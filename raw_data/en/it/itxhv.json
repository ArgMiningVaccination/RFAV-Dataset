The IRP Request is $97.5 million. Isotopes are high-priority commodities of strategic importance for the nation and are essential in medical diagnosis and treatment, discovery science, clean energy, national security, advanced manufacturing, space exploration and communications, biology, archeology, quantum information science, climate and environmental science, and other fields. The Request supports transformative research to develop new or improved production and separation techniques for high priority isotopes in short supply, enabling emerging technology and promoting U.S. scientific, technical and industrial strengths. A high priority remains the dedicated research effort to develop large scale production capabilities of the alpha-emitter actinium-225 (Ac-225) that has shown stunning success in the treatment of diffuse cancers and infections. The Request continues support for the U.S. Stable Isotope Production and Research Center, which will provide significant stable isotope production capacity for the nation, mitigating dependence on sensitive countries. The Request continues the FRIB Isotope Harvesting research effort, which adds capabilities to extract and process significant quantities of isotopes from the beam dump of FRIB, cost effectively repurposing unwanted product. The Request maintains effort in the Advanced Manufacturing initiative, pursuing innovative approaches to robotics, target manufacturing, such as ink jet printing of thin film targets for isotope production, modular automated systems for radioisotope purification and processing, and modern enrichment technology. As part of the Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE) Initiative, the DOE IP continues to advance the development of the Radioisotope Science Center research project in a disadvantaged area near the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) to bring more science opportunities and high-tech jobs to an impoverished area, while also mitigating single point failures in core competencies and capabilities. Funding will further develop the conceptual design of a new long-term facility at ORNL, the Radioisotope Processing Facility (RPF). This will increase the limited radiochemical processing capabilities in the DOE complex and enable the Program to make available certain new isotopes and provide nuclear assurance of the Nation's readiness to respond to disruptions in global isotope supply chains. Critical efforts continue in the ongoing SC Quantum Information Science (QIS) initiative that will enable the domestic production of isotopes of interest for QIS. Funding continues participation in the RENEW initiative, supporting the Isotope Program Traineeship to promote innovative and transformative approaches to isotope production and processing, including advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and robotics; the Traineeship emphasizes participation of minority serving institutions and increasing the diversity and equity of workforce development opportunities in the Program. The Request also supports two new initiatives. Investment in the FAIR initiative will support investments at specific institutions in disadvantaged areas in order to promote environmental justice through place-based science and the provision of technical jobs and capabilities associated with isotope research and production. Participation in the Accelerate Initiative advances the readiness of novel medical isotopes that have shown great promise for cancer and disease diagnosis and treatment for use in innovative radiopharmaceutical therapeutics through the support of translational research in coordination with the NIH. \u0003 Accelerator R&D and Production (ARDAP) supports cross-cutting basic R&D in accelerator science and technology, access to unique SC accelerator R&D infrastructure, workforce development, and partnerships to advance new technologies for use in SC's scientific facilities and in commercial products.

Basic and Applied R&D CoordinationCoordination between the Department's basic research and applied technology programs is a high priority within DOE and is facilitated through joint planning meetings, technical community workshops, annual contractor/awardee meetings, joint research solicitations, focused DOE program office working groups in targeted research areas, and collaborative program management of DOE's Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. Collaboration of research activities and facilities at the DOE national laboratories and partnership-encouraging funding mechanisms facilitate research integration within the basic and applied research communities. SC's R&D coordination also occurs at the 14Science FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationinteragency level. Specific collaborative activities are highlighted in the \"Basic and Applied R&D Coordination\" sections of each individual SC program budget justification narrative. High-Risk, High-Reward Researcha SC incorporates high-risk, high-reward, basic research elements in all of its research portfolios; each SC research program considers a significant proportion of its supported research as high-risk, high-reward. Because advancing the frontiers of science also depends on the continued availability of state-of-the-art scientific facilities, SC constructs and operates nation al scientific facilities and instruments that comprise the world's most sophisticated suite of research capabilities. SC's basic research is integrated within program portfolios, projects, and individual awards; as such, it is not possible to quantitativel y separate the funding contributions of particular experiments or theoretical studies that are high-risk, high-reward from other mission-driven research in a manner that is credible and auditable. SC incorporates high-risk, high-reward basic research elements in its research portfolios to drive innovation and challenge current thinking, using a variety of mechanisms to develop topics: Federal advisory committees, triennial Committees of Visitors, program and topical workshops, interagency working groups, National Academies' studies, and special SC program solicitations. Many of these topics are captured in formal reports, e.g., Chemical Upcycling of Polymers, Basic Energy Sciences report (2019) b; Basic Research Needs for Microelectronics , joint BES, ASCR, and HEP workshop (2018)c; Basic Research Needs for Scientific Machine Learning; Core Technologies for Artificial Intelligence , ASCR workshop (2018)d; Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context , by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (2014)e; From Long-distance Entanglement to Building a Nationwide Quantum Internet: Report of the DOE Quantum Internet Blueprint Workshop, ASCR workshop report (2020)f; Opportunities for Basic Research for Quantum Computing in Chemical and Materials Sciences , Basic Energy Sciences report (2017); Opportunities for Basic Research for Next-Generation Quantum Systems , Basic Energy Sciences report (2017) g; Basic Research Needs for Transformative Manufacturing (2020)h; Basic Research Needs Workshop on Quantum Materials for Energy Relevant Technology, BES workshop report (2016)i; Grand Challenges for Biological and Environmental Research: Progress and Future Vision, by the BER Advisory Committee (2017)j; Genome Engineering for Materials Synthesis , BER workshop report (2018)k; Plasma: at the Frontier of Scientific Discovery , FES workshop report (2017)l; Powering the Future: Fusion and Plasmas , FES Advisory Committee Long Range Plan (2020)m; FES Roundtable on QIS (2018)n; Advancing Fusion with Machine Learning, joint FES-ASCR workshop report (2019)o; Isotope Research and Production Opportunities and Priorities , by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) (2015)p; and Nuclear Physics Long Range Plan , by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC, 2015)q and Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Sciences (QIS), by NSAC (2019)l; Office of Science User Facilities: Lessons from the COVID Era and Visions for the Future ; SC workshop report (2020)r.

To help attract critical talent for stimulating fresh ideas and forward thinking, SC supports the Early Career Research Program, which funds individual research programs to identify and award outstanding rising scientists early in their careers in the disciplines supported by SC s. To retain highly accomplished researchers, SC initiated the Distinguished Scientist Fellows opportunity to recognize leading DOE laboratory staff and sponsoring their innovative efforts to enrich, sustain, and promote scientific and academic excellence in SC mission research and community at large through partnership between institutions of higher education and national laboratories. SC coordinates with other DOE offices and other agencies on best practices for STEM training programs and evidence-based program evaluation efforts through internal DOE working groups and active participation in all the inter-agency working groups of the National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (CoSTEM). SC also participates in the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Science & Technology Policy Fellowships program and the Presidential Management Fellows Program to bring highly qualified scientists and professionals to DOE headquarters for a maximum term of two years. The Request continues the activity, Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW), for targeted efforts to expand participation and retention of HBCUs and other MSIs, community colleges, and individuals from underrepresented groups in SC research and workforce development activities. The Office of Science administers and/or bestows several awards to recognize talented scientists and engineers that advance the Department's missions, including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, Enrico Fermi Award, and Distinguished Scientist Fellow opportunity. The Request continues support for these honorary awards. CybersecurityDOE is engaged in two categories of cyber-related activities: protecting the DOE enterprise from a range of cyber threats that can adversely impact mission capabilities and improving cybersecurity in the electric power subsector and the oil and natural gas subsector. SC supports the Cybersecurity Safeguards and Security Departmental Crosscut, which includes central coordination of the strategic and operational aspects of cybersecurity and facilitates cooperative efforts such as the Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center for incident response, and the implementation of Department-wide Identity, Credentials, and Access Management. s https://science. osti.gov/early-career/ 16Science FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFuture Year Outyear Priorities and FY 2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74), Congress directed the Department to include a future-years energy program (FYEP) in subsequent requests that reflects the proposed appropriations for five years. This FYEP shows outyear funding for each account for FY 2024 - FY 2027. The outyear funding levels use the growth rates from and match the outyear account totals published in the FY 2023 President's Budget for both the 050 and non-050 accounts. Actual future budget request levels will be determined as part of the annual budget process. Office of Science priorities in the outyears include the following: \u0003 Increase investments in Administration priorities to advance bold, transformational leaps in U.S. science and technology (S&T), build a diverse workforce of the future, and ensure America remains the global S&T leader forgenerations to come. \u0003 Ensure optimal operations of all scientific user facilities. \u0003 Continue to invest in infrastructure and utility upgrades at all national laboratories. \u0003 Invest in ongoing and new line-item construction projects and major items of equipment to ensure the United States maintain world leading and state-of-the-art scientific user facilities. 17Science FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification Science Funding by Congressional Control (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized Enacted ($)FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted 1,000 10,000 +9,000 +900.00%19-SC-14, Second Target Station (STS), ORNL 29,000 32,000 32,000 17,000 -35,000 -67.31%18-SC-12, 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized Enacted ($)FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted (%) Biological and Environmental Research BER Research 753,000 753,000 903,685 +150,685 +20.01% 903,685 +150,685 +20.01% +67,222 +16.20%Construction 20-SC-61, Matter in Extreme Petawatt Upgrade, SLAC 15,000 5,000 1,000 -14,000 - - Total, Construction 252,000 279,000 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized Enacted ($)FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted (%) Nuclear Physics Operation and Maintenance 624,000 719,196 -5,300 Stable Research Center 12,000 - - -12,000 -100.00% 20-SC-52, Electron Ion Collider (EIC), BNL 5,000 5,000 +15,000 +300.00% Total, Construction 22,300 5,000 +85,451 - Construction 20-SC-51, U.S. Stable Isotope Production and Research Center (SIPRC), ORNL- 12,000 12,000 +12,000 - Total, Construction - 12,000 12,000 +12,000 - Total, Isotope R&D and Production - 84,000 97,451 +97,451 - Accelerator R&D and Production ARDAP Research - 16,935 27,436 +27,436 - Total, Accelerator R&D and Production - 16,935 27,436 +27,436 - Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists WDTS 29,000 29,000 41,300 +12,300 +42.41% Total, Workforce Development for and Scientists 29,000 29,000 41,300 +12,300 +42.41% 21Science FY 2023 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized Enacted ($)FY 2023 Request vs FY -23.08%Construction 21-SC-71, Princeton Plasma Innovation Center (PPIC), PPPL 150 900 10,000 +9,850 +6,566.67%21-SC-72, Critical Infrastructure Recovery Renewal (CIRR), PPPL 150 2,000 4,000 +3,850 +2,566.67% 21-SC-73, Ames Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) 150 - - -150 -100.00%20-SC-71, Critical Utilities Rehabilitation Project (CURP), BNL 20,000 26,000 13,000 -7,000 -35.00% 20-SC-72, Seismic and +450.00% 20-SC-73, CEBAF Renovation Expansion (CEBAF), TJNAF 2,000 10,000 2,000 - - 20-SC-74, Craft Resources Support Facility (CRSF), ORNL 25,000 - - -25,000 -100.00% 20-SC-75, Large Center (LSCC), SLAC 11,000 12,000 30,000 +19,000 +172.73%20-SC-76, Tritium System Demolition and Disposal (TSDD), PPPL 13,000 6,400 - -13,000 -100.00%20-SC-77, Argonne ANL 500 500 8,000 +7,500 +1,500.00% 20-SC-78, Linear Project (LAMP), LBNL 500 23,425 +22,925 +4,585.00%20-SC-79, Critical SLAC 25,425 +24,925 +4,985.00%20-SC-80, Utilities FNAL 500 500 20,000 +19,500 +3,900.00% 19-SC-71, Science User Support (SUSC), BNL -100.00% (ESC), PNNL 23,000 - - 17-SC-71, +15,000 +6.25% 22Science FY 2023 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized Enacted ($)FY 2023 Request vs FY S&S Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAdvanced Scientific Computing Research Overview The mission of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program is to advance applied mathematics and computer science; deliver the most sophisticated computational scientific applications in partnership with disciplinary science; advance computing and networking capabilities; and develop future generations of computing hardware and software tools for science and engineering in partnership with the research community, including U.S. industry. ASCR supports state-of-the-art capabilities that enable scientific discovery through computation. The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics activities in ASCR provide the foundation for increasing the capability of the national high performance computing (HPC) ecosystem by focusing on long-term research to develop innovative software, algorithms, methods, tools and workflows that anticipate future hardware challenges and opportunities as well as science applications and Department of Energy (DOE) mission needs. ASCR's partnerships, including new efforts with the applied technology offices, activities to broaden participation of under-served communities, and coordination with the other Office of Science (SC) programs and with industry, are essential to these efforts. At the same time, ASCR partners with disciplinary sciences to deliver some of the most advanced scientific computing applications in areas of strategic importance to SC and the DOE. ASCR also deploys and operates world-class, open access high performance computing facilities and a high performance network infrastructure for scientific research. For over half a century, the U.S. has maintained world-leading computing capabilities through sustained investments in research, development, and regular deployment of new advanced computing systems and networks along with the applied mathematics and software technologies to effectively use leading edge systems. The benefits of U.S. computational leadership have been enormous \u2014huge gains in increasing workforce productivity, accelerated progress in both science and engineering, advanced manufacturing techniques and rapid prototyping, and stockpile stewardship without testing. Computational science allows researchers to explore, understand, and harness natural and engineered systems, which are too large, too complex, too dangerous, too small, or too fleeting to explore experimentally. Leadership in HPC has also played a crucial role in sustaining America's competitiveness internationally. There is recognition that the nation that leads in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and in the integration of the computing and data ecosystem will lead the world in developing innovative clean energy technologies, medicines, industries and supply chains, and military capabilities. The U.S. will need to leverage investments in science for innovative new technologies, materials, and methods to strengthen our clean energy economy and ensure all Americans share the benefits from those investments. Most of the modeling and prediction necessary to produce the next generation of breakthroughs in science will come from employing data-driven methods at extreme scales tightly coupled to the enormous increases in the volume and complexity of data generated by U.S. researchers and SC user facilities. The convergence of AI technologies with these existing investments creates a powerful accelerator for innovation and technology development and deployment. Quantum Information Science (QIS) \u2014the ability to exploit intricate quantum mechanical phenomena to create fundamentally new ways of obtaining and processing information \u2014is opening new vistas of science discovery and technology innovation that build on decades of investment across SC. DOE envisions a future in which the cross-cutting field of QIS increasingly drives scientific frontiers and innovations toward realizing the full potential of quantum-based applications, from computing to sensing, connected through a quantum internet. However, there is a need for bold approaches that better couple all elements of the technology innovation chain and combine the talents of the program offices in SC, universities, national labs, and the private sector in concerted efforts to redefine and construct the foundatio n for a new internationally competitive U.S. economy. Moore's Law \u2014the historical pace of microchip innovation whereby feature sizes reduce by a factor of two approximately every two years \u2014is nearing an end due to limits imposed by fundamental physics and economics. As a result, numerous emerging technologies are competing to help sustain productivity gains, each with its own risks and opportunities. The challenge for ASCR is in understanding their implications for scientific computing and being ready for the potential disruptions from rapidly evolving technologies without stifling innovation or hampering scientific progress. ASCR's strategy is to focus on technologies that build on expertise and core investments across SC, continuing engagements with industry, the applied technology offices, other agencies, and the scientific community from the exascale computing project; investing in small-scale testbeds; and increasing core research investments in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. 25Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationASCR's proposed activities will advance AI, QIS, advanced communication networks, and strategic computing at the exascale and beyond to accelerate progress in delivering a clean energy future, understanding and addressing climate change, broadening the impact of our investments in science, and increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. industry. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request of $1,068.7 million for ASCR will strengthen U.S. leadership in strategic computing with operation and allocation of the Nation's first exascale computing system and testing of a second system, broadening the foundations of AI and QIS, and expanding the infrastructure and partnerships that enables data-driven science and technology\u2014from climate to clean energy solutions. Research \u0003 To ensure ASCR is meeting SC's HPC and advanced networking mission needs during and after the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) deployment, the Request prioritizes foundational research in Applied Mathematics and Computer Scienceand the transition of critical technologies from the ECP. Investments will continue to emphasize foundational researchto address the combined challenges of increasingly heterogeneous architectures and the changing ways in which HPCsystems are used, the development of new scalable energy efficient algorithms and software, directed basic researchto address specific challenges for the new Energy Earthshot Research Centers, and incorporating AI and ML intosimulations and data intensive applications while increasing greater connectivity with distributed resources, includingother SC user facilities. The Computational Partnerships activity will continue to infuse the latest developments inapplied math and computer science into strategic applications, including areas such as accelerating the development ofclean energy technologies, and understanding the earth's systems, to get the most out of the leadership computingsystems and data infrastructure investments. The Request increases support for ASCR's Computational Partnerships tosupport SC initiatives; extends SciDAC partnerships to DOE's applied technology offices and mission critical ECPapplications, including interagency partnerships to actively build workflows that ensure rapid and robust response toemerging pandemic, biothreat, and public health emergencies; and expands the SciDAC Institutes to fully incorporateexascale software and libraries. The Request also sustains increased support for the Computational Sciences GraduateFellowship (CSGF) to increase the number of fellows in AI and Quantum as well as outreach to and participation byunder-represented groups. \u0003 The Request provides robust support for Advanced Computing Research's quantum investments in the National Quantum Information Sciences Research Centers (NQISRCs), quantum internet, and testbeds. ASCR will continue topartner with the other SC programs to support the multi-disciplinary NQISRCs. These centers promote basic researchand early-stage development to accelerate the advancement of QIS through vertical integration between systems andtheory and hardware and software. ASCR's regional quantum testbeds, which provide researchers with access to novel,early-stage quantum computing and networking resources and services, and basic research in quantum informationwill continue. In FY 2023, ASCR will begin to enable the sustainability of critical ECP software for use on emergingtechnology testbeds. \u0003 ASCR increases support for the SC-wide Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative that leverages SC's unique national laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide undergraduate andgraduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S.Science and Technology (S&T) ecosystem. \u0003 The Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative will provide focused investment on enhancing research on clean energy, climate, and related topics at minority serving institutions, including attention to underserved andenvironmental justice regions. The activities will improve the capability of MSIs to perform and propose competitiveresearch and will build beneficial relationships between MSIs and DOE national laboratories and facilities. \u0003 ASCR will also participate in the Accelerate initiative through support for scientific research that will accelerate the transition of science advances to energy technologies. These new efforts will drive scientific discovery towardsustainable production of new technologies across the innovation continuum, to provide experiences in working acrossthis continuum for the workforce needed for industries of the future, and to meet the nation's needs for abundantclean energy, a sustainable environment, and national security. 26\u0083 Energy Earthshot Research Centers (EERCs), a new modality of research to be launched in FY 2023, building on the success of SC's Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFR Cs) and the SciDAC program, will bring together multi- investigator, multi-disciplinary teams to perform energy-rel evant research with a scope and complexity beyond what is possible in standard single-investigator or small-group awards. Beyond complementing and expanding the scope of the EFRCs and SciDAC, the EERCs will address the research challe nges at the interface between currently supported basic research, applied research, and development activities, with support from both SC and the applied technology offices. Facility Operations \u0083 FY 2023 marks the beginning of the exascale era for the U.S. research community with full operations and competitive allocation of the Nation's first exascale computing system at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), a system called Frontier that was deployed in calendar year 2021, and acceptance and operations for early science and the ECP applications on a second exascale computing system at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a system called Aurora. The Request provides strong support for ASCR user facilities operations to ensure the availabilityof high performance computing, data, and networking to the scientific community. Funding supports operations costsat the Leadership Computing Facilities, at the National En ergy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet). The Request supports testbeds at the facilities and provides robust support for the completion of the Department's Exascale Computing Initiative (ECI), which in cludes the SC-Exascale Computing Project (SC-ECP). In addition, the Request supports the NERSC-10 upgrade, planned to start in FY 2022, including site preparations and long lead procurements, to address risi ng demand for production computing across the SC programs. \u0083 Current ASCR high performance computing (HPC) resources and facilities are designed to efficiently execute large-scale simulations and are focused on minimizing users' wait-times in batch queues while maximizing use of these unique resources. However, the rate and volume of data from SC scientific user facilities is expected to grow exponentially in the future. In addition, the diversity of data- and compute-intensive research workflows is expanding rapidly. InFY 2023, ASCR will continue planning for a new High Performance Data Facility (HPDF), to satisfy the unique requirements of state-of-the-art real-time experimental/observational workflows. The NERSC-10 and HPDF projects will each drive unique technological innovation in system architectures and services beyond what is available in the commercial cloud and will inform planning for future upgrades at the LCFs. Projects \u0083 The ASCR FY 2023 Request for SC's co ntribution to DOE's Exascale Computing Initiative to deploy an exascale computing software ecosystem and mission critical applications on at least one exascale system delivered in calendar year 2021 and a second in 2022 to address national needs. Of this effo rt, $150.0 million of facility operations funding will go to the ALCF to deploy and operat e Aurora and testbeds in support of the ECP project teams.

In addition, funding supports o peration of the 125 petaflop NERSC-9 Perlmutter system, site preparations and long-lead procurements for NERSC-10, and the ESnet-6 upgrade in a ccordance with the project baselines. To address the significant growth in the rate and volume of data from SC scientific user facilities , ASCR also initiated planning for a new High Performance Data Facility (HPDF) initiated in the FY 2022 Request to satisfy the unique requirements of state-of-the- art real-time experimental/observational workflows to support the explosion of data and also serve as the anchor for the integr ated computational and data infrastructure efforts. Funding for all facilities supports operations, including power, equipment, staf fing, testbeds, lease payments, and planning for future upgrades. 30Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification(dollars in thousands) FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Exascale Computing -$91,945 The FY 2023 Request will support efforts to deploy SC-ECP applications and ecosystem on both exascale architectures in partnership with the ASCR facilities. The decrease represents a shift in focus within the project as it matures beyond delivery to the execution of applications' challenge problems and implementation of software technologies to meet the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) on the exascale sy stems delivered in 2021 and 2022. Total, Advanced Scientific Computing Research +$53,741 31Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic and Applied R&D Coordination Coordination across disciplines and programs is a cornerstone of the ASCR program. Partnerships within SC are mature and continue to advance the use of HPC and scientific networks for science. New partnerships with other SC Programs have been established in QIS and in AI. Future Advanced Computing, Scientific Data, Large Scale Networking, AI, High End Computing, and QIS are coordinated with other agencies through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). There are growing areas of collaboration in the area of data-intensive science, AI, and readying applications for exascale. ASCR continues to have a strong partnership with National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for achieving the Department's goals for exascale computing. In April 2016, ASCR and NNSA strengthened this partnership by signing a memorandum of understanding for collaboration and coordination of exascale research within the DOE. Through the Networking and Information Technology R&D Subcommittee of the NSTC Committee on Technology, ASCR also coordinates with programs across the Federal Government. In FY 2023, cross-agency interactions and collaborations will continue in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Program AccomplishmentsSupercomputing Versus COVID-19 - Round Two, Understanding COVID VariantsThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has entered a new phase with the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) that are more contagious and could undermine the protection of vaccines. Substitutions in the spike protein have been identified with new variants but do not fully explain the success of fast-spreading variants, like the Delta and Omicron variants. A research team at ORNL used a computational systems biology approach to process more than 900,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and map spatiotemporal relationships, revealing other critical attributes of successful variants. Comparisons to earlier dominant mutations and protein structural analyses indicate that the increased transmission is promoted by the combination of functionally complementary mutations in both the spikes and in other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. They found that the currently known VOCs have common mutations in proteins involved in immune-antagonism and replication performance, suggesting a convergent evolution of the virus. Critically, they found that VOCs often occur with a sudden doubling of the number of mutations in that strain, which indicates recombination events\u2014where two different strains infect the same person and, in the process of replicating, merge their genetic material\u2014that facilitate the combination of mutations in spike and other proteins that together lead to new, more infectious and increasingly immune escaping variants. This indicates that extensive community distribution of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the probability of future recombination events, further accelerating the evolution of the virus. Toward an Integrated Scientific Data Infrastructure - Addressing Urgent Challenges in Real Time Scientists working remotely from Turkey leveraged the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, via the ESnet, to capture detailed images of the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, focusing on two of the viral proteases\u2014enzymes that make the virus's life cycle possible\u2014and how to keep them from functioning. By understanding the molecular structure of the proteases, researchers can identify proteins that bind to them and interfere with their role in viral reproduction. The goal is to inhibit these two enzymes with chemical compounds contributed from the COVID-19 Moonshot initiative that may eventually lead to antiviral treatments in humans, a key step toward next generation treatments for COVID-19. During and after the experiments, the team utilized NERSC's Cori supercomputer and ESnet's high-speed optical network to process data and provide results in real time, allowing the researchers to monitor the experiment, begin analysis, and make changes as necessary. This enables the study of small differences in atomic structure in near real time, even while working remotely, to guide decision-making during the experiment. Analysis of the findings from these experiments is ongoing but the work is also shaping the development of the ASCR scientific data facility concept, exposing challenges and identifying areas where more work is needed.ASCR Inside: Taking AI to Extreme Scales for Science Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, working in collaboration with NVIDIA, Facebook, and other industrial and academic teams, leveraged ASCR's long-standing investments in the Legion data-centric parallel-programming the FlexFlow large-scale machine-learning allows frameworks and interfaces, such as Keras/TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX, to utilize large-scale resources to train machine-learning models of unprecedented size and faster than ever. Efficiently using large-scale resources enabled a 15x reduction in model-training times, bringing a key benchmark workflow from 18 hours to 1.2 hours. The increased turn-around time was enabled by scaling the workflow 32Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationto use over 750 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), a feat made possible using the FlexFlow framework build on Legion, an R&D 100 Award winner in 2020. The workflow acceleration contributed to urgent scientific work aimed at discovering new drugs to treat cancer and COVID-19. Getting Real About Uncertainty in Sea Level Rise A team of DOE-supported ice sheet and climate modeling scientists contributed to improved quantitative estimates for the range of future sea level rise expected from melting glaciers and ice sheets, as recently reported on in the journal Nature. t This study was also cited in Chapter 9 of the 6th assessment report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \"Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change.\" For this study, the team of 84 international researchers used NERSC to run the largest and most sophisticated set of climate and land ice models to date, combining nearly 900 simulations from 38 international modeling groups to improve not only the median projections of future sea level rise but also estimates for the associated uncertainties. These multi-model ensembles were combined via statistical emulation to build probabilistic projections of future sea level rise from all sources of land ice. The projections show that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures would cut projected 21st century sea level rise from land ice in half, relative to currently pledged emissions reductions, from approximately 25 cm to 13 cm in the best-case scenario. However, under the worst-case scenario, with much more melting than snowfall in the Antarctic, ice losses there could be five times larger, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 cm of sea level rise under current policies and pledges, with a 5 percent chance of sea level rise exceeding 50 cm even under 1.5\u00b0C warming. Results from this study confirm that Antarctica remains a critical focus for reducing future uncertainty in sea level rise; due to substantial uncertainty in how strongly warm ocean waters will erode floating parts of the ice sheet from beneath, a process that now is the focus of DOE's Energy Exascale Earth System Model. Supercomputing Powers Energy Savings Residential and commercial buildings consume nearly three-quarters of U.S. electricity\u2014during peak hours, the share reaches 80 percent. The annual energy bill is nearly $412 billion. Simulating that energy use on a broad scale can help identify ways to reduce it, cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the process. Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility for data-intensive simulations of a \"digital twin\" of the more than 178,000 buildings in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They studied how different energy conservation measures might result in cost savings. The AutoBEM simulation of Chattanooga buildings, which also uses EnergyPlus and OpenStudio, two DOE tools for modeling buildings energy use, found that 99 percent of buildings would realize energy savings from employing the existing energy efficiency technologies evaluated. The effort is part of a larger goal to model all of the Nation's 125 million building s. A conservation measure of the impact of simple changes like improved HVAC efficiency, space sealing, insulation or lighting could have the potential to offset 500 to 3,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per building, the researchers concluded. Delivering the Exascale Ecosystem The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is building a comprehensive software ecosystem consisting of more than 20 applications and 80 software packages that use more than 10 compilers and 10 programming models on a range of target hardware architectures (from laptops to exascale). The legacy of these efforts will be a computational ecosystem that accelerates U.S. capabilities in scientific simulation and artificial intelligence (AI), unlocking the potential of Exascale computers and preparing us for future systems that will build on our legacy. The complexity of this ecosystem, with over one million combinations, is being managed and simplified for the entire scientific and AI user community through the creation of ECP's Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S). E4S (https://e4s.io) is lowering the barrier to entry for user s and developers in the DOE and other U.S. government agencies, industries, and universities. The E4S has aggressively evolved, providing 80 distinct turn-key HPC and AI products grouped into thematic software development kits (SDKs). Application codes that build on top of E4S benefit from guaranteed version compatibility, access to the latest stable features integrated into each quarterly release, and advanced build environment features that can improve build times by a factor of ten. The last E4S release contains support for GPU architectures and is installed on DOE and NSF pre-exascale systems, enabling the portability promise that is central to the success of future U.S. supercomputing. t Edwards, T. L. and 82 others. Nature, 593(7857), 74-82, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03302-y 33Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationPhysics-Informed Machine Learning The accelerating pace of observational data from experiments far outpaces our ability to understand it. Despite the promise and some preliminary success, most machine learning approaches are unable to extract interpretable information and knowledge from this data deluge. Moreover, purely data-driven models may fit observations, but predictions may be physically inconsistent or implausible. A research team led by PNNL and Brown University, funded by ASCR, are leading a new and rapidly expanding branch of ML, called physics-informed ML, which takes well-known ML algorithms and modifies them to enforce physical laws. Physics-informed ML seamlessly integrates data and mathematical physics models, even in partially understood, uncertain and complex large-scale problems. This may lead to specialized network architectures that have many advantages: noisy data can be integrated where it couldn't be integrated before; the amount of data required to train a model is greatly reduced; the need for expensive mesh generation can be eliminated; hidden physics can be exposed; and high-dimensional problems can be made tractable. Physics-informed ML is being used to: enhance the resolution of 4-D flow MRI assessments of blood flow and vascular function; predict turbulent transport on the edge of magnetic confinement fusion devices; and study transitions between metastable states in complex systems as well as potential applications in quantum chemistry. Their work was published in Nature Reviews in May 2021. Transferring Technology to Broaden the Impact of Research Investments An ASCR-supported team at ORNL and Georgia Tech is working with General Motors (GM) to leverage their R&D 100 award- winning AI software system, Multinode Evolutionary Neural Networks for Deep Learning (MENNDL), to improve the performance of autonomous vehicles. GM licensed MENNDL for use in vehicle technology and design. MENNDL uses an evolutionary approach that leverages high performance computers to explore the different design parameters available for an AI network. Market experts anticipate that the autonomous vehicles market size will be $60 billion U.S. dollars by 2030. However, testing of autonomous vehicles remains limited, and simulations remain in their infancy. For automakers like GM, MENNDL can be used to accelerate advanced driver assistance technology by tackling one of the biggest questions facing the adoption of this technology: How can cars quickly and accurately perceive their surroundings to navigate safely through them? Building a Quantum Infrastructure Throughout 2021, ASCR continued to build DOE's quantum research and development infrastructure. ASCR's quantum computing testbeds expanded their user base to provide more communities with fully transparent access to novel quantum computing hardware, enabling foundational research to explore high-risk, high-reward approaches. The Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), the only open quantum computing testbed in the world based on trapped ions, was recognized with an R&D 100 Award. The National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, Office of Science's flagship investment in quantum information science, expanded their partnerships to include the expertise and resources of 71 institutions, including EPSCOR and Minority Serving Institutions and small businesses, to push the envelope in quantum R&D, to create and steward the ecosystem needed to drive economic competitiveness, and to foster the growth of the Nation's quantum workforce. In addition, researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University have established the most advanced regional quantum network in the U.S. to demonstrate a quantum connection between two remote atomic clouds separated by 97 miles, which was the longest experiment of its type in the world. Launching the Exascale Era The Department achieved a major milestone in 2021 by deploying the Nation's first exascale computing system, Frontier, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This system also delivered on the Department's stretch goal of 20MW per exaflop\u2014reducing energy utilization (watts per flop) by a factor of 3.42 over the pre-exascale systems. The facility also shared a systemic analysis of detailed energy utilization data from Summit, the pre-exascale system, through a paper at the Supercomputing 21 conference that was recognized as \"Best Paper\" at this seminal international workshop. The facility is currently working with more than thirty science and engineering applications, supported by the Exascale Computing Initiative, that are getting ready for, and eager to gain access to, this unique resource. These include mission critical areas such as climate, clean energy, subsurface science, advanced materials, and an array of big data and \"AI at scale\" capabilities. 34Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification Advanced Scientific Computing Research Mathematical, Computational, and Computer Sciences Research Description The Mathematical, Computational, and Computer Sciences Research subprogram supports research activities to effectively meet the SC High Performance Computing (HPC) mission needs, including both data intensive and computationally intensive science. Computational and data intensive sciences coupled with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are central to progress at the frontiers of science and to our most challenging engineering problems, particularly in climate science. ASCR investments are not focused on the next quarter but on the next quarter century. The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics activities in ASCR provide the foundation for increasing the capability of the national HPC ecosystem and scientific data infrastructure by focusing on long-term research to develop intelligent software, algorithms, and methods that anticipate future hardware challenges and opportunities as well as science application needs. ASCR partnerships and coordination with industry are essential to these efforts. ASCR's partnerships with disciplinary science deliver some of the most advanced scientific computing applications in areas of strategic importance to the Nation. Scientific software often has a lifecycle that spans decades\u2014much longer than the average HPC system. New ASCR partnerships through the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) and Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) programs will further broaden and diversify the applied mathematics and computer science research communities. Research efforts must therefore anticipate changes in hardware and rapidly developing capabilities such as AI and QIS, as well as application needs over the long term. ASCR's partnerships with vendors and discipline sciences are critical to these efforts. With the completion of ECP, research efforts will need to transition critical elements of the exasca le software ecosystem to support sustainability and fund continued development of co-design activities. Accordingly, the subprogram delivers: \u0003 new mathematics and algorithms required to more accurately model systems involving processes taking place across a wide range of time and length scales and incorporating AI and ML techniques into HPC simulations; \u0003 the software needed to support DOE mission applications, including critical elements of the exascale software ecosystem and new paradigms of compute-intensive and data-intensive applications, AI and scientific machinelearning, and scientific workflows on current and increasingly more heterogeneous future systems; \u0003 insights about computing systems and workflow performance and usability leading to more efficient and productive use of all levels of computing, from the edge to HPC storage and networking resources; \u0003 collaboration tools, data and compute infrastructure and partnerships to make scientific resources and data broadly available to scientists in university, national laboratory, and industrial settings; \u0003 expertise in applying new algorithms and methods, and scientific software tools to advance scientific discovery through modeling and simulation in areas of strategic importance to SC, DOE, and the Nation; and \u0003 long-term, basic research on future computing technologies with relevance to the DOE missions. Applied Mathematics Research The Applied Mathematics activity supports basic research leading to fundamental mathematical advances and computational breakthroughs across DOE and SC missions. Basic research in scalable algorithms and libraries, multiscale and multi-physics modeling, AI/ML, and efficient data analysis underpin all of DOE's computational and data-intensive science efforts. More broadly, this activity includes support for foundational research in problem formulation, multiscale modeling and coupling, mesh discretization, time integration, advanced solvers for large-scale linear and nonlinear systems of equations, methods that use asynchrony or randomness, uncertainty quantification, and optimization. Historically, advances in these methods have contributed as much, if not more, to gains in computational science than hardware improvements alone. Forward-looking efforts by this activity anticipate DOE mission needs from the closer coupling and integration of scientific modeling, data and scientific AI/ML with advanced computing, for enabling greater capabilities for scientific discovery, design, and decision-support in complex systems and new algorithms to support data analysis at the edge of experiments and instruments and protect the privacy of sensitive datasets. In addition, this activity will support partnerships between mathematicians and computer scientists to develop energy efficient algorithms and methods that scale from intelligent sensors to HPC to support decarbonizing industry. 35Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationComputer Science Research The Computer Science research activity supports long-term, basic research on the software infrastructure that is essential for the effective use of the most powerful HPC and networking systems in the country as well as the tools and data infrastructure to enable the real-time exploration and understanding of extreme scale and complex data from both simulations and experiments. Through the continued development of adaptive software tools, it aims to make high performance scientific computers and networks even more productive and efficient to solve scientific challenges while attempting to reduce domain science application complexity as much as possible. ASCR Computer Science research also plays a key role in developing and evolving the sophisticated software required for future Leadership Computers, including basic research focused on quantum computing and communication. Hardware and software vendors often use software developed with ASCR Computer Science investments and integrate it with their own software. ASCR-supported activities are entering a new paradigm driven by sharp increases in the heterogeneity and complexity of computing systems and their software ecosystems, support for large-scale data analytics, and by the incorporation of AI techniques. In partnership with the other SC programs and their scientific user facilities, the Computer Science activity supports research that addresses the need to seamlessly and intelligently integrate simulation, data analysis, and other tasks into comprehensive workflows. These workflows will gather data from the edge of experiments and connect simulation and AI at HPCs to support data analytics and visualization. This includes making research data and AI models findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable to strengthen trust and maximize the impact of scientific research in society. In addition, this activity supports partnerships between mathematicians and computer scientists to develop energy efficient algorithms and methods that scale from intelligent sensors to HPC to support decarbonizing industry. Computational Partnerships The Computational Partnerships activity supports the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing, or SciDAC, program, which is a recognized leader for the employment of HPC for scientific discovery. Established in 2001, SciDAC involves ASCR partnerships with the other SC programs, other DOE program offices, and other federal agencies in strategic areas with a goal to dramatically accelerate progress in scientific computing through deep collaborations between discipline scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists. SciDAC does this by providing the intellectual resources in applied mathematics and computer science, expertise in algorithms and methods, and scientific software tools to advance scientific discovery through modeling and simulation in areas of strategic importance to SC, DOE, and the Nation, including Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE), allowing distributed networks of scientists to work together on multidisciplinary research priorities and/or national emergency challenges. The Computational Partnerships activity also supports collaborations in the areas of data analysis, and future computing. Collaborative and data analysis projects enable large, distributed research teams to share data and develop tools incorporating AI/ML for real-time analysis of the massive data flows from SC scientific user facilities, as well as the researc h and development of software to support a distributed advanced computing data infrastructure and computing environment. In addition, interdisciplinary teams enable development of new algorithms and software stack targeted for future computing platforms, including QIS, as well as partnerships with Basic Energy Sciences (BES) to understand extreme materials and chemistries for energy and with both BES and Biological and Environmental Research (BER) to advance research in clean water technologies through the use of AI and HPC. The activity also supports the FAIR initiative and the Accelerate Initiative which will provide focused investment on enhancing research on clean energy, climate, and related topics at minority serving institutions, including attention to underserved and environmental justice regions. Advanced Computing Research This activity supports research focused on development of emerging computing technologies such as QIS and neuromorphic efforts as well as investments in microelectronics in partnership with the other SC program offices, Research and Evaluation Prototypes (REP), and ASCR-specific investments in cybersecurity and workforce including the Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship (CSGF) and the SC-wide RENEW initiative. REP has a long history of partnering with U.S. vendors to develop future computing technologies and testbeds that push the state-of-the-art and enabled DOE researchers to better understand the challenges and capabilities of emerging technologies. In addition to REP, this activity supports ASCR's investments in the National QIS Research Centers (NQISRCs), as well as quantum computing testbeds and building a quantum internet to connect the NQISRCs and ultimately the 17 DOE national laboratories. 36Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSC is fully committed to advancing a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, key to providing the scientific and technical expertise for U.S. scientific leadership. Toward that goal, ASCR will participate in the SC-wide RENEW initiative that leverages SC's world-unique national laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem. This includes HBCUs and other MSIs, typically individuals from groups historically underrepresented in STEM, as well as students from communities disproportionally affected by social, economic, and health burdens of the energy system, and the EPSCoR jurisdictions. The hands-on experiences gained through the RENEW initiative will open new career avenues for the participants, forming a nucleus for a future pool of talented young scientists, engineers, and technicians with the critical skills and expertise needed for the full breadth of SC research activities, including DOE national laboratory staffing. Success in fostering and stewarding a highly skilled, diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce is fundamental to SC's mission and key to also sustaining U.S. leadership in HPC and computational science. The high demand across DOE missions and the unique challenges of high-performance computational science and engineering led to the establishment of the CSGF in 1991. This program has delivered leaders in computational science both within the DOE national laboratories and across the private sector. With increasing demand for these highly skilled scientist and engineers, ASCR continues to partner with the NNSA to support the CSGF to increase the availability and diversity of a trained workforce for exascale computing, AI, and capabilities beyond Moore's Law such as QIS. Energy Earthshot Research Centers The Department of Energy's Energy Earthshots will accelerate breakthroughs of more abundant, affordable, and reliable clean energy solutions within the decade to address the climate crisis. The Energy Earthshots are designed to drive integrated program development across DOE's science, applied technology offices, and ARPA-E, and take an 'all R&D community' approach to leading science and technology innovations to address tough technological challenges and cost hurdles, and rapidly advance solutions to help achieve our climate and economic competitiveness goals. From a science perspective, many research gaps for the Energy Earthshots cut across many topics and will provide a foundation for other energy technology challenges, including biotechnology, critical minerals/materials, energy-water, subsurface science (including geothermal research), and materials and chemical processes under extreme conditions for nuclear applications. These gaps require multiscale computational and modeling tools, new AI and ML\u2014technologies, real-time characterization\u2014including in extreme environments\u2014and development of the scientific base to co-design processes and systems rather than individual materials, chemistries, and components. Toward that end, ASCR will contribute to the establishment of Energy Earthshot Research Centers (EERCs), a new modality of research to be launched in FY 2023, building on the success of SC's Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) and the SciDAC program. The EERCs will bring together multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary teams to perform energy-relevant research with a scope and complexity beyond what is possible in standard single-investigator or small-group awards. Beyond complementing and expanding the scope of the EFRCs and SciDAC, the EERCs will address the research challenges at the interface between currently supported basic research, applied research, and development activities, with support from both SC and the applied technology offices. EERCs will entail co-funding of team awards involving academic, national laboratories, and industrial researchers, establishing a new era of cross-office research cooperation. The funding will focus efforts directly at the interfaces of current research efforts, ensuring that directed fundamental research and capabilities at SC user facilities tackle the most challenging barriers identified in the applied research and demonstration activities to bridge the R&D gaps and realize the stretch goals of the Energy Earthshots. In FY 2023, the Request supports a joint Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to be released by three program offices in the Office of Science Basic Energy Science (BES), ASCR, and Biological and Environmental Research (BER), and DOE applied technology offices for the initial cohort of EERCs. Emphasis will be on the current Energy Earthshots topics and those announced by DOE prior to release of the FOA. 37Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAdvanced Scientific Computing Research Mathematical, Computational, and Computer Sciences Research Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Mathematical, Computational, and Computer Sciences +$118,858 Applied Mathematics Research $48,570 $71,938 +$23,368 Funding expands support of core research efforts in algorithms, libraries and methods that underpin high-end scientific simulations, scientific AI/ML techniques, and methods that help scientists extract insights from massive scientific datasets with an emphasis on foundational capabilities in AI/ML.The Request will continue to expand support of core research efforts in algorithms, libraries and methods that underpin high-end scientific simulations, scientific AI/ML techniques, and methods that help scientists extract insights from massive scientific datasets with an emphasis on foundational capabilities.

Note: - Funding for the subprogram above, includes 3.65 percent of research and development (R&D) funding for the Small Business Innova tion Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. 42Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAdvanced Scientific Computing Research High Performance Computing and Network Facilities Description The High Performance Computing (HPC) and Network Facilities subprogram supports the operations of forefront computational and networking user facilities to meet critical mission needs. ASCR operates three HPC user facilities: the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which provides HPC resources and large-scale storage to a broad range of SC researchers; and the two Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), which provide leading-edge HPC capability to the U.S. research and industrial communities. ASCR's high performance network user facility, ESnet, delivers highly reliable data transport capabilities optimized for the requirements of large-scale science. Finally, operations of these facilities also include investments in upgrades: for the HPC user facilities, this scope includes electrical and mechanical system enhancements to ensure each remains state-of-the-art and can install future systems; for ESnet, the upgrades include rolling capacity growth to ensure no bottlenecks occur in the network. The HPC and Network Facilities subprogram regularly gathers strategic user requirements from stakeholders across SC and DOE, including the other SC research programs, SC scientific user facilities, DOE national laboratories, and other stakeholders. ASCR gathers these user requirements through formal processes, including workshops and technical reviews, to inform planning for upgrade projects, development of services, and implementation of user programs. The insights ASCR gains from these user requirements activities are also vital to a broad spectrum of ASCR and SC strategic efforts. Examples of this insight include identification of emerging research directions, emerging trends in usage of computing and data resources, and industry innovations in computing architectures and technologies. ASCR continues to observe an accelerating pace of innovation in computing technology, through and beyond the exascale era. Allocation of ASCR HPC resources to users follows the merit review public-access model used by other SC scientific user facilities. The Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) allocation program provides access to the LCFs; the ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge (ALCC) allocation program provides a path for critical DOE mission applications to access LCFs and NERSC, and a mechanism to address urgent national emergencies and priorities. The core strength of the ASCR facilities is the dedicated staff who work to maximize user productivity and science impact, operate and maintain world-leading computing and networking resources, while simultaneously executing major upgrade projects. None of the ASCR facilities have suffered significant operational impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. ASCR HPC facilities received CARES Act funding in FY 2020 to support COVID-19 research teams through the COVID-19 HPC Consortium, a partnership between industry, national and international federal agencies, national laboratories, and academia. DOE deployed customized computing hardware to each HPC facility to better address specific COVID-19 research needs; dozens of research projects used millions of hours of compute time to provide new insights about the virus, variants, the disease, and the pandemic, including: how the virus infects cells, exploration of treatment options, understanding mutations, understanding variation in patient outcomes, high throughput drug candidate screening, epidemiology and public health surveillance, and advanced data analytics. Several of these research teams were finalists for the special COVID-19 Gordon Bell Prize. Eventually, this hardware will be integrated into the facilities' user programs, providing additional HPC resources available for peer-reviewed, competitive research with emphasis on biological and medical research. High Performance Production Computing This activity supports the NERSC user facility at LBNL to deliver high-end production computing resources and data services for the SC research community. More than 8,000 computational scientists conducting about 700 projects use NERSC annually to perform scientific research across a wide range of disciplines including astrophysics, chemistry, earth systems modeling, materials science, engineering, high energy and nuclear physics, fusion energy, and biology. NERSC users come from nearly every state in the U.S., with about half based in universities, approximately one-third in DOE laboratories, and other users from government laboratories, non-profits, small businesses, and industry. NERSC's large and diverse user population spans a wide range of HPC experience, from world leading experts to students. NERSC aids users entering the 43Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHPC arena for the first time, as well as those preparing leading-edge codes that harness the full potential of ASCR's HPC resources. NERSC currently operates the 30 petaflops (pf) system (Perlmutter), that came online in FY 2021. NERSC is a vital resource for the SC research community and is consistently oversubscribed, with requests exceeding capacity by a factor of 3-10. This gap between demand and capacity exists despite upgrades to the primary computing systems approximately every three to five years. In addition, the diversity of data- and compute-intensive research workflows is expanding rapidly. The FY 2023 Request, will continue planning for two projects intended together to provide SC with increased computing capacity and capability to meet user requirements in the second half of this decade. ASCR will continue preparations for a NERSC-10 upgrade project that is intended to provide SC with an innovative, flexible HPC platform to serve an even greater diversity of NERSC users. ASCR will also continue planning efforts for a new High Performance Data Facility (HPDF), a high performance computing and data management facility designed from the ground up to satisfy the unique requirements of state-of-the-art real-time experimental/observational workflows. The NERSC-10 and HPDF projects will each drive unique technological innovation in system architectures and services beyond what is available in the commercial cloud. As real-time user demand for HPC resources grows, ASCR foresees the strategic need for operational resilience through geographic diversity of its HPC resources. In addition, some workflows may have latency requirements that necessitate geographic proximity to HPC resources. NERSC-10 and HPDF will complement each other in this regard. Leadership Computing Facilities The LCFs are national resources built to enable open scientific computational applications, including industry applications, that harness the full potential of extreme-scale leadership computing to accelerate discovery and innovation. The success of this effort is built on the gains made in the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), Research and Evaluation Prototypes (REP) and ASCR research efforts. The LCFs' experienced staff provides support to INCITE and ALCC projects, scaling tests, early science applications, and tool and library developers; their efforts are also critical to the success of industry partnerships. The OLCF at ORNL currently operates and competitively allocates the Nation's first exascale computing system, an HPE- Cray/AMD exascale system (Frontier), deployed in calendar year 2021; 200 pf IBM/NVIDIA OLCF-4 system (Summit); and other testbeds and supporting resources. Recent scientific highlights from Summit include: AI-driven multiscale simulations that illuminate the disease mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 including the mechanisms linked to the inflammatory response in some patients; the rapid screening of drug candidates and the development of therapeutics for COVID; training deep neural networks to understand glass-like quantum materials with potential applications in electronic devices, quantum computers, and superconductors; simulating the Earth's atmosphere for a full season at 1-square-kilometer grid-spacing to improve weather forecasting and climate predictions; first-of-their-kind 3D flow simulations of gas turbine jet engines that are providing breakthrough insights quickly and accurately to influence the design process for improved fuel efficiency and more durable jet engines; bridging classical Molecular Dynamics and AI to produce complex simulations that are both large and accurate\u2014simulating for the first time more than 100 million atoms, with ab initio accuracy, a thousand times faster than ever before. OLCF staff shares its expertise with industry to broaden the benefits of petascale computing for the nation. For example, OLCF works with industry to reduce the need for costly physical prototypes and physical tests to accelerate the development of high-technology products. These efforts often result in upgrades to in-house computing resources at U.S. companies. The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at ANL operates the 8.5 pf Intel/Cray ALCF-2 and HPC testbeds, such as the Polaris (A-19) system, to prepare their users and SC-ECP applications and software technology for the ALCF-3 upgrade, to be known as Aurora. Aurora, the Nation's second exascale system, will be deployed in calendar year 2022 and is being designed by Intel/HPE-Cray to support the largest-scale computational simulations possible as well as large-scale data analytics and machine learning. Recent scientific highlights from the ALCF include: developing CityCOVID, an agent-based model capable of capturing the dynamics of heterogeneous, interacting, adaptive agents at a granular level of detail to track COVID-19 transmission and to simulate a variety of interventions and future scenarios; training a deep neural network to find more energy-efficient separation processes to reduce the energy footprint of the chemical industries; the largest ever collection of 3D investigations of the physics of core-collapse supernovae to better understand the origin of the elements in the universe, measure gravitational waves, and interpret laboratory nuclear reaction rate 44Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationmeasurements in light of stellar nucleosynthesis; large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that help to elucidate the mechanisms of helium transport and tungsten surface deformation that may degrade material stability on the primary plasma-facing divertor material in ITER; one of the largest cosmological structure formation simulations ever performed to help with planning and analysis of current and upcoming sky surveys; and developing a novel method to provide high-quality 3D reconstructions of heavily scattering samples to enable software reconstructions beyond-depth-of-focus on the APS Upgrade (APS-U) facility. Through INCITE, ALCF also enables industrial applications, for example, by helping scientists and engineers to optimize manufacturing of non-woven materials, such as those used in protective masks, to reduce energy requirements without impacting performance. The ALCF and OLCF systems are architecturally distinct, consistent with DOE's strategy to manage enterprise risk and foster diverse capabilities that provide the Nation's HPC user community with the most effective resources. The demand for 2021 INCITE allocations at the LCFs outpaced the available resources by more than a factor of three. Demand for 2020-2021 ALCC allocations outpaced resources by more than a factor of five. The LCFs have begun planning for upgrades that would expand the capacity and capabilities of these unique National resources to keep pace with demand and foreign investments. High Performance Network Facilities and Testbeds This activity supports the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), SC's high performance network user facility. ESnet is recognized as a global leader in the research and education network community, with a multi-decade track record of developing innovative network architectures and services, and reliable operations designed for 99.9 percent uptime for connected sites. ESnet is the circulatory system that enables the DOE science mission. ESnet delivers highly reliable data transport capabilities optimized for the requirements of large-scale science. ESnet currently maintains one of the fastest and most reliable science networks in the world that spans the continental United States and the Atlantic Ocean. ESnet interconnects all 17 DOE National Laboratories, dozens of other DOE sites, and approximately 200 research and commercial networks around the world, enabling many tens of thousands of scientists at DOE laboratories and academic institutions across the country to transfer vast data streams and access remote research resources in real-time. ESnet also supports the data transport requirements of all SC user facilities. ESnet's traffic continues to grow exponentially\u2014roughly 66 percent each year since 1990\u2014a rate more than double the commercial internet. The number of connected sites has also expanded significantly in recent years and continues to grow. Costs for ESnet are dominated by operations and maintenance, including continual efforts to maintain dozens of external connections, benchmark future needs, expand capacity, and respond to new requests for site access and specialized services. As a user facility, ESnet engages directly in efforts to improve end-to-end network performance between DOE facilities and U.S. universities. ESnet is currently executing a complete upgrade of its backbone network, the ESnet-6 upgrade project, which commenced construction in FY 2020 and is anticipated to complete construction in FY 2022. In FY 2021, the ESnet-6 project achieved a mid-project milestone of acceptance and commissioning of the coast-to-coast ESnet6 optical infrastructure, culminating in the successful phased migration of all current ESnet traffic onto this new, advanced optical backbone. In addition, ESnet operates a network R&D Testbed user program, which is linked to the National Science Foundation's FABRIC mid-scale instrumentation project, providing the nation's academic research community a unique terabit-scale research platform for next generation internet research. 45Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAdvanced Scientific Computing Research High Performance Computing and Network Facilities Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted High Performance Computing and Network Facilities $586,190 $613,018 +$26,828 High Performance Production Computing $113,786 $115,033 +$1,247 Funding supports operations at the NERSC facility, including user support, power, space, system leases, and staff.

The deployment of these systems includes necessary site preparations and non-recurring engineering (NRE) at the Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs) that will ultimately house and operate the exascale systems. The Office of Science Exascale Computing Project (SC-ECP) captures the research aspects of ASCR's participation in the ECI, to ensure the hardware and software R&D, including applications software, for an exascale system is completed in time to meet the scientific and national security mission needs of DOE. The SC-ECP is managed following the principles of DOE Order 413.3B, tailored for this fast-paced research effort and similar to that which has been used by SC for the planning, design, and construction of all its major computing projects, including the LCFs at ANL and ORNL, and NERSC at LBNL. SC conducts overall project management for the SC-ECP via a Project Office established at ORNL because of its considerable expertise in developing computational science and engineering applications and in managing HPC facilities, both for the Department and for other federal agencies; and its experience in managing distributed, large-scale projects, such as the Spallation Neutron Source project. A Memorandum of Agreement is in place between the six DOE national laboratories participating in the SC-ECP: LBNL, ORNL, ANL, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The Project Office at ORNL is executing the project and coordinating among partners. The FY 2023 Request includes $77,000,000 for the SC-ECP.

Project Scope and Justification Scope Four well-known challengesu are key to requirements and Mission Need of the SC-ECP. These challenges are: \u0003 Parallelism: Systems must exploit the extreme levels of parallelism that will be incorporated in an exascale-capable computer; \u0003 Resilience: Systems must be resilient to permanent and transient faults; \u0003 Energy Consumption: System power requirements must be no greater than 20-30 MW; and \u0003 Memory and Storage Challenge: Memory and storage architectures must be able to access and store information at anticipated computational rates. The realization of an exascale-capable system that addresses parallelism, resilience, energy consumption, and memory/storage involves tradeoffs among hardware (processors, memory, energy efficiency, reliability, interconnectivity); software (programming models, scalability, data management, productivity); and algorithms. To address this, the scope of the SC-ECP has three focus areas: \u0003 Hardware and Integration: The Hardware and Integration focus area supports U.S. HPC vendor-based research and the integrated deployment of specific ECP application milestones and software products on targeted systems at computingfacilities, including the completion of PathForward projects transitioning to facility non-recurring engineering (whereappropriate), and the integration of software and applications on pre-exascale and exascale system resources atfacilities. \u0003 Software Technology: The Software Technology focus area spans low-level operational software to programming environments for high-level applications software development, including the software infrastructure to support largedata management and data science for the DOE at exascale and will deliver a high quality, sustainable product suite. \u0003 Application Development: The Application Development focus area supports co-design activities between DOE mission critical applications and the software and hardware technology focus areas to address the exascale challenges: extremeparallelism, reliability and resiliency, deep hierarchies of hardware processors and memory, scaling to larger systems,and data-intensive science. As a result of these efforts, a wide range of applications will be ready to effectively use theexascale systems deployed in the 2021-2022 calendar year timeframe under the ECI. u http://www.isgtw.org/feature/opinion-challenges-exascale-computing 59Science/Advanced Scientific Computing Research/ 17-SC-20, SC Exascale Computing Project FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationJustification In 2015, the National Strategic Computing Initiative was established to maximize the benefits of HPC for U.S. economic competitiveness, scientific discovery, and national security. Within that initiative DOE, represented by a partnership between SC and NNSA, has the responsibility for executing a joint program focused on advanced simulation through an exascale-capable computing program, which will emphasize sustained performance and analytic computing to advance DOE missions. The objectives and the associated scientific challenges define a mission need for a computing capability of 2 - 10 ExaFLOPS (2 billion billion floating-point operations per second) in the ea rly to mid-2020s. In FY 2017, SC initiated the SC-ECP within Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) to support a large research and development (R&D) co-design project between domain scientists, application and system software developers, and hardware vendors to develop an exascale ecosystem as part of the ECI. The SC-ECP is managed in accordance with the principles of DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets , which SC uses for the planning, design, and construction of all of its major projects, including the LCFs at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Computer acquisitions use a tailored version of Order 413.3B. The first four years of SC-ECP were focused on research in software (new algorithms and methods to support application and system software development) and hardware (node and system design), and these costs will be reported as Other Project Costs. During the last three years of the project, activities will focus primarily on hardening the application and the system stack software, and on additional hardware technology investments, and these costs will be included in the Total Estimated Costs for the project.

BES research provides the foundations to develop new clean energy technologies, to mitigate the climate and environmental impacts of energy generation/use, and to support DOE missions in energy, environment, and national security. BES accomplishes its mission through excellence in scientific discovery in the energy sciences, and through stewardship of world-class scientific user facilities th at enable cutting-edge research and development. The research disciplines that BES supports\u2014condensed matter and materials physics, chemistry, geosciences, and aspects of biosciences\u2014touch virtually every important aspect of energy resources, production, conversion, transmission, storage, efficiency, and waste mitigation, providing a knowledge base for achieving a secure and sustainable clean energy future. The Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) report, \"A Remarkable Return on Investment in Fundamental Research,\" w provides key examples of major technological, commercial, and national security impacts, including clean energy technologies, directly traceable to BES-supported basic research. This mission-relevance of BES research results from a long-standing established strategic planning process, which encompasses BESAC reports, topical in-depth community workshops and reports, and rigorous program reviews. BES scientific user facilities consist of a complementary set of intense x-ray sources, neutron sources, and research centers for nanoscale science. Capabilities at BES facilities probe materials and chemical systems with ultrahigh spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions to investigate the critical functions of matter\u2014transport, reactivity, fields, excitations, and motion \u2014to answer some of the most challenging science questions and to provide insights on the scientific basis for energy technologies. The above noted BESAC report recounts the central role of these shared resources as a key to U.S. scientific and industrial leadership. In response to the COVID pandemic, BES facilities were at the forefront of the research efforts to understand the virus and to provide therapeutics to combat it. BES has a long history of delivering major construction projects on time and on budget, and of providing reliable availability and support to users for operating facilities. This record of accomplishment begins with rigorous community-based processes for conceptualization, planning, and execution in construction of facilities that continues in performance assessment for operating facilities. Key to exploiting scientific discoveries for future clean energy systems is the ability to create new materials using sophisticated synthesis and processing techniques, to precisely define the atomic arrangements in matter, and to design chemical processes, which will enable control of physical and chemical transformations and conversions of energy from one form to another. Materials will need to be more functional than today's energy materials, and new chemical processes will require ever-increasing control at the level of electronic structure and dynamics. These advances are not found in nature; rather they must be designed and fabricated to exacting standards using principles revealed by basic science. Today, BES-supported activities are entering a new era in which materials can be built with atom-by-atom precision, chemical processes at the molecular scale can be controlled with increasing accuracy, and computational models can predict the behavior of materials and chemical processes before they have been experimentally realized. Collectively, these new tools and capabilities convey a significant strategic advantage for the Nation to advance the scientific frontiers while laying the foundation for future clean energy innovations and economic prosperity. w https://science.osti.gov/~/media/bes/pdf/BESat40/BES_at_40.pdf 67Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHighlights of the FY 2023 Request The BES FY 2023 Request of $2,420.4 million is an increase of $175.4 million, or 7.8 percent, above the FY 2021 Enacted level.

Total, Basic Energy Sciences +$175,439 75Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic and Applied R&D Coordination As a program that supports fundamental scientific research relevant to many DOE mission areas, BES strives to build and maintain close connections with other DOE program offices. BES coordinates with DOE R&D programs through a variety of Departmental activities, including joint participation in research workshops, strategic planning activities, solicitation development, and program review meetings, as elaborated below. BES also coordinates with DOE technology offices in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, including topical area planning, solicitations, reviews, and award recommendations. BES has robust interactions with DOE technology offices through formal and informal coordination activities. Formal coordination includes the Science and Energy Technology Teams (SETTs) that draw on expertise and capabilities stewarded by multiple DOE offices to address forefront energy challenges. For example, BES participates in the Hydrogen SETT, engaging in activities to advance the Hydrogen Energy Earthshot (launched in 2021) aimed at accelerating breakthroughs of more abundant, affordable, and reliable clean energy solutions within the decade. x BES also contributes to the Carbon Dioxide Removal SETT and the Carbon Negative Earthshot to address the challenge of long-term removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using a variety of approaches including direct air capture, and the Energy Storage SETT and Long Duration Storage Earthshot to accelerate the development, commercialization, and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies. BES is also participating in planning for additional Earthshots and crosscutting energy technology areas. In the FY 2023 Request, BES participates in the new SC Energy Earthshots initiative, including the new research modality of Energy Earthshot Research Centers. These Centers will be jointly planned by SC and the DOE energy technology offices, to work toward the stretch goals of the Earthshots by addressing key research challenges at the interface between currently supported basic research and applied research and development activities. Historically, co-siting of research by BES and DOE energy technology programs at the same institutions has proven to be a valuable approach to facilitate close integration of basic and applied research. In these cases, teams of researchers benefit by sharing expertise and knowledge of research breakthroughs and program needs. The DOE national laboratory system plays a crucial role in achieving this integration of basic and applied research. Informal coordination includes participation of BES program managers in regularly scheduled intra-departmental meetings for information exchange and coordination on solicitations, program reviews, and project selections. These interactions cover a broad range of topics including biofuels derived from biomass; solar energy utilization, including solar fuels; critica l minerals/materials; advanced nuclear energy systems; vehicle technologies; biotechnology; and fundamental science to transform advanced manufacturing and industrial processes. These activities facilitate cooperation and coordination between BES and the DOE energy technology offices and defense programs. Additionally, DOE technology office personnel participate in reviews of BES research, and BES personnel participate in reviews of research funded by the technology offices. Program AccomplishmentsMastering energy efficiency for clean energy processes in electricity, fuels, storage, and carbon capture.The clean energy future requires efficient processes for energy generation, energy storage, and decarbonization. Recent research has made important steps that can lead to a wide range of efficient technologies.\u0003 Photoinduced charge transfer plays a central role in conversion of light energy into electricity and fuels. Researchers used femtosecond time-resolved X-ray photoemission spectroscopy on an organic system to discover a newmechanism that produces charge carriers from excitations by low-energy photons. This provides new options toefficiently harness light energy for photovoltaic or solar fuels applications. \u0003 Electrochemical processes provide energy-efficient approaches to split water into hydrogen, a carbon-neutral fuel, and oxygen. Platinum group elements\u2014critical elements with limited domestic supply\u2014are commonly used as catalysts tospeed up the rate of hydrogen production. Scientists demonstrated that earth-abundant elements can be incorporatedin metalorganic frameworks, a porous material, to tune their electrocatalytic properties and yield rates of hydrogen production comparable to those with platinum group elements. \u0003 The stability of interfaces is critical to the performance of many energy storage systems. Cryogenic electron microscopy and cryogenic focused ion beam enabled the characterization of the interface between Li metal and lithium x https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot. 76Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationphosphorous oxynitride. The structural and chemical information leads to a robust understanding of the stability of these interfaces and can be extended to study other solid-solid interfaces. \u0003 The ocean contains a lot of carbon dioxide as bicarbonate ions that increases as CO 2 in the air increases. The higher CO 2 concentration in the ocean provides an opportunity for easier CO 2 capture. Scientists recently demonstrated that electrochemical CO 2 capture from ocean water at 70 percent efficiency can be efficiently directly coupled with chemical conversion to CO with 95 percent Faradaic efficiency. Sustainable, low-carbon, and scalable approaches to transform manufacturing. The key chemicals and materials of the clean energy future must be produced, synthesized, and extracted by efficient, scalable methods that are sustainable over time in an environmentally sensitive way. Researchers have made significant progress with ammonia production, upcycling of plastics, synthesis science, and extraction of rare earths.\u0003 Nitrogenase enzymes catalyze the conversion of nitrogen and water to ammonia at ambient conditions. In contrast, multistep industrial processes produce ammonia from nitrogen and fossil feedstocks at elevated temperatures andpressures. Researchers coupled the enzyme to an inorganic component that controlled electron transfer, allowinggreater insight into the catalytic mechanism. The study demonstrated that hydrogen and ammonia productioncompete and provided mechanistic insight for development of new catalysts and bio-inorganic hybrids for low-carbonammonia production. \u0003 Researchers have developed energy-efficient approaches to convert polymers, the primary components of plastics, into valuable products that give a second life to single-use plastics. In one approach, the mechanistic understanding allowedtuning of a dual catalyst to promote low-temperature (under 250 C) conversion of polyethylene to fuels with few byproducts. In another approach, earth-abundant zirconium catalysts coupled with an aluminum reactant allowedconversion of alcohols that as surfactants. \u0003 Real-time observations and computational modeling of the synthesis of solid-state ceramics yielded a new, simplified model to precisely guide and accelerate this process. Solid-state ceramics are critical for clean energy technologies suchas solar cells and batteries, but their preparation is extremely slow and problematic because the process passesthrough many intermediate states. This computational model explains how to control and accelerate the multistepprocess and enabled formation of a classic superconducting ceramic 25 times faster than the traditional approach. \u0003 Rare-earth elements\u2014critical materials for modern technology\u2014are difficult to separate from each other because they have similar chemical properties. Scientists have demonstrated an electrochemical approach that forces some of theelements into different oxidation states, making separation possible by means of specially designed extractantmolecules. The typical multistep process is reduced to a cleaner, more energy-efficient and scalable single step. \u0003 Crystals made from colloids are valuable in a wide range of applications such as batteries, sensors, and solar cells, but making these crystals with desired properties is quite challenging. A new, robust approach for directing assembly ofcrystals with desired geometry and properties avoids costly and complex chemical surface engineering and allowstuning properties for new uses. This new method creates precise regions of discrete chemical and physical propertieson the surface of particles followed by selective interactions to correctly direct crystal formation. Materials and chemical sciences enable advances in quantum-based science and technology, and quantum computing enables advances in materials and chemical sciences.Recent research underscores the two-way relationship between BES-supported science domains and quantum information science. Advances span the areas of molecules for gate operations, understanding of correlated quantum errors, particles for logical operations, and efficient energy computations.\u0003 Scientists studying photovoltaics for light harvesting in molecular crystals uncovered design principles for the light- driven generation and manipulation of long-lived, correlated spin states. A combination of predictive modeling ofexcited state dynamics, targeted chemical synthesis of molecular systems, and sophisticated time-resolvedspectroscopy enabled the discovery of coupled molecules with spin entangled pair states, which could serve as thebasis of molecular platforms to perform optically initialized gate operations in quantum information systems operatingat room temperature. \u0003 The central challenge in building a quantum computer is error correction. Currently error correction relies on the assumption that errors are not correlated between different quantum bits (or qubits) in the system. Experimental and 77Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationmodeling research has revealed the existence of correlated errors in multi-qubit superconducting circuits. The data are compatible with absorption in the qubit substrate of cosmic ray muons and gamma rays, giving rise to correlated charge fluctuations in neighboring qubits. These results have major implications for proposed fault tolerant quantum computing and will inform the design of robust next-generation superconducting qubit arrays. \u0003 Researchers have established new experimental evidence of quantum objects called \"anyons\" that arise from the collective behavior of electrons in two dimensions and were first predicted decades ago. It is also anticipated that amany-anyon system can serve as the basis for quantum computing. Unlike for more well-known particles, movinganyons around each other in solids causes them to acquire a phase factor that can be used to perform logical gateoperations on a qubit. As researchers moved anyons in their experimental system they directly observed the expectedphase change. \u0003 Quantum computing techniques provide a means to address insurmountable computational barriers for simulating quantum systems on classical computers. Unfortunately, as the number of quantum circuits increases for progressivelylarger calculations, the opportunity for error also increases. Researchers have demonstrated a mathematical conceptknown as \"connected moments\" to compute the total energy of a molecular system using fewer quantum circuits,allowing the equivalent of a full-scale quantum calculation with more modest resources, while also reducing errors. Confronted by the COVID-19 pandemic, BES user facilities shifted to remote access and conducted research that was instrumental in combating the disease.BES light sources, neutron sources, and Nanoscale Science Research Centers adapted quickly to changed modes of operation and made key contributions to understanding of the virus, development of vaccines and therapeutics, and fabrication of vital materials.\u0003 User facilities rapidly shifted to remote access and mail-in of material samples in March 2020 to support critical research, mostly devoted to combating the pandemic. Representative topical areas included macromolecularcrystallography to study atomic-scale interactions of viral proteins with drug candidates and human proteins, solutionstate analysis of large and transient macromolecular assemblies, observation of cellular infection, and characterizationof respirator filter materials to aid manufacturing. \u0003 More than 700 unique users from more than 125 groups (including most major Pharma companies), using approximately 55 different beamlines at BES light sources and neutron sources, determined more than 450 structuresof SARS-CoV-2 proteins with or without potential antivirals or antibodies, leading to more than 80 peer-reviewedpublications as of August 2021. \u0003 A decade of studies at APS and SSRL on spike proteins were key to the rapid development and effectiveness of all three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in use in the United States. Furthermore, Pfizer scientists used NSLS-II to researchcertain structural properties of their vaccine. \u0003 In terms of drug discovery, ALS protein crystallography capabilities supported a large collaboration led by the University of Washington and VIR Biotechnology, which has developed a COVID-19 therapeutic, Sotrovimab, that recentlyreceived FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Glaxo-Smith-Kline is now a major ALS partner as the drug approachescommercialization. More candidate drugs developed through research at BES light sources are in clinical trials. \u0003 The Nanoscale Science Research Centers supported research to understand the virus and develop novel detection methods (fast, nanotechnology-based portable diagnostics sensors), synthesize custom nanoparticles for vaccineencapsulation and delivery, improve effectiveness of personal protective equipment (masks, nanoparticle-basedantiviral coatings), and develop epidemiological models to predict virus spread.

Undergraduate students from Alaska to the local area contributed to the project underthe Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships program, which encourages undergraduates and recent graduatesto pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers by providing research experiences at the DOElaboratories. 79Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic Energy Sciences Materials Sciences and Engineering Description Materials are critical to nearly every aspect of energy generation and end-use. Materials limitations are often a significant barrier to improved energy efficiencies, longer lifetimes of infrastructure and devices, or the introduction of new clean energy technologies. The Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) report on transformative opportunities for discovery science, coupled with the Basic Research Needs workshop reports on energy technologies and roundtable reports, provide further documentation of the importance of materials sciences in forefront research for next-generation scientific and technological advances. The Materials Sciences and Engineering subprogram supports research to provide the fundamental understanding and control of materials synthesis, behavior, and performance that will enable solutions to wide-ranging clean energy generation and end-use challenges as well as opening new directions that are not foreseen based on existing knowledge. The research explores the origin of macroscopic material behaviors; their fundamental connections to atomic, molecular, and electronic structures; and their evolution as materials move from nanoscale building blocks to mesoscale systems. At the core of the subprogram is experimental, theoretical, computational, and instrumentation research that will enable the predictive design and discovery of new materials with novel structures, functions, and properties. To accomplish these goals, the portfolio includes three integrated research activities:\u0003 Scattering and Instrumentation Sciences Research \u2014Advancing science using new tools and techniques to characterize materials structure and dynamics across multiple length and time scales, including ultrafast science, and to correlate this data with materials performance under real world and extreme conditions. \u0003 Condensed Matter and Materials Physics Research \u2014Understanding the foundations of material functionality and behavior including electronic, thermal, optical, mechanical, and rare-earth properties, the impact of extreme environments, and materials whose properties arise from the effects of quantum mechanics. \u0003 Materials Discovery, Design, and Synthesis Research \u2014Developing the knowledge base and synthesis strategies to design and precisely assemble structures to control properties and enable discovery of new materials with unprecedented functionalities, including approaches learned from biological systems, that limit the use of rare earth and other critical materials, and that enable more effective polymer chemistries. The Request continues the highest-priority fundamental research that supports the DOE mission, including research that will advance the foundational knowledge necessary to accelerate innovation to reduce impacts resulting from climate change while advancing clean energy technologies and infrastructure. The portfolio emphasizes understanding of how to direct and control energy flow in materials systems over multiple time (femtoseconds to seconds) and length (nanoscale to mesoscale and beyond) scales, and translation of this understanding to prediction of material behavior, transformations, and processes in challenging real-world systems. This will establish a foundational knowledge base for future advanced, clean energy technologies and advanced manufacturing processes, including extremes in temperature, pressure, stress, photon and radiation flux, electromagnetic fields, and chemical exposures. To maintain leadership in materials discovery, the research supported by this subprogram explores new frontiers of emergent materials behavior; utilization of nanoscale control; and materials systems that are metastable or far from equilibrium. This research includes investigation of the interfaces between physical, chemical, and biological sciences to explore new approaches to novel materials design and advanced manufacturing, including understanding to enable polymer upcycling to higher-value molecular systems. In clean energy-related research, there is a growing emphasis on carbon dioxide removal, including direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air. Other topics in clean energy include a focus on low-carbon hydrogen research and long-duration energy storage. Also, critical materials and minerals research will provide foundational knowledge to enable secure and sustainable supply chains for key clean energy technologies. Research activities in quantum materials highlight the importance and challenges for materials science in understanding and guiding the development of systems that realize unique properties for quantum information science (QIS). Materials science for microelectronics will provide the needed advances for future computing, sensors, detectors, and communication that are critical for national priorities in clean energy and for leadership in advanced research over a wide range of fields. An increasingly important aspect of materials research is the use of data science techniques to enhance the 81Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationutility of both theoretical and experimental data for predictive design and discovery of materials. As an essential element of this research, this subprogram supports the development of advanced characterization tools, instruments, and techniques that can assess a wide range of space and time scales, especially in combination and under dynamic operando conditions to analyze non-equilibrium materials, conditions, and excited-state phenomena. In addition to a diverse portfolio of single-investigator and small-group research projects, this subprogram supports Computational Materials Sciences, Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs), the Batteries and Energy Storage Hub, SC National Quantum Information Science Research Centers (NQISRCs), in partnership with other SC programs, and, new in FY 2023, Energy Earthshot Research Centers (in partnership with Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) and Biological and Environmental Research (BER) and with DOE energy technology offices). These research modalities support multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary research focused on forefront scientific challenges in support of the DOE clean energy mission. This subprogram also includes the DOE Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The DOE EPSCoR program will strengthen investments in early-stage clean energy and climate research for U.S. states and territories that do not historically have large federally-supported academic research programs, expanding DOE research opportunities to a broad and diverse scientific community. This subprogram also supports the Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem, such as Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), individuals from groups historically underrepresented in STEM, and students from communities disproportionately affected by social, economic, and health burdens of the energy system and from EPSCoR jurisdictions. Scattering and Instrumentation Sciences Research Advanced characterization tools with very high precision in space and time are essential to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and nanoscale levels. Research in Scattering and Instrumentation Science supports innovative techniques and instrumentation development for advanced materials science research with scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging using electrons, neutrons, and x-rays, including development of science to understand ultrafast dynamics. These techniques provide precise and complementary information about the relationship among structure, dynamics, and properties, generating scientific knowledge that is foundational to the BES mission. The major advances in materials sciences from DOE's world-leading electron, neutron, and x-ray scattering facilities provide continuing evidence of the importance of this research field. In addition, the BESAC report on transformative opportunities for discovery science identified imaging as one of the pillars for future transformational advances. The use of multimodal platforms to reveal the most critical features of a material has been a finding in several of the Basic Research Needs reports. These tools and techniques are also critical in advancing understanding and discovery of novel quantum materials, including materials for next-generation systems to advance QIS and support the work of NQISRCs. This program is focused on open questions in materials science and physics, but these characterization tools are broadly applicable to other fields including chemistry, biology, and geoscience, and can be a key component in preparedness for biological threats. The unique interactions of electrons, neutrons, and x-rays with matter enable a range of complementary tools with different sensitivities and resolution for the characterization of materials at length- and time-scales spanning many orders of magnitude. A distinct aspect of this activity is the development of innovative instrumentation and techniques for scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging needed to link the microscopic and macroscopic properties of energy materials. Included is the use of cryogenic environments to evaluate properties only occurring at these temperatures and to learn about processes and interfaces in materials that are damaged by the probes used to characterize them. The use of multiscale and multimodal techniques to extract heretofore unattainable information on multiple length and time scales is a growing aspect of this research, as is the development and application of cryogenic electron microscopy for challenges in physical sciences. For example, to aid in the design of transformational new materials for clean energy technologies such as batteries, operando experiments contribute to understanding the atomic and nanoscale changes that lead to materials failure in non-equilibrium and extreme environments (temperature, pressure, stress, radiation, magnetic fields, and electrochemical potentials). Advances in cryogenic microscopy will support the BRaVE initiative since this instrumentation is heavily used to characterize biological threats. Information from these characterization tools is the foundation for the creation of new materials that have extraordinary tolerance and can function in extreme environments without property degradation. This activity supports the Accelerate initiative, which will support scientific research to accelerate the transition of science advances to energy technologies and the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative 82Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationwhich will provide focused investment on enhancing research on clean energy, climate, and related topics at minority serving institutions, including attention to underserved and environmental justice communities. Condensed Matter and Materials Physics Research This activity supports fundamental experimental and theoretical research to discover, understand, and control novel phenomena in solid materials, generating scientific knowledge that is foundational to the BES mission. These electronic, magnetic, optical, thermal, and structural materials make up the infrastructure for clean energy technologies and innovations to reduce climate change impacts, as well as accelerator and detector technologies for SC facilities. Also supported is research to understand the role of rare earth and other critical materials in determining functionality, so that they can be reduced or eliminated from key energy technology supply chains. Experimental research in this program emphasizes discovery and characterization of materials' properties that have the potential to be exploited for new technological functionalities. Complementary theoretical research aims to explain such properties across a broad range of length and time scales. Theoretical research also includes development and integration of predictive theory and modeling for discovery of materials with targeted properties. Advanced computational and data science techniques (including artificial intelligence and machine learning) are increasingly enabling knowledge to be extracted from large materials databases of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. This program also supports the development of such databases as well as the computational tools that can take advantage of them. This program continues to emphasize understanding and control of quantum materials whose properties result from interactions of the constituent electrons with each other, the atomic lattice, or light. Investigations include bulk materials as well as nanostructures and two-dimensional layered structures such as graphene, multilayered structures of two-dimensional materials, and studies of the electronic properties of materials at ultra-low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. The research advances the fundamental understanding of electronic, magnetic, and optical properties relevant to energy-efficient microelectronics and quantum information science (QIS). The focus on QIS research couples experimental and theoretical expertise in quantum materials with prototypes of quantum structures that can be used to study the science of device functionality and performance. Activities also emphasize research to understand how materials respond to temperature, light, radiation, corrosive chemicals, and other environmental conditions. This includes electrical and optical properties of materials related to solar energy as well as the effects of defects on electronic properties, strength, deformation, and failure over a wide range of length and time scales. In FY 2023, these activities will support the SC Energy Earthshots initiative. A recent focus is on extending knowledge of radiation effects to enable predictive capabilities for the extreme environments expected in future nuclear reactors and accelerators for SC facilities. In FY 2023, BES will continue to partner with other SC programs to support the NQISRCs initiated in FY 2020. These centers focus on a set of QIS applications and cross-cutting topics that span the development space that will impact SC programs, including sensors, communication, quantum emulators/simulators, and enabling technologies that will pave the path to exploit quantum computing in the longer term. Research supported by this program will include theory of materials for quantum applications in computing, communication, and sensing; device science for next-generation QIS systems, including interface science and modeling of materials performance; and synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of quantum materials, including integration into novel device architectures to explore QIS functionality. In partnership with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), High Energy Physics (HEP), Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), and Nuclear Physics (NP) programs, BES will continue activities begun in FY 2021 to support multi-disciplinary basic research to accelerate the advancement of microelectronic technologies in a co-design innovation ecosystem, as called for by the Basic Research Needs for Microelectronics report. y Among the challenges is discovery science that can lead to low- power microelectronics for edge computing as well as for exascale computers and beyond. Such computing capabilities will be necessary to analyze the vast volumes of data that will be generated by future SC facilities. Similarly, transforming power electronics and the electricity grid into a modern, agile, resilient, and energy-efficient system requires improvements in advanced microelectronics materials, and their integration within a co-design framework. y https://science.osti.gov/-/media/bes/pdf/reports/2019/BRN_Microelectronics_rpt.pdf 83Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationMaterials Discovery, Design, and Synthesis Research The discovery and development of new materials has long been recognized as the engine that drives science frontiers, technology innovations, and advanced manufacturing. Predictive design and discovery of new forms of matter with desired properties continues to be a significant challenge for materials sciences. A strong, vibrant research enterprise in the discovery and design of new materials is critical to world leadership\u2014scientifically, technologically, and economically. One of the goals of this activity is to grow and maintain U.S. leadership in materials discovery by investing in advanced synthesis capabilities and by coupling these with state-of-the-art user facilities and advanced computational capabilities at DOE national laboratories, generating scientific knowledge that is foundational to the BES mission, including clean energy and reduction of impacts resulting from climate change. In FY 2023, these activities will support the SC Energy Earthshots initiative. The BESAC report on transformative opportunities for discovery science reinforced the importance of the continued growth of synthesis science, recognizing the opportunity to realize targeted functionality in materials by controlling the synthesis and assembly of hierarchical architectures and beyond equilibrium matter. In FY 2023 this program will continue to apply materials discovery and synthesis research to understand the unique properties of rare earth and other critical materials and minerals, with the goal of reducing their use. New research directions will be inspired by BES reports related to advanced manufacturing, including polymer upcycling. Understanding of synthesis science will enable design of new systems that are easier to efficiently convert into similar products with comparable or enhanced complexity, functionality, and value. Emphasis will include advancing the basic science of advanced manufacturing through innovative approaches for scalable assembly and integration of predictive modeling with characterization tools tuned to advanced manufacturing scale, complexity, and speed. In addition to research on chemical and physical synthesis processes, an important element of this portfolio is research to understand how to use bio-mimetic and biology-inspired approaches to design and synthesize novel materials with some of the unique properties found in nature. Major research directions include the controlled synthesis and assembly of nanoscale materials into functional materials with desired properties; mimicking the low-energy synthesis approaches of biology to produce materials; bio-inspired materials that assemble autonomously and, in response to external stimuli, dynamically assemble and disassemble to form non-equilibrium structures; and adaptive and resilient materials that also possess self-repairing and self-regulating capabilities. The portfolio also supports fundamental research in solid-state chemistry to enable discovery of new functional materials and the development of new crystal growth methods and thin film deposition techniques to create complex materials with targeted structure and properties. An important element of this activity is research to understand the progression of structure and properties as a material is formed, in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and to gain atomic level control of material synthesis and processing, including the extraordinary challenges for synthesis of quantum materials. Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) The DOE EPSCoR program funds early-stage research that supports DOE's energy mission in states and territories with historically lower levels of Federal academic research funding. Eligibility determination for the DOE EPSCoR program follows the National Science Foundation eligibility analysis. The DOE EPSCoR program emphasizes research that will improve the capability of designated states and territories to conduct sustainable and nationally competitive energy-related research; jumpstart research capabilities in designated states and territories through training scientists and engineers in energy-related areas; and build beneficial relationships between scientists and engineers in the designated jurisdictions and world-class national laboratories managed by the DOE. This research leverages DOE national user facilities and takes advantage of opportunities for intellectual collaboration across the DOE system. Through broadened participation, DOE EPSCoR seeks to augment the network of energy-related research performers across the Nation. Annual EPSCoR funding opportunities alternate between a focus on research performed in collaboration with the DOE National Laboratories and a focus on implementation awards that facilitate larger team awards for the development of research infrastructure in the EPSCoR jurisdictions. The FY 2023 program will focus on implementation awards for larger teams and will consider renewals of the FY 2021 awards as well as proposals for new teams. The technical scope will include 84Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationa focus on clean energy research and climate science, expanding these important research communities and supporting the Energy Earthshot initiative. The program supports early career scientists from EPSCoR jurisdictions on an annual basis and provides complementary support for research grants to eligible institutions. Energy Frontier Research Centers The EFRC program is a unique research modality, bringing together the skills and talents of teams of investigators to perform energy-relevant, basic research with a scope and complexity beyond what is possible in standard single-investigator or small-group awards. These multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary centers foster, encourage, and enable transformative scientific advances. They allow experts from a variety of disciplines to collaborate on shared challenges, combining their strengths to uncover new and innovative solutions to the most difficult problems in materials sciences. The EFRCs also support numerous graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, educating and training a scientific workforce for the 21 st century economy. The EFRCs supported in this subprogram focus on the following topics: the design, discovery, synthesis, characterization, and understanding of novel, solid-state materials that convert energy into electricity; the understanding of materials and processes that are foundational for electrical energy storage and gas separation; quantum materials and quantum information science; microelectronics; and materials for future nuclear energy and waste storage. After twelve years of research activity, the program has produced an impressive breadth of scientific accomplishments, including over 14,000 peer-reviewed journal publications. BES uses a variety of methods to regularly assess the progress of the EFRCs, including annual progress reports, monthly phone calls with the EFRC Directors, periodic Directors' meetings, and on-site visits by program managers. Each EFRC undergoes a review of its management structure and approach in the first year of the award and a midterm assessment of scientific progress compared to its scientific goals. To facilitate communication of results to other EFRCs and DOE, BES holds scientific meetings of the EFRC researchers biennially. In FY 2023, BES will continue EFRC research efforts through awards made in FY 2020 and FY 2022. Scientific emphasis includes research directions identified in recent strategic planning activities, such as investments in clean energy research, climate science, and low-carbon manufacturing. Energy Earthshot Research Centers The EERC program is a new modality of research to be launched in FY 2023, building on the success of the Energy Frontier Research Centers. Like the EFRCs, EERCs will bring together multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary teams to perform energy-relevant research with a scope and complexity beyond what is possible in standard single-investigator or small-group awards. Beyond the scope of the EFRCs, EERCs will address the gap between basic research and the applied research and development activities to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between SC and the DOE energy technology offices, which is key to realizing the stretch goals of the Energy Earthshots. EERCs will support team awards involving academic, national lab, and industrial researchers with joint planning by SC and energy technology offices, establishing a new era of cross-office research cooperation. The funding will focus efforts directly at the interface, ensuring that directed fundamental research and capabilities at SC user facilities tackle the most challenging barriers identified in the applied research and development activities. Existing DOE Energy Earthshots include the Hydrogen Shot, the Long Duration Storage Shot, and the Carbon Negative Shot. Additional topics are under consideration for future announcements. From a science perspective, many research gaps for the Energy Earthshots crosscut all topics and will provide a foundation for other energy technology challenges, including biotechnology, critical minerals/materials, energy-water, subsurface science (including geothermal research), and materials and chemical processes under extreme conditions for nuclear applications. These gaps require multiscale computational and modeling tools, new artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, real-time characterization, including in extreme environments, and development of the scientific base to co-design processes and systems rather than individual materials, chemistries, and components. EERCs will leverage individual Center research to cross-fertilize the ideas that emerge in one topical area to benefit others with similar challenges accelerating the science, as well as the technologies. In FY 2023, the Request supports a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to be released by the Office of Science (BES, Advanced Scientific Computing Research, and Biological and Environmental Research), in coordination with the DOE energy 85Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationtechnology offices, for the initial cohort of Energy Earthshot Research Centers. Emphasis will be on the current Earthshot topics and those announced by DOE prior to release of the FOA. Energy Innovation Hubs The Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), the Batteries and Energy Storage Hub, focuses on early-stage research to tackle forefront, basic scientific challenges for next-generation electrochemical energy storage. JCESR is a multi-institutional research team led by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in collaboration with four other national laboratories, eleven universities, the Army Research Laboratory, and industry. In the initial five-year award (2013-2018), JCESR created a library of fundamental scientific knowledge including: demonstration of a new class of membranes for anode protection and flow batteries; elucidation of the characteristics required for multi-valent intercalation electrodes; understanding the chemical and physical processes that must be controlled in lithium-sulfur batteries to greatly improve cycle life; and computational screening of over 16,000 potential electrolyte compounds using the Electrolyte Genome protocols. For the current award (2018-2023, pending annual progress reviews and appropriations), JCESR identified critical scientific gaps to serve as a foundation for the research. The research directions are consistent with the priorities established in the 2017 BES workshop report Basic Research Needs for Next Generation Electrical Energy Storage z including discovery science for exploration of new battery chemistries and materials with novel functionality. JCESR is focusing on advances that will elucidate cross-cutting scientific principles for electrochemical stability; ionic and electronic transport at interfaces/ interphases, in bulk materials or membranes; solvation structures and dynamics in electrolytes; nucleation and growth of materials, new phases, or defects; coupling of electrochemical and mechanical processes; and kinetic factors that govern reversible and irreversible reactions. Close coupling of theory, simulation, and experimentation is proving critical to accelerate scientific progress; to unravel the complex, coupled phenomena of electrochemical energy storage; to bridge gaps in knowledge across length and temporal scales; and to enhance the predictive capability of electrochemical models. In the current research, prototypes are being used to demonstrate the impact of materials advances for specific battery architectures and designs. Based on established best practices for managing large awards, BES will continue to require quarterly reports, frequent teleconferences, and annual progress reports and peer reviews to communicate progress, provide input on the technical directions, and ensure high-quality, impactful research. In FY 2022, JCESR will receive the tenth and final year of funding, which will support research activities through much of FY 2023. In FY 2023, BES plans to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement to openly recompete the Batteries and Energy Storage Hub program. Computational Materials Sciences Major strides in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization, combined with concurrent advances in computational science\u2014enabled by enormous improvements in high-performance computing capabilities\u2014have opened an unprecedented opportunity to design new materials with specific functions and physical properties. The goal is to leap beyond simple extensions of current theory and models of materials towards a paradigm shift in which specialized computational codes and software enable the design, discovery, and development of new materials or functionalities, and in turn, create new advanced, innovative technologies. Given the importance of materials to virtually all technologies, including clean energy, computational materials sciences are critical for American competitiveness in advanced manufacturing and global leadership in innovation. This paradigm shift will accelerate the design of revolutionary materials to enable the Nation's energy and quantum information security, tackle the climate challenge, and enhance economic competitiveness. Success will require extensive R&D with the goal of creating experimentally validated, robust community codes that will enable functional materials innovation. Awards in this program focus on the creation of computational codes and associated experimental/computational databases for the design of functional materials or quantum materials with new functionalities. This research is performed by small groups and fully integrated teams. Large teams combine the skills of experts in materials theory, modeling, computation, synthesis, characterization, and fabrication. The research includes development of new ab initio theory, z https://science.osti.gov/-/media/bes/pdf/reports/2017/BRN_NGEES_rpt.pdf 86Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationcontributing the generated data to databases, as well as advanced characterization and controlled synthesis to validate the computational predictions. It uses the unique world-leading tools and instruments at DOE's user facilities. The computational codes will use DOE's leadership computational facilities and be positioned to take advantage of today's petascale and tomorrow's exascale high-performance computers. This will result in open source, robust, validated, user-friendly software that captures the essential physics of relevant materials systems. The goal is the use of these codes and generated data by the broader research community and by industry to accelerate the design of new functional materials. BES manages the computational materials science research activities using the approaches developed for similar small and large team modalities. Management reviews by a peer review panel are held in the first year of the award for large teams. Mid-term peer reviews are held to assess scientific progress, with regular teleconferences, annual progress reports, and active oversight by BES throughout the performance period. In FY 2023, the funding associated with the four-year awards in FY 2019 will be recompeted for both renewal and new awards. 87Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic Energy Sciences Materials Sciences and Engineering Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Materials Sciences and Engineering $435,008 $566,629 +$131,621 Scattering and Instrumentation Sciences Research $74,031 $101,963 +$27,932 Funding continues to push the frontiers of instrumentation and techniques needed to understand materials properties and enable materials discovery, including quantum phenomena, materials behavior in extreme energy-related environments, and multidimensional phenomena (requiring simultaneous assessment crossing space, time, and chemical evolution).

The Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences subprogram supports research to discover fundamental knowledge of chemical reactivity and energy conversion that is the foundation for energy-relevant chemical processes, such as catalysis, synthesis, separations, and light-driven chemical transformations. The research addresses how physical and chemical phenomena at the scales of electrons, atoms, and molecules control complex and collective behavior of macroscopic-scale energy and matter conversion systems. At the most fundamental level, research to understand quantum mechanical behavior is rapidly evolving into the ability to control and direct such behavior to achieve desired outcomes. Fundamental knowledge developed through this subprogram can extend the new era of control science to tailor chemical transformations with atomic and molecular precision. The challenge is to achieve predictive understanding of complex chemical, geochemical, and biochemical systems at the same level of detail now known for simpler molecular systems. To address these challenges, the portfolio includes coordinated research activities in three areas:\u0003 Fundamental Interactions Research \u2014Discover the foundational factors controlling chemical reactivity and dynamics in gas and condensed phases, and at interfaces, based on understanding quantum interactions among photons, electrons, atoms, and molecules. \u0003 Chemical Transformations Research \u2014Understand and control the mechanisms of chemical catalysis, synthesis, separation, stabilization, and transport in complex chemical and subsurface systems, from atomic to geologic scales. \u0003 Photochemistry and Biochemistry Research \u2014Elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the capture of light energy and its conversion into electrical and chemical energy through biological and chemical pathways. The Request continues the highest-priority fundamental research, including support of research to advance scientific understanding and accelerate innovation that can reduce impacts that contribute to climate change while advancing clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Support will continue for research to discover chemical processes for low-carbon, efficient, and circular approaches to advanced manufacturing including chemical upcycling of polymers. Related research emphasizes the chemistry, separations, and substitutions of critical elements important for reducing the dependence on critical materials and minerals while promoting innovative and robust manufacturing supply chains. Fundamental biochemistry will develop models and datasets for discovery of principles to enable biomimetic and biohybrid clean energy systems. Research focused on molecular science will enable new microelectronics and increase understanding of the phenomena relevant to QIS and quantum computing. Bringing simulation and experiments together, integration of data science and computational chemistry will provide the needed tools and infrastructure for shared data repositories. Five synergistic, foundational research themes are at the intersections of multiple research focus areas in this portfolio. Ultrafast Chemistry probes electron and atom dynamics to understand energy and chemical conversions. Chemistry at Complex Interfaces advances understanding of how interfacial dynamics and structural and functional disorder influence chemical phenomena.

Fundamental Interactions Research This activity emphasizes structural and dynamical studies of atoms, molecules, and nanostructures, and the description of their interactions in full quantum detail. The goal is to achieve a complete understanding of reactive chemistry in the gas phase, in condensed phases, and at interfaces. This activity provides leadership for ultrafast chemistry, supporting research that advances ultrafast tools and approaches and their application to probe and control chemical processes.

Novel attosecond sources, x-ray free electron laser sources such as the LCLS-II, and ultrafast electron diffraction are used to image the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and charge transport. CPIMS research emphasizes foundational research at the boundary of chemistry and physics, pursuing a molecular-level understanding of chemical, physical, and electron- and photon-driven processes in liquids and at interfaces. Experimental, theoretical, and computational investigations in the condensed phase and at interfaces elucidate the molecular-scale chemical and physical properties and interactions that govern condensed phase structure and dynamics. The GPCP program supports research on fundamental gas-phase chemical processes important in energy applications. Research in this program explores chemical reactivity, kinetics, and dynamics in the gas phase at the level of electrons, atoms, molecules, and nanoparticles. The CTC program supports development, improvement, and integration of new and existing theoretical and massively parallel computational or data-driven strategies for the accurate and efficient prediction or simulation of processes and mechanisms. Research in this area is crucial to utilize emerging exascale computing facilities and to optimize use of existing leadership class computers, leveraging U.S. leadership in the development of open-source computational chemistry codes and databases.

These user facilities are operated on an open access, competitive, merit review basis, enabling scientists from every state and many disciplines from academia, national laboratories, and industry to utilize the facilities' unique capabilities and sophisticated instrumentation. Studying matter at the level of atoms and molecules requires instruments that can probe structures that are one thousand times smaller than those detectable by the most advanced light microscopes. Thus, to characterize structures with atomic detail, researchers must use probes such as electrons, x-rays, and neutrons with wavelengths at least as small as the structures being investigated. The BES user facilities portfolio consists of a complementary set of intense x-ray sources, neutron scattering facilities, and research centers for nanoscale science. These facilities allow researchers to probe materials in space, time, and energy with the appropriate resolutions that can interrogate the inner workings of matter to answer some of the most challenging grand science questions. By taking advantage of the intrinsic charge, mass, and magnetic characteristics of x-rays, neutrons, and electrons, these tools offer unique capabilities to help understand the fundamental aspects of the natural world. Advances in tools and instruments often drive scientific discovery. The continual development and upgrade of the instrumental capabilities include new x-ray and neutron experimental stations with improved computational and data analysis infrastructure, improved nanoscience core facilities, and new stand-alone instruments. The subprogram also supports research in accelerator and detector development to explore technology options for the next generations of x-ray and neutron sources. Keeping BES accelerator-based facilities at the forefront requires continued, transformative advances in accelerator science and technology. Strategic investments in high-brightness electron injectors, superconducting undulators with strong focusing, and high gradient superconducting cavities will have the most impactful benefits. X-ray free electron laser (FEL) oscillators offer the most near-future attainable advances in x-ray science capabilities, requiring additional research efforts in x-ray resonant cavities and high heat-load diamond materials. Research in seeded FEL schemes for full coherent x-rays, and attosecond electron and x-ray pulse generation are critical for multi-terawatt FEL amplifiers required by single-particle imaging. The twelve BES scientific user facilities provide the Nation with the most comprehensive and advanced x-ray, neutron, and electron-based experimental tools enabling fundamental discovery science. Hundreds of experiments are conducted simultaneously around the clock, generating vast quantities of raw experimental data that must be stored, transported, and then analyzed to convert the raw data into information to unlock the answers to important scientific questions. Managing the collection, transport, and analysis of data at the BES facilities is a growing challenge as new facilities come online with expanded scientific capabilities coupled together with advances in detector technology. Over the next decade, the data volume, and the computational power to process the data, is expected to grow by several orders of magnitude. Applications of data science methods and tools are being implemented in new software and hardware to help address these data and information challenges and needs. Challenges include speeding up high-fidelity simulations for online models, fast tuning in high-dimensional space, anomaly/breakout detection, 'virtual diagnostics' that can operate at high repetition rates, and sophisticated compression/rejection data pipelines operating at the 'edge' (next to the instrument) to save the highest-value data from user experiments. The BES user facilities provide unique capabilities to the scientific community and industry and are a critical component of maintaining U.S. leadership in the physical sciences. Collectively, these user facilities and enabling tools contribute to important research results that span the continuum from basic to applied research and embrace the full range of scientific and technological endeavors, including chemistry, physics, geology, materials science, environmental science, biology, and biomedical science. These capabilities enable scientific insights that can lead to the discovery and design of advanced materials and novel chemical processes with broad societal impacts, from energy applications to information technologies and biopharmaceutical discoveries. The advances enabled by these facilities extend from energy-efficient catalysts to spin- 107Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationbased electronics and new drugs and delivery systems for cancer therapy. For approved, peer-reviewed projects, operating time is available at no cost to researchers who intend to publish their results in the open literature. In FY 2019, more than 16,000 scientists and engineers in many fields of science and technology used BES scientific facilities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BES scientific user facilities were under curtailed user operations, available mainly through remote access for the majority of the instruments during the second half of FY 2020 and all of FY 2021. Additional funds provided through the CARES Act supported extraordinary operations of the light and neutron sources and nanoscale science research centers for COVID-specific research during curtailed operations. The BES facilities supported over 12,500 users in FY 2020 and over 11,300 users in FY 2021. Light sources and neutron sources were able to provide critical support to the development of potential therapeutic drugs and vaccines through structural studies of the proteins of the SARS CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. All of the user facilities contributed to other COVID-19 activities, including research on masks, characterization of novel manufacturing for medical equipment, and delivery of therapeutics. The BES facilities will continue to support ongoing research efforts to combat COVID-19 and evolve the tools and expertise needed for future public health challenges. In FY 2023, continued support for biological threats at the light and neutron sources is included in the Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE) initiative. X-Ray Light Sources X-rays are an essential tool for studying the structure of matter and have long been used to peer into material through which visible light cannot penetrate. Today's light source facilities produce x-rays that are billions of times brighter thanmedical x-rays. Scientists use these highly focused, intense beams of x-rays to reveal the identity and arrangement of atomsin a wide range of materials. The tiny wavelength of x-rays allows us to see things that visible light cannot resolve, such asthe arrangement of atoms in metals, semiconductors, biological molecules, and other materials. The fundamental tenet ofmaterials research is that structure determines function. The practical corollary that converts materials research from anintellectual exercise into a foundation of our modern technology-driven economy is that structure can be manipulated toconstruct materials with desired behaviors. To this end, x-rays have become a primary tool for probing the atomic andelectronic structure of materials internally and on their surfaces. From their first systematic use as an experimental tool in the 1960s, large-scale light source facilities have vastly enhanced the utility of pre-existing and contemporary techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, x-ray spectroscopy, and imaging and have given rise to scores of new ways to do experiments that would not otherwise be feasible with conventional x-ray machines. Moreover, the wavelength can be selected over a broad range (from the infrared to hard x-rays) to match the needs of particular experiments. Together with additional features, such as controllable polarization, coherence, and ultrafast pulsed time structure, these characteristics make x-ray light sources an important tool for a wide range of materials research. The wavelengths of the emitted photons span a range of dimensions from the atom to biological cells, thereby providing incisive probes for advanced research in a wide range of areas, including materials science, physical and chemical sciences, metrology, geosciences, environmental sciences, biosciences, medical sciences, and pharmaceutical sciences. BES operates a suite of five light sources, including a free electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC, and four storag e ring-based light sources\u2014the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at ANL, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at SLAC, and the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) at BNL. BES provides funds to support facility operations, to enable cutting-edge research and technical support, and to administer the user program at these facilities, which are made available to all researchers with access determined via peer review of user proposals. Facility upgrade projects are underway for the APS, ALS, and LCLS to ensure ongoing world leadership for these facilities. Since completing construction of NSLS-II in FY 2015, BES has invested in the scientific research capabilities at this advanced light source facility by building specialized experimental stations or \"beamlines.\" The initial suite of seven beamlines has expanded to the current 28 beamlines with room for at least 30 more. In order to adopt the most up-to-date technologies and to provide the most advanced capabilities, BES plans a phased approach to new beamlines at NSLS-II, as was done for the other light sources in the BES portfolio. The NSLS-II Experimental Tools-II (NEXT-II) major item of equipment (MIE) project was started in FY 2020 to provide three best-in-class beamlines to support the needs of the U.S. research community. These beamlines will focus on the techniques of coherent diffraction imaging, soft x-ray spectromicroscopy, and nanoscale probes of electronic excitations. In FY 2023, NEXT-III will receive Other Project Costs support for planning of the next cadre of beamlines. 108Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh-Flux Neutron Sources One of the goals of modern materials science is to understand the factors that determine the properties of matter on the atomic scale and to use this knowledge to optimize those properties or to develop new materials and functionality. This process regularly involves the discovery of fascinating new physics, which itself may lead to previously unexpected applications. Among the different probes used to investigate atomic-scale structure and dynamics, thermal neutrons have unique advantages: \u0003 they have a wavelength similar to the spacing between atoms, allowing atomic-resolution studies of structure, and have an energy similar to the elementary excitations of atoms and magnetic spins in materials, thus allowing aninvestigation of material dynamics; \u0003 they have no charge, allowing deep penetration into a bulk material; \u0003 they are scattered to a similar extent by both light and heavy atoms but differently by different isotopes of the same element, so that different chemical sites can be uniquely distinguished via isotope substitution experiments, forexample substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in organic and biological materials; \u0003 they have a magnetic moment, and thus can probe magnetism in condensed matter systems; and \u0003 their scattering cross-section is precisely measurable on an absolute scale, facilitating straightforward comparison with theory and computer modeling. The High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at ORNL generates neutrons via fission in a research reactor. HFIR operates at 85 megawatts and provides state-of-the-art facilities for neutron scattering, isotope production, materials irradiation, and neutron activation analysis. It is the world's leading production source of elements heavier than plutonium for medical, industrial, and research applications. There are 12 instruments in the user program at HFIR and the adjacent cold neutron beam guide hall, which include world-class instruments for inelastic scattering, small angle scattering, powder and single crystal diffraction, neutron imaging, and engineering diffraction. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at ORNL uses a different approach for generating neutron beams, where an accelerator generates protons that strike a heavy-metal target such as mercury. As a result of the impact, cascades of neutrons are produced in a process known as spallation. The SNS is the world's brightest pulsed neutron facility, and presently includes 19 instruments. These world-leading instruments include very high-resolution inelastic and quasi-elastic scattering capabilities, powder and single crystal diffraction, polarized and unpolarized beam reflectometry, and spin echo and small angle scattering spectrometers. A large suite of capabilities for high and low temperature, high magnetic field, and high-pressure sample environment equipment is available for the instruments. All the SNS instruments are in high demand by researchers world-wide in a range of disciplines from biology to materials sciences and condensed matter physics. Current construction projects at SNS focus on maintaining world-leadership for neutron scattering. In addition, for FY 2023 Other Project Costs are requested to initiate planning for replacement of the aging HFIR pressure vessel. Nanoscale Science Research Centers Nanoscience is the study of materials and their behaviors at the nanometer scale\u2014probing and assembling single atoms, clusters of atoms, and molecular structures. The scientific quest is to design new nanoscale materials and structures not found in nature and observe and understand how they function while they interact with their physical and chemical environments. Developments at the nanoscale and mesoscale have the potential to make major contributions to delivering remarkable scientific discoveries that transform our understanding of energy and matter and advance national, economic, and energy security. The Nanoscale Science Research Centers (NSRCs) focus on interdisciplinary discovery research at the nanoscale, serving as the basis for a national program that encompasses new science, new tools, and new computing capabilities. Distinct from the x-ray and neutron sources, NSRCs comprise of a suite of smaller unique tools and expert scientific staff. The five NSRCs are the Center for Nanoscale Materials at ANL, the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at BNL, the Molecular Foundry at LBNL, the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at ORNL, and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies at SNL and 109Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationLANL. Each center has particular expertise and capabilities, such as nanomaterials synthesis and assembly; theory, modeling and simulation; imaging and spectroscopy including electron and scanning probe microscopy; and nanostructure fabrication and integration. Selected thematic areas include catalysis, electronic materials, nanoscale photonics, and soft and biological materials. The centers are typically near BES facilities for x-rays or neutrons, or near SC-supported computation facilities, which complement and leverage each other's capabilities. These custom-designed laboratories contain clean rooms, nanofabrication resources, one-of-a-kind signature instruments, and other instruments generally available only at major user facilities. The NSRC electron and scanning probe microscopy capabilities provide superior atomic-scale spatial resolution and simultaneously obtain structural, chemical, and other types of information from sub-nanometer regions at short time scales. They house one of the highest resolution electron microscopes in the world. Data science approaches are enabling large and fast data acquisition, real-time analysis, and autonomous experiments. Operating funds enable cutting-edge research, provide technical support, and administer the user program at these facilities, which serve academic, government, and industry researchers with access determined through external peer review of user proposals. The NSRCs will continue to develop nanoscience and QIS-related research infrastructure and capabilities for materials synthesis, device fabrication, metrology, modeling, and simulation. The goal is to develop a flexible and enabling infrastructure so that U.S. institutions and industry can rapidly develop and commercialize the new discoveries and innovations. Other Project Costs The total project cost (TPC) of DOE's construction projects comprises of two major components: the total estimated cost (TEC) and other project costs (OPC). The TEC includes project costs incurred after Critical Decision-1, such as costs associated with all engineering design and inspection; the acquisition of land and land rights; direct and indirect construction/fabrication; the initial equipment necessary to place the facility or installation in operation; and facility construction costs and other costs specifically related to those construction efforts. OPC represents all other costs related to the projects that are not included in the TEC, such as costs that are incurred during the project's initiation and definitio n phase for planning, conceptual design, research, and development, and those incurred during the execution phase for R&D, startup, and commissioning. OPC is always funded via operating funds. Major Items of Equipment BES supports major item of equipment (MIE) projects to ensure the continual development and upgrade of major scientific instrument capabilities, including fabricating new x-ray and neutron experimental stations, improving NSRC core facilities, additional beamlines for the NSLS II, and providing new stand-alone instruments and capabilities. Research This activity supports targeted basic research in accelerator physics, x-ray and neutron detectors, and development of advanced x-ray optics that is specific to BES facility needs and directions. BES coordinates with the SC Office of Accelerator R&D and Production on crosscutting research and technology areas. Accelerator research is the cornerstone for the development of new technologies that will improve performance of accelerator-based light sources and neutron scattering facilities, in support of the Accelerator Science and Technology Initiative. Research areas include ultrashort pulse free electron lasers (FELs), new seeding techniques and other optical manipulations to reduce the cost and complexity and improve performance of next-generation FELs, and development of intense laser-based terahertz (THz) sources to study non-equilibrium behavior in complex materials. As the complexity of accelerators and the performance requirements continue to grow the need for more dynamic and adaptive control systems becomes essential. Particle accelerators are complicated interconnected machines and ideal for applications of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to improve performance optimization, rapid recovery of fault conditions, and prognostics to anticipate problems. Detector research is a crucial component to enable the optimal utilization of BES user facilities, together with the development of innovative optics instrumentation to advance photon-based sciences, and data management techniques. The emphasis of the detector activity is on research leading to new and more efficient photon and neutron detectors. X-ray optics research involves development of systems for time-resolved x-ray science that preserve the spatial, temporal, and spectral properties of x-rays. Research includes studies on creating, manipulating, transporting, and performing diagnostics of ultrahigh brightness beams and developing ultrafast electron diffraction systems that complement the capabilities of x-ray FELs. This activity also supports training in the field of particle beams and their associated accelerator applications. This activity will support the Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) 110Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationinitiative to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem, such as Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), individuals from groups historically underrepresented in STEM, and students from communities disproportionately affected by social, economic, and health burdens of the energy system, and from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdictions. This activity will also support the BRaVE initiative, which brings DOE laboratories together to tackle problems of pressing national importance, BES research will continue developing and maintaining capabilities at user facilities related to biotechnology for responsiveness to biological threats and development of advanced instrumentation to address these research challenges. 111Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic Energy Sciences Scientific User Facilities (SUF) Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Scientific User Facilities $1,026,707 $1,042,899 +$16,192 X-Ray Light Sources $525,000 $509,425 -$15,575 The funding supports operations at five BES light sources (LCLS, APS, ALS, NSLS-II, and SSRL).The Request will support operations at five BES light sources (LCLS, APS, ALS, NSLS-II, and SSRL).Funding will support LCLS, APS, ALS, NSLS-II and SSRL operations at 90 percent of optimal, the level for normal operations based on FY 2018 baseline.

These user facilities provide the academic, laboratory, and industrial research communities with the tools to fabricate, characterize, and develop new materials and chemical processes to advance basic and applied research, advancing chemistry, physics, earth science, materials science, environmental science, biology, and biomedical science. Regular investments in construction of new user facilities and upgrades to existing user facilities are essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in these research areas. 21-SC-10, Cryomodule Repair & Maintenance Facility (CRMF), SLAC The CRMF project will provide a much needed capability to maintain, repair, and test superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerator components. These components include but are not limited to superconducting RF cavities and cryomodules that make up the new superconducting accelerator being constructed by the LCLS-II and LCLS-II-HE projects, high brightness electron injectors, and superconducting undulators. The facility will provide for the full disassembly and repair of the SRF cryomodule; the ability to disassemble, clean, and reassemble the SRF cavities and cavity string; testing capabilities for the full cryomodule; and separate testing capabilities for individual SRF cavities. To accomplish this, the project is envisioned t o require a 19,000 to 25,000 gross square foot building to contain the necessary equipment. The building will need a concrete shielded enclosure for cryomodule testing, a control room, a vertical test stand area for testing SRF cavities and components, supplied with cryogenic refrigeration and a distribution box which is connected to a source of liquid helium and will distribute liquid helium within the CRMF building, cryomodule fixtures used to insert and remove the cold mass from the cryomodule vacuum vessel, a cleanroom partitioned into class 10 and class 1000 areas, a loading and cryomodule preparation area, storage areas, and a 15 ton bridge crane for moving equipment from one area to another within the building. The project received CD-0, Approve Mission Need, on December 6, 2019, with a current TPC range of $70,000,000-$98,000,000. A combined CD-1/3A is projected for 2Q FY 2023. 19-SC-14, Second Target Station (STS), ORNL The STS project will expand SNS capabilities for neutron scattering research by exploiting part of the higher SNS accelerator proton beam power (2.8 MW) enabled by the PPU project. The STS will be a complementary pulsed source with a narrow proton beam which increases the proton beam power density compared to the first target station (FTS). This dense beam of protons, when deposited on a compact, rotating, water-cooled tungsten target, will create neutrons through spallation and direct them to high efficiency coupled moderators to produce an order of magnitude higher brightness cold neutrons than were previously achievable. By optimizing the design of the instruments with advanced neutron optics, optimized geometry for 15 Hz operation, and advanced detectors, the detection resolution will be up to two orders of magnitude higher, enabling new research opportunities. The project received CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, on November 23, 2020, which established the approved TPC range of $1,800,000,000-$3,000,000,000 and CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline, is Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U), ANL The APS-U project will provide scientists with an x-ray source possessing world-leading transverse coherence and extreme brightness. The magnetic lattice of the APS storage ring will be upgraded to a multi-bend achromat configuration to provide 100-1000 times increased x-ray brightness and coherent flux. At least seven new x-ray beamlines will be installed andseveral existing beamlines will be upgraded to take advantage of the enhanced x-ray properties. APS-U will ensure that theAPS remains a world leader in hard x-ray science. The project received CD-3, Approve Start of Construction, on July 25,2019, with a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $815,000,000 and CD-4, Approve Project Completion, The PPU project will double the proton beam power capability of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) from 1.4 megawatts (MW) to 2.8 MW by fabricating and installing seven new superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cryomodules and supporting RF equipment, upgrade the first target station to accommodate beam power up to 2 MW, and deliver a 2 MW-qualified target. The high voltage converter modulators and klystrons for some of the existing installed RF equipment will 115Science/Basic Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationbe upgraded to handle the higher beam current. The accumulator ring will be upgraded with minor modifications to the injection and extraction areas. The improved target performance at the increased beam power of 2 MW is enabled by the addition of a new gas injection system and a redesigned mercury target vessel. The project received CD-3, Approve Start of Construction, on October 6, 2020, with a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $271,567,000 and CD-4, Approve Project Completion, expected in FY 18-SC-12, Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), LBNL The ALS-U project will upgrade the existing ALS facility by replacing the existing electron storage ring with a new electron storage ring based on a multi-bend achromat lattice design, which will provide a soft x-ray source that is up to 1000 times brighter and with a significantly higher coherent flux fraction. ALS-U will leverage two decades of investments in scientific tools at the ALS by making use of the existing beamlines and infrastructure. ALS-U will ensure that the ALS facility remains a world leader in soft x-ray science. The project received CD-3A, Approve Long Lead Procurements, on December 19, 2019. The project received CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline, on April 2, 2021, with a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $590,000,000 and CD-3, Approve Start of Construction, is expected in 1Q of FY 2023. 18-SC-13, Linac Coherent Light Source-II-High Energy (LCLS-II-HE), SLAC The LCLS-II-HE project will increase the energy of the superconducting linac currently under construction as part of the LCLS-II project from 4 giga-electronvolts (GeV) to 8 GeV and thereby expand the high repetition rate operation (1 million pulses per second) of this unique facility into the hard x-ray regime (5-12 keV). LCLS-II-HE will add new and upgraded instrumentation to augment existing capabilities and upgrade the facility infrastructure as needed. The LCLS-II-HE project will upgrade and expand the capabilities of the LCLS-II to maintain U.S. leadership in ultrafast x-ray science. The project received CD-3A, Approve Long Lead Procurements, on May 12, 2020, with the TPC range of $290,000,000-$480,000,000. Between CD-3A and the current budget process, the TPC estimate has increased to $660,000,000 as a result of a maturing design effort that identified additional costs across the project scope, added scope for a new superconducting electron source, and increased the project's contingency to address several future risks.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Cryomodule Repair and Maintenance Facility (CRMF) project at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is $10,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. This proj ect has a preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range of $70,000,000 to $98,000,000. These co st ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives at this time. The current preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $94,000,000. Significant Changes CRMF was initiated in FY 2021. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-0, Approve Mission Need, approved on December 6, 2019. This Construction Project Data Sheet (CPDS) is an update of the FY 2022 CPDS and does not include a new start for FY 2023. FY 2021 funding launched the alternatives analysis and conceptual design activities required for CD-1. The FY 2022 Request continues the analysis of alternatives and matures the conceptual design with expertise from an architectural and engineering (AE) firm.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The preliminary scope of the CRMF project is to construct a building to support the repair, maintenance, and testing of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerator components. These components may include but are not limited to SRF cavities and cryomodules, future capabilities for high brightness electron injectors, and superconducting undulators. The requirements will be refined as the project matures. The initial concept includes a building with a concrete shielded enclosure for cryomodule testing, a control room, a vertical test stand area for testing SRF cavities and components, supplied with cryogenic refrigeration and a distribution box, cryomodules handling fixtures used to insert and remove the cold mass from the cryomodule vacuum vessel, a cleanroom partitioned into class 10 and class 1000 areas, a loading and cryomodule preparation area, storage areas, and a 15 ton bridge crane for moving equipment from one area to another within the building. The project includes the potential for later installation of a dedicated SRF electron injector development and test area, which requires extending the envisioned building length by 30 feet, a 40 mega-electronvolt (MeV) SRF linac to provide the equipment and diagnostics necessary for an integrated injector test stand, and equipment to refurbish and test the niobium SRF cavities. The project is pre-CD-2; the scope included in the alternative selection and cost range will be refined at CD-1. Justification SC, through the two current BES construction projects, LCLS-II and LCLS-II-HE, is making over a $1,800,000,000 capital investment in an SRF linac at SLAC to support the science mission of DOE. The LCLS-II project is providing a 4 GeV SRF-based linear accelerator capable of providing 1 megahertz (MHz) electron pulses to create a free electron, x-ray laser. This machine contains 35 SRF cryomodules to accelerate the electrons to 4 GeV. The LCLS-II-HE will increase the energy of the LCLS-II linac to 8 GeV by providing an additional 20-23 SRF cryomodules of a similar design to the LCLS-II ones but operating at a higher accelerating gradient. SLAC has partnered with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) to provide the accelerating cryomodules. FNAL and TJNAF produce the cryomodules making use of specialized fabrication, assembly, and test capabilities available there. To make any repairs, the 134Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 21-SC-10, Cryomodule Budget Justificationfacilities must currently send the cryomodules back to either FNAL or TJNAF at an increased risk of damage, cost, and schedule delays. The initial assumption was that cryomodules could be shipped back to the partner laboratories as needed for maintenance at a rate of 1 to 2 cryomodules per year. However, during construction of the LCLS-II facility it was determined that cryomodules could be damaged during transportation; transportation of cryomodules for repairs during operations would pose a risk to reliable facility operations. This approach also assumed that either FNAL or TJNAF would have the maintenance capabilities available when needed. At this time, the two partner laboratories have informed SLAC that they will need 6 to 12 months of advance notice to schedule maintenance or repairs to the SLAC hardware. The proposed CRMF is designed to meet these challenges and will provide the capability to repair, maintain, and test SRF accelerator components, primarily the SRF cryomodules that make up the new superconducting accelerator being constructed by the LCLS-II and LCLS-II-HE construction projects. The facility will provide for the full disassembly and repair of the SRF cryomodule; the ability to disassemble, clean, and reassemble the SRF cavities and cavity string; testing capabilities for the full cryomodule; and separate testing capabilities for individual SRF cavities. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2. At CD-2 approval, the KPPs will be baselined. The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the desired project performance. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Project Completion.

Costs for acceptance testing, integrated testing, and initial commissioning to demonstrate achievement of the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are included in the STS scope. The STS will be located in unoccupied space east of the existing First Target Station (FTS). The project requires approximately 350,000 ft 2 of new buildings, making conventional facility construction a major contributor to project costs. Justification The Basic Energy Sciences (BES) mission is to \"support fundamental research to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment, and national security.\" BES accomplishes its mission in part by operation of large-scale user facilities consisting of a complementary set of intense x-rays sources, neutron scattering centers, electron beam characterization capabilities, and research centers for nanoscale science. 142Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 19-SC-14, Second Target Station (STS), ORNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationIn the area of neutron science, the scientific community conducted numerous studies since the 1970's that have established the scientific justification and need for a very high-intensity pulsed neutron source in the U.S. Since 2007, when it began its user program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the SNS has been fulfilling this need. In accordance with the 1996 Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) (Russell Panel) Report recommendation, SNS has many technical margins built into its systems to facilitate a power upgrade into the 2-4 megawatt (MW) range to maintain its position of scientific leadership in the future. An upgraded SNS would enable many advances in the opportunities described in the 2015 BESAC report \"Challenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy: Transformative Opportunities for Discovery Science.\" ORNL held four workshops to assess the neutron scattering needs in quantum condensed matter, soft matter, biology, and the frontiers in materials discovery. These four areas encompass and directly map to the transformative opportunities identified in the BES Grand Challenges update. Quantum materials map most directly to harnessing coherence in light and matter, while soft matter and biology are aligned primarily with mastering hierarchical architectures and beyond-equilibrium matter, and frontiers in materials discovery explored many of the topics in beyond ideal materials and systems: understanding the critical roles of heterogeneity, interfaces, and disorder. As an example, while neutrons already play an important role in the areas of biology and soft matter, step change improvements in capability will be required to make full use of the unique properties of neutrons to meet challenges in mastering hierarchical architectures and beyond-equilibrium matter and understanding the critical roles of heterogeneity and interfaces. The uniform conclusion from all workshops was that in the areas of science covered, neutrons play a unique and pivotal role in understanding structure and dynamics in materials required to develop future technologies. The STS will feature a proton beam that is highly concentrated to produce a very high-density beam of protons that strikes a rotating solid tungsten target. The produced neutron beam illuminates moderators located above and below the target that will feed up to 22 experimental beamlines (eight within the STS project scope) with neutron beams conditioned for specific instruments. The small-volume cold neutron moderator system is geometrically optimized to deliver higher peak brightness neutrons. The SNS Proton Power Upgrade (PPU) project, requested separately, will double the power of the SNS accelerator complex to 2.8 MW so that STS can use one out of every four proton pulses to produce cold neutron beams with the highest peak brightness of any current or projected neutron sources. The high-brightness pulsed source optimized for cold neutron production will operate at 15 Hz (as compared to FTS, which currently operates at 60 Hz, but will operate at 45 pulses/second when STS is operating) to provide the large time-of-flight intervals corresponding to the broad time and length scales required to characterize complex materials. The project will provide a series of kicker magnets to divert every fourth proton pulse away from the FTS to a new line feeding the STS. Additional magnets will further deflect the beam into the transport line to the new target. A final set of quadrupole magnets will tailor the proton beam shape and distribution to match the compact source design. An initial set of eight best-in-class instruments, developed with input from the user community, are largely built on known and demonstrated technologies but will need some research and development to deliver unprecedented levels of performance. Advanced neutron optics designs are needed for high alignment and stability requirements. The lower repetition rate of STS pushes the chopper design to larger diameter rotating elements with tighter limits on allowed mechanical vibration. The higher peak neutron production of STS will put a greater demand on neutron detector technology. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . 143Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 19-SC-14, Second Target Station (STS), ORNL 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2.

Acquisition Approach Based on the DOE determination at CD-1, ORNL is acquiring the STS project under the existing DOE Management and Operations (M&O) contract. The M&O contractor prepared a Conceptual Design Report for the STS project and identified key design activities, requirements, and high-risk subsystem components to reduce cost and schedule risk to the project and expedite the startup. The necessary project management systems are fully up to date, operating, and are maintained as an ORNL-wide resource. ORNL will design and procure the key technical subsystem components. Some technical system designs will require research and development activities. Preliminary cost estimates for most of these systems are based on operating experience of SNS and vendor estimates, while some first-of-a-kind systems are based on expert judgement. Vendors and/or partner labs with the necessary capabilities will fabricate the technical equipment. ORNL will competitively bid and award all subcontracts based on best value to the government. The M&O contractor's performance will be evaluated through the annual laboratory performance appraisal process. Lessons learned from other Office of Science projects and other similar facilities are being exploited fully in planning and executing STS. 149Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-10, Advanced Photon Source Justification18-SC-10, Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U), ANL Argonne National Laboratory Project is for Design and Construction 1. Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Advanced Photon Source-Upgrade (APS-U) project is $9,200,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding and $5,000,000 of Other Project Costs (OPC) funding. The project has a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $815,000,000. Significant Changes The APS-U became a line item project in FY 2018. The most recent approved DOE Order 413.3B critical decision is CD-3, Approve Start of Construction , which was approved on July 25, 2019. CD-4, Approve Project Completion , is projected for 2Q FY 2026. This Construction Project Data Sheet (CPDS) is an update of the FY 2022 CPDS and does not include a new start for FY 2023. There are no significant changes. FY 2021 funding enabled the advancement of the storage ring and experimental facilities final design, engineering, prototyping, testing, fabrication, procurement of baseline and spare hardware, integration, and installation, and enabled site preparation and civil construction activities for the Long Beamline Building (LBB). The project received and inspected hardware for the storage ring and experimental facilities and advanced the integrated magnet module assembly. FY 2022 funding emphasizes fabrication, procurement, acceptance testing, integration and assembly, and preparing all items for installation in FY 2023. Civil construction for the LBB and final design will be completed. The FY 2023 Request activities emphasize system integration, testing, and assembly in preparation for the storage ring removal and installation during the experimental dark time, tentatively scheduled to begin in April 2023. To date, the project encountered delays in its progress and has required use of both cost and schedule contingency. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect personnel, cause supply chain delays in deliveries, and increase costs for procurements/subcontracts. The project and program are carefully monitoring progress and contingency, with options under active evaluation in the event of unacceptable costs/schedule impacts. A Federal Project Director, certified to Level IV, has been assigned to this project and has approved this CPDS. 151Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-10, Advanced 2023 JustificationCritical Mission Need for a construction project with a conceptual scope and cost range Conceptual Design Complete - Actual date the conceptual design was completed (if applicable) CD-1 - Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range CD-2 - Approve Performance Baseline Final Design Complete - Estimated/Actual date the project design will be/was complete(d) CD-3 - Approve Start of Construction D&D Complete - Completion of D&D work CD-4 - Approve Start of Operations or Project Fiscal (RIXS) beamline.

The project's scope includes a new very low emittance multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice storage ring in the existing tunnel, new permanent magnet and superconducting insertion devices optimized for brightness and flux, new or upgraded front-ends, and any required modifications to the linac, booster, and radiofrequency systems. The project will also construct new beamlines and incorporate substantial refurbishment of existing beamlines, along with new optics and detectors that will enable the beamlines to take advantage of the improved accelerator performance. Two best-in-class beamlines require conventional civil construction to extend the beamlines beyond the existing APS Experimental Hall to achieve the desired nano-focused beam spot size. Justification The BES mission is to \"support fundamental research to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment, and national security.\" APS-U will provide the nation's researchers with a world-class scientific user facility for mission-focused research and advanced scientific discovery. Worldwide investments in accelerator-based x-ray light source user facilities threaten U.S. leadership in high energy, hard x- ray light source technology. The six giga-electronvolt (GeV), very low emittance European Synchrotron Radiation Facility-Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) in France came on line in 2020; China initiated construction of the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) in Beijing, a six GeV hard x-ray synchrotron light source, planned to come on line in 2026; the six GeV PETRA-IV extremely low emittance storage ring at DESY in Hamburg, and SPring-8-II in Japan are well into campaigns of major upgrades of beamlines and are also incorporating technological advancements in accelerator science to enhance performance for hard x-ray energies (>20 keV). The APS upgrade will provide a world-class hard x-ray synchrotron radiation facility, with up to 500 times increased brightness and coherent flux over the current APS and will be a unique asset in the U.S. portfolio of scientific user facilitie s. The APS-U is a critical and cost-effective next step in the photon science strategy that will keep the U.S. at the forefront of scientific research, combining with other facilities to give the U.S. a complementary set of storage ring and free-electron laser x-ray light sources. 153Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-10, Advanced Budget JustificationThe high-brightness, high-energy penetrating hard x-rays will provide a unique scientific capability directly relevant to probing real-world materials and applications in energy, the environment, new and improved materials, and biological studies. The APS upgrade will ensure that the APS remains a world leader in hard x-ray science.

Acquisition Approach ANL is acquiring the APS-U project under the existing DOE Management and Operations (M&O) contract between DOE and UChicago Argonne, LLC. The acquisition of equipment and systems for large research facilities is within the scope of the DOE contract for the management and operations of ANL and consistent with the general expectation of the responsibilities of DOE M&O contractors. ANL has prime responsibility for oversight of all contracts required to execute this project, which will include managing the design and construction of the APS-U accelerator incorporating an MBA magnet lattice, insertion devices, front ends, beamlines/experimental stations, and any required modifications to the linac, booster, and radiofrequency systems. ANL has established an APS-U project organization with project management, procurement management, and Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H) management with staff qualified to specify, select and oversee procurement and installation of the accelerator and beamline components and other technical equipment. ANL is procuring these items through competitive bids based on a 'best value' basis from a variety of sources, depending on the item, and following all applicable ANL procurement requirements. The APS-U project is using the design-bid-fabricate method. This proven approach provides the project with direct control over the accelerator components and beamline design, equipment specification and selection, and all contractors. The M&O contractor's performance is evaluated through the annual laboratory performance appraisal process. 160Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-11, Spallation Neutron Source Neutron Source Proton Power Upgrade (PPU), ORNL Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee Project is for Design and Construction 1.

The Total Project Cost (TPC) is $271,567,000. Significant Changes PPU was initiated in FY 2018. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is a combined CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline and CD-3, Approve Start of Construction, approved on October 6, 2020. CD-4, Approve Project Completion, is anticipated in 4Q FY 2028. This Construction Project Data Sheet (CPDS) is an update of the FY 2022 CPDS and does not include a new start for FY 2023. In FY 2021, the project continued R&D, engineering, prototyping, preliminary and final design, testing, fabrication, procurement of baseline and spare hardware, and component integration and installation and civil construction, focusing on initial target procurement, initial cryomodule production, and continued RF equipment procurement, and initiated equipment installation in the klystron gallery.

Justification The Basic Energy Sciences (BES) mission is to \"support fundamental research to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment, and national security.\" BES accomplishes its mission in part by operating large-scale user facilities consisting of a complementary set of intense x-ray sources, neutron scattering centers, electron beam characterization capabilities, and research centers for nanoscale science. In the area of neutron science, numerous studies by the scientific community since the 1970s have established the scientific justification and need for a very high-intensity pulsed neutron source in the U.S. The SNS, which began its user program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2007, currently fulfills the need. The SNS was designed to be upgradeable so as to maintain its position of scientific leadership in the future, in accordance with the 1996 Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) (Russell Panel) Report recommendation, and many technical margins were built into the SNS systems to facilitate a power upgrade into the 2 - 4 MW range with the ability to extract some of that power to a second target station. An upgraded SNS will enable many advances in the opportunities described in the 2015 BESAC report \"Challenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy: Transformative Opportunities for Discovery Science.\" Four workshops were held by ORNL to assess the neutron scattering needs in quantum condensed matter, soft matter, biology, and the frontiers in materials discovery. These four areas encompass and directly map to the transformative opportunities identified in the BES Grand Challenges update. Quantum materials map most directly to harnessing coherence in light and matter, while soft matter 162Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-11, Spallation Neutron Source ORNL 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationand biology align primarily with mastering hierarchical architectures and beyond-equilibrium matter, and frontiers in materials discovery explored many of the topics in beyond ideal materials and systems: understanding the critical roles of heterogeneity, interfaces, and disorder.

Acquisition Approach Based on the DOE determination at CD-1, the PPU project is being acquired by ORNL under the existing DOE Management and Operations (M&O) contract. The M&O contractor has completed a Conceptual Design Report for the PPU project and identified key design activities, requirements, and high-risk subsystem components to reduce cost and schedule risk to the project and expedite the startup. The necessary project management systems are fully up-to-date, operating, and are maintained as an ORNL-wide resource. ORNL is partnering with other laboratories for design and procurement of key technical subsystem components. Some technical system designs will require research and development activities. Cost estimates for these systems are based on operating experience of SNS and vendor quotes. ORNL, partner laboratory staff, and/or vendors will complete the design of the technical systems. Vendors and/or partner labs with the necessary capabilities will fabricate technical equipment. All subcontracts will be competitively bid and awarded based on best value to the government. Lessons learned from other Office of Science projects and other similar facilities have been sought and are being applied as appropriate in planning and executing PPU. The M&O contractor's performance will be evaluated through the annual laboratory performance appraisal process. 168Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-12, Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), LBNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification18-SC-12, Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), LBNL Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Project is for Design and Construction 1. Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U) project is $135,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The project has a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $590,000,000. Significant Changes The ALS-U was initiated in FY 2018. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline, approved on April 2, 2021. This Construction Project Data Sheet (CPDS) is an update of the FY 2022 CPDS and does not include a new start for FY 2023. FY 2021 funding continued support of planning, engineering, design, R&D, prototyping activities, and long-lead procurements. FY 2022 funding continues support of planning, engineering, design, R&D, prototyping, and procurements of both long-lead components for the accumulator ring installation as well as start of major procurements for the storage ring systems and components. In addition, FY 2022 funding will support advancing the design for the radiation shielding and required seismic upgrades. FY 2023 funding will continue support of planning, engineering, design, R&D, prototyping, testing, and procurements with an emphasis on accumulator, beamline, insertion device, and storage ring procurements and continue installation of the accumulator ring in the ALS tunnel. As final design and long-lead time procurements progress, COVID-19 impacts have required use of both cost and schedule contingency. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect personnel, cause supply chain delays in deliveries, and increase costs for staff/procurements/subcontracts. The project and program are carefully monitoring progress, cost estimates, and contingency, with options under active evaluation in the event of unacceptable cost/schedule impacts.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The ALS-U project will upgrade the existing ALS facility by replacing the existing electron storage ring with a new electron storage ring based on a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice design to provide a soft x-ray source that is orders of magnitude brighter\u2014a 10-1000 times increase in brightness over the current ALS\u2014and to provide a significantly higher fraction of coherent light in the soft x-ray region (approximately 50-2,000 electronvolts [eV]) than is currently available at ALS. The project will replace the existing triple-bend achromat storage ring with a new, high-performance storage ring based on a nine-bend achromat design. In addition, the project will add a low-emittance, full-energy accumulator ring to the existing tunnel inner shield wall to enable on- and off-axis, swap-out injection and extraction into and from the new storage ring using fast kicker magnets. The new source will require upgrading x-ray optics on existing beamlines with some beamlines being realigned or relocated. The project adds two new undulator beamlines that are optimized for the novel science made possible by the beam's new high coherent flux. The project intends to reuse the existing building, utilities, electron gun, linac, and booster synchrotron equipment currently at ALS. Prior to CD-2, the scope was increased to include radiation shielding and safety-mandated seismic structural upgrades to the ALS facility. With an aggressive accelerator design, ALS-U will provide the highest coherent flux of any existing or planned storage ring facility worldwide, up to a photon energy of about 3.5 keV. This range covers the entire soft x-ray regime. Justification At this time, our ability to observe and understand materials and material phenomena in real-time and as they emerge and evolve is limited. Soft x-rays (approximately 50 to 2,000 eV) are ideally suited for revealing the chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of materials, as well as the chemical reactions that underpin these properties. This knowledge is crucial for the design and control of new advanced materials that address the challenges of new energy technologies. 170Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-12, Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), LBNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationExisting storage ring light sources lack a key attribute that would revolutionize x-ray science: stable, nearly continuous soft x-rays with high brightness and high coherent flux\u2014that is, smooth, well organized soft x-ray wave fronts. Such a stable,high brightness, high coherent flux source would enable 3D imaging with nanometer resolution and the measurement ofspontaneous nanoscale motion with nanosecond resolution\u2014all with electronic structure sensitivity. Currently, BES operates advanced ring-based light sources that produce soft x-rays. The NSLS-II, commissioned in 2015, is the brightest soft x-ray source in the U.S. The ALS, completed in 1993, is competitive with NSLS-II for x-rays below 200 eV but not above that. NSLS-II is somewhat lower in brightness than the new Swedish light source, MAX-IV, which began user operations in 2017 and represents the first use of a MBA lattice design in a light source facility. Neither NSLS-II nor ALS make use of the newer MBA lattice design. Switzerland's SLS-2 (an MBA-based design in the planning stage) will be a brighter soft x-ray light source than both NSLS-II and MAX-IV when it is built and brought into operation. These international light sources, and those that follow, will present a significant challenge to the U.S. light source community to provide competitive x-ray sources to domestic users. Neither NSLS-II nor ALS soft x-ray light sources possess sufficient brightness or coherent flux to provide the capability to meet the mission need in their current configurations. BES is currently supporting two major light source upgrade projects, the APS-U and LCLS-II. These two projects will upgrade existing x-ray facilities in the U.S. and will provide significant increases in brightness and coherent flux. These upgrades wi ll not address the specific research needs that demand stable, nearly continuous soft x-rays with high brightness and high coherence. APS-U, which is under construction at ANL, will deploy the MBA lattice design optimized for its higher 6 GeV electron energy and to produce higher energy (hard) x-rays in the range of 10-100 keV. Because the ring will be optimized for high energy, the soft x-ray light it produces will not be sufficiently bright to meet the research needs described above. LCLS-II, which is under construction at SLAC, is a high repetition rate (up to 1 MHz) free electron laser (FEL) designed to produce high brightness, coherent x-rays, but in extremely short bursts rather than as a nearly continuous beam. Storage rings offer higher stability than FELs. In addition, there is a need for a facility that can support a larger number of concurr ent experiments than is possible with LCLS-II in its current configuration. This is critical for serving the large and expanding so ft x-ray research community. LCLS-II will not meet this mission need. The existing ALS is a 1.9 GeV storage ring operating at 500 milliamps (mA) of beam current. It is optimized to produce intense beams of soft x-rays, which offer spectroscopic contrast, nanometer-scale resolution, and broad temporal sensitivity. The ALS facility includes an accelerator complex and photon delivery system that are capable of providing the foundations for an upgrade that will achieve world-leading soft x-ray coherent flux. The existing ALS provides a ready-made foundation, including conventional facilities, a $500,000,000 scientific infrastructure investment and a vibrant user community of over 2,500 users per year already attuned to the potential scientific opportunities an upgrade offers. The facility also includes extensive (up to 40) simultaneously operating beamlines and instrumentation, an experimental hall, computing resources, ancillary laboratories, offices, and related infrastructure that will be heavily utilized in an upgrade scenario. Furthermore, the upgrade leverages the ALS staff, who are experts in the scientific and technical aspects of the proposed upgrade. In summary, the capabilities at our existing x-ray light source facilities are insufficient to develop the next generation of tools that combine high resolution spatial imaging together with precise energy resolving spectroscopic techniques in the soft x-ray range. To enable these cutting edge experimental techniques, it is necessary to possess an ultra-bright source of soft x-ray light that generates the high coherent x-ray flux required to resolve nanometer-scale features and interactions, and to allow the real-time observation and understanding of materials and phenomena as they emerge and evolve. Developing such a light source will ensure the U.S. has the tools to maintain its leadership in soft x-ray science and will significantly accelerate the advancement of the fundamental sciences that underlie a broad range of emerging and future energy applications. 171Science/Basic Energy Sciences/ 18-SC-12, Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U), LBNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Linac Coherent Light Source-II High Energy (LCLS-II-HE) project is $90,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding and $4,000,000 of Other Projec t Costs (OPC) funding. This project at CD-1 established a preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range of $290,000,000 to $480,000,000. This cost range encompassed the most feasible preliminary alternatives at CD-1. Pending CD-2 reviews, the project's TPC estimate is likely to exceed the current level of $660,000,000, and could approach $710,000,000 when COVID-driven cost and schedule increases are included. Significant Changes The LCLS-II-HE project was initiated in FY 2019. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-3A, Approve Long-Lead Procurements, which was approved on May 12, 2020. The LCLS-II-HE project is continuing to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the project's cost, schedule, and project milestones.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The LCLS-II-HE project's scope includes increasing the superconducting linac energy from 4 giga-electronvolts (GeV) to 8 GeV by installing additional cryomodules in the first kilometer of the existing linac tunnel. The electron beam, generated by a superconducting electron source, will be transported to the existing undulator hall to extend the x-ray energy to 12 keV and beyond. The project will also modify or upgrade existing infrastructure and x-ray transport, optics, and diagnostics system, and provide new or upgraded instrumentation to augment existing and planned capabilities. Additional scope is being considered to address several risks associated with the linac performance, operation reliability and scientific mission capability. Justification The leadership position of LCLS-II will be challenged by the European x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) at DESY in Hamburg, Germany, which began operations in 2017. The European XFEL has a higher electron energy, which allows production of shorter (i.e., harder) x-ray wavelength pulses compared to LCLS-II. More recent plans emerging from DESY have revealed how the European XFEL could be extended from a pulsed operation mode to continuous operation, which would create a profound capability gap compared to LCLS-II. The continuous operation improves the stability of the electron beam and provides uniformly spaced pulses of x-rays or, if desired, the ability to customize the sequence of x-ray pulses provided to experiments to optimize the measurements being made. In the face of this challenge to U.S. scientific leadership, extending the energy reach of x-rays beyond the upper limit of LCLS-II (5 keV) is a high priority. 12 keV x-rays correspond to an x-ray wavelength of approximately 1 \u00c5ngstrom, which is particularly important for high resolution structural determination experiments since this is the characteristic distance between bound atoms in matter. Expanding the photon energy range beyond 5 keV will allow U.S. researchers to probe earth-abundant elements that will be needed for large-scale deployment of photo-catalysts for electricity and fuel 180Science/Basic FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationproduction; it allows the study of strong spin-orbit coupling that underpins many aspects of quantum materials; and it reaches the biologically important selenium k-edge, used for protein crystallography. There is also a limited ability to observe and understand the structural dynamics of complex matter at the atomic scale with hard x-rays, at ultrafast time scales, and in operational environments. Overcoming this capability gap is crucial for the design, control and understanding of new advanced materials necessary to develop new energy technologies. To achieve this objective, the Department needs a hard x-ray source capable of producing high energy ultrafast bursts, with full spatial and temporal coherence, at high repetition rates. Possession of a hard x-ray source with a photon energy range from 5- 12 keV and beyond would enable spectroscopic analysis of additional key elements in the periodic table, deeper penetration into materials, and enhanced resolution. This capability cannot be provided by any existing or planned light source. The LCLS-II project at SLAC, which is currently under construction and will begin operations in 2022-2024 is the first step to address this capability gap. LCLS-II will be the premier XFEL facility in the world at energies ranging from 200 eV up to approximately 5 keV. The cryomodule technology that underpins LCLS-II is a major advance from prior designs that will allow continuous operation up to 1 megahertz (MHz). When completed, LCLS-II will be powered by SLAC's 4 GeV superconducting electron linear accelerator (linac). Over the past years, the cryomodule design for LCLS-II has performed beyond expectations, providing the technical basis to double the electron beam energy. It is therefore conceivable to add additional acceleration capacity at SLAC to double the electron beam energy from 4 GeV to 8 GeV. Calculations indicate that an 8 GeV linac will deliver a hard x-ray photon beam with peak energy of 12.8 keV, which will meet the mission need. The LCLS-II-HE project will upgrade the LCLS-II to fully address the capability gaps and maintain U.S. leadership in XFEL science. The upgrade will provide world leading experimental capabilities for the U.S. research community by extending the x-ray energy of LCLS-II from 5 keV to 12 keV and beyond. The flexibility and detailed pulse structure associated with theproposed LCLS-II-HE facility will not be matched by other facilities under development worldwide. Based on the factors described above, the most effective and timely approach for DOE to meet the Mission Need and realize the full potential of the facility is by upgrading the LCLS-II, currently under construction at SLAC, by increasing the energy of the superconducting accelerator and upgrading the existing infrastructure and instrumentation. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . 181Science/Basic Energy Congressional Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2.

D&D Information At this stage of project planning and development, SC anticipates that there will be no new area being constructed in the construction project. 8. Acquisition ApproachBased on the DOE determination at CD-1, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is acquiring the LCLS-II-HE project under the existing DOE Management and Operations (M&O) contract. SLAC has completed a Conceptual Design Report for the LCLS-II-HE project and is in the preliminary design phase, identifying requirements and high-risk subsystem components to reduce cost and schedule risk to the project and expedite the startup. The necessary project management systems are fully operating and are maintained as a SLAC-wide resource. SLAC is partnering with other laboratories for design and procurement of key technical subsystem components. Technical system designs require research and development activities. Preliminary cost estimates for these systems are based on actual costs from LCLS-II and other similar facilities, to the extent practicable. The M&O contractor is fully exploiting recen t cost data in planning and budgeting for the project. SLAC or partner laboratory staff will complete the design of the technical systems. SLAC or subcontracted vendors with the necessary capabilities will fabricate the technical equipment. All subcontracts will be competitively bid and awarded based on best value to the government. The M&O contractor's performance will be evaluated through the annual laboratory performance appraisal process. Lessons learned from the LCLS-II project and other similar facilities are exploited fully in planning and executing LCLS-II-HE. 187Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBiological and Environmental Research Overview The mission of the Biological and Environmental Research (BER) program is to support transformative science and scientific user facilities to achieve a predictive understanding of complex biological, Earth, and environmental systems for clean energy and climate innovation. This fundamental research, conducted at universities, DOE national laboratories, and research institutions across the country, explores organisms and ecosystems that can influence the U.S. energy system and advances understanding of the relationships between energy and environment from local to global scales, including a focus on climate change modeling. BER's support of basic research will contribute to a future of stable, reliable, and resilient energy sources and infrastructures that will contribute to evidence-based climate solutions with a focus on environmental justice. Research within BER can be categorized into biological systems and Earth and environmental systems. Biological systems research seeks to characterize and predictively understand microbial and plant systems using genomic science, computational analyses (including Artificial Intelligence [AI] and Machine Learning [ML]), and experimental approaches. Foundational knowledge of the structure and function of these systems underpins the ability to leverage natural processes for clean energy production, including the sustainable development of biofuels and other bioproducts, as well as natural carbon sequestration capabilities. Characterization of microbial communities will lead to understanding the impacts of how vulnerable environments will respond to climate change. Earth and environmental systems research seek to characterize and understand the feedback between Earth and energy systems, which includes studies on atmospheric physics and chemistry, ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry, and development and validation of Earth system models extending from regional to global scales. These models integrate information on the biosphere, atmosphere, terrestrial land masses, oceans, sea ice, subsurface, and human components. To promote world-class research in these areas, BER supports user facilities that enable observation and measurement of atmospheric, biological, and biogeochemical processes using the latest technologies. All BER activities are informed by community and the federally chartered BER Advisory Committee engagement. Over the last three decades, BER's scientific impact has been transformative. Mapping the human genome through the U.S. supported international Human Genome Project that DOE initiated in 1990 ushered in a new era of modern biotechnology and genomics-based systems biology. Today, researchers in the BER Genomic Sciences activity and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), as well as in the four DOE Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs), are using the powerful tools of plant and microbial systems biology to pursue the innovative early-stage research that will lead to the development of future transformative bio-based products and clean energy technologies to underpin a burgeoning bioeconomy. Since the 1950s, BER and its predecessor organizations have been critical contributors to the fundamental scientific understanding of climate change and the atmospheric, land, ocean, and environmental systems in which life exists. The earliest work included atmospheric and ocean circulation studies initiated to understand the effects of fallout from nuclear explosions in the early period of the Cold War. These efforts were the forerunners of the modern climate and Earth System models that are in use today. Presently, BER research contributes to reducing the greatest uncertainties in model predictions, e.g., involving clouds and aerosols. In the last decade, DOE research has made considerable advances in increasing the reliability and predictive capabilities of these models using applied mathematics, access to DOE's fastest computers, and systematic comparisons with observational data to improve confidence in model predictions. BER-supported research has also produced the software and algorithms that enable the productive application of models that span genomics, systems biology, environmental, and Earth system science. These mission-driven models that are run on DOE's fastest supercomputers, are game-changing and among the most capable in the world. For example, BER's models of biological and environmental processes are exploring the systems level complexity of genomics, protein structures, and microbial dynamics that will serve the basis of future bioenergy sources. BER's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) provide the necessary information to achieve these goals. Model developments in climate and Earth system science are shifting to ultra-high resolution to better represent the processes that limit prediction uncertainty, e.g., in the most climate-sensitive regions. Cloud-aerosol data provided by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility (ARM) as well as environmental data provided by BER's long term observatories are necessary in developing, testing, and validating climate and Earth systems. 189Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHighlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request for BER is $903.7 million.

Total, Biological and Environmental Research +$150,685 195Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic and Applied R&D Coordination BER research underpins the needs of DOE's energy and environmental missions and is coordinated through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). This includes all biological, Earth and environmental systems modeling, renewable energy, and field experiments involving atmospheric, ecological, and hydro-biogeochemical sciences research. Basic research on microbes and plants provides fundamental knowledge that can be used to develop new bioenergy crops and improved biofuel and bioproduct production processes that enable a more sustainable bioeconomy. Coordination with other federal agencies on priority bioeconomy science needs, occurs through the Biomass Research and Development Board, a Congressionally mandated interagency group created by the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Agricultural Act of 2014. In general, BER coordinates with DOE's energy technology programs through regular joint program manager meetings, by participating in their internal program reviews and in joint principal investigator meetings, as well as conducting joint technical workshops. BER supports some interagency projects to manage databases (such as the Protein Data Bank) through interagency awards and funding for complementary community resources (such as beamlines and cryo-electron microscopy), mostly with NIH and NSF. BER also serves on a government advisory committee for DoD's latest Manufacturing Innovation Institute, the BioMADE project researching synthetic biology applications. All Earth systems research activities are specifically coordinated through the interagency U.S. Global Change Research Program and other NSTC subcommittees. For example, the DOE E3SM has evolved to become the world's highest resolution Earth system model, that in turn serves as an integrating platform for the scientific community to develop and test system-level scientific concepts. The new version will add advanced capabilities for exploring cryosphere-ocean dynamics' impacts of climate variability, continental ice sheet evolution and sea level rise, and the effects of changing water cycles on watershed and coastal hydrological systems. Other agencies, e.g., NOAA, NASA, the Navy, and NSF, are following developments in E3SM via the Interagency Council for Advancing Meteorological Services (ICAMS). The ICAMS is co-led by OSTP and NOAA with DOE as a member. The Intelligence Community has indicated significant interest in E3SM, as a platform to incorporate their data to address national security problems. The E3SM research is tightly coordinated with BER's large scale experimental activities and has strong linkages to DOE applied programs and DOE Office of Policy. Program Accomplishments Biological Systems Science conducts fundamental genomic science on plants and microorganisms across a broad range of biological applications including biosystems design and environmental research. The portfolio also includes the development of enabling computational, analytical, and bioimaging capabilities for hypothesis-based experimental research. New biosystems design research led to the development of the iPROBE system, a cell-free machine learning-informed framework for testing multiple biosynthetic pathways in rapid fashion. The system was used to accelerate the design of an optimized metabolic pathway for 3-hydroxybutryate production in Clostridium species. This new approach reduced the time needed to develop engineered strains from months to weeks and could be used to optimize pathways for a range of other compounds including biofuels and bioproducts. New microbiome research conducted as part of a 6-year prairie soil warming experiment in central Oklahoma led to the observation that soil microbial community networks grew larger, more complex, and more stable over time, providing insight into the effect of soil warming on soil microbial communities as a proxy for understanding effects under warmer climate scenarios. New multi-modal bioimaging capabilities integrating four different types of spatial and chemical measurement techniques were developed to image cells on pollen grains. The results show the importance of a multimodal approach to microscopy to image processes within complex biosystems. 196Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBioenergy Research Centers are focused on research to fill basic science knowledge gaps for the commercial production of biofuels and bioproducts, including sustainable production of biomass, plant feedstock development, and biomass deconstruction and conversion. Notable accomplishments include:\u0003 The Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproduct Innovation (CABBI) engineered grasses to hyper-accumulate tri- acylglyerides (TAGs), oils that can be easily transformed to biodiesel and other specialty lubricants and compounds. \u0003 At the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), over expression of a metabolic gene (QsuB) resulted in the over production of protocatechuate (PCA) in sorghum, an aromatic precursor to biofuel compounds and a range of other chemicals. Theresult is another step towards crops engineered to produce specific fuels and chemicals. \u0003 The Center for Bioenergy Innovation (CBI) demonstrated the production of C-lignin in plants, an alternate lignin form found in seed coats. The finding is important as a potential tool to alter lignin composition in bioenergy crops toimprove biofuel production. \u0003 The Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) developed modified plants to over produce terpenoid compounds. These versatile molecules can be further converted to flavors, scents, and other commodity chemicals normallyproduced from petroleum. Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences conducts research to improve the predictability of the Earth system at different scales, with particular focus on the interdependencies of the physical, biogeochemical, and human processes that govern variability, change, and the evolution of extreme climate events.An analysis and comparison of tropical cyclone observations and computer simulations in the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) showed that improvements in high resolution model biases can alleviate errors in tropical cyclone simulations and improve predictability in Earth system models. In linking regional modeling to Earth system modeling efforts, perennial bioenergy crops were incorporated into the global Community Terrestrial System Model for the first time, enabling simulation and understanding of feedbacks among bioenergy crops and Earth system processes at local, regional, and global scales. Atmospheric researchers studied aerosols in a cloud chamber under varied water vapor concentrations and found that turbulent fluctuations led to cloud formation at much lower relative humidity levels than which occur under average steady state conditions, potentially leading to new parameterizations for Earth system models. Ecologists conducting a field warming and elevated CO 2 experiment in a high-latitude forest found increased fine-root growth, particularly in shrub vegetation, highlighting a mechanism that enables shrubs to rapidly adapt to warmer and drier conditions.

Systems biology is the multidisciplinary study of complex interactions specifying the function of entire biological systems\u2014from single cells to multicellular organisms\u2014rather than the study of individual isolated components. The Biological Systems Science subprogram employs systems biology approaches from a genome-based perspective to define the functional principles that drive living systems, from microbes and microbial communities to plants and other whole organisms and microbiomes. The research will pursue the fundamental science needed to understand, predict, manipulate, and design biological systems that underpin innovations for clean energy production and biotechnology and enhance our understanding of natural, DOE-relevant environmental processes needed to promote social equity and enhance response to the climate crisis. Key questions that drive these studies include: \u0003 What information is encoded in the genome sequence and how does this information explain the functional characteristics of cells, organisms, and whole biological systems? \u0003 How do interactions among cells regulate the functional behavior of living systems and how can those interactions be understood dynamically and predictively? \u0003 How do plants, microbes, and communities of organisms adapt and respond to changing environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, water and nutrient availability, and ecological interactions), and how can their behavior bemanipulated toward desired outcomes? \u0003 What organizing biological principles need to be understood to facilitate the design and engineering of new biological systems for beneficial purposes? The subprogram builds upon a successful track record in defining and tackling bold, complex scientific problems in genomics. These problems require the development of large tools and infrastructure; strong collaboration with the computational sciences community; and the mobilization of multidisciplinary teams focused on plant and microbial bioenergy and bioeconomy-related research. The subprogram employs genome sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, structural biology, high-resolution imaging and characterization, and integration of information on open access computational platforms into models that can be iteratively tested and validated to advance a predictive understanding of biological systems. The subprogram supports the operation of the DOE Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs) and the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) scientific user facility. Genomic Science The Genomic Science activity supports research seeking to reveal the fundamental principles that drive biological systems relevant to DOE missions in clean energy and climate resilience. These principles guide the interpretation of the genetic code into functional proteins, biomolecular complexes, metabolic pathways, and the metabolic/regulatory networks underlying the systems biology of plants, microbes, and communities. Advancing fundamental knowledge of these systems in concert with integrative, collaborative, and open access computational platforms will accelerate biological research for solutions to clean energy production, breakthroughs in genome-based biotechnology underpinning a broader decarbonized bioeconomy, understanding the role of biological systems in the environment, including carbon capture and sequestration, and adapting biological design paradigms to physical and material systems. The major objectives of the Genomic Science activity are to determine the molecular mechanisms, regulatory elements, and integrated networks needed to understand genome-scale functional properties of microbes, plants, and communities; to develop \"-omics\" experimental capabilities and enabling technologies needed to achieve a dynamic, system-level understanding of organism and community functions; and to develop the knowledgebase, computational infrastructure, and modeling capabilities to advance predictive understanding, manipulation and design of biological systems. 199Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFoundational Genomics supports fundamental research on discovery and manipulation of genome structural and regulatory elements and epigenetic controls to understand genotype to phenotype translations in microbes and plants. Systems biology research on microorganisms with potential bioenergy/bioproduct-relevant traits will yield new pathways to convert plant biomass to a range of fuels, chemicals, and bioinspired products and biomaterials. Efforts in biosystems design research builds on existing genomics-based research and de velops broad-based, secure gene-editing techniques in plants and microbes for a wide variety of advanced biotechnologies. Together these efforts will yield a broader range of platform organisms to be employed in a range of clean energy and biotechnology applications underpinning a more decarbonized bioeconomy. The climate related science supports new approach es and systems to support low carbon biomanufacturing, especially with respect to genome-enabled engineering and de sign of biomaterials, along with developing new emerging technologies and integrated automated sensors that scale from laboratory-fabricated ecosystems to field ecosystems in support of the Accelerate initiative. BER's contribution to wards understanding and anticipating the convergence of advanced genome science with other fields is critical for foresi ght into secure technology development, leveraging scientific communities across biological, physical, and computational science fields with the unique ability to evaluate systems across disciplinary boundaries. The Funding for Accelerated, Inclusiv e Research (FAIR) initiative will provide opportunities to enhance clean energy genome research at minority serving institutions, including attention to underserved and environmental justice communities. The Energy Earthshot Research Centers (EERC ) program is a new modality of research to be launched in FY 2023, building on the success of the Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs). Like the EFRCs and the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program, EERCs will bring togeth er multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary teams to perform energy-relevant research with a scope and complexity be yond what is possible in standard or small-group awards. Complementing and expanding the scope of the EFRCs and SciDAC, aligned with both SC and the energy technology offices, EERCs will address key research challenges at the interface between currently supported basic research and applied research and development activities, to bridge the R&D gap. These challenges are barriers to implementation of the innovations emerging from basic science into potential solution s for technological challenges and are vital to realizing the stretch goals of the DOE Energy Earthshots. EERCs' team awards will entail collaboration involving academic, national laboratories, and industrial researchers with SC and the DOE technology offices, establishing a new era of cross-office research cooperation. BER funding will focus efforts directly at the interface, ensuring that directed biological fundamental research and capabilities at SC user facilities tackle the most challenging barriers identified in the applied research and development activities. Existing DOE Energy Earthshots include the Hydrogen Shot, th e Long Duration Storage Shot, and the Carbon Negative Shot. Additional topics are under consideration for future announcements. From a science perspective, many research gaps for the Energy Earthshots crosscut all topics and will provide a foundation for other energy technology challenges, including biotechnology, critical minerals/materials, energy-water, subsur face science (including geothermal research), and materials and chemical processes under extreme conditions for nuclea r applications. These gaps require multiscale computational and modeling tools, new artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, real-time characterization, including in extreme environments, and development of the scientific base to co-design processes and systems rather than individual materials, chemistries, and components. EERCs will leverage individual Center research to cross-fertilize the ideas that emerge in one topical area to benefit others with similar chal lenges\u2014accelerating the science, as well as the technologies. Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE) will continue to provide a single portal through which a distributed network of capabilities and scientists can work together on multidisciplinary and multiprogram priorities to tackle significant DOE mission-relevant science challenges and provide a ready resource to quickly address urgent national emergencies as needed. The overall goals of the virtual envi ronment are to understand the function of whole biological systems, effectively integrating knowledge from distributed datasets, individual process components, and individual component models in an AI/ML-enabled, open access computational environment. Environmental Genomics supports research focused on understan ding plants and soil microbial communities and how they impact the cycling and/or sequestration of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants in the environment. The activity includes the study of a range of natural and model microbiomes in targeted field environments relevant to BER's bioenergy and environmental research efforts. With a long history in plan t and microbial genomics research coupled with substantial 200Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationbiotechnological and computational capabilities available within the DOE user facilities, BER is well positioned to make transformative contributions in biotechnology and understanding microbiome and phytobiome function. Computational Biosciences supports all Genomic Science systems biology activities through the ongoing development of bioinformatics and computational biology capabilities within the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) and the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC). The integrative KBase project seeks to develop the necessary hypothesis-generating analyses techniques and simulation capabilities on high performance computing platforms to accelerate collaborative and reproducible systems biology research within the Genomic Sciences. The activity supports the Advanced Computing initiative. The DOE BRCs effort within the Genomic Science portfolio seeks to provide a fundamental understanding of the biology of plants and microbes as a basis for developing sustainable innovative processes for clean bioenergy and a range of bioproducts from inedible cellulosic biomass supporting a more decarbonized bioeconomy. Research will accelerate genome engineering, using AI/ML techniques, in plants and microbes to expand the range of products that can be produced from sustainable plant biomass, expand understanding of plant-microbe interactions to inform better agronomic practices for clean bioenergy production, develop new plant varieties with expanded capabilities for sustainable product production and increased collaboration among the broader research community including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and within rural communities where new crop-based clean energy and bioproduct production could spark new industries and bioeconomic development. Biomolecular Characterization and Imaging Science supports integrative approaches to detecting, visualizing, and measuring systems biology processes engaged in translating information encoded in an organism's genome to those traits expressed by the organism. These genotype to phenotype translations are key to gaining a holistic and predictive understanding of cellular function under a variety of environmental and bioenergy-relevant conditions. The activity will enable development of new multimodal bioimaging, measurement, and characterization technologies to visualize the structural, spatial, and temporal relationships of key metabolic processes governing phenotypic expression in plants and microbes. The activity includes efforts in QIS-enabled concepts for imaging and to advance design of sensors and detectors based on correlated materials, crucial for developing an understanding of the impact of various environmental and/or biosystems designs on whole cell or community function. Biological Systems Facilities and Infrastructure The DOE JGI is the only federally funded major genome sequencing center focused on genome discovery and analysis in plants and microbes for energy and environmental applications, and is widely used by researchers in academia, the national laboratories, and industry. High-throughput DNA sequencing underpins modern systems biology research, providing fundamental biological data on organisms and groups of organisms. By understanding shared features of multiple genomes, scientists can identify key genes that may link to biological function. These functions include microbial metabolic pathways and enzymes that are used to generate a range of different chemicals, affect plant biomass formation, degrade contaminants, or sequester carbon dioxide, leading to the optimization of these organisms for cost effective biofuels and bioproducts production and other DOE missions. The DOE JGI is developing aggressive new strategies for interpreting complex genomes through new high-throughput functional assays, DNA synthesis and manipulation techniques, and genome analysis tools in association with the DOE KBase and the NMDC. Related efforts use genomic information to infer natural product production from microorganisms and plants. These advanced capabilities are part of the DOE JGI strategic plan to provide users with additional, highly efficient, capabilities supporting biosystems design efforts for biofuels and bioproducts research, and environmental process research. The DOE JGI also performs metagenome (genomes from multiple organisms) sequencing and analysis from environmental samples and single cell sequencing techniques for hard-to-culture microorganisms from understudied environments relevant to the DOE missions. 201Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBiological and Environmental Research Biological Systems Science Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 FY +$60,611Foundational Genomics research supports expanded secure biosystems design research to gain the ability to stably and securely modify microorganisms and plants with specific beneficial traits for renewable bioenergy, bioproduct and biomaterials production with particular emphasis on programmable materials production and provide foundational research for the Next Generation of Biology.

Note:- Funding for the subprogram above, includes 3.65 percent of research and development (R&D) funding for the Small Business Innova tion Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. 205Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBiological and Environmental Research Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Description The Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences subprogram supports fundamental science and research capabilities that enable major scientific developments in climate, environmental, and Earth system research, in support of DOE's mission goals for transformative science for energy and national security. This includes research on atmospheric, terrestrial, and human components of the Earth system; modeling of oceanic and Great Lakes systems; modeling of component interdependencies under a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcings; studies involving the interdependence and perturbations involving cloud, aerosol, marine, ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical, and cryospheric processes; analysis of the vulnerabilities that affect the resilience of the full suite of energy and related infrastructures as well as the vulnerabilities of other human systems to extreme events; and uncertainty quantification. This integrated portfolio of research extends from molecular-level to field-scales, spans time scales from seasonal to centennial, and emphasizes the coupling of multidisciplinary experimentation with increasingly sophisticated computer models. The ultimate goal of new science is to develop and enhance a predictive, systems-level understanding of the fundamental science that addresses environmental and energy-related challenges associated with extreme phenomena. Investments will emphasize the most difficult challenges limiting prediction uncertainty, including cloud-aerosol interactions; terrestrial systems experiencing rapid transitions; the role of human activities as they couple with the natural system; and increasing opportunities provided by machine learning (ML) and emerging technologies. The research will pursue the fundamental scientific understanding necessary to inform the design, development, financing, and deployment pathways of climate friendly technical solutions that promote social equity and enhance urban resilience in response to the climate crisis. The subprogram supports three primary research activities: atmospheric sciences; environmental system science; and modeling. In addition, the subprogram supports a data management activity, and two SC scientific user facilities: the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL). ARM provides unique, multi-instrumented, high-resolution capabilities for continuous, three-dimensional, long-term observations that researchers need to improve scientific understanding of atmospheric and climate processes involving clouds, aerosols, precipitation, and the Earth's energy balance. ARM also contains a sophisticated model-simulation component that scientists use to augment field observations. EMSL provides integrated experimental and computational resources that researchers utilize to extend understanding of the physical, biogeochemical, chemical, and biological processes that underlie DOE's energy and environmental mission. The data management activity encompasses both observed and model-generated data that are collected by dedicated environmental field experiments; on behalf of the DOE and the international community, this activity also archives information generated world-wide by climate and Earth system models of variable complexity and sophistication. Atmospheric System Research Atmospheric System Research (ASR) is the primary U.S. research activity addressing the main source of uncertainty in climate and Earth system models: the interdependence of clouds, atmospheric aerosols, and precipitation that in turn influences the Earth's radiation balance. ASR coordinates with ARM, using the facility's continuous long-term datasets that provide three-dimensional measurements of a variety of aerosol types that includes natural, brown, and black carbon; cloud, aerosols, and precipitation microphysics under a variety of dynamical conditions; and turbulence and convection over a range of spatially varying environmental and thermodynamical conditions. Collected at diverse climate-sensitive geographic locations, the long-term observational datasets are supplemented with shorter-duration, ground-based and airborne field campaigns as well as laboratory studies to target specific atmospheric processes that limit the predictability of atmospheric processes, properties, and dynamical evolution. Using integrated, scalable testbeds that incorporate process-level understanding, climate and Earth system models incorporate ASR research results to assure greater confidence in system level understanding and predictions that span local to global. Environmental System Sciences Environmental System Science supports research to provide an integrated, robust, and scale-aware predictive understanding of environmental systems, including the role of hydro-biogeochemistry, from the subsurface to the top of the vegetative canopy that considers effects of seasonal to interannual variability and change. Short-term extreme events that act on spatial scales that span from molecular to global are of particular interest. New multi-scale data are essential to 207Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationadvance basic understanding and improve climate and Earth system models that can and are being used to achieve broad benefits ranging from planning and development of energy infrastructure to natural resource management, clean water, environmental stewardship and identifying equitable solutions to the Nation's most vulnerable communities. The vision for this activity is to develop a unified predictive capability that integrates scale-aware process understanding with unique characteristics of watersheds, coastal zones, terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, and urban-rural transitions that are present in, e.g., the Arctic, midlatitude boreal zone, the Tropics, mountainous zones, and coastal regions that include the Delaware andSusquehanna watersheds, the Great Lakes, and Puget sound. Using decadal-scale investments, such as the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEEs), to study the variety of time scales and processes associated with ecological change, Environmental System Science research focuses on understanding, observing, and modeling the processes controlling exchange flows between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere, and improving and validating the representation of environmental systems in coupled climate and Earth system models. Research supports the integration of observations with process modeling from molecular to field scales, to improve understanding of hydrological, and biogeochemical processes that affect terrestrial environments. Research activities will expand place-based Urban Integrated Field Laboratories (IFLs) in support of climate science. The Urban IFLs are dedicated to developing the science framework for advancing observational and prediction capabilities to tackle the following interdependent challenges: constraining climate changes and its impacts on all scales across urban regions; evaluating the mitigation-potential for emerging energy technologies that can be deployed to urban and suburban regions; and addressing environmental justice by enabling neighborhood scale evaluation of climate impacts and energy needs. The Urban IFL scope targets a greater set of urban regions, integrates field data within a next generation Earth System Modeling framework, and creates a science capability to advance climate and energy research as a unified co-dependent system. The enhanced scope will provide DOE, its stakeholders, and impacted communities with the best possible science-based tools that enable the evaluation of the societal and environmental benefits of current and future energy policies. BER will continue support for the SC-wide Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative that leverages SC's unique national laboratories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem. The National Virtual Climate Laboratory (NVCL) will continue to provide greater access to climate science to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), connecting frontline communities with the key climate science capabilities at the DOE national laboratories. A network of climate centers that are affiliated with MSIs will complete planning, with a focus on developing climate resilience solutions that can be deployed to America's communities. The activity also supports Ameriflux, a network of 373 field sites funded by a variety of federal agencies and other research institutions to measure the air-surface exchanges of heat, moisture, and other gases, between the atmosphere and the surface to maintain data quality and organizational support to the network and funding for 13 of the network sites. Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling develops the physical, biogeochemical, and dynamical underpinning of fully coupled climate and Earth System Models (ESMs), in coordination with other Federal efforts. The new Integrative Artificial Intelligence Framework for Earth System Predictability (AI4ESP) effort will motivate the radical acceleration of predictive capabilities across the DOE climate model-data-experiment enterprise, taking advantage of emerging AI and unsupervised learning techniques, robust couplers, diagnostics, performance metrics, and advanced data analytics. Priority model components include the ocean, sea-ice, land-ice, atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, and human activities, where these are treated as interdependent and able to exploit dynamic grid technologies. Support of diagnostic and intercomparison activities, combined with scientific analysis, allows BER-funded researchers to exploit the best available science within each of the world's leading climate and Earth system modeling research programs. In addition, DOE continues to support the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), which is a computationally efficient model adaptable to DOE's Leadership Computing Facility supercomputer architectures (including Exascale computational systems), with greater sophistication and fidelity for high resolution simulation of extreme phenomena and complex processes in heterogeneous landscapes. Earth system modeling, simulation, and analysis tools are essential for informing energy infrastructure investment decisions 208Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationthat have the future potential for large-scale deployment that in turn benefit national security and environmental justice. New modeling efforts will support emerging Earthshot topics. Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Facilities and Infrastructure The Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Facilities and Infrastructure activity supports data management and two scientific user facilities for the Earth and environmental systems sciences communities. The scientific user facilities, ARM and EMSL, provide the broad scientific community with technical capabilities, scientific expertise, and unique information to facilitate science in areas integral to BER's mission. ARM is a multi-laboratory, multi-platform, multi-site, national scientific user facility, providing the world's most comprehensive, continuous, and precise observations of clouds, aerosols, radiative transfer, and related meteorological information. These observations provide new data to address the main source of uncertainty in climate and Earth system models: the interdependence of clouds, atmospheric aerosols, and precipitation that in turn influences the Earth's radiation balance. In addition to supporting interdisciplinary science challenges, extreme events represented in DOE's Earth system model are used to inform plans for designs and deployment of future energy infrastructures. ARM currently consists of three fixed, long-term measurement facility sites (in Oklahoma, Alaska, and the Azores), three mobile observatories, and an airborne research capability that operates at sites selected by the scientific community. In FY 2023, ARM will continue operations at the three fixed sites. One mobile facility will complete deployment to the Houston, TX area for Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER), where scientists are using a sophisticated precipitation radar together with radiosonde and aerosol measurements to learn more about cloud and aerosol interactions in deep convection, and then be prepared and deployed to San Diego. A second mobile unit will continue deployment in central Colorado to study how water and energy budgets in a heterogeneous mountain environment affect precipitation patterns in the activity called Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL). The third mobile unit will complete its installation at a site in the southeastern U.S. with long term operations beginning in FY 2023. ARM will continue to incorporate very high-resolution Large Eddy Simulations at the fixed Oklahoma site during specific campaigns requested by the scientific community. BER is also maintaining the exponentially increasing data archive to support enhanced analyses and model development. The data extracted from the archive are used to improve atmospheric process representations at higher resolution, greater sophistication, and robustness of ultra-high-resolution atmospheric models. Besides supporting BER atmospheric sciences and Earth system modeling research, the ARM facility freely provides key information to other agencies that are engaged in, e.g., calibration and validation of space-borne sensors. BER-supported scientists require high-quality well-characterized in-situ aircraft observations of aerosol and cloud microphysical properties and coincident dynamical and thermodynamic properties to continue to improve fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical processes that control the formation, life cycle, and radiative impacts of cloud and aerosol particles. To meet these needs, the ARM user facility will continue to develop the aerial capabilities, including uncrewed aerial system (UAS) and crewed aircraft. Acceptance testing and evaluation on the crewed aircraft will be completed, including modifications to the air frame as needed to install numerous existing and new atmospheric aerosol, cloud, turbulence, and other sensors. Research flight operations will begin in late FY 2023. EMSL provides integrated experimental and computational resources for discovery and technological innovation in the environmental molecular sciences. EMSL enables users to undertake molecular-scale experimental and theoretical research on biological systems, biogeochemistry, catalysts, and materials, and interfacial and surface (including aerosol) science relevant to energy and environmental challenges facing DOE and the Nation. This research informs the development of advanced biofuels and bioproducts, the design of novel methods to accelerate environmental cleanup, and an improved understanding of Arctic infrastructure vulnerability due to biogenic processes that govern permafrost thaw. EMSL will address a more focused set of scientific topics that continue to exploit High Resolution and Mass Accuracy Capability (HRMAC), live cell imaging, and more extensive utilization of other EMSL instrumentation into process and systems models and simulations to address challenging problems in the biological and environmental system sciences. Data sets generated by ARM, other DOE and Federal Earth observing activities, and Earth system modeling activities are enormous. The new science, derived from Earth observations and models, combines with advanced data analytics such as machine learning to achieve broad benefits ranging from informing the design of robust resilient infrastructures to risk analysis involving natural disaster impact mitigation to commercial supply chain management to natural resource 209Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationmanagement and environmental stewardship. Accessibility and usage of these data sets are fundamental for scientific discovery, technological innovation, decision-making, and national security. Enhanced research across the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences portfolio that involves hybrid capabilities based on the combination of physics-based and machine learning and artificial intelligence research will further these objectives. The BER Data Management activity will focus efforts on archiving scientifically useful data from the Earth System Grid Federation, Ameriflux, NGEE field experiments, SPRUCE site observations, and long-term DOE investments to understand coastal and watershed systems. 210Science/Biological and Environmental Research FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBiological and Environmental Research Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences $350,426 $435,500 +$85,074 Atmospheric System Research $36,000 $39,000 +$3,000ASR continues research on clouds, aerosols, and thermodynamic processes, with a focus on data from the ARM fixed sites as well as recent field campaigns conducted in the Arctic during FY 2020.

This is accomplished through the study of plasma, the fourth state of matter, and how it interacts with its surroundings. To achieve its mission, FES strives to develop a well-trained STEM workforce, guided by the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Importantly, high-temperature laboratory fusion plasmas at hundreds of millions of degrees are being exploited to become the basis for a future clean energy source. Once developed, fusion will provide a clean energy source well-suited for on-demand, dispatchable electricity production, supplementing intermittent renewables and fission. Energy from fusion will be carbon-free, inherently safe, with a virtually limitless fuel supply, and without the production of long-lived radioactive waste. Developing fusion energy is the motivation for the FES subprograms focused on study of the \"burning plasma\" state of matter, for which self-heating from fusion reactions exceeds external heating and leads to net energy production. The frontier area of high-power, long-pulse fusion burning plasmas, to be enabled by the ITER facility, will allow the discovery and study of new scientific phenomena relevant to fusion as a future clean energy source. The DIII-D National Fusion Facility and the National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade (NSTX-U) are world-leading Office of Science (SC) user facilities for experimental research, used by scientists from national laboratories, universities, and industry research groups , to optimize magnetic confinement regimes. Partnerships with the emerging fusion private sector could potentially shorten the time for developing fusion energy by combining efforts to resolve common scientific and technological challenges; along with the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) voucher program, FES will initiate a milestone-based cost-share fusion enterprise program. In addition, FES will initiate an inertial fusion energy science and technology program. Complementing these experimental activities is a significant effort in fusion theory and simulation to predict and interpret the complex behavior of plasmas as self-organized systems. FES supports several Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) centers, in partnership with the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. U.S. scientists use international partnerships to conduct research on overseas tokamaks and stellarators with unique capabilities. The development of novel materials that can withstand enormous heat and neutron exposure is important for fusion and the design basis for a fusion pilot plant (FPP). The FES program also supports discovery plasma science in research areas such as plasma astrophysics, high-energy-density laboratory plasmas (HEDLP), and low-temperature plasmas. Plasma science is wide-ranging, with various types of plasma comprising 99 percent of the visible universe. Practical applications of plasmas are found in microelectronics fabrication, nanomaterial synthesis, and space weather forecasting. Some of this research is carried out through partnerships with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Also, U.S. scientists are world leaders in the invention and development of new high-resolution plasma measurement techniques. Advances in plasma science have led to many spinoff applications and enabling technologies with economic and societal impact. The FES program invests in several SC cross-cutting transformational technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), quantum information science (QIS), microelectronics, advanced manufacturing, and advanced computing. Decisions about the direction of the FES program and its activities are informed by the recent strategic plan \"Powering the Future: Fusion and Plasmas\" ff from the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC), as well as reports from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and community workshops. Specific projects are selected through rigorous peer review and the application of validated standards. ff https://science.osti.gov/-/media/fes/fesac/pdf/2020/202012/FESAC_Report_2020_Powering_the_Future.pdf 221Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHighlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request is $723.2 million.

Program Accomplishments Disruption and runaway electron mitigatio n techniques advanced through coupled experiment and theory collaborations. U.S. researchers are developing new control methods to ensure safe operation of tokamaks. One method deployed on the DIII-D National Fusion Facility uses boro n-filled diamond shell pellet s to quickly cool, or quen ch, the plasma . Quenching is often done by injecting a large quantity of a gas or a cryogenica lly frozen solid into the plasma , cooling it from the outside and releasing the confined heat outward. The new approach reve rses the process by cooling the inner plasma first, so that the released heat is still trapped by the outer plasma regions as it is converted to light. New simulations that reproduce DIII - D results show that under the right conditions the outer edge of the magnetized plasma continues to confine heat until nearly all the heat in the plasma core is converted, thereby protecting the outer wall. A second method studied on DIII-D and the Joint European torus in the U.K. involves injection of cryogenically frozen deuterium into high energy runaway electron beams, triggering a plasma instability that reduc es confinement of the electrons and allows benign plasma termination. New data from DIII-D and JET are being used to explore whether this approach can potentially solve one of the major issues of future reac tors based on the tokamak. U.S. researchers are keeping it cool. One challenge facing tokamaks is how to keep the plasma core hot enough that fusion can occur while maintaining low edge temperatures, so the tokamak walls do not melt. For the fi rst time, impurity radiation was used in DIII-D's new small angle slot divertor to reduce exhaust heat, a process known as divertor detachment. Researchers performed the first simultaneous observation of plasma cooling without degrading plasma performance. In related work, the same advanced divertor control algorithm was used to sustain plasmas with excellent core confinement by integrating divertor detachment with an additional internal transport barrier further inside the plasma. When the injected radiative gases dissipate heat and cool the edge plasma, this tends to further reduce turbulence, and isolation the high-temperature core from the walls. This internal transport barrier is created by tailoring the shape of the plasma current in a way that is known to reduce plasma turbulence. Gain in the fast lane: fast-ion confinement improved in advanced tokamak scenarios. A key ingredient to any fusion reactor is the ability to keep energetic ions in the plasma, since these particles undergo fusion reactions more readily and also k eep the plasma hot. However, too many fast ions in the core of the plasma can trigger instabilities that cause fast ions to move out from the core, similar to how a sandpile cannot become too steep. In DIII-D, advanced tokamak experiments ha ve utilized the upgraded neutral beam injection (NBI) system to double the amount of NBI power that can be injected off-axis. This di stributes the fast-ions more evenly across the plasma, enabling improved fast-ion confinement and plasma performance. New experiments using the combination of off-axis beam power and an electron cyclotron current drive resulted in increased measured neutron counts from approximately 70 percent of the classically predicted rates with on-axis NBI to 95 percen t using off-axis NBI. This de monstrates improved fast-ion confinement and shows that it is possible to use flexible control tools to optimize the advanced tokamak scenarios envisioned for compact fusion power plants and ITER's peak performance goals. High-performance computing and AI/ML help develop a predic tive formulation for the heat-flux width in tokamaks. Predicting the width of the narrow channel through which the power produced in the core plasma is exhausted to the material surfaces is a critical issue for ITER and future fusion reactors. The heat-flux width determines whether the plasma Science/Fusion Energy Sciences 229 FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationfacing components (PFCs), including the divertor plates, can survive the extreme heat fluxes anticipated in reactor-grade plasmas which can be comparable to the heat fluxes in rocket nozzles and spacecrafts during reentry. While several formulas for the heat-flux width exist, they predict very narrow widths for ITER raising concerns about whether the PFCs would fail prematurely. Large-scale simulations performed by a PPPL-led multi-institutional SciDAC team on the SC leadership computing facilities showed that when turbulence effects are properly considered, the resulting heat-flux width is much larger, relaxing the constraints on the PFCs. However, these extreme-scale simulations are computationally expensive. The SciDAC researchers used AI/ML techniques and large datasets from their first-principles simulations to develop a physics-informed surrogate formula that reproduces the heat-flux widths observed in the present tokamaks and the predicted heat-flux width on ITER. This capability will be invaluable for ITER and for the design of future fusion reactors , including the FPP. SNAP Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Reproduces Key Hydrogen Surface Interactions. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, University of Tennessee, and Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed new a machine-learned interatomic potential for studying plasma interactions with fusion reactor materials using atomistic modeling. Previously, spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP) have been successfully developed to study beryllium interactions with tungsten surfaces. This work has now been extended to hydrogen, which makes up most of the plasma impinging on the divertor surface. The new potential was trained to handle a range of surface environments and reproduces the adsorption energies and surface diffusion barriers, as compared to density functional theory for low energy crystallographic orientations. Understanding both the microstructural changes caused by hydrogen and the retention of hydrogen in the divertor is critical for designing future divertor materials and machine learning methods are an enabling technology to accelerate atomistic simulations of these processes. Super-X divertors in spherical tokamaks can really take the heat. For the first time, a Super-X divertor has been experimentally realized in the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak-Upgrade (MAST-U) at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in the UK. The idea for this technology originated with U.S. scientists at the University of Texas - Austin, where theorists showed that specially shaped magnetic fields can expand the area that hot plasma exhaust strikes, thereby reducing the heat absorbed by the surrounding materials. In fusion, where the generated internal plasma temperatures are hotter than the core of the sun, reducing the exhausted heat in a way that does not vaporize the surrounding materials of the reactor is essential. These initial MAST-U results showed that a Super-X divertor can reduce this material heat loading by more than a factor of ten, which may prove sufficient for future fusion power plant designs. Continuous Cryogenic Pellet-Fueling System for Wendelstein 7-X Shows Promise. Continuous injection of cryogenic deuterium-hydrogen pellets is required on the German stellarator, Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), to maintain reactor-like plasma densities and enhanced confinement in long-pulse operation. W7-X is designed to sustain high-performance plasmas for up to 30 minutes. Exploratory experiments on W7-X demonstrated that the injection of 50, 2-mm hydrogen pellets at a velocity of 200 m/s could sustain a high-density plasma heated with 5 MW of microwave power with electrons and ions at temperatures of about 3 keV for about a second. Physics analysis shows that these pellet-fueled plasmas have reduced turbulent transport, which improves the plasma energy confinement. A U.S- led international team is now constructing a continuous, high-speed pellet system to fuel W7-X plasmas in quasi steady-state conditions with plasma experiments starting in 2022. The Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (MPEX) Project receives approval to begin Long-Lead Procurements. The scientific demonstration of magnetic fusion energy as an environmentally sustainable and economically competitive energy source will require mastering of materials science issues associated with the plasma-material interface. The MPEX Project will deliver a world leading capability enabling the testing of plasma-facing materials and components under reactor-relevant plasma loading conditions. As part of the tailoring strategy, the MPEX project is utilizing long-lead procurements which are necessary to ensure the timely, cost-effective delivery of the MPEX work scope while minimizing overall project risk. These long-lead procurements include six superconducting and one resistive magnet subsystems, two gyrotrons, a high voltage power supply, and facility reconfiguration and enhancements, totaling $44.6M in cost. The MPEX project received formal Approval of Long-Lead Procurements (CD-3A) on October 29th, 2020, a major milestone for the project. 230Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFES and ARPA-E collaboration on Fusion Technology R&D The Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and FES oversaw the issuance of a joint solicitation aimed at supporting innovative R&D on a range of fusion enabling technologies. The program, known as Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts (GAMOW) prioritized R&D in 1) technologies and subsystems between the fusion plasma and balance of plant, 2) cost-effective, high-efficiency, high-duty-cycle driver technologies, and 3) cross-cutting areas such as novel fusion materials and advanced and additive manufacturing for fusion-relevant materials and components. The program was aimed at bridging the gap in traditional mission spaces of FES and ARPA-E, where applicants were encouraged to leverage and build on foundational SC-FES research programs while ensuring that market-aware techno-economic analyses informed project goals consistent with ARPA-E directives. The joint program made 14 awards with an execution period over the next three years and a total funding of $30M, equally shared between the two programs. Researchers offer a new definitive test to explain auroras. The shimmering displays of the aurora borealis have always fascinated humankind, but a demonstration of how auroral electrons are accelerated down towards the Earth where collisions with molecules in the thin upper atmosphere cause the emission of auroral light has remained elusive. According to theory, Alfv\u00e9n waves accelerate electrons toward Earth, causing them to precipitate and produce auroras. Although space-based measurements provide strong support of this theory, limitations inherent to spacecraft and rocket measurements have prevented a definitive test. For the first time, using laboratory experiments on the Large Plasma Device at UCLA's Basic Plasma Science Facility, researchers from the University of Iowa, Wheaton College, and UCLA have discovered a direct link between energy transfer from Alfv\u00e9n waves to electrons that causes auroras. The electrons were shown to \"surf\" on the electric field of the Alfv\u00e9n wave, a phenomenon known as Landau damping, in which the energy of the wave is transferred to the accelerated electrons, analogous to a surfer catching a wave and being continually accelerated as the surfer moves along with the wave. LaserNetUS: Tomographic Imaging with an intense laser-driven multi-MeV Photon Source. Scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory in collaboration with Colorado State University successfully demonstrated multi-MeV Photon radiography with intense lasers. Photon sources with energy >1 MeV are of significant interest for imaging and radiography of dense objects in inertial fusion energy, stockpile stewardship, industry, and homeland security applications. This work was enabled by LaserNetUS, a consortium of ten institutions, including both academic and national laboratories, funded by FES to advance laser-driven discovery science and translational research that produces societal benefit. U.S. hardware development and delivery to ITER. Increased design and fabrication continued for all systems within the U.S. responsibility.

Among the activities supported by this subprogram are:\u0003 Research at major experimental user facilities aimed at resolving fundamental advanced tokamak and spherical tokamak science issues. \u0003 Support for public-private partnerships through the INFUSE activity and the establishment of a new cost-share milestone-based partnership program. \u0003 Research on inertial fusion energy science and technology. \u0003 Research on small-scale magnetic confinement experiments. \u0003 Theoretical work on the fundamental description of magnetically confined plasmas and the development of advanced simulation codes on current and emerging high-performance computers. \u0003 Research on technologies, such as high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, needed to support continued improvement and capabilities of the experimental program and current and future facilities. \u0003 Infrastructure improvements at PPPL and other DOE laboratories where fusion research is ongoing. \u0003 Research on AI/ML relevant to fusion and plasma science. Research in the Burning Plasma Science: Foundations area in FY 2023 will focus on high-priority scientific issues in alignment with the recommendations in the recent FESAC LRP, including addressing key science and technology needs in the design basis for an FPP. Advanced Tokamak The Advanced Tokamak (AT) element is a major pillar of the FES research portfolio, supporting a broad range of activities focused on closing gaps in the scientific and technical basis for the tokamak approach to fusion energy. The advanced tokamak is an integrated fusion energy system that simultaneously achieves a stationary plasma state characterized by high plasma pressure, high fractions of self-generated (bootstrap) plasma current, adequate heat and particle confinement, and levels of heat and particle exhaust that are compatible with plasma-facing surfaces. Generating and sustaining such states requires optimization of the configuration via experimental and theoretical studies, as well as multifaceted control algorithms that rely on efficient actuators and validated plasma models. The AT activity comprises several research lines to support the accompanying R&D in these areas, including the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, Enabling Research and Development, and Small-scale AT research. The DIII-D user facility at General Atomics is the largest magnetic fusion research experiment in the U.S. It can magnetically confine plasmas at temperatures relevant to burning plasma conditions. Its extensive set of advanced diagnostic systems and extraordinary flexibility to explore various operating regimes make it a world-leading tokamak research facility. The current DIII-D five-year plan aims to deliver three major goals: (1) enable a successful ITER research program; (2) develop the physics basis for and validation of the Advanced Tokamak path to a U.S. fusion pilot plant; and (3) advance the physics understanding of fusion science across a broad front, developing validated predictive capabilities to project solutions to future devices and maintaining U.S. world leadership in fusion science. The DIII-D program has the long-term objective to establish the physics basis for an integrated core-edge solution in a fusion power plant. Enabling Research and Development (R&D) is aimed at advancing the plasma-supporting technologies required for the realization of fusion energy. Magnets are an integral feature of magnetic fusion configurations, and a primary focus of this element is to support R&D aimed at the development of magnets with higher fields, operating temperatures, and reliability, opening the way towards a FPP. In addition, this element supports the development of heating and current drive technologies, which need substantial advancement in order to meet performance, efficiency, and lifetime goals for an FPP. Enabling R&D also supports the development of plasma fueling and disruption mitigation systems, which are required to enable high-power, steady-state plasma discharges. 233Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSmall-scale advanced tokamak research is complementary to the efforts at the major user facilities, providing rapid and cost-effective development of new techniques and exploration of new concepts. Recent efforts are focused on improving fusion plasma control physics for advanced tokamaks. Spherical Tokamak The NSTX-U user facility at PPPL is designed to explore the physics of plasmas confined in a spherical tokamak (ST) configuration, characterized by a compact (apple-like) shape. If the predicted ST energy confinement improvements are experimentally realized in NSTX-U, then the ST might provide a more compact fusion pilot plant than other plasma confinement geometries. In FY 2023, NSTX-U recovery activities will continue. This recovery effort will ensure reliable plasma operations of the facility. Small-scale ST plasma research involves focused experiments to provide data in regimes of relevance to the ST magnetic confinement program. These efforts can help confirm theoretical models and simulation codes in support of the FES goal to develop an experimentally validated predictive capability for magnetically confined fusion plasmas. This activity also involves high-risk, high-reward, experimental efforts useful to advancing ST science. Theory & Simulation The Theory and Simulation activity is a key component of the FES program's strategy to develop the predictive capability needed for a sustainable fusion energy source. Its long-term goal is to enable a transformation in predictive power based on fundamental science and high-performance computing to minimize risk in future development steps and shorten the path toward the realization of fusion energy. This activity includes three interrelated but distinct elements: Theory, SciDAC, and Advanced Computing. The Theory element is focused on advancing the scientific understanding of the fundamental physical processes governing the behavior of magnetically confined plasmas. The research ranges from foundational analytic theory to mid- and large-scale computational work with the use of high-performance computing resources. In addition to its scientific discovery mission, the Theory element provides the scientific grounding for the physics models implemented in the advanced simulation codes developed under the SciDAC activity described below and also supports validation efforts at major experiments. The FES SciDAC element, a component of the SC-wide SciDAC program, is aimed at accelerating scientific discovery in fusion plasma science by capitalizing on SC investments in leadership-class computing systems and associated advances in computational science in partnership with ASCR. The new portfolio will build upon the SciDAC-4 portfolio that was focused on integration and whole-device modeling and expand its scope to whole-facility modeling, addressing recommendations in the FESAC long-range plan and also providing a consistent set of high-fidelity tools for design and performance assessment of FPP concepts. The Advanced Computing for Fusion element supports efforts that address the growing data needs of fusion research, resulting from both experimental and large-scale simulation efforts, by investing in enhanced data infrastructure capabilities. This element also aims to integrate fusion-relevant capabilities developed under the Exascale Computing Project into the FES program. GPP-GPE Infrastructure This activity supports critical general infrastructure (e.g., utilities, roofs, roads, facilities, environmental monitoring, an d equipment) at the PPPL site and other DOE laboratories where fusion research is ongoing. Public-Private Partnerships INFUSE provides private-sector fusion companies with access to the expertise and facilities of DOE's national laboratories and other supported institutions to overcome critical scientific and technological hurdles in pursuing development of fusion energy systems. The private companies are expected to contribute 20 percent cost share. Among the areas supported by INFUSE are the development of new and improved magnets; materials science, including engineered materials, testing and qualification; plasma diagnostic development; modeling and simulation; and access to fusion experimental capabilities. 234Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe Fusion Enterprise Cost Share Program is a new milestone-based program with 50/50 cost-share between DOE and the private sector. It aims at accelerating the closing of technological gaps for multiple fusion pilot plant concepts by working closely with the private sector. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning The objective is to support research on the development and application of AI/ML techniques that can have a transformative impact on FES mission areas. Research addresses recommendations from the 2018 FESAC report on \"Transformative Enabling Capabilities for Efficient Advance toward Fusion Energy,\" gg is informed by the findings of the joint 2019 FES-ASCR workshop on \"Advancing Fusion with Machine Learning,\"hh and is often conducted in partnership with computational scientists through the establishment of multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaborations. Among the areas supported by the FES AI/ML activity are prediction of key plasma phenomena and plant states; plasma optimization and active plasma control; plasma diagnostics; extraction of models from experimental and simulation data; and extreme data algorithms. Supported activities encompass multiple FES areas, including magnetic fusion, materials science, and discovery plasma science, and contribute to the development of FPP design tools. Strategic Accelerator Technology The objective is to leverage expertise across SC to maximize research and development progress in high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets for future fusion facilities. A key aspect is the support of the High Field Vertical Magnet Test Stand at Fermi National Laboratory, which is being funded jointly with High Energy Physics (HEP). This test stand will be a world-leading capability for testing conductors. Inertial Fusion Energy This activity supports development of the scientific foundation and technologies for inertial fusion energy. Improved knowledge of driver-target physics, understanding of physical limits on design parameters applicable across drivers, advanced concepts for increasing gain, and high-repetition-rate drivers and targets are all critical to advancing IFE concepts. gg https://science.osti.gov/-/media/fes/fesac/pdf/2018/TEC_Report_15Feb2018.pdf hh https://science.osti.gov/-/media/fes/pdf/workshop-reports/FES_ASCR_Machine_Learning_Report.pdf 235Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFusion Energy Sciences Burning Plasma Science: Foundations Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 $127,038 $127,122 supports 18 weeks of operations at the DIII-D facility.

Note: - Funding for the subprogram above, includes 3.65 percent of research and development (R&D) funding for the Small Business Innova tion Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. 239Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFusion Energy Sciences Burning Plasma Science: Long Pulse Description The Burning Plasma Science: Long Pulse subprogram explores new and unique scientific regimes that can be achieved primarily with long-duration superconducting international machines and addresses the development of the materials and technologies required to withstand and sustain a burning plasma. The key objectives of this area are to utilize these unique capabilities to accelerate our scientific understanding of how to control and operate a burning plasma and contribute to the design of a fusion pilot plant (FPP). This subprogram includes long-pulse international tokamak and stellarator research, fusion nuclear science, materials research, and future facilities studies. Long Pulse: Tokamak This activity supports interdisciplinary teams from multiple U.S. institutions for collaborative research aimed at advancing the scientific and technology basis for sustained long-pulse burning plasma operation in tokamaks. Collaborative research on international facilities with capabilities not available in the U.S. aims at building the science and technology required to control, sustain, and predict a burning plasma, as described in the FESAC LRP. ii Multidisciplinary teams work together to close key gaps in the design basis for an FPP, especially in the areas of plasma-material interactions, transients control, and current drive for steady-state operation. Research on overseas superconducting tokamaks, conducted onsite and also via fully remote facility operation, leverages progress made in domestic experimental facilities and provides access to model validation platforms for mission critical applications supported through the FES/ASCR partnership within the SciDAC portfolio. Efforts are augmented by research on non-superconducting tokamaks with access to burning plasma-like scenarios and mature diagnostic suites. Long Pulse: Stellarators This activity supports research on stellarators, which offer the potential of steady-state confinement regimes without transient events such as disruptions. The three-dimensional (3D) shaping of the plasma in a stellarator provides for a broader range in design flexibility than is achievable in a 2D system. The participation of U.S. researchers on the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) in Germany provides an opportunity to develop and assess 3D divertor configurations for long-pulse, high-performance stellarators, including the provision of a pellet fueling injector for quasi-steady-state plasma experiments. The U.S. is developing control schemes to maintain plasmas with stable operational boundaries in long-pulse conditions. U.S. researchers will play key roles in developing the operational scenarios and hardware configuration for high-power, steady-state operation, an accomplishment that will advance the performance/pulse length frontier for fusion. The strong U.S. contributions during the W7-X construction phase have earned formal partnership status for the U.S. Accordingly, the U.S. is participating fully in W7-X research and has full access to data. U.S. domestic compact stellarator research is focused on improvement of the stellarator magnetic confinement concept through quasi-symmetric shaping of the toroidal magnetic field, which was invented in the U.S. According to the FESAC Long-Range Plan, the quasi-symmetric stellarator is the leading U.S. approach to develop disruption-free, low-recirculating-power fusion configurations. Materials & Fusion Nuclear Science The Materials and Fusion Nuclear Science activity seeks to address the significant scientific and technical gaps between current-generation fusion experiments and a future FPP, as recommended by the FESAC LRP. An FPP will produce heat, particle, and neutron fluxes that significantly exceed those in present confinement facilities, and new approaches and materials need to be developed and engineered for the anticipated extreme reactor conditions. The goal of the Materials subactivity is to develop a scientific understanding of how the properties of materials evolve and degrade due to fusion neutron and plasma exposure to safely predict the behavior of materials in fusion reactors. Before an FPP is constructed, materials and components must be qualified and a system design must ensure the compatibility of all components. The goal of the Fusion Nuclear Science subactivity is to advance the balance-of-plant equipment, remote handling, tritium breeding, and safety systems that are required to safely harness fusion power in an FPP. The SC initiative on Fundamental ii https://usfusionandplasmas.org/ 241Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience to Transform Advanced Manufacturing, which has implications for both the Materials and Fusion Nuclear Science subactivities, is also part of this activity. Developing solutions for this scientifically challenging area requires innovative types of research along with new experimental capabilities. In the near term, this includes the Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (MPEX) Major Item of Equipment (MIE) project, which will enable solutions for new plasma-facing materials, and the Fusion Prototypic Neutron Source (FPNS), which will provide unique material irradiation capabilities for understanding materials degradation in the fusion nuclear environment. These experimental capabilities will lead to an increased understanding of materials and of component and system performance in support of an FPP. Future Facilities Studies The Future Facilities Studies activity seeks to identify approaches for an integrated fusion plant design, e.g., an FPP, as recommended by the FESAC LRP. 242Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFusion Energy Sciences Burning Plasma Science: Long Pulse Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY Enacted Pulse: Tokamak $15,000 $15,000 $ \u2014 Funding supports U.S. teams to develop prediction, avoidance, and mitigation strategies for potentially damaging transient events in large tokamaks, validate computational tools for integrated simulation of burning plasmas, and assess the potential of solid metal walls as the main plasma-facing material in long-pulse tokamak facilities.The Request will support the second budget period for U.S. teams conducting research on international facilities, which will help close key gaps in the design basis for an FPP.No change.

In a burning or self-heated plasma, at least half of the power needed to maintain the plasma at thermonuclear temperatures is provided by heating sources within the plasma. For the most common deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuel cycle, this internal heating source is provided by the energy of the helium nuclei (alpha particles) which are produced by the D-T reaction itself. A common figure of merit characterizing the proximity of a plasma to burning plasma conditions is the fusion gain or \"Q\", which is defined as the ratio of the fusion power produced by the plasma to the heating power injected into the plasma that is necessary to bring it, and keep it, at thermonuclear temperatures. ITER will be the world's first burning plasma experiment that is expected to produce 500 MW of fusion power for pulses of 400 seconds, attaining a fusion gain of Q = 10. It is a seven-member international collaborative project to design, build, operate, and decommission a first-of-a-kind international fusion research facility in St. Paul-lez-Durance, France, aimed at demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. In addition to the U.S., the six other ITER members are China, the EU, India, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. More information about the U.S. Contributions to the ITER project is provided in the FES Construction section. ITER Research To ensure that the U.S. fusion community takes full advantage of ITER research operations after First Plasma, it is necessary to organize a U.S. ITER research team to be ready on day one to benefit from the scientific and technological opportunities offered by ITER. Building such a team was also among the highest recommendations in the recent FESAC LRP. A Basic Research Needs workshop is being held in FY 2022 to identify the highest-priority research and engagement opportunities for the U.S. in order to maximize the benefit of its participation in ITER. 245Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFusion Energy Sciences Burning Plasma Science: High Power Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Burning Plasma Science: High Power $ \u2014 $2,000 +$2,000 ITER Research $ \u2014 $2,000 +$2,000No Funding in FY 2021.

Plasma science is not only fundamental to understanding the nature of visible matter throughout the universe, but also to achieving the eventual production and control of fusion energy. Discoveries in plasma science are leading to an ever-increasing array of practical applications, some of them relevant to clean energy technologies, including synthesis of nanomaterials and artificial diamonds, efficient solar and fuel cells, fabrication of microelectronics and opto-electronic devices, energy-efficient lighting, low-heat chemical-free sterilization processes, tissue healing, combustion enhancement, satellite communication, laser-produced isotopes for positron emission tomography, and extreme ultraviolet lithography. The Discovery Plasma Science subprogram is organized into the following activities: Plasma Science and Technology The Plasma Science and Technology (PS&T) activities involve research in largely unexplored areas of plasma science, with a combination of theory, computer modeling, and experimentation. These areas encompass extremes of the plasma state, ranging from the very small (several atom systems) to the extremely large (plasma structure spanning light years in length), from the very fast (attosecond processes) to the very slow (hours), from the diffuse (interstellar medium) to the extremely dense (diamond compressed to tens of gigabar pressures), and from the ultra-cold (tens of micro-kelvin degrees) to the extremely hot (stellar core). Advancing the science of these unexplored areas creates opportunities for new and unexpected discoveries with potential to be translated into practical applications. These activities are carried out on small- and mid-scale experimental collaborative research facilities. The PS&T portfolio includes research activities in the following areas:\u0003 General Plasma Science (GPS): Research at the frontiers of basic and low temperature plasma science, including dynamical processes in laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasmas, such as magnetic reconnection, dynamo, shocks,turbulence cascade, structures, waves, flows and their interactions; behavior of dusty plasmas, non-neutral, single-component matter or antimatter plasmas, and ultra-cold neutral plasmas; plasma chemistry and processes in low-temperature plasma, interfacial plasma, synthesis of nanomaterials, and interaction of plasma with surfaces, materialsor biomaterials. \u0003 High Energy Density Lab Plasmas (HEDLP): Research directed at exploring the behavior of plasmas at extreme conditions of temperature, density, and pressure, including relativistic high energy density (HED) plasmas and intensebeam physics, magnetized HED plasma physics, multiply ionized HED atomic physics, HED hydrodynamics, warm densematter, nonlinear optics of plasmas and laser-plasma interactions, laboratory astrophysics, and diagnostics for HEDlaboratory plasmas. The PS&T activity stewards world-class plasma science experiments and collaborative research facilities at small and intermediate scales. These platforms not only facilitate addressing frontier plasma science questions, but also provide critical data for the verification and validation of plasma science simulation codes and comparisons with space observations. This effort maintains strong partnerships with NSF and NNSA. Measurement Innovation The Measurement Innovation activity supports the development of world-leading transformative and innovative diagnostic techniques and their application to new, unexplored, or unfamiliar plasma regimes or scenarios. The challenge is to develop diagnostics with the high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution necessary to validate plasma physics models used to predict the behavior of fusion plasmas. Advanced diagnostic capabilities successfully developed through this activity are migrated to domestic and international facilities as part of the Burning Plasma Science: Foundations and Burning Plasma Science: Long Pulse subprograms.

The project received Critical Decision-1 (CD-1), \"Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range,\" on October 4, 2021. The FY 2023 Request of $1,000,000 will support preliminary design activities. The estimated total project cost range is $264,000,000 to $461,000,000. 14-SC-60, U.S. Contributions to ITER The ITER facility, currently under construction in Saint Paul-lez-Durance, France, is more than 70 percent complete to First Plasma. ITER is designed to provide fusion power output approaching reactor levels of hundreds of megawatts, for hundreds of seconds. ITER is a necessary next step toward developing a carbon-free fusion energy pilot plant that will keep the U.S. competitive internationally. Construction of ITER is a collaboration among the U.S., European Union, Russia, Japan, India, Republic of Korea, and China, governed under an international agreement (the \"ITER Joint Implementing Agreement\"). As a co-owner of ITER, the U.S. contributes in-kind hardware components and financial contributions for the ITER Organization (IO) operations (e.g., design integration, nuclear licensing, quality control, safety, overall project management, and installation and assembly of the components provided by the U.S. and other Members). The U.S. also has over 50 nationals employed by the IO and working at the site. An independent review of CD-2, \"Approve Performance Baseline,\" for the U.S. Contributions to ITER\u2014First Plasma subproject was completed in November 2016 and then subsequently approved by the Project Management Executive on January 13, 2017, with a total project cost of $2,500,000,000. The FY 2023 Request of $240,000,000 will support the continued systems design, fabrication of First Plasma hardware, and financial contributions for IO operations. The estimated total project cost range is $4,700,000,000 to $6,500,000,000, which includes all U.S. in-kind hardware and financial construction contributions through the completion of ITER. The U.S. In-kind contribution represents 9.09 percent (1/11 th) of the overall ITER project, but will allow access to 100 percent of the science and engineering associated with what will be the largest magnetically confined burning plasma experiment ever created. The U.S. involvement in ITER will help to advance the promise of carbon-free, inherently safe, and abundant fusion energy. kk https://www.nap.edu/read/24939/chapter/1 253Science/Fusion Energy Sciences FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFusion Energy Sciences Construction Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes Enacted Construction $257,000 $241,000 SLAC $15,000 $1,000 -$14,000 The Enacted budget supports design activities, preparation for developing a project baseline, and long-lead procurements for an upgrade to MEC.The Request will continue to support design activities and preparation for developing a project performance baseline.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) Petawatt Upgrade project is $1,000,000. The project has a preliminary estimated Total Project Cost (TPC) range of $264,000,000 to $461,000,000. Currently, this cost range encompasses the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The future MEC Petawatt user facility will be a premier research facility to conduct experiments in the field of High Energy Density Plasmas. It will utilize the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) beam at SLAC to probe and characterize plasmas and extreme states of matter. Significant Changes The MEC Petawatt Upgrade project was initiated in FY 2019. The project achieved Critical Decision-0 (CD-0), \"Approve Mission Need,\" on January 4, 2019. Other Project Costs (OPC) funding in FY 2020 supported conceptual design of the civil infrastructure and technical hardware. The project achieved CD-1, \"Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range,\" on October 4, 2021, and will initiate the TEC-funded preliminary design phase. The upper-end of the cost range increased from $372,000,000 to $461,000,000 and from a 2028 to 4Q FY 2029. The increases in cost and schedule were implemented in order to address the uncertainty associated with budget requests and future appropriations.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The scope of the MEC Petawatt Upgrade project includes the development of a user facility that couples long-pulse (1 Kilojoule or higher) and short-pulse (1 petawatt or higher) drive lasers to an X-ray source, as well as a second target chamber that will accommodate laser-only fusion and material science experiments. The lasers will be placed in a dedicated MEC experimental hall (located at the end of the LCLS-II Far Experimental Hall), composed of an access tunnel, an experimental hall with 12,000 to 17,000 square feet, a stand-alone control room, and associated safety systems and infrastructure. Justification The FES mission is to build the scientific foundations needed to develop a fusion energy source and to expand the fundamental understanding of matter at very high temperatures and densities. To meet this mission, there is a scientific need for a petawatt or greater laser facility that is currently not available in the U.S. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 2017 study titled \"Opportunities in Intense Ultrafast Lasers: Reaching for the Brightest Light ll\" found that about 80 percent to 90 percent of the high-intensity laser systems are overseas, and all the highest- power lasers currently under construction or already built are overseas as well. The report noted that the U.S. is losing ground in a second laser revolution of high-intensity, ultrafast lasers, which have broad applications in manufacturing, medicine, and national security. The report made five recommendations that would improve the nation's position in the field, including a recommendation for DOE to plan for at least one large-scale, open-access, high-intensity laser facility that leverages other major science infrastructures in the DOE complex. The NASEM report focuses on high-intensity, pulsed petawatt-class lasers (1 petawatt is 10 15 watts). Such laser beams can drive nuclear reactions, heat matter to mimic conditions found in stars, and create electron-positron plasmas. In addition to discovery-driven science, petawatt-class lasers can generate particle beams with potential applications in medicine, intense neutron and gamma ray beams for homeland security applications, directed energy for defense applications, and radiation for extreme ultraviolet lithography. Co-location of high-intensity lasers with existing infrastructure such as particle accelerators has been recognized as a key advantage of the U.S. laboratories over the Extreme Light Infrastructure concept in Europe. A laser facility with high-power, high-intensity beam parameters that is co-located with hard X-ray laser probing capabilities (i.e., with an X-ray wavelength that allows atomic resolution) will provide the required diagnostic capabilities for fusion discovery science and related fields. This co-location enables novel pump-probe experiments with the potential to dramatically improve understanding of the ultrafast response of materials in extreme conditions, e.g., found in the environment of fusion plasmas, astrophysical objects, and highly stressed engineering materials. Recent research on ultrafast pump-probe experiments using the LCLS at ll https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24939/opportunities-in-intense-ultrafast-lasers-reaching-for-the-brightest-light 264Science/Fusion 20-SC-61 Matter in SLAC FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationthe SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory has demonstrated exquisite ultrafast measurements of the material structural response to radiation. The upgrade includes the petawatt laser beam and the long pulse laser beam. The latter is required to compress matter to densities relevant to planetary science and fusion plasmas. FES is seeking to develop a new world-class petawatt laser capability to meet the FES mission and address the recommendations from the NASEM report. The project will be generally conducted utilizing the project management principles described in DOE O 413.3B , Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change during design phase as the project continues towards CD-2. At CD-2 approval, the KPPs will be baselined. The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the desired project performance. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Project Completion. The project is in the conceptual design phase, and the KPPs reflect the types of parameters being considered and are notional at this stage.

Acquisition Approach The FES is proposing that the MEC-U Project be acquired by Stanford University under the SLAC Management and Operations (M&O) Contract (DE-AC02-76-SF00515) for DOE. The acquisition of large research facilities is within the scope of the DOE contract for the management and operations of SLAC and consistent with the general expectation of the responsibilities of DOE M&O contractors. SLAC does not currently possess all the necessary core competencies to design, procure and build the laser systems. To address this, SLAC will collaborate with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) as partners through signed Memorandum of Agreements to perform significant portions of the MEC-U laser systems scope of work. Memorandum Purchase Orders will be used to define work scopes and budgets with LLNL as funds become available. Any work accomplished through LLE will be completed using the standard DOE format university agreements. Procurements authorized by the partner institutions will utilize the approved DOE purchasing systems. 269Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification14-SC-60, U.S. Contributions to ITER Project is for Design and Construction 1.

Research results from the ITER project, if successful, are expected to contribute to the development of a fusion pilot plant. Fusion energy could provide a carbon-free, inherently safe energy source that will be a significant contributor to ameliorating climate change. As outlined in the May 2016 Secretary of Energy's Report to Congress, DOE expected to baseline the \"First Plasma\" portion of the U.S. ITER project. As such, DOE divided the U.S. ITER project hardware scope into two distinct subprojects, which represent the two phases of the project: the First Plasma (FP) subproject (SP-1), and the Post-FP subproject (SP-2). SP-1 completes all design, delivers the Steady State Electrical Network, Toroidal Field Conductor, Central Solenoid Magnet, and portions of other systems described in Table 1, SP-1 In-Kind Hardware Description. SP-2 is the second element of the U.S. ITER project and includes the remainder of U.S. hardware contributions for Post-FP operations leading up to Deuterium-Tritium Operations. SP-2 is planned for baselining in FY 2023. The financial contributions to the IO operational costs during construction are shared among the seven Members and constitute the third element of the U.S. ITER Total Project Cost that funds the entirety of ITER construction. These funds are used by the IO to provide, among other items, design integration, nuclear licensing, regulatory engagement, construction of the complex, project management, and assembly and installation of in-kind components. Significant Changes The FY 2023 Request of $240,000,000 will support the continued design and fabrication of \"in-kind\" hardware systems and construction financial contributions to the ITER Organization. This includes continued fabrication and delivery of the Central Solenoid (CS) magnet system, which consists of seven superconducting magnet modules. In FY 2022, the U.S. is scheduled to ship the second and third CS magnet modules and continue the design and fabrication efforts associated with other \"In-kind\" hardware systems. The U.S. ITER project will have obligated more than $1,500,000,000 through the end of FY 2022, of which more than 80 percent is to U.S. industry, universities, and DOE laboratories. The U.S. ITER project was initiated in FY 2006. On January 13, 2017, U.S. ITER SP-1 achieved Critical Decision SP-1 is planned for December 2028. A Federal Project Director with a level-I certification has been assigned to this Project, and is currently pursuing higher-lev el certification. 271Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationCritical Milestone History - Approve Mission Need for a construction project with a conceptual scope and cost range Conceptual Design Complete - Actual date the conceptual design was completed (if applicable) CD-1 - Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range CD-2 - Approve Performance Baseline Final Design Complete - Estimated/Actual date the project design will be/was complete(d) CD-3 - Approve Start of Construction D&D Complete - Completion of D&D work CD-4 - Approve Start of Operations or Project Closeout 272Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to on multiple dates in Conceptual and Final Design columns for each piece of equipment: - Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) Transmission lines (TL) (06/22/2009); - Tokamak Cooling Water System (07/21/2009); - CS Modules, Structures, and Assembly Tooling (AT) (09/30/2009); - Ion Cyclotron Heating Transmission Lines (ICH) (10/14/2009); - Tokamak Exhaust Processing (TEP) (05/17/2010); - Diagnostics: Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA) (07/14/2010), Upper Visible Infrared Cameras (VIR) (07/27/2010); - Vacuum Auxiliary System (VAS) - Main Piping (12/13/2010); Diagnostics Low-Field-Side Reflectometer (LFS) (05/30/2011); - Cooling Water (04/12/2011); Diagnostics: Upper Port (10/03/2011), Electron Cyclotron (TIP) (01/02/2012), Port E-3 (07/10/2012); - Steady State Electrical Network (05/02/2012); - VAS Supply (11/13/2012); - Disruption Mitigation (12/11/2012); - Pellet Injection (04/29/2013); - Diagnostics: Motional (CIXS) (06/01/2013); - RGA Divertor Sampling Tube (07/28/14); - CS AT, Early Items (09/17/14); - CS Modules and Structures (11/18/2013); - VAS Main Piping B-2, L-1, L-2 (12/10/2013); - CS AT Remaining Items (12/02/2015); - Pumps (03/2017); - VAS 03 - VAS 03 Supply I&C (07/2017); - CS AT Bus Bar Alignment and Coaxial Heater (04/2017); - VAS Main Piping L3/L4 (03/2017); - VAS 02 CGVS (&C Part 1 (06/2017); - VAS 02 Supply Part 1 (05/2018); - ICH RF Building and I&C (11/2017); - TCWS Captive Piping and First Plasma (11/2017); - ICH RF components supporting INDA/IO testing (01/2018). Project Cost History At the time of CD-1 approval in January 2008, the preliminary cost range was $1,450,000,000 to $2,200,000,000. Until 2016, however, it was not possible to confidently baseline the project due to delays early on in the international ITER construction schedule. Various factors (e.g., schedule delays, design and scope changes, funding constraints, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation, and inadequate project management and leadership issues in the ITER Organization (IO) at that time) affected the project cost and schedule. Shortly after the current Director General's appointment in March 2015, the ITER Project was baselined for cost and schedule. 273Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationIn response to a 2013 Congressional request, a DOE SC Independent Project Review (IPR) Committee assessed the project and determined that the existing cost range estimate of $4,000,000,000 to $6,500,000,000 would likely encompass the final TPC. This range, recommended in 2013, was included in subsequent President's Budget Requests. In May 2016, the Secretary of Energy provided a \"Report on the Continued U.S. Participation in the ITER Project\" to Congress, which stated that the First Plasma part of the U.S. ITER project would be baselined in FY 2017. In preparation for baselining SP-1, based on the results of an Independent Project Review, the acting Director for the Office of Science updated the lower end of this range to reflect updated cost estimates, resulting in the current approved CD-1 Revised (CD-1R) range of $4,700,000,000 to $6,500,000,000. This updated CD-1R range incorporates increases in the project's hardware estimate that have occurred since August 2013. The SP-1 TPC is now baselined at $2,500,000,000. Starting in FY 2022, the table below includes both SP-1 and cash contributions.

Project Scope and Justification ITER, currently the largest science experiment in the world, is a major fusion research facility under construction in St. Paul - lez-Durance, France by an international partnership of seven Members or domestic agencies, specifically, the U.S., China, the EU, India, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the Russian Federation. ITER is co-owned and co-governed by the seven Members. The U.S. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), Section 972(c)(5)(C) authorized U.S. participation in ITER. The Agreement on the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization for the Joint Implementation of 274Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationthe ITER Project (Joint Implementation Agreement or JIA), signed on November 21, 2006, provides the legal framework for the four phases of the program: construction, operation, deactivation, and decommissioning. The JIA is a Congressional-Executive Hybrid Agreement that is considered \"treaty-like.\" The other six Member entered the project by treaty. Through participation in the JIA, the European Union, as the Host, bears five-elevenths (45.45 percent) of the ITER facility's construction cost, while the other six Members, including the U.S., each contribute one-eleventh (9.09 percent) of the ITER facility's construction cost. The IO is a designated international legal entity located in France. Scope U.S. Contributions to ITER - Construction Project Scope The overall U.S. ITER project includes three major elements: \u0003 Hardware components, built under the responsibility of the U.S., and then shipped to the ITER site for IO assembly, installation, and operation. Included in this element is cash provided in-lieu of U.S. in-kind component contributions toadjust for certain reallocations of hardware contributions between the U.S. and the IO. \u0003 Funding to the IO to support common expenses, including ITER research and development (R&D), design and construction integration, overall project management, nuclear licensing, IO staff and infrastructure, IO-providedhardware, on-site assembly/installation/testing of all ITER components, installation, safety, quality control andoperation. \u0003 Other project costs, including R&D (other than mentioned above) and conceptual design-related activities. The U.S. is to contribute the agreed-upon hardware to ITER, the technical components of which are currently split between SP-1 (FP) and SP-2 (Post-FP). The description of the component systems and the percentage to be delivered in SP-1 are indicated in the table below: 275Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions Budget JustificationTable 1.

Creating a self-sustaining burning plasma will provide essential scientific knowledge necessary for practical fusion power. There are two planned experimental outcomes expected from ITER: The first is to investigate the fusion process in the form of a \"burning plasma,\" in which the heat generated by the fusion process exceeds that supplied from external sources (i.e., self-heating). The second is to sustain the burning plasma for a long duration (e.g., several hundred to a few thousand seconds), during which time equilibrium conditions can be achieved within the plasma and adjacent structures. ITER is the necessary next step toward developing a fusion pilot plant. Although not classified as a Capital Asset, the U.S. ITER project is being conducted following project management principles of DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets, to the greatest extent possible. Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The U.S. Contributions to the ITER Project will not deliver an integrated operating facility, but rather In-kind hardware contributions, which represent a portion of the international ITER facility. Therefore, typical KPPs are not practical for this type of project. The U.S. ITER project defines project completion as delivery and IO acceptance of the U.S. in-kind hardware. For SP-1, in some cases (e.g., Tokamak Exhaust Processing and Disruption Mitigation), only the completion of the design is needed, which requires IO approval of the final designs (see Table 1 on previous page for more detail). 277Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification3.

Details of Project Cost Estimate The overall U.S. Contributions to ITER project has an approved revised CD-1 Cost Range (CD-1R). DOE chose to divide the project hardware scope into two distinct subprojects (FP SP-1, and Post-FP or SP-2) so that an initial portion of the project that was mature enough to baseline could be accomplished. The baseline for SP-1 ($2,500,000,000) was approved in January 2017. Baselining of SP-2 is expected in FY 2023; SP-2 design work is underway which is included in SP-1 scope. An Independent Project Review (IPR) of U.S. ITER was conducted on November 14-17, 2016, to consider the project's readiness for CD-2 (Approve Performance Baseline) and CD-3 (Approve Start of Construction [Fabrication]) for SP-1, as well as for the proposed updated CD-1 Cost Range. Outcomes from the IPR indicated that the project was ready for approval of 282Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 U.S. Contributions to ITER FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSP-1 CD-2/3, following a reassessment of contingency to account for risk in the areas of escalation and currency exchange. In addition, the IPR committee found no compelling reason to deviate from the cost-range identified in the May 2016 Report to Congress ($4,000,000,000 to $6,500,000,000) and recommended that this range be adopted and approved as the Updated CD-1 cost-range. However, as noted above, in preparation for baselining SP-1 and based on the outcome of the IPR, a decision was made to update the lower end of this range to reflect updated cost estimates, resulting in the current approved CD-1R range of $4,700,000,000 to $6,500,000,000.

Related Operations and Maintenance Funding Requirements The U.S. Contributions to ITER operations phase is to begin with initial integrated commissioning activities with an assumed useful life of 20 to 25 years. The fiscal year in which commissioning activities begin depends on the international ITER project schedule, which currently indicates 2025. As a result of COVID-19 and other known delays, the overall ITER project is being re-baselined to update cost and schedule estimates. Start of Operation or Beneficial Occupancy 12/2025 Expected Useful Life 30-35 years Expected Future Start of D&D of this capital asset 2058-2063 285Science/Fusion Energy Sciences/ 14-SC-60 Contributions to Congressional Budget Justification7. D&D Information Since ITER is being constructed in France by a coalition of countries and will not be a DOE asset, the \"one-for-one\" requirement is not applicable to this project. The U.S. Contributions to ITER decommissioning phase is assumed to begin no earlier than 20 years after the start of operations. The deactivation phase is also assumed to begin no earlier than 20 years after operations begin and will continue for a period of five years. The U.S. is responsible for 13 percent of the total decommissioning and deactivation cost; the fund will be collected and escrowed out of research Operations funding. 8. Acquisition Approach The U.S. ITER Project Office (USIPO) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with its two partner laboratories (Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory), will procure and deliver In-kind hardware in accordance with the Procurement Arrangements established with the IO. The USIPO will subcontract with a variety of research and industry sources for design and fabrication of its ITER components, ensuring that designs are developed that permit fabrication, to the maximum extent possible, to use fixed-price subcontracts (or fixed-price arrangement documents with the IO) based on performance specifications, or more rarely, on build-to-print designs. USIPO will use cost-reimbursement type subcontracts only when the work scope precludes accurate and reasonable cost contingencies being gauged and established beforehand. USIPO will use best value, competitive source-selection procedures to the maximum extent possible, including foreign firms on the tender/bid list when necessary. Such procedures shall allow for cost and technical trade-offs during source selection. For the large-dollar-value subcontracts (and critical path subcontracts as appropriate), USIPO will utilize unique subcontract provisions to incentivize cost control and schedule performance. In addition, where it is cost effective and it reduces risk, the USIPO will participate in common procurements led by the IO or request the IO to perform activities that are the responsibility of the U.S. 286Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Overview The mission of the High Energy Physics (HEP) program is to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level by discovering the elementary constituents of matter and energy, probing the interactions between them, and exploring the basic nature of space and time. HEP accomplishes its mission through excellence in scientific discovery in particle physics, and through stewardship of world-class scientific user facilities that enable cutting-edge research and development. HEP continues to deliver major construction projects on time and on budget and provides reliable availability and support to users for operating facilities. HEP's work allows the U.S. to remain a global leader in international particle physics research and collaboration. Our current understanding of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the forces that govern them is described by the Standard Model of particle physics. However, experimental measurements suggest that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that new physics may be discovered by future experiments. The May 2014 report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), \"Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context\" nn was unanimously approved by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP) to serve the DOE and National Science Foundation (NSF) as the ten-year strategic plan for U.S. high energy physics in the context of a 20-year global vision. The P5 report identified five intertwined science drivers of particle physics that provide compelling lines of inquiry with great promise to discover what lies beyond the Standard Model: \u0003 Use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery; \u0003 Pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass; \u0003 Identify the new physics of dark matter; \u0003 Understand cosmic acceleration: dark energy and inflation; and \u0003 Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles. The HEP program enables scientific discovery and supports cutting edge research and development (R&D):\u0003 Energy Frontier Experimental Physics, where researchers accelerate particles to the highest energies ever made by humanity and collide them to produce and study the fundamental constituents of matter. \u0003 Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics, where researchers use a combination of intense particle beams and highly sensitive detectors to make extremely precise measurements of particle properties, to study some of the rarestinteractions predicted by the Standard Model, and to search for new physics. \u0003 Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics, where researchers use naturally occurring cosmic particles and phenomena to reveal the nature of dark matter, understand the cosmic acceleration caused by dark energy and inflation, infer certainneutrino properties, and explore the unknown. \u0003 Theoretical, Computational, and Interdisciplinary Physics provides the framework to explain experimental observations and gain a deeper understanding of nature. \u0003 The Advanced Technology R&D subprogram fosters fundamental research into particle acceleration and detection techniques and instrumentation. Innovative research methods and enabling technologies that emerge from R&D into accelerators, instrumentation, quantum information science (QIS), and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will advance scientific knowledge in high energy physics and in a broad range of related fields, advancing DOE's strategic goals for science. Many of the advanced technologies, research tools, and analysis techniques originally developed for high energy physics have proved widely applicable to other scientific disciplines as well as for health services, national security, and the private sector. nn High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, Department of Energy.

The GARD activity is based on input from the community, including high-level advice on long term facility goals from HEPAP and P5, and more detailed technical advice developed through a series of Roadmap Workshops. The GARD activity is coordinated with other Offices of Science (especially Basic Energy Sciences, Fusion Energy Sciences, Nuclear Physics, and Accelerator R&D and Production programs) and other federal agencies to optimize synergy and foster strong U.S. capability in this key technology area. The HEP QIS research program has coordinated partnerships with the Department of Defense Office of Basic Research as well as the Air Force's Office of Scientific Research on synergistic research connecting foundational theory research with quantum error correction and control systems for sensors, and a partnership with the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology on quantum metrology and quantum sensor development for experimental discovery along HEP science drivers and for better understanding of fundamental constants. Furthermore, the SC National QIS Research Center (NQISRCs) effort is a partnership across all SC programs and engages industry to inform use-inspired research and connect to applied and development activities. These interdisciplinary QIS efforts are aligned with the National Quantum Initiative and SC QIS priorities. Program Accomplishments First results from Muon g-2 experiment strengthen evidence of new physics (Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics).The Muon g-2 collaboration published its first physics result in 2021. The result exceeded all prior results in its statistical and systematic precision. The results from the FNAL-based experiment confirm a prior experiment that took data at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and strengthen the evidence that our understanding of fundamental physics is incomplete. When combined with BNL, the FNAL experimental determination of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment is in tension with the theoretical expectation. There is less than a 1 in 40,000 chance that the difference is merely a statistical fluke. Either there is an additional 18 th fundamental particle that has not yet been directly discovered, or there is something amiss with our understanding of the forces governing the known 17. These astounding implications generated the most excitement for the field of particle physics in the mainstream public since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2013 at CERN. The Muon g-2 experiment uses an intense, energetic beam of subatomic particles called muons that are generated by the powerful Fermilab Accelerator Complex. The muons are circulated in a magnetic storage ring that was transported in one piece from BNL in 2013. Scientists measure how the muon interacts with the ring's magnetic field to better understand its properties and get a glimpse into the quantum world, where particles of all varieties continually blink in and out of existence as they spontaneously generate from the vacuum surrounding the muon. The results published in 2021 were based on a total of 6 percent of the expected total data sample that will be collected by the experiment. The experiment has already collected ten times the data that was used for the first result. The next publication is expected in 2023 and will shrink the experimental uncertainty by another factor of two, with a factor of four expected by the end of the experiment. LHC data enables sensitive studies of the Higgs boson and searches for exotic particle decays to probe the existence of new physics (Energy Frontier Experimental Physics). Scientists at the LHC continued their studies of Higgs boson interactions and searched for exotic particles being created in high energy particle collisions. Using AI/ML techniques to enhance their sensitivity, the ATLAS collaboration used the Higgs boson as a tool for discovery by searching for evidence of decays of the Higgs boson where a pair of oppositely charged muons or electrons accompany the photon decay from the Higgs. While this challenging decay channel is predicted by the standard model at a very low rate and thereby considered rare, the analysis suggests that an observation will be possible with additional data acquired at the LHC or during the future era of the HL-LHC. A different search by the CMS collaboration probes the possibility of the Higgs boson serving as a portal for the existence of new particles that have not yet been observed but can provide hints of new physics. The presence of such new and exotic particles can be long-lived and thereby travel longer distances before creating observable signatures in the CMS detector. Using the full dataset acquired from the 2015-2018 run, the CMS experiment has placed stringent constraints that bound the phase space for the signal-like evidence of long-lived particles. These analyses demonstrate the potential for discovery as LHC data taking operations continue in FY 2023. 295Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationDouble advances for Cosmic Frontier dark energy experiments (Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics). The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the first of the next generation, precision dark energy surveys. DESI, the world's most advanced multi-object spectrograph, started its full 5-year scientific survey in May 2021. DESI will carry out a spectroscopic survey of roughly 30 million distant galaxies and quasars, which is ten times more than the previous generation of spectroscopic surveys. With the three-dimensional map derived from these data, DESI will measure the expansion history of the last 8 billion years to better than 0.3 percent precision. These distance measurements will allow the tightest constraints to date on the nature of the dark energy that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In addition to the expansion history, DESI will place the most precise limits on the sum of neutrino masses, provide new tests of inflationary models, and measure the growth rate of large-scale structure in the universe to test models of dark energy. Meanwhile, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Camera (LSSTCam), fabricated for the next generation Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a joint DOE and NSF partnership, completed its MIE funded construction phase in 2021. The LSSTCam will complete testing at SLAC before shipment to Chile for integration on the telescope, followed by commissioning of the entire system. DOE and NSF will also partner for the operations phase, to carry out the ten-year LSST imaging survey which is expected to start in 2024. Emerging Technologies: Superconducting Quantum Materials and Interdisciplinary Physics).The FNAL-led SQMS Center established a multidisciplinary collaboration comprised of more than 250 experts from twenty partner institutions, spanning from U.S. national labs, academia and industry. The Center has successfully accomplished more than 65 new hires, and new fellowships and internship programs have been created and executed, with emphasis on training a new generation of diverse quantum workforce. \u0003 High Coherence Quantum Devices: 2D qubits from Rigetti computing have been integrated for the first time, demonstrating a record coherence time of the integrated qubitsystem approximately 40 times above the state of the art. The combined system has now successfully demonstratedquantum operation and constitutes the first important milestone for a 3D SRF-based quantum computer. A round robintesting program is executed, where qubits are traveling from Rigetti to NIST to FNAL to underground facilities in Italy,for the first large scale systematic benchmarking study of qubit performance. \u0003 Physics and Sensing: New schemes for axion and dark matter detection based on the unique SRF high coherence devices have been proposed. Several tests have been carried out to understand the feasibility of such schemes, and forthe first time Nb3Sn cavities have shown to remain superconducting in high magnetic fields, offering an importantpathway to improve the sensitivity reach of several dark matter search experiments. The DarkSRF experiment hasestablished a record sensitivity in the search of dark photons and progress has been made in commissioning thisexperiment in a dilution fridge. \u0003 Algorithms: Quantum simulation of high energy physics has been a key area of research for SQMS. Principal investigators tackled the simulation of dihedral gauge theories on digital quantum computers, which represents a newmulti-institution collaboration (FNAL, NASA, Rigetti). In co-design with the SRF based systems under development atthe SQMS Center, recent results demonstrate a theoretical approach to studying field theories using a qubit-basedsimulator. Construction crews start lowering equipment a mile underground for excavation for Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (Construction).The FNAL-hosted Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an enormous international scientific effort. More than 1,300 collaborators from over 200 institutions in 33 countries plus CERN aim to shed light on elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos\u2014and possibly the nature of matter itself. DUNE is also going to be physically enormous. The experiment will send the world's most intense high-energy neutrino beam from the near site in Batavia, Illinois to huge particle detectors 800 miles away at SURF in Lead, South Dakota. Each of the two neutrino detector modules will be four-stories high and over 200 feet long. Construction crews will excavate almost 800,000 tons of rock to create the gigantic caverns of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) that will house these detectors. Two years of pre-excavation work was completed, building the necessary systems to move excavated rock from a mile underground to the surface, crush it and then transport it on a 4,200-foot conveyor system for deposit in the Lead Open Cut, in accordance with the wishes of local Native American tribes. On April 5, 2021, Thyssen Mining, the company contracted to carry out the excavation, received the green light to start underground work. Everything required to excavate the LBNF caverns in South Dakota, and build the future particle detectors, must be lowered a mile below the surface of the Earth through a 13- by 5-foot shaft compartment 296Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationand then assembled underground, like a ship in a bottle. Thyssen conducted the first underground blast in June. The main cavern excavation work began in August 2021 and will continue for two-and-a-half years. Successful tests pave the way for FNAL's next-generation particle accelerator; FNAL's new Accelerator Science Program to Increase Representation in Engineering (ASPIRE) fellowship for underrepresented students aims to develop the next generation of accelerator engineers (Construction).The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project includes building a new superconducting proton accelerator to replace the aging linac that serves as the frontend of the Fermilab Accelerator Complex. Once complete, PIP-II will be one of the highest-power linear accelerators in the world. It is the first accelerator project in the U.S. with significant international contributions, with partner institutions in France, India, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The project successfully completed the operation of the PIP-II Integration Test Facility in 2021. The purpose of the facility was to demonstrate the functionality of the normal conducting frontend of PIP-II by accelerating a proton beam through the frontend and into two prototype superconducting cyromodules. The prototype cryomodules performed as predicted by simulations validating the cryomodules' designs. The facility will now be converted to a cryomodule test-stand where the bulk of the PIP-II cryomodules will be tested with high voltage before being installed into the accelerator. PIP-II led the development of the ASPIRE fellowship to provide immersive learning experiences at FNAL for undergraduate and masters-level engineering students who are underrepresented in accelerator engineering fields, including Black, LatinX and Indigenous identities, and women. ASPIRE is a partnership between FNAL and colleges and universities. The ASPIRE Fellows participate in the design, development, and construction of world-leading particle accelerators, initially on the PIP-I I project. A primary goal of the ASPIRE program is to develop participants into competitive candidates for full-time employment in particle accelerator and related fields upon fellowship completion. 297Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Energy Frontier Experimental Physics Description The Energy Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram's focus is to support the U.S. researchers participating in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) program. The LHC hosts two large multi-purpose particle detectors, ATLAS and CMS, which are partially supported by DOE and NSF and are used by large international collaborations of scientists. U.S. researchers participating in the LHC program account for approximately 20 percent and 25 percent of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, respectively, and play critical leadership roles in all aspects of each experiment. Data collected by ATLAS and CMS are used to address three of the five science drivers as explained below: \u0003 Use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson is a key ingredient responsible for generating the mass forfundamental particles. Experiments at the LHC continue to actively measure the Higgs's properties to establish its exactcharacter and to discover if there are additional effects that are the result of new physics beyond the Standard Model. \u0003 Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles. Researchers at the LHC probe for evidence of what lies beyond the Standard Model such as supersymmetry,mechanisms for black hole production, extra dimensions, and other exotic phenomena. The upgraded LHC detectorswill be increasingly more sensitive to potential deviations from the Standard Model that may be exposed by the highestenergy collisions in the world. \u0003 Identify the new physics of dark matter. LHC collisions may possibly produce dark matter particles, and their general properties may be inferred through thebehavior of the accompanying normal matter. This \"indirect\" detection of dark matter is complementary to the ultra-sensitive direct detection experiments in the Cosmic Frontier and Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics subprograms. Research The Energy Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram's Research activity supports groups at U.S. academic and research institutions and national laboratories. These groups, as part of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, typically have a broad portfolio of responsibilities and leadership roles in support of R&D, experimental design, fabrication, commissioning, operations, and maintenance, and performing scientific simulations and data analyses. This activity also supports Advanced Computing to ensure broad access to exascale computing resources for HEP researchers. DOE selects research efforts with the highest scientific merit and potential impact based on a competitive peer-review process. In FY 2022, HEP plans to conduct an external peer review of the Energy Frontier laboratory research groups. The findings from the reviews in combination with input on strategic directions from regular, open, community workshops will inform funding decisions of the Energy Frontier subprogram in subsequent years. Facility Operations and Experimental Support U.S. LHC Detector Operations supports the maintenance of U.S.-supplied detector systems for the ATLAS and CMS detectors in the LHC at CERN, and the U.S.-based computer infrastructure used by U.S. physicists to analyze LHC data, including the Tier 1 computing centers at BNL and FNAL. The Tier 1 centers provide around-the-clock support for the worldwide LHC Computing Grid; are responsible for storing a portion of raw and processed data; perform large-scale data reprocessing; and store the corresponding output. Projects CERN is implementing a major upgrade to the LHC machine to increase the particle collision rate by a factor of at least five, to explore new physics beyond its current reach. Through the HL-LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project, HEP is contributing to this upgrade by constructing and delivering the next-generation of superconducting accelerator components, where U.S. scientists have critical expertise. After the upgrade, the HL-LHC collisions will lead to very challenging conditions in which the ATLAS and CMS detectors must operate. As a result, the HL-LHC ATLAS and HL-LHC CMS Detector Upgrades are critical investments to enable the experiments to operate for an additional decade and collect at least a factor of ten more data. 299High Energy Physics Energy Frontier Experimental Physics Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 Request Explanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Energy $194,150 $204,620 +$10,470 Research $68,000 $70,833 +$2,833 Funding continues to support U.S. leadership roles in all aspects of the ATLAS and CMS experimental programs, completing analysis of the large datasets collected during the previous LHC run that ended in FY 2019, and preparing for the next LHC run, which begins in FY 2022.

Science/High Energy Physics 301 FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics Description The Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram supports the investigation of some of the rarest processes in nature, including rare interactions of fundamental particles or subtle effects requiring large data sets to observe and measure. This HEP subprogram focuses on using high-power particle beams or other intense particle sources such as reactors to make precision measurements of fundamental particle properties. These measurements in turn probe for new phenomena that are not directly observable at the Energy Frontier, either because they occur at much higher energies and their effects may only be seen indirectly, or because their interactions are too weak for detection in high-background conditions at the LHC. Data collected from Intensity Frontier experiments are used to address three of the five science drivers as explained below: \u0003 Pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass. Of all known particles, neutrinos are perhaps the most enigmatic and certainly the most elusive. HEP researchersworking at U.S. facilities discovered all the three known varieties of neutrinos. HEP supports research into fundamentalneutrino properties that may reveal important clues about the unification of forces and the very early history of theuniverse. The Intensity Frontier portfolio of neutrino experiments will advance neutrino physics while serving as aninternational platform for the R&D activities necessary to establish the U.S. hosted international LBNF/DUNE. \u0003 Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles. Several observed phenomena are not described by the Standard Model, including the imbalance of matter andantimatter in the universe today. Precision measurements of the properties of known particles may reveal informationabout what new particles and forces might explain these discrepancies and whether the known forces unify at energiesbeyond the reach of the LHC. \u0003 Identify the new physics of dark matter. The lack of experimental evidence from current generation dark matter detectors has led to proposed theoreticalmodels with new particles and forces that rarely interact with normal matter. These theoretical particles and forces areeffectively invisible to conventional experiments but may connect to the cosmic dark matter. Experiments use intenseaccelerator beams at national laboratories outfitted with highly efficient high-rate detectors to explore thesetheoretical models. Research The Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram's Research activity supports groups at U.S. academic and research institutions and national laboratories. These groups, as part of scientific collaborations, typically have a broad portfolio of responsibilities and leadership roles in support of R&D, experimental design, fabrication, commissioning, operations, and maintenance, and they perform scientific simulations and physics data analyses. This activity also supports Advanced Computing to ensure broad access to exascale computing resources for HEP researchers. DOE selects research efforts with the highest scientific merit and potential impact based on a competitive peer review process. In FY 2018, HEP conducted an external peer review of the Intensity Frontier laboratory research groups; the next review is planned for FY 2023. In FY 2019, HEP conducted a Basic Research Needs (BRN) oo workshop to assess the science landscape and new opportunities for dark matter particle searches and identified three priority research directions across the Intensity and Cosmic Frontiers that are beyond the current HEP program's sensitivity. The findings from the reviews and BRN workshop in combination with input on strategic directions from regular and open community workshops will inform funding decisions of the Intensity Frontier subprogram in subsequent years. The largest component of the Intensity Frontier subprogram is the support for research in accelerator-based neutrino physics centered at FNAL with multiple experiments running concurrently in two separate neutrino beams with different beam energies. The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam is used by the NuMI Off-Axis e Appearance (NOvA) experiment. The Booster Neutrino Beam is used by the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, which includes near (SBND) and far (ICARUS) detectors to definitively address measurements of additional neutrino types beyond the three currently oo The \"Basic Research Needs for Dark Matter Small Projects New Initiatives\" report can be found at: https://science.osti.gov/hep/ Community- Resources/Reports 303Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationdescribed in the Standard Model. LBNF/DUNE will be the centerpiece of a U.S. hosted world-leading neutrino research facility, using the world's most intense neutrino beam and large, sensitive underground detectors to make transformative discoveries. The Research activity includes efforts at FNAL and at other international facilities, including experiments in Japan, to search for rare processes to detect physics beyond the reach of the LHC. The Muon g-2 experiment at FNAL, with four times better precision than previously achieved, is following up on hints of new physics from an earlier experiment. The Mu2e experiment will search for extremely rare muon decays that, if detected, will provide clear evidence of new physics. The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan is complementary to NOvA, and a combined measurement from these two experiments will offer the best available information on neutrino oscillations prior to LBNF/DUNE. At the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan, the Belle II experiment searches for new physics produced in electron-positron collisions at the SuperKEKB accelerator. Oak Ridge National Laboratory hosts two HEP experimental efforts to measure neutrino properties and to search for new physics. The experiments leverage the Spallation Neutron Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor facilities, via the byproducts of neutron production, which are muon-type neutrinos and electron-type anti-neutrinos, respectively. Facility Operations and Experimental Support The Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram supports several distinct facility operations and experimental activities, the largest of which is the Fermilab Accelerator Complex User Facility. This activity includes the operations of al l accelerators and beamlines at FNAL, the operation of the detectors that use those accelerators, and the computing support needed by both the accelerators and detectors. General Plant Project (GPP) and Accelerator Improvement Project (AIP) funding supports improvements to FNAL facilities. HEP has a cooperative agreement with the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority (SDSTA), a quasi-state agency created by the State of South Dakota for the operation of the SURF. Experiments supported by DOE, NSF, and private entities are conducted there, including the HEP-supported LZ experiment. SURF will be the home of the DUNE far site detectors being built by the LBNF/DUNE project. The SURF cooperative agreement provides basic services to LBNF/DUNE, and other experiments located at the site. Projects In support of LBNF/DUNE, a lease with SDSTA provides the framework for DOE and FNAL to construct federally funded buildings and facilities on non-federal land and to establish a long-term (multi-decade) arrangement for DOE and FNAL to use SDSTA space to host the DUNE neutrino detector. Other Project Costs (OPC) have been identified by the LBNF/DUNE project and DOE for the cost of SURF services used by LBNF/DUNE beyond the basic operational support covered by the SURF cooperative agreement mentioned above. FNAL will upgrade its dated accelerator control system with a modern system, which is maintainable, sustainable, and capable of utilizing advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create a high-performance accelerator for the future. The Accelerator Controls Operations Research Network (ACORN) MIE upgrade project is critical as the control system of the Fermilab Accelerator Complex initiates particle beam production; controls beam energy and intensity; steers particle beams to their ultimate destination; measures beam parameters; and monitors beam transport through the complex to ensure safe, reliable, and effective operations. 304High Energy Physics Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 Request Explanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Intensity $63,082 $67,644 +$4,562 on short- and long-baseline neutrino experiments, muon and rare physics processes experiments, and technology studies and science planning for Mu2e and LBNF/DUNE.

Science/High Energy Physics 306 FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification High Energy Physics Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics Description The Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram uses measurements of naturally occurring cosmic particles and observations of the universe to probe fundamental physics questions and offer new insight about the nature of dark matter, cosmic acceleration in the forms of dark energy and inflation, neutrino properties, and other phenomena. The activities in this subprogram use diverse tools and technologies, from ground-based observatories and space-based missions to large detectors deep underground to address four of the five science drivers as described below: \u0003 Identify the new physics of dark matter. Experimental evidence reveals that dark matter accounts for five times as much matter in the universe as ordinarymatter. A staged series of direct-detection experiments search for the leading theoretical candidate particles usingmultiple technologies to cover a wide range in mass with increasing sensitivity. Accelerator-based dark matter searchesperformed in the Intensity Frontier and the Energy Frontier subprograms are complementary to these experiments. \u0003 Understand cosmic acceleration: dark energy and inflation. The nature of dark energy, which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe, continues as one of the mostperplexing questions in science. Together, dark energy and dark matter comprise 95 percent of the matter and energyin the universe. The cosmic microwave background (CMB), the oldest observable light in the universe, informsresearchers about the era of inflation, the rapid expansion in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. Researchersuse measurements of this ancient CMB light and light from distant galaxies to map the acceleration of the universeover time and to unravel the nature of dark energy and inflation. \u0003 Pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass. The study of the largest physical structures in the Universe may reveal the properties of particles with the smallestknown cross section, the neutrinos. Experiments studying dark energy and the CMB will put constraints on the numberof neutrino species and their masses, as the properties of neutrinos lead to changes in these other measurements.These measurements are complementary to the ultra-sensitive measurements made in the Intensity Frontier. \u0003 Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles. High-energy cosmic rays and gamma rays probe energy scales well beyond what may be produced with man-madeparticle accelerators, albeit not in a controlled experimental setting. Searches for new phenomena and indirect signalsof dark matter in these surveys may yield surprising discoveries about the fundamental nature of the universe. Research The Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics subprogram's Research activity supports groups at U.S. academic and research institutions and national laboratories who perform experiments using instruments on the surface, deep underground, and in space. These groups, as part of scientific collaborations, typically have a broad portfolio of responsibilities and leadersh ip roles in support of R&D, experimental design, fabrication, commissioning, operations, and maintenance. In addition, they perform scientific simulations and data analyses on the experiments in the subprogram. DOE selects research efforts with the highest scientific merit and potential impact based on a competitive peer-review process. In FY 2021, HEP conducted an external peer review of the Cosmic Frontier laboratory research groups. In early FY 2019, HEP conducted a Basic Research Needs (BRN) pp workshop to assess the science landscape and new opportunities for dark matter particle searches made possible by recent technology and theoretical advancements. The scientists identified three priority research directions across the Intensity and Cosmic Frontiers that are beyond the current HEP program's sensitivity. The findings from the reviews and BRN workshop, in combination with input on strategic directions from regular, open community studies, inform funding decisions in subsequent years. Two complementary next-generation, dark energy \"Stage 4\" experiments will provide increased precision in measuring the history of the expansion of the universe. The Dark Energy Spectrographic Instrument (DESI) collaboration is carrying out a five-year survey to make light-spectrum measurements of 30 million galaxies and quasars that span over two-thirds of the history of the universe. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will carry out a ten-year wide-field, ground-based optical and near- pp The \"Basic Research Needs for Dark Matter Small Projects New Initiatives\" report can be found at: https://science.osti.gov/hep/ Community- Resources/Reports 307Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationinfrared imaging Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) that will be used by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). Together the data sets will enable studies on whether acceleration of the expansion of the universe is due to an unknown force, a cosmological constant, or if Einstein's General Theory of Relativity breaks down at large distances. The next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background Stage 4 (CMB-S4) experiment will have unprecedented sensitivity and precision, and will enable researchers to peer directly into the inflationary era in the early moments of the universe, at a time scale unreachable by other types of experiments. Research activities support the design and science optimization of the planned experiment. Two complementary next-generation, dark matter particle search experiments use complementary technologies to search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) over a wide range of masses, with LZ searching for heavier WIMPs and SuperCDMS-SNOLAB sensitive to lighter WIMPs. A third next-generation experiment, ADMX-G2, searches for axions, another type of possible dark matter particles. To address the priority research directions aligned with the BRN study, technology studies and planning efforts are being carried out for four potential small dark matter search projects in the Cosmic Frontier. Facility Operations and Experimental Support This activity supports the DOE share of expenses necessary to carry out the successful operating phase of Cosmic Frontier experiments, including instrumentation maintenance, data collection, and data processing and serving. These experiments are typically not sited at national laboratories, but at ground-based observatories and facilities, in space, or deep underground. Support is provided for the experiments currently operating and for pre-operations activities for the next-generation experiments in the design or fabrication phase. HEP conducts planning reviews to ensure readiness as each experiment transitions from project fabrication to science operations, and periodic reviews during the operations phase. DOE's DESI instrumentation is mounted and started its five-year science survey in May 2021 on the NSF's Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory with both the instrumentation and telescope operations supported by DOE. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, using the DOE-provided three billion-pixel LSST camera (LSSTCam), is being commissioned in Chile. DOE and NSF are full partners in the Observatory's operations phase to carry out the ten-year LSST survey, planned to start in late FY 2024. SLAC manages the Observatory's U.S. Data Facility as part of DOE's responsibilities during the operations phase. The LZ dark matter detector began science operations underground in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota in December 2021. The SuperCDMS-SNOLAB dark matter detector, located at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Sudbury, Canada, is finishing pre-operations activities and is expected to start full science operations in late 2023. Projects The next-generation CMB-S4 experiment is a planned partnership with NSF. LBNL leads the efforts for the DOE scope of the CMB-S4 project, which will consist of an array of small and large telescopes working in concert at two locations, the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and the Atacama high desert in Chile. Both arrays are required to reach the full science capabilities. 308Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY $97,591 $97,102 -$489Research $47,091 $48,512 +$1,421Funding supports core research efforts in all phases of experiments.

This research is essential for proper interpretation and understanding of the experimental research activities described in other HEP subprog rams, and cuts across all five science drivers and the Energy, Intensity, Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics, and Advanced Technology R&D subprograms. Theory The HEP theory activity supports world-leading Research groups at U.S. academic and research institutions and national laboratories. Both university and laboratory research groups play important roles in addressing the leading research areas discussed above. Laboratory groups are typically more focu sed on data-driven theoretical investigations and precise calculations of experimentally observable quantities. Universi ty groups usually focus on building models of physics beyond the Standard Model and studying their phenomenology, as well as on formal and mathematical theory. DOE selects research efforts with the highest scientific merit and potential impact based on a competitive peer-review process. HEP conducted an external peer review of the Theory laboratory research groups in FY 2018; the next review is planned for FY 2023. The findings from this review, in combination with input on strategic directions from regular, open, community studies as well as a planned, future Basic Research Needs workshop, will inform funding decisions in subsequent years. This activity supports the Advanced Computing initiative (formerly referred to as Integrated Computational and Data Infrastructure) to ensure broad access to exascale computing re sources. This activity will also support the Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for diverse students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. science and technology ecosystem and the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative to provide focused investment on enhancing research on clean energy, climate, and related topics at inority erving nstitutions.

These activities are necessary for continued progress in high energy physics. Longer-term multi-purpose accelerator technology development, applicable to fields beyond HEP, is carried out by the Accelerator R&D and Production program. General Accelerator R&D The HEP General Accelerator R&D (GARD) activity supports the science underlying the technologies used in particle accelerators and storage rings, as well as the fundamental physics of charged particle beams. Long-term research goals include developing technologies to enable breakthroughs in particle accelerator size, cost, beam intensity, and control. The GARD activity supports groups at U.S. academic and research institutions and national laboratories performing research activities categorized into five thrust areas: 1) accelerator and beam physics; 2) advanced acceleration concepts; 3) particle sources and targetry; 4) radio-frequency acceleration technology; and 5) superconducting magnets and materials. A community study aimed at establishing a technology roadmap for the accelerator and beam physics thrust is planned for late FY 2022. Community studies for the other HEP GARD thrusts were completed in the past five years. qq DOE selects research efforts with the highest scientific merit and potential impact based on a competitive peer-review process. In FY 2018, HEP conducted an external peer review of the GARD laboratory research groups; the next review is planned for FY 2023. The findings from this review, in combination with input on strategic directions from regular, open, community studies as well as future Basic Research Needs workshops, will inform funding decisions in subsequent years. The state-of-the-art SC facilities attract the world's leading researchers, bringing knowledge and ideas that enhance U.S. science and create high technology jobs. As competing accelerator-based facilities are built abroad, they are beginning to draw away scientific and technical talent. Sustaining world-class accelerator-based SC facilities requires continued, transformative advances in accelerator science and technology, and a workforce capable of performing leading accelerator research for future application. In coordination with the Office of Accelerator R&D and Production, the SC Accelerator Science and Technology Initiative (ASTI) will address these needs by reinforcing high-risk, high-reward accelerator R&D that will invest in SC facilities to stay at the global forefront and develop a world-leading workforce to build and operate future generations of facilities. As a part of ASTI, ASCR, BES, FES, HEP, and NP will enhance coordination and jointly pursue accelerator R&D topics that will have a strong impact on the scientific capabilities of SC facilities. The GARD activity supports the highly successful U.S. Particle Accelerator School (USPAS). HEP conducted a review of the USPAS Program in late FY 2020 and the review committee found its performance to be excellent. GARD also supports the Traineeship Program for Accelerator Science and Technology to revitalize education, training, and innovation in the physics of particle accelerators for the benefit of HEP and other SC programs that rely on these enabling technologies. The Traineeship Program is aimed at university and national laboratory consortia to provide the academic training and research experience needed to meet DOE's anticipated workforce needs. HEP holds a competition for traineeship awards for graduate level students to increase workforce development in areas of critical need. These traineeships leverage existing GARD research activities as well as the capabilities and assets of DOE laboratories.

All Total Estimated Costs (TEC) are funded in this subprogram, including engineering, design, and construction. 18-SC-42, Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II), FNAL The PIP-II project will enhance the Fermilab Accelerator Complex to enable it to deliver higher-power proton beams to the neutrino-generating target for groundbreaking discovery in neutrino physics. The project will design and construct an 800 megaelectronvolt (MeV) superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) proton linear accelerator and beam transfer line. The PIP-II project also will modify the existing FNAL Booster, Recycler, and Main Injector synchrotrons downstream from the new linear accelerator to accept the increased beam intensity. Some of the new components and the cryoplant will be provided through international, in-kind contributions. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-3A (Approve Long-lead Procurement), approved March 16, 2021; it followed three months after CD-2 (Approve Performance Baseline), approved on December 14, 2020, with a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $978,000,000. The funding profile supports the approved TPC of $978,000,000. The CD-4 milestone date is 1Q FY 2033. The PIP-II project is inclusive of a subproject, Early Conventional Facilities (ECF) for PIP-II, that received Critical Decisio n CD-2/3 (Approval of Subproject Baseline and Start of Construction) on July 17, 2020. The TPC for the ECF subproject is$36,000,000 which will be funded out of the same line-item appropriation as the PIP-II project. 11-SC-40, Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, FNAL The LBNF/DUNE construction project is a federal, state, private, and international partnership developing and implementing the technologies of particle accelerators and detectors to enable world-leading research into the fundamental physics of neutrinos, which are the most ubiquitous particles in the universe while at the same time among the most mysterious. LBNF/DUNE will study the transformations of muon neutrinos that occur as they travel from FNAL, where they are produced in a high-energy proton beam, to a large detector in South Dakota, 800 miles away from FNAL. The experiment will analyze the rare, flavor-changing transformations of neutrinos in flight, from one lepton flavor to another, which are expected to help explain the fundamental physics of neutrinos and the puzzling imbalance of matter and antimatter that enables our existence in a matter-dominated universe. The LBNF/DUNE project is a national flagship particle physics initiative and will be the first-ever large-scale, international science facility hosted by the U.S. The LBNF/DUNE project consists of two multinational collaborative efforts. LBNF is responsible for the beamline at FNAL and other experimental and civil infrastructure at FNAL and at the SURF in South Dakota. DUNE is an international scientific collaboration responsible for defining the scientific goals and technical requirements for the beam and detectors, as well as the design, construction and commissioning of the detectors and subsequent research. DOE's High Energy Physics program manages both activities as a single, line-item construction project\u2014LBNF/DUNE-US. LBNF, with DOE/FNAL leadership and participation by a small number of international partners including CERN, will construct a megawatt-class neutrino source and related facilities at FNAL (the \"Near Site\"), as well as underground caverns and cryogenic facilities in South Dakota (the \"Far Site\") needed to house the DUNE detectors. DUNE has international leadership and participation by over 1,300 scientists and engineers from over 200 institutions in over 30 countries. DOE will fund less than one-third of DUNE under the name DUNE-US. The most recent approved DOE Order 413.3B Critical Decision is CD-3A, approval for Initial Far Site Construction. Following this approval, excavation and construction for the LBNF Far Site conventional facilities started to mitigate risks and minimize delays for providing a facility ready to accept detectors for installation. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range is $1,260,000,000 to $1,860,000,000, as approved on September 1, 2016, with a preliminary CD-4 date of 4Q FY 2030. 321Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe project completed the reliability improvements needed to support excavation in early 2021 and the excavation work began in April 2021 under the CD-3A authorization. Updated planning and analysis led to an increased scope and TPC for LBNF/DUNE of $3,000,000,000, which is being evaluated prior to establishing the project baseline. The scale of LBNF/DUNE, annual funding levels, and research and development needs have resultedin the major scope elements of the project maturing at different rates. Baselining the entire scope of the project at once introduced too many uncertainties and was no longer viewed as being in the best interest of DOE. Therefore, a subproject tailoring approach in accordance with DOE Order 413.3B is being developed to reorganize the project's scope into several independent subprojects for improved planning and management control. The definition of the subprojects and the approach to managing subprojects will be approved at CD-1RR (reaffirmation and approval of the CD-1 cost range). The first subproject to be baselined will include the completion of cavern excavation at the Far Site. 11-SC-41, Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment, FNAL Mu2e, under construction at FNAL, will search for evidence that a muon can undergo direct (neutrinoless) conversion into an electron, a process that would violate lepton flavor conservation and probe new physics at energy scales beyond the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider. If observed, this major discovery would signal the existence of new particles or new forces beyond the Standard Model. The Mu2e project completed its technical design phase (CD-3) on July 14, 2016, and moved into full construction at that time. Civil construction of the underground detector housing and the surface building for the experiment were completed in 2017. The funding profile through FY 2019 supported the current TPC of $273,677,000 and the currently approved CD-4 milestone date of 1Q FY 2023. However, the approved baseline schedule can no longer be met. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unplanned work shutdowns and inefficiencies at the participating universities and laboratories in FY 2020-2021. Further schedule delays were incurred because of actions needed to correct performance issues delaying fabrication of the particle tracking detector and two superconducting magnets being fabricated by a vendor. A baseline change was recommended by an Independent Project Review in February 2021. The Baseline Change Proposal (BCP) is being developed but is not yet submitted or approved. In anticipation of approval of the BCP, $2,000,000 of TEC funding was appropriated in FY 2021, $13,000,000 of TEC funding is requested in FY 2022, and $2,000,000 of TEC funding is requested in FY 2023. None of these additional funds will be available to spend until the BCP is approved and the project is re-baselined. 322Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Construction Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes +$41,000 Funding supports completion of civil engineering design for the conventional facilities, technical design and prototyping for the accelerator components, and initiation of Early Conventional Facilities (ECF) subproject construction, as well as long-lead procurement and procurement for technical systems when design is final and construction is authorized by CD-3.The Request will support initiation of civil construction for the balance of the linear accelerator facilities as well as fabrication of technical systems when designs are final, and construction is authorized by CD-3.Funding increase will support the transition from the design phase of PIP-II, from procurement of the Early Conventional Facilities subproject for the cryogenic plant and from site preparation, to initiation of construction for the linear accelerator facilities as well as fabrication of technical components for the accelerator. 11-SC-40, Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground NeutrinoExperiment, FNAL $171,000 $176,000 +$5,000 Funding supports completion of the Far Site civil construction activities for pre-excavation and the beginning of excavation activities for the underground equipment caverns and connecting drifts (tunnels), as well as design and procurement activities for Far Site cryogenics systems.

CD-3 was approved on December 21, 2020, to complete the production of the remaining accelerator components for theupgrade. Following the major upgrade, the CERN LHC machine will further increase the particle collision rate by at least afactor of five to explore new physics beyond its current reach. This project will deliver components for which U.S. scientistshave critical expertise: interaction region focusing quadrupole magnets, and special superconducting radiofrequency crabcavities that can generate transverse electric fields. The magnets will be assembled at LBNL, BNL, and FNAL, exploitingspecial expertise and unique capabilities at each laboratory. The FY 2023 Request for TEC funding of $30,000,000 willcontinue to support the production of quadrupole magnets and crab cavities and maintain international schedulesynchronization. The project was stalled by shutdowns at the national laboratories due to COVID-19 and has seen increasedcosts as a result. In all other respects the project is performing well. The Office of Science (SC) plans a rebaseline review i n late FY 2022 to evaluate the needs for additional funding. High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider ATLAS Detector Upgrade Project (HL-LHC ATLAS) The HL-LHC ATLAS project received CD-1 approval on September 21, 2018, with an estimated cost range of $149,000,000 to $181,000,000, and received CD-3A approval on October 16, 2019. CD-2 is planned for early FY 2023. The ATLAS detector will integrate a higher amount of data per run by at least a factor of ten compared to the period prior to the HL-LHC upgrades, making the physical conditions in which the detectors run very challenging. To operate for an additional decade in these new conditions, the ATLAS detector will require upgrades to the silicon pixel and strip tracker detectors, the muon detector systems, the calorimeter detectors and associated electronics, and the trigger and data acquisition systems. The National Science Foundation (NSF) approved support for a Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction (MREFC) project in FY 2020 to provide different scope to the HL-LHC ATLAS detector upgrade. DOE and NSF are coordinating their contributions to avoid duplication. The FY 2023 Request for TEC funding of $27,500,000 will focus on completion of the final design in anticipation of approval of construction (CD-3) and ramp-up of fabrication activities. The project was stalled by shutdowns at the national laboratories due to COVID-19 and has seen increased costs as a result. SC will evaluate the need for additional funding when the project is baselined in early FY 2023. High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider CMS Detector Upgrade Project (HL-LHC CMS) The HL-LHC CMS project received CD-1 approval on December 19, 2019, with an estimated cost range of $144,100,000 to $183,000,000, and received CD-3A approval on June 8, 2020. CD-2 is planned for early FY 2023. The CMS detector will integrate a higher amount of data per run by at least a factor of ten compared to the period prior to the HL-LHC upgrades, making the physical conditions in which the detectors run very challenging. To operate for an additional decade in these new conditions, the CMS detector will require upgrades to the silicon pixel tracker detectors, outer tracker detector, the muon detector systems, the calorimeter detectors and associated electronics, the trigger and data acquisition systems, and the addition of a novel timing detector. NSF approved support for a MREFC Project in FY 2020 to provide different scope to the HL-LHC CMS detector upgrade. DOE and NSF are coordinating their contributions to avoid duplication. The FY 2023 Request for TEC funding of $27,500,000 will focus on completion of the final design in anticipation of approval of construction (CD-3) and ramp-up of fabrication activities. The project was stalled by shutdowns at the national laboratories due to COVID-19 and has seen increased costs as a result. SC will evaluate the need for additional funding when the project is baselined in early FY 2023. Intensity Frontier Experimental Physics MIE: Accelerator Controls Operations Research Network (ACORN) The ACORN project received CD-0 approval on August 28, 2020, with an estimated cost range of $100,000,000 to $142,000,000. This project will replace FNAL's dated accelerator control system with a modern system which is maintainable, sustainable, and capable of utilizing advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create a high-performance accelerator for the future. The control system of the Fermilab Accelerator Complex initiates particle beam production; controls beam energy and intensity; steers particle beams to their ultimate destination; measures beam parameters; and monitors beam transport through the complex to ensure safe, reliable, and effective operations. ACORN 328Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationwill provide FNAL with an accelerator control system that will be compatible with PIP-II. FNAL plans to collaborate with other national labs that have experience with accelerator control systems. This project is expected to receive CD-1 approval in 2Q FY 2023 and CD-2 approval in FY 2024. The FY 2023 Request for TEC funding of $1,000,000 will fund system design and other related engineering activities. Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics MIE: Cosmic Microwave Background Stage 4 (CMB-S4) The CMB-S4 project received CD-0 approval on July 25, 2019, with an estimated cost range of $320,000,000 to $395,000,000. The project is expected to be carried out as a partnership with NSF, with DOE as the lead agency and a distribution of scope planned to be determined by FY 2023. The project consists of fabricating an array of small and large telescopes at two locations: the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and the Atacama high desert in Chile. LBNL was selected in August 2020 to lead the efforts in providing the DOE scope for the project. While no TEC funding is requested in the FY 2023 Request, $1,000,000 of OPC funding will enable continued conceptual design and activities needed to inform CD-1 approval as well as planning for the associated systems and infrastructure. 329Science/High Energy Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHigh Energy Physics Construction Projects Summary (dollars in thousands) Total Prior YearsFY 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized 2021 Enacted 18-SC-42, Proton Improvement Plan II Total Estimated Cost (TEC) 891,200 81,000 79,000 90,000 120,000 +41,000Other Project Cost (OPC) 86,800 73,594 - - - 79,000 173,000 180,000 180,000 +7,000 11-SC-41, Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment Total Estimated Cost (TEC) 281,000 250,000 2,000 13,000 2,000 - Other Project Cost (OPC) 23,677 23,677 - - - - Total Project Cost (TPC) 304,677 273,677 2,000 13,000 2,000 - Total, Construction Cost (TEC) N/A N/A 254,000 283,000 302,000 +48,000 Note for Mu2e: - In anticipation of approval of the Baseline Change Proposal (BCP), $2,000,000 of TEC funding was appropriated in FY 2021, $13,0 00,000 of TEC funding is requested in FY 2022, and $2,000,000 of TEC funding is requested in FY 2023.

Energy Physics/ 18-SC-42, Plan II (PIP-II), FNAL Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Project is for Design and Construction 1. Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Proton Improvement Project II (PIP-II) is $120,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The project has an approved Total Project Cost (TPC) of $978,000,000. The PIP-II project will enhance the Fermilab Accelerator Complex to enable it to deliver higher-power proton beams to the neutrino-generating target for groundbreaking discovery in neutrino physics. The project will design and construct an 800 megaelectronvolt (MeV) superconducting radio frequency (SRF) proton linear accelerator and beam transfer line. The PIP-II project also will modify the existing Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Booster, Recycler, and Main Injector synchrotrons downstream from the new linear accelerator to accept the increased beam intensity. Some of the new components and the cryo-plant will be provided through international, in-kind contributions. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2018. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-3A (Approve Long-lead Procurement), approved March 16, 2021; it followed three months after CD-2 (Approve Performance Baseline), approved on December 14, 2020, with a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $978,000,000. The PIP-II project was restructured in FY 2020 with a subproject, \"Early Conventional Facilities (ECF),\" that received Critical Decision CD-2/3 (Approve Subproject Performance Baseline and Start of Construction) on July 17, 2020. The ECF subproject is a subsidiary subset of the PIP-II project, with TPC of $36,000,000. ECF will be funded out of the same line-item appropriation as the PIP-II project. All financial information for PIP-II is inclusive of ECF. Approve Start of Construction, CD-3, is anticipated in FY 2022, and the planned date for CD-4, Project Completion, is 1Q FY 2033. In FY 2021 construction was initiated by the ECF subproject for the building that will house the in-kind contribution of the cryoplant; the building is expected to be completed in calendar year 2022. Also in FY 2021, continued design and development work improved the maturity of the civil engineering and technical system designs, cost estimates, risk assessment and contingency plans, as well as the planning of technical prototypes for project risk mitigation. In FY 2021, the civil engineering design for the linear accelerator complex was completed. The PIP-II injector test was completed, a significant R&D program that reduced technical risk for the project. Assumptions were refined for the level of in-kind contributions from the international partner laboratories. Anticipated in-kind technical contributions from international partners total $330,000,000 (equivalent to DOE costing). Legally binding agreements with all countries but France have been signed to cover the planned work. The legally binding agreement with France has been drafted and signatures are expected in the summer of 2022. Non-binding Project Planning Documents (PPDs) that provide additional technical details beyond those provided in the legally binding agreements are being signed by the international partners; so far PPDs have been signed with Italian, Polish, and UK partner institutions. The FY 2022 Request of $90,000,000 supports completion of the ECF cryo-plant building and completion of CD-3, approval for site preparation and construction for the linear accelerator complex as well as initiation of preconstruction procurement for the accelerator's technical systems as designs are completed. The FY 2023 Request of $120,000,000 will support construction of the conventional facilities as well as continuation of procurement and fabrication for the technical systems.

The Test Facility has successfully completed its program and has been converted to acryomodule test stand for testing the cryomodules for the project. b) Cryoplant with storage and distribution system to support SRF Linac operation. The cryoplant is an in-kind contribution by the India DAE Labs that is similar to the cryoplant being designed and constructed for a high-intensity superconducting proton accelerator project in India. ss c) Beam Transfer Line from the Linac to the Booster Synchrotron, including accommodation of a beam dump and future delivery of beam to the FNAL Muon Campus. d) Modification of the Booster, Recycler and Main Injector synchrotrons to accommodate a 50 percent increase in beam intensity and construction of a new injection area in the Booster to accommodate 800-megaelectronvolt(MeV) injection. e) Civil construction of conventional facilities, including housings, service buildings, roads, access points and utilities with the special capabilities required for the linac and beam transport line. The linac housing will be constructedwith adequate length to accommodate the possibility of a future extension of the linac for beam energy up to 1GeV. A portion of the civil construction scope comprises the ECF subproject. That subproject scope includes thecryogenics plant building and site work. ECF subproject total estimated cost is $36,000,000; $8,000,000 FY 2022. (See footnotes in the Financial Schedule, Section 3 below.) Ifthe ECF subproject completes less than budget, DOE may authorize redistribution of those funds to remaining PIP-II project scope. Significant pieces of the Linac and cryogenic scope (a and b above) will be delivered as in-kind international contributions not funded by DOE. These include assembly and/or fabrication of Linac SRF components and the cryoplant. The rationale or motivation behind these contributions are institutional and/or industrial technical capability, and interest in SRF technology, as well as interest in LBNF/DUNE. The construction phase scope of in-kind contributions is divided between U.S. DOE national laboratories, India Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) Labs, Italy National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) Labs, French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)-National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3) Labs, UK Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Labs, and Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland, tentatively as indicated in the following table of Scope Responsibilities for PIP-II. tt ss See Section 8. tt See Section 8. Energy Physics/ 18-SC-42, The PIP-II project will enhance the Fermilab Accelerator Complex by providing the capability to deliver higher-power proton beams to the neutrino-generating target that serves the LBNF/DUNE programuu for groundbreaking discovery in neutrino physics, a major field of fundamental research in high energy particle physics. Increasing the neutrino beam intensity requires increasing the proton beam power on target. The higher proton beam power will come from a 1.2-megawatt (MW) beam on target over an energy range of 60-120 GeV, a significant increase of beam power beyond the current proton beam capability. The PIP-II project will provide more flexibility for future science-driven upgrades to the entire accelerator complex and increase the system's overall reliability by addressing some of the accelerator complex's elements that are far beyond their design life. PIP-II was identified as one of the highest priorities in the 10-year strategic plan for U.S. High Energy Physics developed by the High Energy Physics Program Prioritization Panel (P5) and unanimously approved by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), advising DOE and NSF, in 2014. vv The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . uu LBNF/DUNE is the DOE Long Neutrino Experiment. vv \"Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context,\" HEPAP, 2014.Construction-phase Source and System RFQ U.S. DOE (ANL) U.S. (FNAL)India DAE Labs, Poland SSR1 16U.S. India DAE DAE LabsIndia DAE Poland WUST SSR2 Cryomodule7 325 35 France CNRS (IN2P3 Lab) U.S. India DAE LabsIndia DAE Poland WUST LabsUK STFC Performance Parameters (KPPs) The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve.

A waiver from the one-for-one requirement to eliminate excess space at FNAL to offset PIP-II and other projects was approved by DOE Headquarters on November 12, 2009. The waiver identified and transferred to FNAL 575,104 square feet of excess space to accommodate new facilities including Mu2e, LBNF, DUNE, and other facilities, as-yet unbuilt, from space that was banked at other DOE facilities. The PIP-II Project is following all current DOE procedures for tracking and reporting space utilization. 8. Acquisition ApproachDOE is acquiring the PIP-II project through Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), the Management and Operating (M&O) contractor responsible for FNAL, rather than have the DOE compete a contract for fabrication to a third party. FRA has a strong relationship with the high energy physics community and its leadership, including many FNAL scientists and engineers. This arrangement will facilitate close cooperation and coordination for PIP-II with an experienced team of project leaders managed by FRA, which will have primary responsibility for oversight of all subcontracts required to execute the project. The arrangement is expected to include subcontracts for the purchase of components from third party vendors as well as delivery of in-kind contributions from non-DOE partners. Project partners will deliver significant pieces of scope as in-kind international contributions, not funded by U.S. DOE. The rationale or motivation behind these contributions are institutional and/or industrial technical capability, long-standing collaborations in the physics programs at FNAL that PIP-II will support, and interest in SRF technology. Scientific institution s from several countries, tabulated below, are engaged in discussion of potential PIP-II scope contributions within the framework of international, government-to-government science and technology agreements. Congressional Budget JustificationScientific Agencies and Institutions Discussing Potential Contributions of Scope for PIP-II Country Funding Agency Institutions U.S. Department of Energy Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;Argonne National Laboratory India Department of Atomic Energy Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai; Inter University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi;Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore;Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata Italy National Institute for Nuclear Physics Laboratory for Accelerators and Applied Superconductivity, Milan France Atomic Energy Commission National Center for Scientific ResearchSaclay Nuclear Research Center; National Institute of Nuclear & Particle Physics, Paris UK Science & Technology Facilities Council Daresbury LaboratoryPoland Wroclaw University of Science and TechnologyWroclaw University of Science and Technology For example, joint participation by U.S. DOE and the India DAE in the development and construction of high intensity superconducting proton accelerator projects at FNAL and in India is codified in Annex I to the \"Implementing Agreement between DOE and Indian Department of Atomic Energy in the Area of Accelerator and Particle Detector Research and Development for Discovery Science for High Intensity Proton Accelerators,\" signed in January 2015 by the U.S. Secretary of Energy and the India Chairman of DAE. FNAL and DAE Labs subsequently developed a \"Joint R&D Document\" outlining the specific roles and goals of the collaborators during the R&D phase of the PIP-II project. This R&D agreement is expected to lead to a similar agreement for the construction phase, describing roles and in-kind contributions. DOE and FNAL are developing similar agreements with Italy, France, and the UK for PIP-II. SC is putting mechanisms into place to facilitate joint consultation between the partnering funding agencies, such that coordinated oversight and actions will ensure the success of the overall program. SC is successfully employing similar mechanisms for international partnering for the DOE LBNF/DUNE project and for DOE participation in LHC-related projects hosted by CERN. Domestic engineering and construction subcontractors will perform the civil construction at FNAL. FNAL is utilizing a firm fixed-price contract for architectural-engineering services to complete all remaining designs for conventional facilities with an option for construction support. The general construction subcontract will be placed on a firm-fixed-price basis. All subcontracts will be competitively bid and awarded based on best value to the government. Fermi Site Office provides contract oversight for FRA's plans and performance. Project performance metrics for FRA are included in the M&O contractor's annual performance evaluation and measurement plan. 347Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-40, Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/ Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, FNAL Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Project is for Design and Construction 1. Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is $176,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding and $4,000,000 in Other Project Cost (OPC) funding. The project has a preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range of $1,260,000,000 to $1,860,000,000 approved for CD-1(R) on November 5, 2015. The preliminary TPC excludes foreign contributions. Since then, the preliminary TPC estimate has grown to approximately $3,000,000,000 which exceeds the upper end of the cost range by over 50 percent. According to DOE policy, if the upper end of the original approved CD-1 cost range grows by more than 50 percent as the project proceeds toward CD-2 then the Program, in coordination with the Project Management Executive, must reassess the alternative selection process. ww An Independent Project Review conducted by DOE in January 2021 recommended the cost range be reevaluated with a planned review of new range in FY 2022. A CD-1 Reaffirmation or 'CD-1RR' is planned in FY 2022 to approve the updated cost range, reaffirm the alternative selection, and approve a new tailoring strategy for baselining the project in multiple subprojects. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2012. The most recent approved DOE Order 413.3B critical decision is CD-3A Revision, approval for Initial Far Site Construction: reducing the authorized scope for excavation and construction for the LBNF Far Site conventional facilities. The change transferred some of the scope that had been approved by CD-3A to a later authorization decision. OPC costs that were previously applied to technical integration of the neutrino detectors have been transferred from \"Other OPC Costs\" to TEC construction contingency. \"Other OPC Costs\" now are exclusively execution support costs such as electrical power for construction and equipment installation. DOE and the Laboratory are continuing engagement with potential partners. In June 2021, CERN approved contributing a second cryostat to the project. HEP and Fermilab have arranged for in-kind contributions from international partners to both the facility (valued at approximately $260,000,000) and the experiment (valued at approximately $400,000,000). These amounts identify the cost if DOE would supply the components. The scale of LBNF/DUNE and various otherfactors,including annual funding levels and research and development needs,resultedin the major scope elements of the project maturing at different rates. Baselining the entire scope of the project at once introduced too many uncertainties and was no longer viewed as being in the best interest of DOE. Therefore, a subproject tailoring approach in accordance with DOE Order 413.3B is now being developed in order to reorganize the project's scope into several independent subprojects for improved planning and management control. The definition of the subprojects and the approach to managing subprojects will be approved at CD-1RR during FY 2022. The first subproject to be baselined will authorize the completion of cavern excavation at the Far Site. FY 2021 funding supported the completion of pre-excavation and reliability projects at the far site which enable full scale excavation to begin. FY 2021 funding also supported the design of the near site conventional facilities, beamline systems, the cryogenic systems, and the detectors. The final design of the Near Site conventional facilities was received by the project at the end of FY 2021. ww Per DOE Order 413.3B, Experiment, FNAL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe project was evaluated by Independent Project Reviews in January and June 2021. The reviews noted evidence of progress and supported the approach of phasing with subprojects, but identified additional work needed before CD-1RR and baselining of the subprojects. The FY 2022 Request supports continued work on the excavation of the detector caverns and completion of design activities and continuation of approved site preparation, as well as preproduction and fabrication activities when approved by CD-3. The FY 2023 Request will support continuation of the Far Site civil construction activities for excavation of the underground equipment caverns and connecting drifts (tunnels). Design activities will be completed for the Far Site detectors and cryogenics systems and the beam-line design will be finalized. A Federal Project Director with a certification level 4 has been assigned to this project and has approved this CPDS.

Project Scope and Justification Scope LBNF/DUNE will be composed of a neutrino beam created by new construction as well as modifications to the existing Fermilab Accelerator Complex, massive neutrino detectors (at least 40,000 tons in total) and associated cryogenics infrastructure located in one or more large underground caverns to be excavated at least 800 miles \"downstream\" from the neutrino source, and a much smaller neutrino detector at FNAL for monitoring the neutrino beam near its source. A primary beam of protons will produce a neutrino beam directed into a target for converting the protons into a secondary beam of particles (pions and muons) that decay into neutrinos, followed by a decay tunnel hundreds of meters long where the decay neutrinos will emerge and travel through the earth to the massive detector. The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at FNAL is an existing example of this type of configuration for a neutrino beam facility. The new LBNF beam line will provide a neutrino beam of lower energy and greater intensity than the NuMI beam and would point to far detector modules at a greater distance than is used with NuMI experiments. xx For the LBNF/DUNE project, FNAL will be responsible for design, construction and operation of the major components of facilities which enable the DUNE research program (LBNF) including: the primary proton beam, neutrino production target, focusing structures, decay pipe, absorbers and corresponding beam instrumentation; the conventional facilities and experiment infrastructure on the FNAL site required for the near detector; and the conventional facilities and experiment infrastructure at SURF for the large detectors including the cryostats and cryogenics systems. Justification Recent international progress in neutrino physics, celebrated by the Nobel Prizes for Physics in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2015, provides the basis for further discovery opportunities. Determining relative masses and mass ordering of the three known neutrinos will give guidance and constraints to theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The study and observation of the different behavior of neutrinos and antineutrinos will offer insight into the dominance of matter over antimatter in our universe and, therefore, the very structure of our universe. The only other source of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, in the quark sector, is too small to account for the observed matter dominance. The LBNF/DUNE construction project is a federal, state, private, and international partnership developing and implementing the technologies of particle accelerators and detectors to enable world-leading research into the fundamental physics of neutrinos, which are the most ubiquitous particles in the universe while at the same time among the most mysterious. Neutrinos are intimately involved in nuclear decay processes and high energy nuclear reactions. LBNF/DUNE will study the transformations of muon neutrinos that occur as they travel to large detectors in South Dakota, 800 miles away from FNAL, where they are produced in a high-energy beam. The experiment will analyze the rare, flavor-changing transformations of neutrinos in flight, from one lepton flavor to another, which are expected to help explain the fundamental physics of neutrinos and the puzzling matter-antimatter asymmetry that enables our existence in a matter-dominated universe. The LBNF/DUNE project comprises a national flagship particle physics initiative. LBNF/DUNE will be the first-ever large-scale international science facility hosted by the United States. As part of implementation of High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP)-Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) recommendations, the LBNF/DUNE project consists of two multinational collaborative efforts: \u0003 LBNF is responsible for the beamline and other experimental and civil infrastructure at FNAL and at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota. It is currently operated by the South Dakota Science andTechnology Authority (SDSTA), an agency of the State of South Dakota, and hosts experiments supported by DOE,the National Science Foundation, and major research universities. xx Detailed analyses of alternatives compared the NuMI beam to a new, lower-energy neutrino beam directed toward SURF in South Dak ota, and also compared different neutrino detection technologies for the DUNE detector. 352Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-40, Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/ Experiment, FNAL FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification\u0003 DUNE is an international scientific collaboration responsible for defining the scientific goals and technical requirements for the beam and detectors, as well as the design, fabrication of detector components andsubsequent research program. DOE's High Energy Physics program manages both activities as a single, line-item construction project\u2014LBNF/DUNE. LBNF, with DOE/FNAL leadership and minority participation by international partners including CERN, will construct a megawatt-class neutrino source and related facilities at FNAL (the \"Near Site\"), as well as underground caverns and cryogenic facilities in South Dakota (the \"Far Site\") needed to house the DUNE detectors. DUNE has international leadership and participation of over 1,100 scientists and engineers from over 200 institutions in over 30 countries. DOE will fund approximately one half of the DUNE detectors. This excludes the cryostats that hold the detectors. The cryostats will be provided by CERN. The project continues to refine the development of the design and cost estimates as the U.S. DOE contributions to the multinational effort now are better understood. The cost estimate for DOE contributions will be updated as planning continues in preparation for baselining the various subprojects. FNAL and DOE have confirmed contributions to LBNF documented in international agreements from CERN, the UK, India, Poland, and Brazil. Discussions are ongoing with several other countries for additional contributions, including significant additional contributions from CERN that are in the process of being finalized. For the DUNE detectors, the collaboration put in place a process to complete a technical design of the detectors and divide the work of building the detectors between the collaborating institutions. The review of the detector design with a complete set of funding responsibilities by the Long Baseline Neutrino Committee began in 2019, and development of the set of funding responsibilities has made significant progress and continues to advance. New commitments for detector contributions are being finalized now. SC will manage all DOE contributions to the facility and the detectors according to DOE Order 413.3B, and FNAL will provide unified project management reporting. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . 353Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-40, 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and will be finalized and approved with each subproject. The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the desired project performance. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Project Completion.

Acquisition Approach The Acquisition Strategy, approved as part of CD-1, documents the acquisition approach. DOE is acquiring design, construction, fabrication, and operation of LBNF through the M&O contractor responsible for FNAL, Fermi Research Alliance (FRA). FRA and FNAL, through the LBNF Project based at FNAL, is responsible to DOE to manage and complete construction of LBNF at both the near and remote site locations. FRA and FNAL are assigned oversight and management responsibility for execution of the international DUNE project, to include management of the DOE contributions to DUNE. The basis for this choice and strategy is that: \u0003 FNAL is the site of the only existing neutrino beam facility in the U.S. and, in addition to these facilities, provides a source of existing staff and expertise to be utilized for beamline and detector construction. \u0003 FNAL can best ensure that the design, construction, and installation of key LBNF and DUNE components are coordinated effectively and efficiently with other research activities at FNAL. 360Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-40, 2023 Congressional Budget Justification\u0003 FNAL has a DOE-approved procurement system with established processes and acquisition expertise needed to obtain the necessary components and services to build the scientific hardware, equipment and conventional facilities for theaccelerator beamline, and detectors for LBNF and DUNE. \u0003 FNAL has extensive experience in managing complex construction, fabrication, and installation projects involving multiple national laboratories, universities, and other partner institutions, building facilities both on-site and at remoteoff-site locations. \u0003 FNAL, through the LBNF Project, has established a close working relationship with SURF and the SDSTA, organizations that manage and operate the remote site for the far detector in Lead, SD. \u0003 FNAL has extensive experience with management and participation in international projects and international collaborations, including most recently the LHC and CMS projects at CERN, as well as in the increasingly internationalneutrino experiments and program. The LBNF/DUNE construction project is a federal, state, private and international partnership. Leading the LBNF/DUNE Project, FNAL will collaborate and work with many institutions, including other DOE national laboratories (e.g. BNL, LBNL and SLAC), dozens of universities, foreign research institutions, and the SDSTA. FNAL will be responsible for overall project management, Near Site conventional facilities, and the beamline. FNAL will work with SDSTA to complete the conventional facilities construction at the remote site needed to house and outfit the DUNE far detector. With the DUNE collaboration, FNAL is also responsible for technical and resource coordination to support the DUNE far and near detector design and construction. DOE will be providing in-kind contributions to the DUNE collaboration for detector systems, as agreed upon with the international DUNE collaboration. International participation in the design, construction, and operation of LBNF and DUNE will be of essential importance because the field of High Energy Physics is international by nature; necessary talent and expertise are globally distributed, and DOE does not have the procurement or technical resources to self-perform all of the required construction and fabrication work. Contributions from other nations will be predominantly through the delivery of components built in their own countries by their own researchers. DOE will negotiate agreements in cooperation with the Department of State on a bilateral basis with all contributing nations to specify their expected contributions and the working relationships during the construction and operation of the experiment DOE will provide funding for the LBNF/DUNE Project directly to FNAL and collaborating DOE national laboratories via approved financial plans, and under management control of the LBNF/DUNE Project Office at FNAL, which will also manage and control DOE funding to the combination of university subcontracts and direct fixed-price vendor procurements that are anticipated for the design, fabrication, and installation of LBNF and DUNE technical components. All actions will perform in accordance with DOE approved procurement policies and procedures. FNAL staff, or by subcontract, temporary staff working directly with FNAL personnel will perform much of the neutrino beamline component design, fabrication, assembly, and installation. The acquisition approach includes both new procurements based on existing designs, and re-purposed equipment from the Fermilab Accelerator Complex. For some highly specialized components, FNAL will have the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the United Kingdom design and fabricate the components. RAL is a long-standing FNAL collaborator who has proven experience with such components. FNAL has chosen the Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) model to execute the delivery of LBNF conventional facilities at the SURF Far Site. The Laboratory contracted with an architect/engineer (A/E) firm for design of LBNF Far Site conventional facilities at SURF and with a CM/GC subcontractor to manage the construction of LBNF Far Site facilities. FNAL selected this strategy to reduce risk, enhance quality and safety performance, provide a more collaborative approach to construction, and offer the opportunity for reduced cost and shortened construction schedules, via options for the CM/GC to self-perform or competitively bid subcontract award packages. FNAL determined that excavation scope should be openly competed as provided by the subcontract. An excavation subcontract was awarded within budget and excavation construction activities began in FY 2021. 361Science/High Energy Physics/ FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationFor the LBNF Near Site conventional facilities at FNAL, the laboratory will subcontract with an A/E firm for design and plan to utilize a traditional design-bid-build construction method supported by additional procurements for preconstruction and construction phase services from a professional construction management firm. For the LBNF Far Site conventional facilities at SURF, DOE entered into a land lease with SDSTA on May 20, 2016, covering the area on which the DOE-funded facilities housing and supporting the LBNF and DUNE detector will be built. The lease and related realty actions provides the framework for DOE and FNAL to construct federally-funded buildings and facilities on non-federal land, and to establish a long-term (multi-decade) arrangement for DOE and FNAL to use SDSTA space to host the DUNE experiment. Modifications, repairs, and improvements to the SDSTA infrastructure to support the LBNF/DUNE project are costed to the project. Repairs and improvements for the overall facility are costed to the cooperative agreement between HEP and SDSTA for operation of the facility. Protections for DOE's real property interests in these infrastructure tasks are acquired through the lease with SDSTA, contracts and other agreements such as easements. DOE plans for FNAL to have responsibility for managing and operating the LBNF and DUNE far detector and facilities for a useful lifetime of 20 years and may contract with SDSTA for day-to-day management and maintenance services. At the end of useful life, federal regulations permit transfer of ownership to SDSTA, which is willing to accept ownership as a condition for the lease. FNAL developed an appropriate decommissioning plan prior to lease signing. 362Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-41, Muon Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment, FNAL Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Project is for Design and Construction 1. Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment (Mu2e) is $2,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding to support the development of a new technical, cost, schedule, and management baseline for the construction project. The Mu2e project provides the accelerator beam and experimental apparatus to unambiguously identify neutrinoless muon-to-electron conversion events. The conversion of a muon to an electron in the field of a nucleus would probe new physics for discovery at mass scales far beyond the reach of any existing or proposed experiment. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2012. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-3 (Approve Start of Construction), concurrent with completion of the final design, approved on July 14, 2016. Total Project Cost was approved at $273,677,000. The approved funding profile supported this TPC. The CD-4 milestone was set at 1Q FY 2023. Construction progressed according to plan through FY 2019, the final year of approved funding. FY 2019 funding supported continuing procurement and fabrication activities for the accelerator, beamline, superconducting magnets and particle detectors. Civil construction of the building and underground housing for the experiment was completed in April 2017. This civil facility has special capabilities required to house the primary beam target and transport systems for producing the muons and stopping them in the detector system. The approved baseline schedule cannot be met as a result of work restrictions at most of the participating institutions in FY 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and because of delayed delivery of two superconducting magnets. An Independent Project Review recommended a baseline change in February 2021. The Baseline Change Proposal (BCP) is in process, but not yet submitted, reviewed, or approved. Technical progress on all aspects of the project has continued through FY 2021. The project is awaiting the new baseline after resolving contract issues for magnet production. In anticipation of approval of the BCP, $2,000,000 of TEC funding was appropriated in FY 2021, $13,000,000 of TEC funding is requested in FY 2022, and $2,000,000 is requested in FY 2023. The additional funds cannot be spent until the BCP approval and the project is re-baselined. A Federal Project Director with Certification Level III has been assigned to this project and has approved this CPDS. 363Science/High Energy Physics/ 11-SC-41, FY 2013 reprogramming for the Mu2e construction project following the submission of the FY 2014 budget.

FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification2. Project Scope and Justification Scope The Mu2e project includes accelerator modifications, fabrication of superconducting magnets and particle detector systems, and construction of a civil facility with the special capabilities necessary for the experiment. The scope of work in the Project Data Sheet has not changed. The muon beam for the Mu2e experiment will be produced by an intense 8-GeV proton beam, extracted from the Fermilab Booster accelerator, striking a tungsten target. The Mu2e project is modifying the existing Fermilab accelerator complex (Booster, Recycler, and Debuncher Rings) to deliver the primary proton beam to a muon production target, and will efficiently collect and transport the produced muons to a stopping target. The stopping target is surrounded by the Mu2e detector system that can identify muon-to-electron conversions and reject background contamination from muon decays, which produce neutrinos, in contrast to muon conversions which are neutrinoless. The project has designed and is constructing the detector system (consisting of a tracker, calorimeter, cosmic ray veto, and data acquisition subsystem), a new beam line to the detector system from the former Debuncher Ring, and three superconducting solenoid magnets (a Production Solenoid, Transport Solenoid and Detector Solenoid) that will serve as the beam transport channel for collecting the muons and transporting them into the detector system. The project designed and completed construction of a 25,000 square foot civil facility with the special capabilities required to house the primary beam target and transport systems for producing the muons and stopping them in the detector system. The civil construction consists of an underground detector enclosure and a surface building for containing the necessary equipment and infrastructure that can be accessed while the multikilowatt proton beam is being delivered to the experiment. The building includes radiation shielding and design features for safe operation of the beam line and experimental apparatus. Justification The conversion of a muon to an electron in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus provides a unique experimental signature for discovery of charged-lepton flavor-symmetry violation (CLFV), which may be accessible to this experiment of unprecedented sensitivity and would allow access to new physics at very high mass scales beyond the reach of the LHC. In 2008, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), a subpanel of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), recommended: \"Development of a muon-to-electron conversion experiment should be strongly encouraged under all budget scenarios considered by the panel.\" zz Again, in 2014, the most recent P5 Subpanel emphasized the priority of the current \"Mu2e\" experimental construction project in its new report to HEPAP, saying the Mu2e project is an \"immediate target of opportunity in the drive to search for new physics and will help inform future choices of direction.\" \"The scientific case is undiminished relative to its earlier prioritization.\" aaa Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The Threshold KPPs, represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Project Completion.

Acquisition Approach The acquisition approach is fully documented in the Acquisition Strategy approved as part of CD-1. This is a high-level summary of material from that document. DOE awarded the prime contract for the Mu2e project to the Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), the Fermilab Management and Operating (M&O) contractor, rather than have the DOE compete a contract for fabrication to a third party. FRA has a strong relationship with the high energy physics community and its leadership, including many Fermilab scientists and engineers. This arrangement will facilitate close cooperation and coordination between the Mu2e scientific collaboration and an experienced team of project leaders managed by FRA, which will have primary responsibility for oversight of all subcontracts required to execute the project. These subcontracts are expected to include the purchase of components from third party vendors as well as subcontracts with university groups to fabricate detector subsystems. The largest procurements are the magnet systems and the civil construction. The superconducting solenoid magnets are divided into three systems that could be procured independently but which must ultimately perform as a single integrated magnetic system. Two of the systems are similar to systems that have been successfully built in private industry, so the engineering design and fabrication for two of the solenoids was subcontracted to a third party vendor after a study of industrial vendor capabilities confirmed that the technical risks were acceptable. The third solenoid is unique because of its rather large size and unusual configuration, and no good industrial analog exists. This solenoid was designed at Fermilab and is being fabricated by a third-party vendor in multiple modular components, each of which is well matched to existing industrial capabilities. There were two major subcontracts for the civil construction. An architectural and engineering contract was placed on a firm-fixed-price basis for Preliminary (Title I) Design, and Final (Title II) Design with an option for construction support (T itle III). The general construction subcontract was placed on a firm-fixed-price basis and was completed successfully. All subcontracts have been competitively bid and awarded based on best value to the government. Fermi Site Office provides contract oversight for FRA's plans and performance. Project performance metrics for FRA are included in the M&O contractor's annual performance evaluation and measurement plan. 373Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Overview The mission of the Nuclear Physics (NP) program is to explore one of the enduring mysteries of the universe, the nature of matter: its basic constituents and how they interact to form the elements and the properties we observe. Solving this mystery involves discovering, exploring, and understanding all forms of nuclear matter, not only the familiar forms of matter we see around us, but also exotic forms that existed in the first moments after the Big Bang and that may exist today inside neutron stars. The aim is to understand why matter takes on the specific forms observed in nature and how that knowledge can benefit society in the areas of energy, climate, commerce, medicine, and national security. Understanding all forms of nuclear matter requires an enormous range of capabilities: from probing quarks and gluons inside protons, to searching for the largest nuclei that can exist, such as Tennessium, one of four recently discovered super-heavy nuclei. It also encompasses discovery not only from the smallest to the largest, but through time and the evolution of the universe as well. The epoch in the cosmos when quarks and gluons first combined to form protons was millionths of a second after the Big Bang. Events in the cosmos creating heavy nuclei are still occurring today. Achieving this goal therefore requires a suite of advanced tools and support for inspired scientists and engineers to use them. Theoretical approaches to further our understanding are based largely on calculations of the interactions of quarks and gluons described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). An exciting vision is the prospect of Quantum Computing, a revolutionary new paradigm for future computers capable of solving many-body QCD problems currently intractable with today's capabilities. Experimental approaches use large accelerators at scientific user facilities to collide particles at nearly the speed of light, producing short-lived forms of nuclear matter for investigation. Comparison of experimental observations and theoretical predictions tests the limits of our understanding of nuclear matter and suggests new directions for experimental and theoretical research. The many forms in which nuclear matter can exist requires a suite of accelerators with complementary capabilities. NP stewards operations at four such accelerator facilities. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) recreates new forms of matter and phenomena that occurred in the extremely hot, dense environment that existed in the infant universe. The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) extracts information on quarks and gluons bound inside protons and neutrons that formed shortly after the universe began to cool. The Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS) \"gently\" accelerates nuclei to energies typical of nuclear reactions in the cosmos to further our understanding of the ongoing synthesis of heavy elements such as gold and platinum. Stewardship of these facilities is a priority role and goal of NP, as affirmed in the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee's (NSAC) 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science, Reaching for the Horizon . It also underpins achieving the broader goals set for nuclear science in the 2013 National Research Council report, Nuclear Physics: Exploring the Heart of Matter . CEBAF, RHIC, and ATLAS operations will become ever more reliable and efficient via the deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning, currently under development. To maintain U.S. leadership in nuclear physics, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) are being implemented. FRIB will uniquely afford access to eighty percent of all isotopes predicted to exist in nature, including over 1,000 never produced on earth. The answers to long-standing \"grand challenge\" questions such as the ultimate limits of nuclear existence and the astrophysical sites and isotopic paths to heavy element production in the cosmos will be illuminated. FRIB is now a scientific user facility, with data taking for scientific research initiated in FY 20 22. The EIC will provide unprecedented ability to x-ray the proton and discover how the mass of everyday objects is dynamically generated by the interaction of quark and gluon fields inside protons and neutrons. As noted by the National Academies, the EIC will also maintain U.S. leadership in the accelerator science and technology of colliders. These facilities provide an exciting future of discovery in Nuclear Physics. One equally exciting NP frontier does not involve accelerators, but envisions the nucleus itself as a laboratory for observing nature's fundamental symmetries. Chief among these experiments is the search, also given high priority in the 2015 NSAC Long Range Plan, for a nuclear decay predicted to happen once in 10 28 years and only if the elusive neutrino particle turns out to be its own anti-particle. The observation of so-called neutrino-less double beta decay would result in a disruptive change in our current understanding of the elementary constituents of nuclear matter and the forces that govern them. 375Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAdditional experiments to improve the precision of the current value of the neutron lifetime and to improve limits on a possible electric dipole moment of the neutron also have the potential to change our understanding of the physical world.NP is the primary steward of the nation's fundamental nuclear physics research portfolio providing approximately 95 percent of the U.S. investment in this area. It also supports the National Nuclear Data Center which collects, evaluates, curates, and disseminates nuclear physics data for basic nuclear research and applied nuclear technologies. In collaboration with other SC programs, NP continues to support development of quantum sensors and quantum control techniques, as well as efforts on artificial intelligence and machine learning which can benefit nuclear physics research and NP accelerator operations. NP also stewards accelerator research and development (R&D), pursuing next generation electron ion source developments and advancing approaches in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) technologies.

Total, Nuclear Physics +26,196 383Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic and Applied R&D Coordination The NP mission supports the pursuit of unique opportunities for R&D integration and coordination with other DOE Program Offices, Federal agencies, and non-Federal entities. For example, researchers from the High Energy Physics (HEP), NP, and Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) programs coordinate and leverage forefront computing resources and/or technical expertise through the SciDAC projects and LQCD research to determine the properties of as-yet unobserved exotic particles predicted by the theory of QCD, advance progress towards a model of nuclear structure with predictive capability, and dramatically improve modeling of neutrino interactions during core collapse supernovae. The U.S. Nuclear Data Program provides evaluated cross-section and decay data relevant to a broad suite of Federal missions and topics such as innovative reactor design (e.g., of interest to the NE and Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) programs), materials under extreme conditions (of interest to the BES and FES programs), and nuclear forensics (NNSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)). NP leads an Interagency working group including NNSA, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), NE, the DOE IP and other Federal Agencies to coordinate targeted experimental efforts on opportunistic measurements to address serious gaps and uncertainties in existing nuclear data archives, as well to meet emerging challenges such as generating new nuclear data relevant for space exploration. Capabilities and techniques developed for nuclear physics at NP accelerator facilities are used by DOD and NASA to test electronics for radiation sensitivity in furtherance of their missions. NP research develops technological advances relevant to clean energy and the development of advanced fuel cycles for next generation nuclear reactors (NE); advanced cost-effective accelerator technology and particle detection techniques for medical diagnostics and treatment (National Institutes of Health (NIH)); accelerator research and enhancing U.S.-based supply chains for critical accelerator technologies (ARP); and research in developing neutron, gamma, and particle beam sources with applications in cargo screening (NNSA, DHS, and the FBI). Program Accomplishments World's Highest Energy Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator Completed: The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), a world leading \"microscope\" for understanding how protons and neutrons can arrange themselves to form nuclei, the limits of how many species of nuclei can be formed in nature, and how the heaviest nuclei are produced in violent cosmic events, finishes on-time, on-budget construction and will begin early science in spring of 2022. Completing the world's highest energy continuous wave heavy ion accelerator required multiple technological firsts, including a novel high-power target, a high efficiency cryogenic plant, and a novel superconducting radiofrequency resonator system for accelerating a wide range of ion species. Researching Nuclear Risotto: An interdisciplinary team including nuclear theorists, data scientists, and astronomers has put new limits on the radii of neutron stars with unprecedented accuracy. Neutron stars one possible final stage in the lives of ordinary stars after their \"ordinary matter\" has boiled off\u2014consist of the densest matter in the universe. The researchers' approach combined observations of gravitational waves from neutron stars, electromagnetic observations by NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer mission and other telescopes, and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory by DOE Nuclear Physics researchers. The results show that typical neutron stars can concentrate approximately 1-2 solar masses in a radius of 11.8 kilometers, placing new stringent constraints on nuclear matter at the limits of existence. Creating Mass From Energy in the Lab: Although it's been known since Einstein's famous equation E=mc 2 that energy and matter are interchangeable, only now have scientists working at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) found clear evidence that the collision of two packets of light, called photons, can produce pairs of particles, one matter particle and one antimatter particle\u2014the electron and its antimatter companion\u2014the positron, in this instance. This process was predicted by Gregory Breit and John Wheeler, more than 80 years ago. While e+e- pairs have been produced in high-energy collisions, this observation involved two heavy ions flying past each other at nearly the speed of light without touching. The ultra-high electric field between the two passing nuclei results in photons having enough relative energy to form electron-positron pairs. This result puts focus on an exciting new possibility: lasers being sufficiently energetic to see the Breit-Wheeler process directly, without colliding particle beams. 384Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationRare Carbon Breakup-Mode Constrained for the First Time: Researchers from Texas A&M, LSU, and Washington University at St. Louis have observed, for the first time, the breakup of an excited form of carbon-12 (comprising a nucleus of 6 protons and 6 neutrons) into three so-called alpha-particles (nuclei each containing 2 protons + 2 neutrons). Using a new, highly sophisticated detector at Texas A&M, the direct 3D reconstruction of this three-alpha breakup reaction allowed scientists exceptional insight into the role of the inverse process in synthesizing 12 Carbon and other light nuclei in the ear ly universe . Heavy Nuclei Have Thick Skins: The PREx Collaboration at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility recently published conclusive evidence confirming that the heavy lead (Pb) nucleus has a neutron skin approximately a third as thick as the radius of the proton\u2014about twice as thick as predicted. The result has deep implications for the physical processes in neutron stars, with connections to recent observations of colliding neutron stars made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, experiment. The Quantum Rodeo: Quantum computers offer the potential of solving problems too difficult for classical computers. A team of nuclear physicists have developed a \"Rodeo Algorithm for Quantum Computing\" offering a new approach, exponentially faster than other well-known algorithms, for preparing energy states of large complex systems on a quantum computer. The Rodeo algorithm is efficient in terms of both computing resources and speed. It requires relatively few qubits and quantum gates, representing a promising future candidate for solving intractable problems in quantum many-body systems vital to nuclear physics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, atomic and molecular systems, and quantum chemistry. Uncertainty on the Neutron Lifetime is Cut by in Half: Neutrons account for about half of the mass of the matter around us. When inside a nucleus, a neutron is stable. On its own however it is unstable and will decay with a half-life of about 10 minutes. Precisely how long neutrons live is an important quantity in many areas of science, including the accurate description of what happened in the early Universe. High-precision measurements of this lifetime also provide a precise test to probe for new particles and forces beyond what can be measured with colliders like the Large Hadron Collider. A team of researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory and several universities has now cut the uncertainty in neutron's lifetime in half using ultracold neutrons from the LANL ultracold neutron source. Tooling Up to Solve a Major Mystery: The proton is a building block of nature fundamental to everything around us. Despite a century of research however, how the properties of the proton (its mass and spin) are dynamically generated by the quarks and massless gluons inside it remains a mystery. The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) aims to solve this mystery by colliding a high-intensity polarized beam of high-energy electrons with protons or larger atomic nuclei. The EIC recently passed a critical milestone, Critical Decision 1 (CD-1), allowing the project to initiate design of the accelerator, detector, and supporting systems. The project to implement the EIC is being carried out by Brookhaven National Laboratory in partnership with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. 385Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Medium Energy Physics Description The Medium Energy Physics subprogram focuses primarily on experimental tests of the theory of the strong interaction, known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). According to QCD, all observed nuclear particles, collectively known as hadrons, arise from the strong interaction of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons. The protons and neutrons inside nuclei are the best-known examples of hadrons. QCD, although difficult to solve computationally, predicts what hadrons exist in nature, and how they interact and decay. Specific questions addressed within this subprogram include: \u0003 What is the internal landscape of the protons and neutrons (collectively known as nucleons)? \u0003 What does QCD predict for the properties of strongly interacting matter? \u0003 What is the role of gluons and gluon self-interactions in nucleons and nuclei? Scientists use various experimental approaches to determine the distribution of up, down, and strange quarks, their antiquarks, and gluons within protons and neutrons, as well as clarifying the role of gluons in confining the quarks and antiquarks within hadrons. Experiments that scatter electrons off protons, neutrons and nuclei are used to clarify the effects of the quark and gluon spins within nucleons, and the effect of the nuclear medium on the quarks and gluons. The subprogram also supports experimental searches for higher-mass \"excited states\" and exotic hadrons predicted by QCD, as well as studies of their various production mechanisms and decay properties. The Medium Energy Nuclear Physics subprogram supports research at and operation of the subprogram's primary research facility, CEBAF at TJNAF. In addition, the subprogram provides support for spin physics research at RHIC, which is the only collider in the world that can provide polarized proton beams. CEBAF provides high quality beams of polarized electrons that allow scientists to extract information on the quark and gluon structure of protons and neutrons from measurements of how the electrons scatter when they collide with nuclei. CEBAF also uses highly-polarized electrons to make very challenging precision measurements to search for processes that violate a fundamental symmetry of nature, called parity, in order to search for physics beyond what is currently described by the Standard Model of particle physics. These capabilities are unique in the world. The increase in beam energy provided by the 12 GeV CEBAF Upgrade continues to open up exciting new scientific opportunities and secures continued U.S. world leadership in this area of physics. Some of the science goals of the 12 GeV experimental program include the search for exotic combinations of quarks and gluons to advance our understanding of the strong force, evidence of new physics from sensitive searches for violations of nature's fundamental symmetries, and a microscopic understanding in the 12 GeV energy regime of the internal structure of the proton, including origin of its spin, and how this structure is modified when the proton is inside a nucleus. Research at RHIC using colliding beams of spin-polarized protons, a capability unique to RHIC, is providing information on the spin of the proton in a kinematic range complementary to that at CEBAF to extend present knowledge beyond the kinematic boundaries accessible at CEBAF alone. Research support for CEBAF and RHIC includes laboratory and university scientific and technical staff needed to conduct high priority data analysis to extract scientific results. Complementary special focus experiments that require different capabilities can be conducted at the High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIGS) at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL), an NP University Center of Excellence, FNAL, European laboratories, and elsewhere. The Research and Engineering Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has specialized infrastructure used to develop and fabricate advanced instrumentation and accelerator equipment for the nuclear physics community. A high scientific priority for this community is addressing an outstanding grand challenge question of modern physics: how the fundamental properties of the proton such as its mass and spin are dynamically generated by the extraordinarily strong color fields resulting from dense systems of gluons in nucleons and nuclei. The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) facility, to be located at BNL, plans to address this science. DOE approved CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, in June 2021. TJNAF is partnering with BNL to develop and implement the EIC. Scientists and accelerator physicists, from the Medium Energy subprogram, are strongly engaged and play significant leadership roles in the development of the scientific agenda and implementation of the EIC. 387Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationTransformative accelerator R&D efforts advanced approaches in superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) technology and accelerator science aimed at improving the operations of existing facilities and developing next-generation facilities for nuclear physics.

Research The Research activity supports high priority research at universities, TJNAF, BNL, ANL, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and LBNL and carries out high priority experiments at CEBAF, RHIC, and elsewhere. Scientists conduct research to advance knowledge and to identify and develop the science opportunities and goals for next generation instrumentation and facilities, primarily for CEBAF and the EIC. Scientists participate in the development and implementation of targeted advanced instrumentation, including state-of-the-art detectors for experiments that may also have application in areas such as medical imaging instrumentation in coordination with NIH and homeland security. Scientists are engaged in experimental QIS research. TJNAF staff focus on the 12 GeV experimental program, including implementation of select experiments, acquisition of data, and data analysis at CEBAF experimental halls (Halls A, B, C, and D). Staff also participate in the RHIC spin program and play critical roles in instrumentation development for the EIC. Researchers participate in the development of scientific and experimental plans for the EIC. The subprogram also supports a visiting scientist program at TJNAF and bridge positions with regional universities as a cost-effective approach to augmenting scientific expertise at the laboratory and boosting research experience opportunities. TJNAF Laboratory scientists and many university groups play leadership roles in new experiments in the 12 GeV scientific program, and are engaged in commissioning experiments, instrumentation development, and data taking. Scientists at several national laboratories are engaged in planning for the construction of the EIC and its scientific instrumentation. ANL researchers continue precise measurements of the electric dipole moments of laser-trapped atoms as part of an intensive world-wide effort to set limits on QCD parameters and contribute to the search for possible explanations of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. LANL scientists are leading a new experiment at Fermilab to study whether anti-quarks are in orbit about the spin axis of the proton. Research groups at BNL and LBNL play leading roles in RHIC data analysis critical for determining the spin structure of the proton. Researchers at TJNAF are developing high current, polarized electron sources for next generation NP facilities. Accelerator R&D research at universities and laboratories advance technology and core competencies essential for improving operations of the complex user facilities or developing new facilities within the NP program, including the development of transformative technology for the Nation, including innovative, efficient and cost effective cryogenic systems, high gradient SRF cavities, and novel in-situ plasma processing of cryomodules. Researchers are also engaged in developing ML techniques focused on improving efficiencies of accelerator operations. This activity also supports the Accelerate initiative which will support scientific research to accelerate the transition of science advances to energy technologies. 388Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationOperations The Operations activity provides Accelerator Operations funding for CEBAF which boasts world unique features of continuous wave polarized beam to four experimental halls and serves over 1,700 U.S. and international users.

The core competency in SRF technology plays a crucial role in many DOE projects and facilities outside of nuclear physics (such as the BES upgrade of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II) project) and has broad applications in medicine and homeland security. For example, SRF R&D at TJNAF has led to improved land-mine detection techniques and carbon nanotube and nano-structure manufacturing techniques for constructing super-lightweight composites such as aircraft fuselages. TJNAF also has developed award-winning cryogenics techniques that have led to more cost-effective operations at TJNAF and several other SC facilities; their cryogenics expertise benefitted the FRIB project and LCLS-II. TJNAF accelerator physicists help train the next generation of accelerator physicists, enabled in part by a close partnership with nearby universities and other institutions with accelerator physics expertise. Accelerator scientists play critical roles in the design development of the EIC.

At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) facility, scientists continue to pioneer the study of condensed quark-gluon matter at the extreme temperatures, characteristic of the infant universe. The goal is to explore and understand unique manifestations of QCD in this many-body environment and their influence on the universe's evolution. In the aftermath of collisions at RHIC and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, researchers have seen signs of the same quark-gluon plasma (QGP) that is believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang. With careful measurements, scientists are accumulating data that offer insights into the processes early in the creation of the universe, and how protons, neutrons, and other bits of normal matter developed from that plasma. Important avenues of investigation are directed at learning more about the physical characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma including exploring the energy loss mechanism for quarks and gluons traversing the plasma, determining the speed of sound in the plasma, establishing the threshold conditions (minimum nucleus mass and energy) under which the plasma can be formed, and discovering whether a critical point exists demonstrating a first order phase transition between normal nuclear matter and the quark-gluon plasma. The RHIC facility places heavy ion research at the frontier of discovery in nuclear physics. RHIC is uniquely flexible, providi ng a full range of colliding nuclei at variable energies spanning the transition to the quark gluon plasma discovered at RHIC. The facility continues to set new records in performance for both integrated Au-Au luminosity at full energy and a number of other beam settings. This flexibility and performance enable a groundbreaking science program to answer outstanding questions about this exotic and fundamental form of matter and whether a critical point exists in the phase diagram of nuclear matter. Scientists participate in instrumentation upgrades, such as enhancements to the capabilities of the Solenoid Tracker at RHIC (STAR) detector and the sPHENIX detector. The sPHENIX detector will be commissioned in FY 2023. Accelerator physicists conduct accelerator R&D at RHIC in critical areas that include various types of cooling of high-energy hadron beams, high intensity polarized electron sources, and high-energy, high-current energy recovery linear accelerators. The RHIC facility is typically used by more than 1,000 DOE, NSF, and foreign agency-supported researchers annually. A compelling, persistent, high scientific priority for the U.S. nuclear science community has been understanding how the fundamental properties of the proton such as its mass and spin are dynamically generated by the extraordinarily strong color fields resulting from dense systems of gluons in nucleons and nuclei. The answer to this question is key to addressing an outstanding grand challenge problem of modern physics: how QCD, the theory of the strong force, which explains all strongly interacting matter in terms of points-like quarks interacting via the exchange of gluons, acts in detail to generate the \"macroscopic\" properties of protons and neutrons. In 2018, a National Academies study gave a strong endorsement to a U.S.-based Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and recognized its critical role in maintaining U.S. leadership in nuclear science and accelerator R&D bbb. In January 2020, BNL was selected as the location for the EIC and in June 2021, DOE approved CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range. Scientists and accelerator physicists from the Heavy Ion and the Medium Energy sub-programs are partnering to advance the EIC, both playing significant leadership roles in the development of the scientific agenda and implementation of the EIC. Over the course of the acquisition of the EIC, RHIC operations funding will decrease as some scientific staff, engineers and technicians move from RHIC operations to the EIC project. This is a gradual movement to balance the need for the scientific and technical experts with RHIC while ramping up the EIC project. These individuals represent the scientific and technical workforce that are essential to the operations of a complex facility like RHIC and eventually, the EIC. They have critical core bbb Report: https://www.nap.edu/read/25171/chapter/1 393Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationcompetencies in collider operations that cannot easily be replaced; their support is embedded in the EIC TPC and they represent the core facility operations force of RHIC and the EIC. Throughout the EIC project, the temporary reprioritization of funds from the collider facility operations budget to the construction budget will reduce the amount of \"new funds\" needed to implement the EIC, enabling a cost-effective path forward to the implementation of this world-leading facility. Brookhaven National Laboratory was chosen to host one of the five National Quantum Information Sciences Research Centers ( NQISRCs) in FY 2020 and will focus on building the fundamental tools necessary for the United States to create quantum computers that provide a true advantage over their classical counterparts. Scientists working in heavy ion physics leverage discovery opportunities in sensing, simulation, and computing at the intersections of nuclear physics and QIS. The SC Accelerator Science and Technology initiative leverages accelerator science core competencies within the NP program and supports transformative technology needed for the next generation of SC facilities. Core competencies exist at NP facilities in the areas of beam and collider physics, hadron beam cooling, high field superconducting magnets, superconducting radio frequency (SRF), and ion source technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applications are pursued to optimize operation of the complex accelerators and detectors at user facilities in the NP program. This research is essential for maintaining accelerator technology core competencies at SC-supported laboratories. Accelerator scientists also pursue accelerator science aimed at improving the operations of existing facilities. Collaboration in the heavy ion program at the LHC at CERN provides U.S. researchers the opportunity to investigate states of matter under substantially different initial conditions than those provided by RHIC, providing complementary information regarding the matter that existed during the infancy of the universe. Data collected by the ALICE, CMS, and ATLAS detectors confirm that the quark-gluon plasma discovered at RHIC is also seen at the higher energy, and comparisons of results from LHC to those from RHIC have led to important new insights. U.S. researchers have been making important scientific contributions to the emerging results from all three LHC experiments. In ALICE and CMS, U.S. researchers have been participating in developing and upgrading instrumentation for future heavy ion campaigns at the LHC. Research This activity supports high priority research at universities and at BNL, LBNL, LANL, and ORNL to participate in efforts at RHIC and the LHC. NP fully supports U.S. commitments to the LHC \"common funds,\" fees based on the level of U.S. scientist participation in the LHC program and the use of LHC computing capabilities. It will enable the participation of researchers in the complementary heavy ion program at CERN. U.S. scientists will work with their international peers in developing and implementing upgrades to the LHC scientific instrumentation. One such proposed upgrade is the CMS minimum ionizing particle timing detector (MTD) to enhance particle identification for understanding jet quenching, improving heavy flavor hadron measurements, and exploring collectivity in small systems. Heavy Ion research also supports the NQISRCs in partnership with the other SC programs. The university and national laboratory research groups support personnel and graduate students for taking data within the RHIC heavy ion program, analyzing data, publishing results, developing and implementing scientific equipment, and planning for future experiments. BNL, LBNL, and ORNL provide computing infrastructure for petabyte-scale data analysis and state-of-the-art facilities for detector and instrument development. Scientists participate in the development of a world-leading scientific program for the future EIC. Transformative accelerator R&D efforts are pursued, including advancements in ion source developments, SRF technology, and hadron beam cooling. Scientists and engineers also pursue accelerator science aimed at improving the operations of existing facilities and developing next-generation facilities for nuclear physics. Scientists develop cutting-edge techniques based on AI/ML of relevance to nuclear science research, accelerator facility operations and automated machine operations. NP has been supporting applications of artificial neural networks in the analysis of nuclear physics data for decades. Additionally, NP is supporting technical development at the intersections between real-time ML and control and the optimization of accelerator systems operations and detector design using AI/ML models. 394Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationOperations The Heavy Ion Operations activity supports the operations and power costs of the RHIC accelerator complex at BNL, which includes the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS), Booster, and the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) accelerators that together serve as the injector for RHIC. Staff provides key experimental support to the facility, including the development, implementation, and commissioning of scientific equipment associated with the RHIC program. The FY 2023 Request will support high priority capital equipment and accelerator improvement projects at RHIC to promote enhanced and robust operations, such as upgrades to key accelerator infrastructure FY 2023 represents the commissioning of the sPHENIX detector, which will be the key device for the last RHIC data taking campaign. sPHENIX enables scientists to study how the near-perfect Quark Gluon Plasma liquid, which has the lowest shear viscosity ever observed, arises from the strongly interacting quarks and gluons from which it is formed. RHIC operations have led to advances in accelerator physics which have, in turn, improved RHIC performance and enhanced NP capabilities. These core competencies provide collateral benefits to applications in industry, medicine, homeland security, and other scientific areas outside of NP. RHIC accelerator physicists are providing leadership and expertise to reduce technical risk of relevance to the EIC, including beam cooling techniques and energy recovery linacs. Accelerator physicists also play an important role in the training of next generation accelerator physicists, through support of graduate students and post-doctoral associates. In FY 2023, funding for RHIC operations continues to be reprioritized to EIC as some scientific staff, and experienced accelerator collider engineers and technicians move from RHIC operations to the EIC project. This is a gradual movement, to occur throughout the EIC project, to balance the need for the scientific experts with RHIC while ramping up the EIC project. These individuals represent the scientific and technical workforce that are essential to the operations of a complex facility like RHIC and eventually, the EIC. They have critical core competencies in collider operations that cannot easily be replaced and represent a part of the core facility operations workforce of RHIC and the EIC. The temporary reprioritization of funds from the collider facility operations budget to the construction budget will prioritize funding needed to implement the EIC, enabling a cost-effective path forward to the implementation of this world-leading facility. RHIC operations allow for symbiotic, parallel, cost-effective operations of the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer Facility (BLIP), supported by the DOE Isotope Program to produce research and commercial isotopes critically needed by the Nation, and of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory Program supported by NASA for the study of space radiation effects applicable to human space flight as well as electronics. Projects RHIC scientists and engineers focus on completing the installation and initiate the commissioning of sPHENIX. Other project costs for the EIC support scientists and accelerator physicists to advance the conceptual design and conduct accelerator and detector R&D. Integration of laboratory core competencies and participation from across the national laboratory complex and universities continues. Accelerator and detector R&D focuses on reduction of technical risks and value engineering. The EIC Other Project Costs (OPC) funding supports experienced scientists and engineers skilled in collider operations who were previously supported with RHIC base operations and who are essential for the operations of the current and future upgraded collider. 395Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Heavy Ion Physics Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 FY $244,986 -$3,132 $43,204 +$6,891 Funding supports scientists resident at RHIC, universities and other national laboratories to develop, fabricate, implement and maintain scientific instrumentation; participate in select experimental runs to acquire data; analyze data and publish experimental results; develop scientific plans and instrumentation for the proposed EIC; and train students in nuclear science.

Note:- Funding for the subprogram above, includes 3.65 percent of research and development (R&D) funding for the Small Business Innova tion Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. 398Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Low Energy Physics Description The Low Energy Physics subprogram includes two scientific activities that focus on using nuclear interactions and decays to answer overarching questions related to Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics, and Fundamental Symmetries. Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics Questions associated with Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics include: \u0003 What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes? \u0003 What is the origin of simple patterns in complex nuclei? \u0003 What is the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter? \u0003 What are the origins of the elements in the cosmos? \u0003 What are the nuclear reactions that drive stars and stellar explosions? The Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics activities address these questions through support of research to develop a comprehensive description of nuclei using beams of stable and rare isotopes to yield new insights and reveal new nuclear phenomena. The activities also measure the cross sections of the nuclear reactions that power stars and lead to spectacular stellar explosions, which are responsible for the synthesis of the elements. ATLAS, at ANL, is an SC scientific user facility providing research opportunities in Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics, serving approximately 300 domestic and international scientists per year. ATLAS is the world's premiere facility for stable beams and provides high-quality beams of all the stable elements up to uranium, as well as selected beams of short-lived (radioactive) nuclei to study nuclear properties under extreme conditions and reactions of interest to nuclear astrophysics, using the Neutron-generator Upgrade to the Californium Rare Ion Breeder Upgrade (nuCARIBU) ion source. Technologically cutting-edge and unique instrumentation are a hallmark of ATLAS, and the facility continues to be significantly oversubscribed by the user community. ATLAS is also an essential training ground for scientists and students. The facility nurtures an expert core competency in accelerator science with superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities for heavy ions that are relevant to next generation high-performance proton and heavy ion linacs. This competency is important to the SC mission and international stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. ATLAS stewards a target development laboratory, the National Center for Accelerator Target Science, a national asset for the low energy community, including FRIB. Investments to increase ATLAS capabilities provide unique research opportunities including a cost-effective Multi-User Upgrade (MUU) to address a backlog of compelling experiments. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University (MSU) became an SC scientific user facility in FY 2020 and transitions from construction to operations in FY 2022. It will enter its first full year of operation in FY 2023. FRIB wil l advance understanding of the atomic nucleus and the evolution of the cosmos by providing beams of rare isotopes with neutron and proton numbers far from those of stable nuclei to test the limits of nuclear existence. The Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) MIE is one of the primary tools that the nuclear science community has identified as necessary to leverage the capabilities of FRIB. GRETA's unprecedented combination of full coverage with high efficiency, and excellent energy and position resolution, will extend the reach of FRIB to study the nuclear landscape, provide new opportunities to discover and characterize key nuclei for electric dipole moment searches, and open new areas of study in nuclear astrophysics. The High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS) will exploit FRIB's fast beam capabilities, enabling the most sensitive experiments across the entire chart of nuclei with the most neutron-rich nuclei available. Scientists participate in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) research, cond ucting R&D targeting automated optimization of accelerator availability, performance, and operation, as well as software development enabling AI/ML-driven discovery. Scientists participate in the international effort to discover and characterize new \"super heavy\" elements in the periodic table. U.S. researchers played a prominent role in the discovery of Elements 115, 117, and 118, and Element 117 was 399Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationnamed Tennessine to acknowledge the leadership role of the U.S. in these efforts. Research is ongoing to characterize these new elements and to discover Element 120. Past and future experiments were/are made viable by the provision of rare isotopes produced at HFIR through the DOE Isotope Program. NP also supports operations of the LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron to provide beams for an in-house nuclear science program focused on studying the properties of newly-discovered elements on the periodic table, as well as conducting independent searches for new super-heavy elements. DOD and NASA exploit materials irradiation capabilities at the 88-Inch Cyclotron to develop radiation-resistant electronics for their missions. There are three university Centers of Excellence within the Low Energy subprogram, each with specific goals and unique physics programs: the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M University (TAMU), the four facilities at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University, and unique expertise and capabilities for instrumentation development at the Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics (CENPA) at the University of Washington. Fundamental SymmetriesQuestions related to Fundamental Symmetries of nature addressed in low energy nuclear physics experiments include: \u0003 What is the nature of neutrinos, what are their masses, and what role have they played in creating the imbalance between matter and antimatter in our universe? Is there evidence from the electric-dipole moments of atomic nucleiand the neutron that indicate our current understanding of the fundamental laws governing nuclear physics isincomplete? \u0003 Will precise measurements in electron scattering and the decay of nuclei indicate the existence of forces that were present at the dawn of the universe, disappeared from view as the universe evolved? The Fundamental Symmetries activities address these questions through precision studies using neutron and electron beams and decays of nuclei, including beta decay, double-beta decay, and neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD). U.S. scientists are world leaders in the global research effort aimed at neutrino science and owing to the importance of nuclear beta decay in understanding neutrino properties, NP is the SC steward of neutrino mass measurements and NLDBD. Often in partnership with NSF, NP has invested in neutrino experiments both domestically and overseas, playing critical roles in international experiments that depend on U.S. leadership for their ultimate success: e,g, the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE, the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment [KATRIN]). In partnership with NSF, NP also participates in the international LEGEND-200 experiment. The NSAC 2015 LRP recommended \"the timely development and deployment of a U.S.-led ton-scale neutrinoless double beta decay experiment.\" NLDBD can only occur if neutrinos are their own anti-particles. The observation of such events would have profound, game changing consequences for present understanding of the physical universe. NP has invested in R&D on candidate technologies for next-generation ton-scale experiments, including crystals of enriched germanium (LEGEND-1000), liquid xenon (nEXO) and lithium molybdenate crystals (CUPID). The Request will provide support for ton-scale research based on one or more of these technologies to progress toward CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range. Ton-Scale NLDBD research is expected to provide unprecedented resolution for the detection of the rare NLDBD process. The NLDBD MIE received CD-0, Approval of Mission Need, in November 2018. Very precise measurements in parity violating electron scattering, the decay of nuclei, and the properties of neutrons provide sensitivity to new forces and address questions about the matter/anti-matter imbalance rivaling, and even exceeding, the reach of high energy colliders. The MOLLER MIE will measure the parity-violating asymmetry in electron-electron scattering at CEBAF which is uniquely sensitive to the possible existence of new as-yet unforeseen particles. Evidence for electric dipole moments of the neutron and atoms violate time reversal invariance and would shed light on the matter/anti-matter imbalance in the universe. Beams of cold and ultracold neutrons with the dedicated Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline (FNPB) at the SNS are used to study fundamental properties of neutrons, including the flagship experiment to measure the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Scientists engaged in Fundamental Symmetries research are particularly well positioned with their expertise in rare signal detection, to engage in research on Quantum Information Science (QIS) and Quantum Computing (QC). They contribute to R&D on quantum sensors to enable precision NP measurements, development of quantum sensors based on atomic- 400Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationnuclear interactions, and development of quantum computing algorithms applied to quantum mechanical systems and NP topical problems. Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics Research This activity supports high priority research groups at ANL, LBNL, LLNL, and ORNL, and at universities. Scientists develop, fabricate, and use specialized instrumentation at ATLAS, and participate in the acquisition and analysis of data. Scientists design, fabricate, install and commission instrumentation at FRIB for use in the scientific program initiating in FY 2022. The Request supports leading researchers who worked at other facilities to help lead the FRIB scientific mission. The Request continues the GRETA MIE. It also continues implementation of the High Rigidity Spectrometer.

Scientists utilize AI/ML advances to improve machine performance and reliability. Fundamental Symmetries Research The activity supports high priority research at BNL, LANL, LBNL, LLNL, ORNL, PNNL, and SLAC, and at universities. R&D continues for a challenging experiment to measure the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which is sensitive to a wide range of underlying new physics and is a test of charge-parity violation. Other experiments at the SNS FNPB continue, along with minor construction activities in support of this research. First-generation NLDBD experiments finalize analysis of data, such as the CUORE experiment at Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy. Conceptual design efforts continue for international ton-scale NLDBD research, along with targeted R&D. Scientists at TJNAF continue to implement the MOLLER MIE. Scientists participate in the operations of the KATRIN experiment at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Karlsruhe, Germany to provide a measurement of the neutrino mass. University Centers of Excellence at TUNL, CENPA, and TAMU with unique capabilities are exploited to advance research in Fundamental Symmetries. Researchers conduct NP research of relevance to QIS, with a focus on novel quantum sensors. Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics Operations The activity supports facility and operations costs associated with ATLAS, FRIB, and the 88-Inch Cyclotron. ATLAS provides highly reliable and cost-effective stable and selected radioactive beams and specialized instrumentation. Funding provides support for the operations and power costs of the ATLAS, and targeted support for high priority accelerator and scientific instrumentation capital equipment, accelerator improvement projects, and experimental support. ATLAS efficiency and complexity have been increased with the addition of the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS), the nuCARIBU radioactive beam system for accelerated radioactive ion beams, the in-flight radioactive ion separator to increase the intensity of radioactive beams, and a gas-filled analyzer. The ATLAS facility nurtures a core competency in accelerator science with SRF cavities for heavy ions that are relevant to the next generation of high-performance proton and heavy ion linacs. This competency is important to the SC mission and international stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. Critical efforts continue to address facility oversubscription and increase available beam time, with development of the cost-effective MUU Accelerator Improvement Project which will significantly increase the beam hours available for experiments to the scientific community. The Request ramps up funding to support FRIB operations in FY 2023, the first full year of operations for the scientific program. The Request supports beam time for the highest priority experiments, improvements to experimental capabilities, and accelerator enhancements to support progress towards reaching full power. The Request also sustains operations of the 88-Inch Cyclotron for a focused in-house nuclear physics program which includes characterization and searches for new elements and nuclear data measurements. 401Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Low Energy Physics Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 FY $217,470 +$60,328 Research $61,763 $68,059 +$6,296 Funding supports high priority university and laboratory nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics efforts at ATLAS and development of the FRIB scientific program including research support for FRIB scientific personnel.

One major theme of theoretical research is the development of an understanding of the mechanisms and effects of quark confinement and deconfinement. A quantitative description of these phenomena through quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is one of this subprogram's greatest intellectual challenges. New theoretical and computational tools are also being developed by the community to describe nuclear many-body phenomena; these approaches will likely also see important applications in condensed matter physics and in other areas of the physical sciences. Another major research area is nuclear astrophysics, which includes efforts to understand the origins of the elements in the cosmos and what the nature of the neutrino may reveal about the evolution of the early universe. This subprogram supports the Institute for Nuclear Theory (INT) at the University of Washington. It also supports topical collaborations within the university and national laboratory communities to address only the highest priority topics in nuclear theory that merit a concentrated, team-based theoretical effort. The U.S. Nuclear Data Program (USNDP) aims to provide current, accurate, and authoritative data to workers in basic and applied areas of nuclear science and engineering. It addresses this goal primarily through maintaining and providing public access to extensive nuclear physics databases, which summarize and cross-correlate the results of over 100 years of research on nuclear science. These databases are an important national and international resource, and they currently serve approximately five million retrievals of nuclear data annually. The USNDP also addresses important gaps in nuclear data through targeted experiments and the development and use of theoretical models. The program involves the combined efforts of approximately 50 nuclear scientists at 10 national laboratories and universities and is managed by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) at BNL. The NNDC is designated as an SC Public Reusable Research (PuRe) Data Resource, a designation commensurate with high standards of data management, resource operation, and scientific impact. The USNDP provides evaluated cross-section and decay data relevant to a broad suite of federal missions and topics. NP leads an interagency working group including NNSA, NE, the DOE IP, and other federal agencies to coordinate targeted experimental efforts. Nuclear theorists also conduct research related to quantum information science (QIS) and quantum computing (QC). This work is carried out in coordination with and support of other NP/SC efforts including R&D on quantum sensors to enable precision measurements, development of quantum sensors based on atomic-nuclear interactions, R&D on nuclear physics techniques to enhance qubit coherence times, and development of quantum computing algorithms applied to quantum mechanical systems and NP topical problems. In partnership with other SC programs, NP continues its role in jointly stewarding NQISRCs which focus on building the fundamental tools necessary for the United States to create quantum computers that provide a true advantage over their classical counterparts. Scientists continue to develop cutting-edge techniques based on artificial Intelligence and machine Learning (AI/ML) to accelerate discovery in nuclear science research and optimize the efficiency of accelerator facility operations. NP applications of artificial neural networks in data analysis continue to be enhanced and made more powerful. Future \"intelligent\" experiments will seek to incorporate next generation AI advances into the optimization of detector design, detector hardware and electronics. The Request also supports technical development at the intersection between real-time ML and control and optimization of accelerator systems operations, with specific focus on improving the reliability and efficiency of accelerator operations. The Nuclear Theory subprogram supports and leverages lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations that are critical for understanding and interpreting many of the experimental results from RHIC, LHC, and CEBAF. NP supports LQCD computing needs for dedicated computational resources with investments at TJNAF. The Nuclear Theory subprogram also supports SciDAC, a collaborative program with ASCR that partners scientists and computer experts in research teams to address major scientific challenges that require supercomputer facilities performing 405Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationat current technological limits. The NP SciDAC program operates on a five-year cycle and supports computationally intensive research projects jointly with other SC and DOE offices in areas of mutual interest. The Nuclear Theory subprogram supports the RENEW initiative to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not curr ently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem. The Request includes funding for RENEW in the theory subprogram as well as the other NP subprograms with the distribution dependent on peer review results of topical proposals. Research This activity supports high priority research at ANL, BNL, LANL, LBNL, LLNL, ORNL, TJNAF, and universities. This research advances our fundamental understanding of nuclear physics, interpreting the results of experiments carried out under the auspices of the experimental nuclear physics program, and identifies and explores compelling new areas of research. The Request continues support of topical collaborations within available funds to bring together theorists to address specific emerging and high-priority theoretical challenges. The activity su pports high priority efforts on FRIB theory, which is critica l to theory research associated with the planned FRIB scientific program to optimize the interpretation of the experimental results. The Request redistributes support for research related to QIS and QC to provide technological and computational advances relevant to NP and other fields to other NP subprograms, in re cognition of the varying experimental facets of QIS; overall, the NP Request for QIS continues in FY 2023. Following exploratory QIS/QC workshops at the Institute for Nuclear Theory and at ANL, as well as a QC \"test-bed\" simulation to demonstrate proof-of-principle use of quantum computing for scientific applications. The NSAC published a report ccc in October 2019 to articulate further priority areas in QIS/QC where unique opportunities exist for nuclear physics contributions. For exam ple, the report noted that the intersection of Quantum Field Theory and QC was an exciting opportunity for important advances achieved through nuclear physics research. Within available funding, a new competition in support of SciD AC-5 is planned that will result in new awards in FY 2022. The Request supports the second year of these efforts. In addition to addressing specific problems relevant for nuclear physics research, SciDAC projects continue to serve as critical research for highly trained scientists who can address national needs. A planned competition in support of the next round topical collaborations will result in new awards being made in FY 2022. The Request supports the second year of these efforts as well. Funding for AI/ML research continues in FY 2023. These activities help develop cutting-edge techniques based on AI of relevance to nuclear science research, accelerator facility operations, and automated machine operations. The Request expands support for the activities of the USNDP to collect, evaluate, and disseminate nuclear physics data for basic nuclear research and for applied nuclear technologies and their development, providing for world-leading acquisition and dissemination of high quality data for public consumpt ion. U.S. efforts focus on improving the completeness and reliability of data already archived that is used for industry and for a variety of Federal missions, and the USNDP expands the effort to conduct experiments needed to address gaps in the data archives deemed of high priority and urgency. Examples of targeted measurements include gamma ray spectroscopy of relevance for medical isotope science; nuclear beta decay data and reactor decay heat data of relevance for optimizing the emergency cooling systems of nuclear reactors and for the control of fast breeder reactors, anti-neutrino data relevant for basic research, and uranium-238 cross section data using neutron-gamma coincidences important for several Federal missions. NP will collaborate with other Federal Agencies that are members of the NP-led Inter-Agency Nuclear Data Working Group, to carry out experimental measurements. This activity also supports the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative which will provide focused investment on enhancing research on clean energy, climate, and related topics at inority erving nstitutions, including attention to underserved and environmental justice communities. ccc \"Nuclear Physics and Quantum Information Science \" Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, October 2015 (https://science.osti.gov/~/media/np/nsac/pdf/2015LRP/2015_LRPNS_091815.pdf). 406Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Nuclear Theory Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY +$1,863 Research +$1,863 Funding supports high priority QIS efforts.

All Total Estimated Costs (TEC) are funded in this subprogram, including engineering, design, and construction. Other Project Costs (OPC) are funded in the relevant subprograms. The FY 2023 Request continues the construction effort for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The estimated Total Project Cost (TPC) range for the EIC project, which is to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), is $1.7 billion to $2.8 billion. BNL has teamed with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) to lead the development and implementation of the EIC. The EIC scope, cost, and schedule include an electron injector chain, an electron storage ring, modifications to one of the two Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) ion accelerators, and one interaction region with a colliding beam detector. The plan also allows for a second interaction region and its detector, although they are not part of the project scope. The project is expected to attract international collaboration and contributions. Over the course of the acquisition of the EIC, the activities of experienced RHIC scientists, engineers and technicians will be redirected to the EIC TPC as RHIC activities start to ramp down. These individuals represent the scientific and technical workforce that are essential to the operations of a complex facility like RHIC and eventually the EIC. They have critical core competencies in collider operations that cannot easily be replaced and represent a part of the core facility operations workforce of RHIC and later the EIC. The temporary reprioritization of funds from the collider facility operations budget to the construction budget will supplement funding needed to implement the EIC, enabling a cost-effective path forward to the implementation of this world-leading facility. Since the 2002 Long Range Plan (LRP) for Nuclear Science was developed and released, a compelling, persistent, high scientific priority for the U.S. nuclear science community has been understanding how the fundamental properties of the proton, such as its mass and spin, are dynamically generated by the extraordinarily strong color fields resulting from dense systems of gluons in nucleons and nuclei. The answer to this question is key to addressing an outstanding grand challenge problem of modern physics: how quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force, which explains all strongly interacting matter in terms of points like quarks interacting via the exchange of gluons, acts in detail to generate the \"macroscopic\" properties of protons and neutrons. The 2015 LRP for Nuclear Science concluded, \"...a high energy, polarized electron ion collider is the highest priority for new facility construction...\" A National Academies study, charged to independently assess the impact, uniqueness, and merit of the science that would be enabled by U.S. construction of an electron ion collider, gave a strong endorsement to a U.S.-based EIC, and recognized its critical role in maintaining U.S. leadership in nuclear science and accelerator R&D. Scientists and accelerator physicists from both the Medium Energy and Heavy Ion subprograms are actively engaged in the development of the scientific agenda, design of the facility and development of scientific instrumentation related to a proposed EIC. Critical Decision-0 (CD-0), Approve Mission Need, was received on December 19, 2019, followed by CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range on June 29, 2021. 413Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNuclear Physics Construction Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes Enacted Construction $22,300 $20,000 Research Center (SIPRC), ORNL $12,000 $ \u2014 -$12,000 Funding supports the continuation of engineering design of the U.S. SIPRC and long leadprocurements, such as site preparations and materials for known designs of technologies developed under previous projects.Funds will be requested under the new Isotope R&D and Production Program within the Office of Science.Funds will be requested under the new Isotope R&D and Production Program within the Office of Science. 20-SC-52, Electron Ion Collider (EIC), BNL $5,000 $20,000 +$15,000 Funding continues TEC for the EIC.

CD-0 was approved September 13, 2016 and Project Decision (PD)-2/3, which approves the performance baseline and start of construction, was approved on September 19, 2019 with a TPC $27,000,000. This MIE is funded within the existing funds for RHIC operations. Operating funds that are typically used to maintain and operate the PHENIX detector have been used to upgrade the detector. No funding beyond that provided for existing RHIC operations is required. sPHENIX adds electron and hadron calorimeters to the existing silicon tracking capabilities and makes use of a recycled solenoid magnet for a cost effective upgrade. Final funding for sPHENIX is provided in the FY 2022 Request with the project completing in FY 2023. Low Energy Nuclear Physics: Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics MIEs and Research Project: Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) MIE GRETA directly supports the NP mission by addressing the goal to understand the structure of nuclear matter, the processes of nuclear astrophysics, and the nature of the cosmos. A successful implementation of this detector will represent a major advance in gamma-ray tracking detector technology that will impact nuclear science, as well as detection techniques in homeland security and medicine. GRETA will provide unprecedented gains in detection sensitivity, addressing several high priority scientific topics, including how weak binding and extreme proton-to-neutron asymmetries affect nuclear properties and how the properties of nuclei evolve with changes in excitation energy and angular momentum. GRETA will provide transformational improvements in efficiency, peak-to-total ratio, and higher position resolution than the current generation of detector arrays. In particular, the capability of reconstructing the position of the interaction with millimeter resolution will fully exploit the physics opportunities of FRIB. Without GRETA, FRIB will rely on existing instrumentation. In that event, beam-times necessary for the proposed experiments will be expanded significantly, and some proposed experiments will not be feasible at all. CD-0 for GRETA was approved September 15, 2015 and CD-1 was obtained October 4, 2017. CD-3a, which approves long lead procurements, was obtained August 16, 2018. CD-2/3 was obtained October 7, 2020 with a TPC of $58,300,000. The FY 2023 Request for GRETA is $15,500,000 of TEC funding. NP is assessing the impact of constrained funding in FY 2021 and FY 2022. High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS) Research Project The HRS at FRIB will increase the scientific potential of state-of-the-art and community-priority devices, such as GRETA, and other ancillary detectors. FRIB will be the world's premier rare-isotope beam facility producing a majority (approximately 80 percent) of the isotopes predicted to exist. Eleven of the 17 NSAC Rare Isotope Beam Taskforce benchmarks, which were introduced to characterize the scientific research of a rare-isotope facility, require the use of fast beams at FRIB. The scientific impact of the FRIB fast beam science program will be substantially enhanced (by luminosity gain factors of between two and one hundred for neutron-rich isotopes, with the largest gains for the most neutron-rich species) by construction of the HRS. The HRS will allow experiments with beams of rare isotopes at the maximum production rates for fragmentation or in-flight fission. This enhancement in experimental sensitivity provides access to critical isotopes not available otherwise. The 2015 NSAC LRP recognized that the \"HRS...will be essential to realize the scientific reach of FRIB.\" The HRS is being funded through a cooperative agreement with MSU and is not a capital asset (MIE). CD-0 was approved November 2018. CD-1 was approved in September 2020, with a TPC range of $85,000,000 to $111,400,000. The FY 2023 Request for the HRS of $3,000,000 will support the management team, coordination of collaboration activities and allow preliminary engineering and design work towards future critical decision points. 418Science/Nuclear Physics FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationLow Energy Nuclear Symmetries MIEs: Ton-Scale Decay MIE The Ton-Scale NLDBD Experiment, implemented by instrumenting a large volume of a specially selected isotope to detect neutrino-less nuclear beta decays (where within a single nucleus, two neutrons decay into two protons and two electrons with no neutrinos emitted), directly supports NP's mission to explore all forms of nuclear matter. NLDBD can only occur if neutrinos are their own anti-particles and the observation of \"lepton number violation\" in such neutrino-less beta decay events would have profound consequences for present understanding of the physical universe. For example, one exciting prospect is that the observation of NLDBD would elucidate the mechanism, completely unknown at present, by which the mass of the neutrino is generated. The observation of lepton number violation would also have major implication for the present-day matter/anti-matter asymmetry which has perplexed modern physics for decades. Several demonstrator efforts using smaller volumes of isotopes and various technologies (bolometry in tellurium dioxide (TeO2) crystals, light collection in liquid xenon, charge collection in enriched germanium-76) have been in progress for several years, and all are in the process of delivering new state-of-the-art lifetime limits for neutrino-less double beta decay which are of order a few times 10 25 years. The goal of a next generation ton-scale experiment is to reach a lifetime limit of 1028 years. For reference, the \"lifetime limit\" discussed is the time one might have to wait to observe neutrino-less double beta decay if observing a single nucleus only. Fortunately, in the ton of isotope planned for the ton-scale neutrino-less double beta decay experiment there are many trillions of nuclei. Thus, such decays, if they exist, should be observable on a much more reasonable timescale (five to ten years) similar to other large modern physics experiments. CD-0 was approved in November 2018 with a TPC range of $215,000,000 to $250,000,000. The FY 2023 Request of $1,440,000 will support the management team and collaboration activities. Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction (MOLLER) MIE The MOLLER experiment directly supports the NP mission by measuring the parity-violating asymmetry in polarized electron-electron (M\u00f8ller) scattering. This extremely small asymmetry is predicted to be on the order of 35 parts per billion (ppb), which requires unprecedented experimental techniques employed for this experiment. CD-0 was approved December 2016. CD-1 was approved in December 2020 with a TPC range of $42,000,000 to $60,100,000. The project is working on preliminary engineering and design in advance of a combined CD-2/3 planned in Q2 of FY 2023. CD-4 is expected in Q4 of FY2027. The MOLLER experiment is an ultra-precise measurement of the weak mixing angle using M\u00f8ller scattering which will improve on existing measurements by a factor of five, yielding the most precise measurement of the weak mixing angle at low or high energy anticipated over the next decade. This new result would be sensitive to the interference of the electromagnetic amplitude with new neutral current amplitudes as weak as approximately 10 3 GF (Fermi Factor) from as yet undiscovered dynamics beyond the Standard Model. The resulting discovery reach is unmatched by any proposed experiment measuring a flavor- and CP-conserving process over the next decade, and yields a unique window to new physics at MeV and multi-TeV scales, complementary to direct searches at high energy colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is $20,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding and $10,000,000 of Other Project Cost (OPC) funding. The current Total Project Cost (TPC) range is $1,700,000,000 to $2,800,000,000. Significant Changes The EIC was initiated in FY 2020. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approval, Critical Decision (CD)-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, was attained on June 29, 2021. In this Project Data Sheet (PDS), the estimated completion date (CD-4) remains 4Q FY 2033 and still considers the additional schedule contingency that was recommended by peer review. In addition, the preliminary TPC in this PDS reflects continued elaboration of the project scope and shows an increase over the point estimate in the FY 2022 PDS, however, the point estimate remains within the cost range. The project is working to CD-2 which is expected in 3Q FY 2023. The EIC completed conceptual design on January 12, 2021, and achieved CD-1 on June 29, 2021. The project received in December 2021 three detector collaboration proposals with a report recommending a path forward expected in March 2022. In FY 2022, the EIC team will focus on preliminary design of the infrastructure, collider machine, and detector instrumentation. The team is also developing a list of possible long-lead procurements and considering requesting a CD-3A, Approve Long Lead Procurement, in conjunction with CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline. Of the $30,000,000 TPC funding requested in FY 2023, $20,000,000 in TEC funding will support the development and completion of the preliminary design. $10,000,000 will be needed for research and development (OPC) to validate technical assumptions and to reduce project risk prior to start of construction. A Federal Project Director (FPD) has been assigned to this project and has approved this project data sheet. The FPD completed Level 3 certification in FY 2021, and Level 4 certification is in process.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The scope of this project is to design and build the EIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) that will fulfill the scientif ic gap as identified in the 2015 Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) Long Range Plan (LRP). BNL is partnering with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) in the implementation of the EIC. The EIC will have performance parameters that include a high beam polarization of greater than 70 percent from both electrons and light ions, and the capability to accommodate ion beams from deuterons to the heaviest stable nuclei. The EIC will also have variable center of mass energies from 20 to 100 GeV and upgradable to 140 GeV, high collision luminosity from 10 33 -1034 cm-2s-1, one detector and one interaction region at project completion, and the capability for a second interaction region and second detector. The scope also includes a new electron injection system and storage ring while taking full advantage of the existing infrastructure by modifying the existing hadron facility of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) infrastructure at BNL. The electron system will include a highly polarized room temperature photo-electron gun and a 400 MeV linac to be installed in an existing available straight section of the RHIC tunnel. It will include a transfer line that brings the electro ns into the storage ring at the energy of 5 to 18 GeV that will be installed in the existing 2.4-mile circular RHIC tunnel. Modifications to the existing hadron system include the injection, transfer line and storage ring to increase beam energy to 275 GeV. It will include a strong-hadron-cooling system to reduce and maintain the hadron beam emittance to the level needed to operate with the anticipated luminosity of 10 33 -1034 cm-2s-1. The interaction region will have superconducting final focusing magnets, crab cavities, and spin rotators to provide longitudinally polarized beams for collisions, where the outgoing particles will be collected by one detector. An enhanced 2 K liquid helium cryogenic plant is provided for the superconducting radiofrequency cavities, with enhanced water-cooling capacity and cooling towers and chillers to stabilize the environment in the existing tunnel. Civil construction will also include electrical systems, service buildings, and access roads. It is anticipated that non-DOE funding sources such as international collaborations, the National Science Foundation, and the State of New York, will contribute to the EIC Project. The timeframe for commitments by non-DOE contributors will vary throughout the life of the project and become more certain as planning for the project progresses. All non-DOE funding sources will be closely coordinated with the Office of Nuclear Physics and will be incorporated into the project through the change control process once baselined. 428Science/Nuclear Physics/ 20-SC-52, Electron Ion Collider (EIC), BNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationJustification The last three Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) Long Range Plan (LRP) reports have supported the EIC with recommendations ranging from investing in accelerator research and development (R&D) in the 2002 NSAC LRP, to reducing technical risks in the 2007 NSAC LRP, to the actual construction of a U.S.-based EIC in the 2015 NSAC LRP. Specifically, the 2015 NSAC LRP for Nuclear Science recommended a high-energy, high-luminosity polarized EIC as the highest priority for new facility construction following the completion of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. Consistent with that vision, in 2016 NP commissioned a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study by an independent panel of external experts to assess the uniqueness and scientific merit of such a facility. The report, released in July 2018, strongly supports the scientific case for building a U.S.-based EIC, documenting that an EIC will advance the understanding of the origins of nucleon mass, the origin of the spin properties of nucleons, and the behavior of gluons. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets. Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change prior to setting the performance baseline at CD-2. The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the project performance stretch goal. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Approve Project Completion.

Related Operations and Maintenance Funding Requirements Over the course of the acquisition of the EIC, NP will redirect experienced RHIC scientists, engineers, and technicians from RHIC operations to the EIC project. This is a gradual movement to balance the need for the scientific experts with RHIC while ramping up EIC project. These individuals represent the scientific and technical workforce that are essential to the operations of a complex facility like RHIC and eventually, the EIC. They have critical core competencies in collider operations that cannot easily be replaced, and they represent the core facility operations force of RHIC and the EIC. In the FY 2022 Request, RHIC Operations includes a \"reprioritization\" of expert workforce from the RHIC facility operations budget to support the EIC OPC and TEC request. The temporary reprioritization of funds from the facility operations budget to the construction budget will reduce the amount of \"new funds\" needed to implement the EIC, enabling a cost-effective path forward to the implementation of this world-leading facility. As the EIC nears CD-4 when the machine will be restarted, the scientists, engineers and technicians that are needed to operate the EIC will be transferred back to the facility operations budget.

Nurture a diverse and inclusive domestic workforce with unique and world-leading core competencies. \u0003 Mitigate U.S. dependence on foreign supplies of isotopes and promote robust domestic supply chains for U.S. economic resilience. The DOE IP produces high priority radioactive and stable isotopes in short supply for the Nation that no domestic entity has the infrastructure or core competency to meet market demand. The Program is typically the only, or one of few, global or domestic producers for these novel isotopes. Isotopes are high-priority and often rare commodities of strategic importance for the Nation and are essential in medical diagnosis and treatment, discovery science, national security, advanced manufacturing, space exploration and communications, biology, quantum information science, clean energy, climate and environmental science, archaeology, and other fields. Isotopes can directly enable emerging technology, and contribute to the economic, technical, and scientific strength of the United States. The DOE IP utilizes particle accelerators, research nuclear reactors, modern isotope enrichment capabilities, and radiochemical processing infrastructure throughout the DOE National Laboratory complex and at universities to employ and nurture domestic capabilities to meet national isotope demand. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOE IP continued operating as a Department \"Mission Essential Function\" to ensure isotope availability for a broad suite of applications and intervened multiple times to prevent disruptions in supply chains of critical medical isotopes. The DOE IP works closely with U.S. industry to ensure availability of needed isotopes for their continued stability and planned growth and facilitates commercialization of isotope production to the domestic private sector. The DOE IP supports a world-leading R&D program in innovative isotope production, enrichment, and separations. Isotope manufacturing and R&D activities provide collateral benefits for training and workforce development, and promotion of a future U.S.-based expertise relevant to clean energy, accelerator science, nuclear engineering, nuclear physics, isotope enrichment, and radiochemistry. These disciplines are foundational, not only to isotope production and processing, but underpin many essential aspects of basic and applied nuclear and radiochemical science. Research and production activities develop and employ techniques and platform technologies in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics, and advanced manufacturing. The DOE IP manages federal inventories of isotopes, such as helium-3 for cryogenics, quantum information science (QIS), and national security; Russia is the other major producer of helium-3. The DOE IP is also responsible for the national repository of all stable isotopes that were created by the calutrons (electromagnetic ion separation) developed as part of the Manhattan Project. The calutrons ceased operations in 1998, leaving the U.S. with no broad isotope enrichment capability. Russia has the largest stable isotope enrichment capability world-wide, followed by Urenco in the Netherlands, and then China, which is expanding their capabilities. The U.S. inventory of stable isotopes is limited, or has even been depleted in some cases, causing the U.S. to be dependent on foreign supply chains. The DOE IP has developed and is implementing modern stable isotope enrichment capabilities to rebuild domestic manufacturing capabilities, replenish inventories, protect American security, and promote U.S. economic resilience. The DOE IP also considers DOE-owned legacy waste or inventories and extracts isotopes of interest to re-purpose unwanted or excess materials and reduce waste disposal. All funding for DOE IP is executed through the Isotope Production and Distribution Program revolving fund. The revolving fund maintains its financial viability by utilizing the appropriation for the Isotope R&D and Production Office, along with 435Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationcollections from customers through the sale of isotopes and services. The funds in this Budget Request are used to support mission readiness of the DOE IP infrastructure, staff, and facilities; conduct innovative R&D related to the production, enrichment, and processing of isotopes; and strengthen and develop the highest priority new capabilities to meet the Nation's growing demand of isotopes. The customer collections from sales pay for the activities associated with the actual production, distribution, and related services of the isotope. Isotopes sold to commercial customers and foreign entities are priced to recover the full cost of production, or if a market exists, the market price (whichever is higher). Isotopes for domestic research are sold at a reduced price to promote innovation and scientific advances. The National Isotope Development Center (NIDC) is located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and is responsible for the day-to-day business operations for the DOE IP, including sales, contract negotiation, marketing assessment, public outreach, quality control, packaging, and transportation. The NIDC arranges for regular and frequent interfaces between DOE IP and industrial, academic, and medical communities to ensure that strategies are evidence-based and informed by stakeholder interactions. Furthermore, the DOE IP formally canvasses the broad federal community for isotope demands every other year to align priorities with evidence-based program evaluations. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request In FY 2023, the DOE IP anticipates increased domestic demand for novel isotopes, especially for medicine, nuclear batteries, space applications, commercial applications, clean energy, national security, biology, discovery research, and quantum computing. The Program enables high priority production and chemical processing capabilities and supports mission readiness to meet high priority demands, and to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly Russia and China. The DOE IP continues to promote disaster resilience, operating as a DOE Mission Essential Function in a pandemic environment to ensure availability of isotopes for treatment and diagnosis of cancer and infectious disease, and mitigating disruptions in isotope supply chains as a result of Russian sanctions. A diverse and inclusive workforce is nurtured and trained in advanced manufacturing practices, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), AI/ML), robotics and transformative isotope enrichment, isotope production, and chemical separations. Attention is paid to promoting career opportunities for engagement in federal science and technology programs, creating jobs in underserved communities. In FY 2023, mission readiness levels of both radio- and stable isotope production facilities are at an average 80 percent, approximately maintained relative to the FY 2022 Request. This enables the Program to produce high priority isotopes in short supply and mitigate the most critical disruptions in supply chains. On the radioisotope front, there is an effort to develop domestic supply chains of isotopes needed for nuclear batteries and space applications and to mitigate disruptions in Russian supply chains. In stable isotopes, there are global shortfalls for several stable isotope feedstocks that are needed to produce critical medical isotopes to treat and diagnose U.S. patients. These stable isotopes are currently oversubscribed from Russia and the DOE IP strives to ramp up newly established production within available funds. Efforts continue to develop new enrichment technology to promote clean energy and reduce fuel cycle costs and waste. The FY 2023 Request includes $12.0 million in Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding, at the same level as the FY 2022 Request, to continue the U.S. Stable Isotope Production and Research Center (SIPRC) at ORNL, which will provide large scale stable isotope production capacity for the Nation. SIPRC will build upon the expertise in gas centrifuge (GC) and electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) technology nurtured by the Stable Isotope Production Facility (SIPF) and the Enriched Stable Isotope Prototype Plant (ESIPP); SIPRC relieves U.S. dependence on foreign countries and supports national security and economic resilience. Support continues for the conceptual design of the proposed ORNL Radioisotope Processing Facility (RPF), to address a lack of available radiochemical processing infrastructure within the DOE IP complex to make available isotopes in short supply. Current radiochemical separations infrastructure is oversubscribed and in need of refurbishment, and while the DOE IP has the core competency to fill additional gaps in critical isotope supply chains, there is no available processing infrastructure in which to complete the production of some critical isotopes. Funding in core research is approximately maintained to support a diverse and inclusive workforce and participation in several Office of Science initiatives increases. The DOE IP increases efforts in the SC Fundamental Science to Transform Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, pursuing innovative approaches to target manufacturing, such as ink jet printing of thin film targets for isotope production, modular automated systems for radioisotope purification and processing, and modern enrichment technology. As part of the Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE) Initiative, the DOE IP increases support to tackle chemical processing of irradiated reactor targets, which has become a significant obstacle and 436Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationsingle point failure in the program. This is actively limiting the ability of the Program to make available certain new isotope s and provide assurance of the Nation's readiness to respond to disruptions in global isotope supply chains. This funding will develop short-term reactor target processing capabilities at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) Radioisotope Science Center (RSC). The contributions to the MURR RSC will also create jobs in an underserved community in Missouri, enabling new opportunities to become involved in federal science and technology. Critical efforts are modestly increased relative to FY 2021 Enacted in the ongoing SC Quantum Information Science (QIS) Initiative to advance the domestic production of isotopes of interest for QIS. Funding increases participation in the Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative, supporting the Isotope Program Traineeship to promote innovative and transformative approaches to isotope production and processing, including advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and robotics. The Traineeship provides direct funding and emphasizes participation of minority serving institutions, increasing the diversity and equity of workforce development opportunities in the program. The DOE IP participates in two new initiatives: the Accelerate Innovations in Emerging Technologies by supporting transitional research to advance readiness of novel isotopes to preclinical and clinical medical trials; and the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative which will provide focused research investments at minority serving institutions, including attention to underserved and environmental justice regions. The FY 2023 Request continues the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) Isotope Harvesting at Michigan State University effort, which adds the capabilities to extract and process significant quantities of isotopes from the beam dump of the FRIB, cost effectively repurposing unwanted product. FRIB is a Nuclear Physics DOE Scientific User Facility dedicated to the study of nuclear structure and astrophysics research. The FY 2023 Request also supports preparations of ORNL facilities for the receipt, storage, and processing of the heavy curium product stream (for use in californium-252 and actinide production) coming from 65 Mark 18-A targets being processed by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) recovery project at the Savannah River Site (SRS) over the next decade. Research The DOE IP supports core research groups at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), ORNL, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to conduct transformative research for novel or advanced production and separation techniques for high priority isotopes in short supply. Critical medical isotope production activities in the FY 2023 Request are maintained. In medicine, there is quickly escalating interest in alpha and beta emitters for revolutionary cancer and infectious disease therapy and diagnostics. A high priority of the DOE IP remains the dedicated research effort to develop large scale production capabilities of the alpha-emitter actinium-225 (Ac-225), a high-priority isotope that has shown stunning success in the treatment of diffuse cancers and infections. The DOE IP has established itself as the world leader in this arena, typically being the sole global source for man y of these isotopes of interest or leading the way in transformative research and manufacturing to make them available. In addition to Ac-225 derived from thorium-229 processing, DOE IP now routinely produces accelerator-produced Ac-225 and is continuing research to develop efficient full-scale production and processing capabilities to enable sufficient supply of th e isotope for cancer treatment. In partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the DOE IP continues research facilitating the transition of novel radioisotopes and targeted delivery agents from the laboratory to use in clinical trials f or both diagnosis and treatment of disease, supporting a known \"valley of death\" that lies at the intersection of these two federal programs. As part of the SC BRaVE Initiative, National Preparedness of the DOE IP and its ability to perform effectively in times of national crisis is enhanced by the RSC at MURR. The RSC is planned to be located in the Discovery Ridge Research Park near the University of Missouri and will provide the surrounding underserved rural area with job opportunities in isotope science. Funding also supports scientists and engineers to pursue design of the Radioisotope Processing Facility (RPF) for new long-term capabilities at ORNL. Competitive research funds to universities and national laboratories support targeted high priority activities, including research to alleviate the current U.S. dependence on foreign sources of deuterium, which was last produced in the U.S. in 1981. Deuterium is used in the development, production, and sale of compounds used in chemistry, biomedical and diagnostic research, environmental analysis, physics, and the semi-conductor industry. Research topics include production 437Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationof highly enriched lithium-7 and chlorine-37 for molten salt reactors, new sources of helium-3 for cryogenics, advanced manufacturing approaches to isotope production, critical nuclear data measurements, novel radioisotope enrichment technology, next generation targetry, modular automated systems, robotics, the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to isotope production, and production of neptunium-236 for nuclear forensics. Scientists perform simulations and conduct cutting-edge research to develop stable isotope enrichment capabilities. Every stable isotope enriched requires an intense and independent research campaign. Dedicated machines are designed and optimized for isotopes of interest for quantum computing. As this technology is dual-use, nurturing a core competency in this technology is vital to the Nation. R&D associated with purification and processing of the existing isotope inventory continues and other enrichment technologies are investigated. Research to promote clean energy considers isotopically tailored low activation materials for fusion and fast fission nuclear reactors, and transformative technology development to enrich isotopes that can yield fuel cycle cost savings and reduced nuclear waste. The DOE IP supports universities with unique capabilities, such as the multi-particle cyclotron at the University of Washington, where full-scale production of the alpha-emitter astatine-211 was developed to support research into the use of the isotope in cancer therapy; and MURR which the DOE IP uses for the production of lutetium-177 for cancer therapy research, selenium-75 for biochemical and environmental research, and gold-199 for cancer imaging/therapy and detection of environmental compounds. The newest addition to the University Isotope Network is the University of Alabama-Birmingham cyclotron, which will provide niche medical isotopes through the DOE IP. This partnership also provides job opportunities to expand their workforce and enhance their isotope science activities. Funding also supports implementation of isotope production capabilities at additional facilities at Texas A&M University, the University of Pennsylvania, Duke University, and the University of Wisconsin. The coordinated university network is designed to leverage the unique and often underutilized facilities available at academic institutions which are generally more suited to low-energy production reactions and can support nationwide availability of short-lived radioisotopes. Emphasis is placed on providing training opportunities to students and post-docs to help assure a vibrant diverse and inclusive workforce essential to the technologies associated with isotope production. In addition to the recently initiated DOE IP Traineeship Program, which continues as the RENEW initiative in the FY 2023 Request, and supports undergraduate and graduate students. DOE IP also sponsors workshops at professional society meetings to promote communication of advances in isotope availability and invests in the Nation's future nuclear chemistry and biomedical researchers through support for the Nuclear Chemistry Summer School (NCSS) program. The NCSS, jointly supported with SC's Basic Energy Sciences (BES) and Nuclear Physics (NP) programs, consists of an intensive six-week program of formal accredited lectures on the fundamentals of nuclear science, radiochemistry, and their applications in related fields, as well as laboratory practicums focusing on state-of-the-art instrumentation and technology used routinely in basic and applied nuclear science. Facility Operations The DOE IP is the steward of several facilities for isotope production and chemical processing, and in addition, leverages facilities and capabilities across the United States government complex that are owned by other Federal entities. The DOE IP stewards the Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at LANL, the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility at BNL, the Enriched Stable Isotope Prototype Plant (ESIPP) at ORNL, and hot cell facilities for processing and handling irradiated materials and purified products at ORNL, BNL, and LANL. In addition, the DOE IP utilizes the capabilities of the Low Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) at ANL, the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at ORNL, the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at INL, processing and packaging infrastructure for strontium-90 at PNNL, processing and packaging infrastructure for lithium-6 and lithium-7 at the Y-12 National Security Complex, americium-241 recovery from NNSA plutonium processes at the LANL Plutonium Facility, the extraction and distribution of helium-3 at the Savannah River Site (SRS), and the radioisotope separator at INL for nuclear forensics isotopes. Funding maintains National Preparedness and mission readiness for the production and radio-chemical separations of isotopes at a growing portfolio of production sites to provide domestic supply chains of critical isotopes not available commercially or domestically; the isotope production and processing costs are paid by the customer. Infrastructure and capital investments enable critical and compelling enhancements to production or processing capability, including recovery of valuable isotopes from legacy reactor targets (Mark 18-A); development of enrichment capabilities for heavier stable isotopes; and the fabrication and assembly of enrichment technology. Scientists and engineers support the implementation 438Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationof Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory requirements for production of isotopes such as actinium-225 to enable their use in approved or future radiopharmaceuticals. DOE IP supports readiness of ESIPP at ORNL to produce research quantities of enriched stable isotopes using electromagnetic separation and centrifuge technologies. The first campaign at ESIPP produced ruthenium-96 to provide the unique target material to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for its planned physics program. A follow-on campaign at ESIPP focuses on production of ytterbium-176, previously only produced in Russia, and needed to produce high priority medical isotopes to treat prostate cancer. Funding also supports the commissioning of gas centrifuges for SIPF. Some examples of produced isotopes disease therapy and research \u0003 americium-241 and californium-252 for oil and gas exploration and production well logging \u0003 cadmium-109 for X-ray fluorescence imaging and environmental research \u0003 barium-133 for quantum computing research, medical standards, use as targets for discovery of new super heavy elements \u0003 fermium-257 for heavy element chemistry research \u0003 selenium-75 for \u0003 silicon-32 for \u0003 quantum memory \u0003 ytterbium-176 as feedstock for isotopes that treat prostate cancer \u0003 nickel-63 for explosives detection \u0003 lithium-6 and helium-3 for neutron detectors for homeland security applications \u0003 strontium-90, promethium-147, and thulium-170 for nuclear and zinc-65 as tracers in metabolic studies It can take decades for an economically and technically viable commercial market to be formed for any novel isotope. The DOE IP works closely with industry to commercialize technology and promote domestic independent producers in a smooth transition that does not disrupt supply and or prohibit research. At that point, the DOE IP stops production so as to not compete with the domestic industry. Recent examples in which domestic commercial production now exists include strontium-82 for cardiac heart imaging and germanium-68 for medical diagnostics. Projects The prototype capabilities of the ESIPP, developed through DOE IP-supported research, demonstrated the feasibility of new EMIS and GC technologies and re-established a small general enriched stable isotope production capability in the U.S. The subsequent SIPF Major Item of Equipment (MIE) at ORNL modestly increases GC production capability. The implementation of SIPF continues to support the commissioning of GCs to produce enriched Xenon-129. Xenon-129 has demonstrated effectiveness in polarized lung imaging and there is currently no U.S. production capability. This isotope has also garnered the interest of the medical community in monitoring lung function and damage from infectious disease such as COVID-19. The U.S. SIPRC line-item construction project further expands GC production capability and significantly increases EMIS production capability to meet the Nation's growing demand for stable isotopes. SIPRC will mitigate the Nation's dependence on foreign countries for stable isotope supply. CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, and Subproject-1 CD-3A, Approve Long Lead Procurement, was received on November 4, 2021. The current Total Project Cost (TPC) point estimate is $250,000,000 with an updated preliminary TPC range of $187,000,000 to $338,000,000. Demand drivers include enriched stables isotopes for medical, national security and fundamental research projects to mitigate dependence on foreign countries. With support from the DOE IP, ORNL is advancing production capabilities for these stable isotopes, primarily through EMIS and GC technologies. 439Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationIsotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Research Initiatives Isotope R&D and Production supports the following FY 2023 Research Initiatives.

Stable and radioactive isotopes are vital to the missions o f many federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Defense (DoD), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Department of Agriculture, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), NNSA, National Science Foundation (NSF), and other SC programs. The DOE IP conducts the biennial Workshop on Federal isotope Supply and Demand to collect 5-year projections from all federal agencies across the USG complex to ensure adequate supply and evidence-based Program priorities. The DOE IP participates in Federal Working Groups and Interagency groups to promote communication, including the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains, and the Interagency Group on He-3, which it leads and that reports to the White House National Security Council staff. The DOE IP participates in the Certified Reference Material Working Group which ensures material availability for nuclear forensics applications that support national security missions. As a service, the DOE IP collects demand and usage information on helium-4 from the federal complex and provides it to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) so that BLM can optimize their plans for the helium-4 Federal Reserve. While the DOE IP is not responsible for the production of molybdenum-99, the most widely used isotope in diagnostic medical imaging in the Nation, it works closely with NNSA, the lead entity responsible for domestic molybdenum-99 production, offering technical and management support. SIPRC will produce molybdenum-98 and molybdenum-100, precursors to certain molybdenum-99 production routes to ensure domestic supply chain resilience. Program Accomplishments Production of Promethium-147 for Industrial and Medical ApplicationsORNL has demonstrated the recovery of promethium-147, an important radioisotope for U.S. industrial applications, from the radiological waste generated during production of plutonium-238, a radioisotope used in space power systems. Promethium-147 is a radioisotope used to measure the thickness of thin plastic films (as in cell phones), as a power source for nuclear batteries, and in medical imaging applications. The isotope was only produced in Russia and the latest information indicates that they are leaving the market causing a supply disruption. By mining plutonium-238 radiological waste, ORNL minimizes its radiological legacy while providing a domestic source for a critically needed radioisotope, promoting U.S. economic resilience. Additional R&D is being advanced on promethium-147 production from the neodymium-146 irradiation route. ORNL Constructs and Commissions Next-Generation Electromagnetic Isotope Separator ORNL and DOE IP recently completed construction and commissioning of a second-generation EMIS device which is optimized to separate isotopes of high-mass elements that require very high assay, or purity. The newest EMIS is designed to nominally have five times the resolution over the previous modern EMIS devices, which are actively producing high demand enriched stable isotopes at ORNL. The latest design is being utilized to highly enrich ytterbium-176, which will be used to produce the radiopharmaceutical lutetium-177. Lutetium-177 has been FDA approved to treat certain digestive tract cancers, including pancreatic cancer. This new EMIS is also able to simultaneously produce ytterbium-171, which is being collected for quantum memory. SIPRC will include the second-generation design of EMISs. The enriched ytterbium isotopes are otherwise only available from U.S. constrained calutron inventory or new production in Russia. Novel Imaging Analog for the Targeted Alpha Therapy Isotope Actinium-225 Facilitates Development of New Treatments Ac-225 is a tremendously promising radioisotope for treating cancer and is being produced by DOE IP to support medical trials. To facilitate research and promote understanding of the impact and travel of Ac-225 in the body, imaging isotopes are needed that mimic the transport behavior of this therapy isotope. LANL researchers developed and demonstrated the production and purification of cerium-134, which is very well-suited for this task as it attaches efficiently to the same tumor targeting agents as the Ac-225. The novel cerium-134 isotope was sent to collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where the first positron emission tomography (PET) images were collected, showing how this isotope behaved in a mouse model. This work provides a powerful tool for helping to develop additional Ac-225 based treatments for cancer and other diseases and is generating significant interest from the medical and imaging communities. 442Science/Isotope R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationIsotope R&D and Production Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Isotope R&D and Production $ Isotopes, Research $ \u2014 $38,827 +$38,827 Isotopes Research was under the Nuclear Physics program in the FY 2021 Enacted Appropriation with a funding level of $29,660,000.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The scope of this project includes design and construction of a building and associated instrumentation and equipment for enriching isotopes. Electromagnetic isotope separator systems and gas centrifuge cascades will be designed and implemented in this new single facility to promote operational, cost and security effectiveness, with space for future growth. The planned facility will include adequate space for test stands and prototype systems development and will be a purely technical facility (i.e., minimal office and staff amenities), and located on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) main campus. Gas centrifuges and electromagnetic separators are leveraged by existing designs developed from prior projects and R&D supported by the DOE Isotope Program (DOE IP). The laboratory considered the optimal number of production systems for each type of technology as part of the alternatives analysis for CD-1. 452Science/Isotope R&D and Production/ 20-SC-51, U.S. Stable (SIPRC) FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationJustification SIPRC is critical to the Nation and to the DOE IP within SC's Office of Isotope R&D and Production. The facility will expand the only broad U.S. stable isotope production capability to enable multiple production campaigns of enriched stable isotopes. SIPRC utilizes innovative technology to establish domestic supply chains of critical stable isotopes and nurtures domestic core competencies in enrichment technologies using centrifuges and electromagnetic ion separators. This will provide domestic supply chains of critical isotopes for industry, medicine, and national security and mitigate U.S. dependencies on foreign suppliers. The current capacity within the United States is insufficient to meet the Nation's growing demands and the current inventory of stable isotopes is being depleted. The SIPRC project will provide an adequately sized building and transformative technology to address our Nation's stable isotope needs in a more economical and operationally efficient manner. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets , and all appropriate project management requirements will be met. Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) Preliminary Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are defined at CD-1 and may change as each subproject continues towards CD-2, Approve Performance Baseline.

The DOE IP produces and sells radioactive and stable isotopes, byproducts, surplus materials, and related isotope services worldwide, and is often the single source for these critical assets. Isotopes are used for hundreds of essential applications that benefit society every day, such as revolutionary cancer therapy, diagnostic medical imaging, clean energy, explosives detection, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, nuclear batteries, space exploration, national security, and biological tracers. For example, radioisotopes are used in the diagnosis or treatment of about one-third of all patients admitted to hospitals. eee Substantial national and international research, medicine, industry, and national security relies upon the use of isotopes and is strongly dependent on the DOE IP's products and services. A priority of the DOE IP is to mitigate the Nation's dependency on foreign supply chains of isotopes, particularly those from sensitive countries or essential for facilitating innovative technology. DOE IP continuously assesses isotope needs to inform program direction, including frequent industry stakeholder meetings and biennial federal workshops to evaluate U.S. federal demand for the advancement of federal missions and emerging technology. The Department supplies isotopes and related services to the Nation under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which specifies the role of the U.S. Government in isotope distribution. Isotopes sold to commercial customers are priced to recover the full cost of production or the market price (whichever is higher). Research isotopes are sold at a reduced price to ensure that the high priority research requiring them does not become cost prohibitive. The DOE IP operates under a revolving fund, the Isotope Production and Distribution Program Fund, established by the 1990 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (Public Law 101-101), as amended by the 1995 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-316). Funding for this revolving fund is provided by the combination of annual appropriations from the Science appropriation account (from the Office of Isotope R&D and Production Program [IRP] beginning in FY 2022; prior to FY 2022, appropriations were included in the Nuclear Physics program), and collections from isotope sales; both are needed to maintain the Isotope Program's viability. The revolving fund allows continuous and smooth operations of isotope production, sales, and distribution independent of the federal budget cycle and fluctuating sales revenue. An independent cost review of the fund's revenues and expenses is conducted annually by an external contractor. Annual appropriations in IRP fund a payment into the revolving fund to maintain mission-readiness of facilities, including the support of core scientists and engineers needed to produce and process isotopes, and the maintenance and enhancement of isotope facilities and capabilities to assure reliable production and provide novel isotopes in high demand and short supply. In addition, appropriated funds provide support for R&D activities associated with development of new production and processing techniques for isotopes and workforce development in isotope production and chemical processing. Each site's production expenses, including processing and distributing isotopes, are offset by revenue generated from sales. About 80 percent of the resources in the revolving fund are used for operations, maintenance, isotope production, and R&D for new isotope production techniques, with approximately 20 percent available for process improvements, unanticipated changes in revenue, manufacturing equipment, capability and infrastructure upgrades, and capital equipment such as assay equipment, glove boxes, and shipping containers needed to ensure on-time deliveries. The DOE IP produces radioisotopes by irradiating targets in accelerators and reactors at national laboratories and universities, and from extraction of materials and legacy waste. Accelerator facilities include the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Isotope Production Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Low Energy Accelerator Facility at Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Washington cyclotron, and the new addition of the University of Alabama-Birmingham cyclotron. Reactor facilities include the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge eee https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/med-use-radioactive-materials.html 459Science/ Isotope Production and Distribution Program Fund FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNational Laboratory (ORNL), the University of Missouri Research Reactor, and the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. Irradiated targets are processed in associated hot cells and gloveboxes at these facilities. Isotopes are also extracted and purified at the Y-12 National Security Complex near ORNL, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Savannah River Site. Enriched stable isotopes are distributed from inventory and produced at ORNL. In FY 2022, a total of $123.0 million is estimated to be deposited into the revolving fund. This consists of the FY 2022 appropriation of $82.0 million paid into the revolving fund from the Isotope R&D and Production program, plus anticipated collections of $41.0 million to recover costs related to isotope production and isotope services. In FY 2022, the DOE IP expects to sell about 120 different radioactive and stable isotopes to a broad range of research and commercial customers, including major pharmaceutical companies, industrial stakeholders, and researchers at hospitals, national laboratories, other federal agencies, universities, and private companies. Among the isotopes produced, about seven are high-volume isotopes often with commercial applications and the remaining are lower-volume, mostly research isotopes, which are more expensive to produce and thus not readily available otherwise. Collections in FY 2021 included, for example, helium-3, nickel-63, and selenium-75. The DOE IP is the global leader in the development and provision of alpha-emitters for novel cancer-fighting therapies, enabling and accelerating the conduct of clinical trials. Actinium-225 is used in pharmaceuticals under development to treat cancer and other diseases that have metastasized. Actinium-227 provides radium-223 for Xofigo \u00ae, which is the first alpha particle-emitting radioisotopic drug approved by the Federal Drug Administration; Xofigo\u00ae extends patient survival as well as alleviates the excruciating pain associated with cancer that has metastasized to bone. Californium-252 has a variety of industrial applications, including oil and gas well-logging and fission start-up sources in nuclear reactors. Helium-3 is used in neutron detectors for national security and cryogenics and pediatric lung imaging. Nickel-63 supports national security through its use in detectors for explosives and illicit material, and performance of nuclear batteries. Selenium-75 is used as a radiography source. As a Mission Essential Function in the DOE, the DOE IP continued isotope production operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate supply chain disruptions in critical isotopes. The production sites across the national laboratory complex quickly and successfully established safe protocols for continued operations to ensure critical isotope supply and overcame extraordinary global transportation hurdles. Not only did the DOE IP meet commitments to its stakeholders during the pandemic, but the DOE IP monitored international supply chains and stepped in to fill shortages when international suppliers could either not produce or transport their product during the pandemic. In FY 2022, DOE IP expects to make approximately 1,000 shipments of isotopes, which is a 25 percent increase from FY 2021. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request For FY 2023, the Department foresees continued strong growth in isotope demand, including alpha and beta emitters for novel cancer therapy and medical diagnostics; stable isotopes to enable high-discovery science, emerging technologies in medicine and national security; isotopes for quantum information science; isotopes to promote clean energy; and isotopes for nuclear batteries and power supplies. The FY 2023 Request of the IRP Budget is $97.5 million. Revolving fund resources will be used to address the following priorities in the program: \u0003 Promote world-leading core competencies for isotope production to address gaps in supply chains and the provision of innovative, rare isotopes for high priority applications. \u0003 Through cutting-edge research and advanced manufacturing, introduce novel and critical isotopes to the Nation to facilitate emerging technology and applications (medicine, quantum computing, clean energy, nuclear batteries...),promoting U.S. economic prosperity and technical strengths. \u0003 Mitigate U.S. dependence on foreign supply chains and promote domestic production capabilities with technology transfer. \u0003 Advance and expand transformative, domestic stable isotope enrichment capabilities. \u0003 Enhance isotope processing capabilities to address a lack of infrastructure limiting the availability of new isotopes, mitigating single point failures to increase the Nation's preparedness for reacting to global supply chaindisruptions. Address targeted, high priority critical infrastructure needs. 460Science/ Isotope Production and Distribution Program Fund FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe FY 2023 Request in the IRP Budget includes $3.0 million to continue the Isotope Harvesting research effort at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) to extract and process significant quantities of high-value isotopes from the FRIB beam dump. FRIB, funded in the Nuclear Physics program, is a DOE Scientific User Facility dedicated to the study of nuclear structure and astrophysics research. The FY 2023 Request in the IRP includes $12.0 million to continue the U.S. Stable Isotope Production and Research Center (SIPRC) at ORNL, to advance stable isotope production capacity for the Nation to commercial scale production of multiple isotopes simultaneously. The U.S. must continue to implement modern technology if it is to become independent of other sensitive countries with greater production capabilities for enriched stable isotopes . This construction project will build upon the developed expertise in centrifuge and electromagnetic ion separation technology nurtured by the Stable Isotope Production Facility (SIPF) Major Item of Equipment, funded through NP and IRP. The IRP Request supports and participates in high priority initiatives for the Department and Administration, including Quantum Information Science, Advanced Manufacturing, National Preparedness in the Biopreparedness Research Virtual Environment (BRaVE), Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Climate/Clean Energy, Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW), Accelerate Innovations in Emerging Technologies, and Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR). Program Accomplishments Enabling the Development of Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its Type II Drug Master File (DMF) submission for Actinium-225 Nitrate (thorium-229 derived) developed by the DOE Isotope Program. The alpha-emitting radionuclide and its decay product bismuth-213 have gained considerable interest within the medical community for targeted radiotherapy of cancer and other diseases. A DMF is a confidential, detailed document that is submitted to the FDA with information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of human drug products. An active DMF enables clinical investigators or pharmaceutical companies to reference the filing in their regulatory submissions. Domestic Centrifuge Manufacturing Capability The DOE IP completed the establishment of a domestic centrifuge manufacturing capability (CMC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The CMC utilizes state-of-the art machinery and advanced manufacturing techniques to support centrifuge fabrication for the Stable Isotope Production Facility (SIPF) MIE, which has modest centrifuge capability, and the Stable Isotope Production and Research Center (SIPRC) which has large electromagnetic separation and centrifuge capability. UAB joins the DOE IP University Isotope Network The University of Alabama at Birmingham has officially joined the DOE IP University Isotope Network (UIN). UAB will offer Valladium-48, Manganese-52, and Cobalt-55 medical isotopes to the isotope user community through DOE IP. UAB is the third academic site to join the UIN. This partnership sets the stage for more technical jobs and workforce development at UAB, as well as enhanced isotope production technologies. 461Science/Accelerator R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAccelerator R&D and Production Overview The mission of the Accelerator R&D and Production (ARDAP) program is to help coordinate Office of Science (SC) accelerator R&D; advance accelerator science and technology relevant to the Department, other Federal Agencies, and U.S. industry; foster public-private partnerships to develop, demonstrate, and enable the commercial deployment of accelerator technology; support the development of a skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce; and provide access to accelerator design and engineering resources. The overarching goal is to ensure a robust pipeline of innovative accelerator technology, train an expert and diverse workforce, and reduce significant supply chain risks by reshoring critical accelerator technology. By ensuring the supply of leading accelerator technology and facilities, ARDAP supports physical science research that provides the foundations for innovative technologies for green energy, medicine, security, and new tools to help clean up the environment and safeguard the water supply. As the lead Office in the Accelerator Science and Technology Initiative, ARDAP will help coordinate accelerator R&D across SC and initiate new partnerships to move technologies from basic R&D into use at U.S. science facilities and into commercial products that benefit all Americans. Support for this initiative will allow the U.S. to continue to provide the world's most comprehensive and advanced accelerator-based facilities for scientific research, strengthen domestic supplies of accelerator technology, and to continue to attract and train the workforce needed to design and operate these facilities. The ARDAP program is organized into two subprograms: Accelerator Stewardship and Accelerator Production. Accelerator Stewardship The Accelerator Stewardship subprogram supports cross-cutting basic R&D; facilitates access to unique state-of-the-art SC accelerator R&D infrastructure for the private sector and other users, including operating a dedicated user facility for accelerator R&D; and drives a limited number of specific accelerator applications towards practical, testable prototypes in a five-to-seven-year timeframe. The Accelerator Stewardship subprogram also supports curation of software and material properties databases commonly used for accelerator design. Research activities in cross-cutting accelerator technologies include superconducting magnets and accelerators, beam physics, data analytics-based accelerator controls, simulation software, new particle sources, advanced laser technology, and other transformative research. Early-stage collaboration between academia, DOE national laboratories, and U.S. industry will be fostered, reducing the time to commercialization. Research activities will be informed by the requirements of both future SC facilities and the requirements for medical, industrial, energy, environmental, security, and defense applications. R&D investments made for scientific facilities will be leveraged to enable commercial application of advanced accelerator technologies. Accelerator Production The Accelerator Production subprogram supports public-private partnerships to develop new accelerator technologies to sufficient technical maturity for use in scientific facilities, commercial products, or both. Increasing the capabilities of domestic accelerator technology suppliers to both innovate and produce components will strengthen the SC mission to conduct world-leading scientific research. Development activities will support partnerships in advanced superconducting wire and cable, superconducting radiofrequency (RF) cavities, and high efficiency RF power sources for accelerators, among other areas. 463Science/Accelerator R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationHighlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request for $27.4 million focuses resources on fundamental research, operation and maintenance of a scientific user facility, and production of accelerator technologies in industry.

Note:- Funding for the subprogram above, includes 3.65 percent of research and development (R&D) funding for the Small Business Innova tion Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. 468Science/Accelerator R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationBasic and Applied R&D Coordination Accelerator R&D and Production provides the fundamental building blocks of new technological advances in accelerator applications. The Accelerator R&D and Production program was developed based on input from accelerator R&D experts drawn from other federal agencies, universities, national laboratories, and the private sector to help identify specific research areas and supply chain gaps where investments would have sizable impacts beyond the SC research mission. This program is closely coordinated with Basic Energy Sciences, Fusion Energy Sciences, High Energy Physics, Nuclear Physics, and Isotope R&D and Production programs and partner agencies to ensure federal stakeholders have input in crafting funding opportunity announcements, reviewing applications, and evaluating the efficacy and impact of funded activities. Use-inspired accelerator R&D for medical applications has been closely coordinated with the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI); ultrafast laser technology R&D with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and microwave and high power accelerator R&D coordinated with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and DOD, the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (DHS/CWMD), and the National Science Foundation/Mathematical and Physical Sciences (NSF/MPS) Division. Discussions with the NCI, DOD, and NNSA on mission needs and R&D coordination in medical accelerators, laser technology, radioactive source replacement, and particle detector technologies led to a Basic Research Needs Workshop on Compact Accelerators for Security and Medicine fff that was held in May 2019 to establish research priorities for accelerator R&D in this critical area. This workshop was co-sponsored by NNSA, DOD, DHS, and NIH, and has inspired follow-on funding opportunities at those agencies in addition to informing use-inspired basic R&D investments by the Accelerator Stewardship program. These R&D and facility investments are guided through the participation of applied agencies in merit and facility operations reviews. In addition, to ensure R&D is aimed at a commercially viable product, accelerator R&D collaborations are expected to involve a U.S. company to guide the early-stage R&D. Specific funded examples include collaborative R&D on proton therapy delivery systems (joint with Varian Medical Systems), advanced proton sources for therapy (joint with ProNova Solutions), advanced detectors for cancer therapy (joint with Best Medical International), advanced microwave source development (joint with Communications Power Industries, L3Harris, and General Atomics), advanced laser technology development (with IPG Photonics and General Atomics), and technical design studies for high power accelerators for wastewater treatment (joint with Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and General Atomics). Funded R&D awards have resulted in 19 patents, more than 750 publications, and the training of 50 PhDs, and have drawn an average of 20 percent of voluntary cost sharing over the initial years of the subprogram, providing evidence of the potential impact. fff https://science.osti.gov/-/media/hep/pdf/Reports/2020/CASM_WorkshopReport.pdf 469Science/Accelerator R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAccelerator R&D and Production Funding Summary (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized CRFY 2023 Research 10,835 21,436 +21,436 Facility Operations - 6,100 6,000 +6,000 R&D and Production - 16,935 27,436 +27,436 471Science/Accelerator R&D and Production FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAccelerator R&D and Production Scientific User Facility Operations The treatment of user facilities is distinguished between two types: TYPE A facilities that offer users resources dependent on a single, large-scale machine; TYPE B facilities that offer users a suite of resources that is not dependent on a single, large-scale machine.

Accomplishing this mission depends on continued support for undergraduate internships, graduate thesis research opportunities, and visiting faculty research appointments; administration of the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship for K-12 STEM teachers for the federal government; and annual, nationwide, middle, and high school science competitions culminating in the National Science Bowl\u00ae finals in Washington, D.C. These activities support the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers to address the DOE mission, administer programs, and conduct research. WDTS activities rely significantly on DOE's 17 national laboratories and scientific user facilities, which employ more than 30,000 individuals with STEM backgrounds. The DOE laboratory system provides access to leading scientists, world-class scientific user facilities and instrumentation, and large-scale, multidisciplinary research programs unavailable in universitie s or industry. WDTS leverages these assets to develop and train post-secondary students and educators in support of the DOE mission. The WDTS discovery learning-based STEM training programs enable highly qualified applicants to conduct research at DOE laboratories and facilities in support of the DOE workforce development mission. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request for $41.3 million prioritizes funding for programs that place highly qualified applicants in STEM learning and authentic research experiences at DOE laboratories and expands training opportunities to students and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and individuals from underrepresented, underserved groups. The Request increases support for the Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative, which will significantly increase outreach to and workforce training opportunities for underrepresented and underserved groups, described further below. The Request continues strong support for the undergraduate internships, graduate thesis research, and visiting faculty program to help sustain a skilled workforce pipeline. The Request maintains support for the technology infrastructure modernization and evaluation activity, which is critically important for evidence-based management and evaluation practice to sustain the workforce training programs at DOE laboratories. It also prioritizes support for the DOE National Science Bowl\u00ae, a signature STEM competition testing middle and high school students' knowledge in science and mathematics. By encouraging and preparing students to pursue STEM careers, these programs address the DOE's STEM mission critical workforce pipeline needs required to advance science innovation and energy, environment, and national security. Description Activities at the DOE Laboratories WDTS supports activities such as the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI) program, the Community College Internships (CCI) program, the Visiting Faculty Program (VFP), the Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) program, and RENEW. One of the primary goals of these programs is to prepare students to enter STEM careers that are especially relevant to the DOE mission. By providing research experiences at DOE laboratories under the direction of scientific and technical laboratory staff who serve as research advisors and mentors, these activities provide opportunities for participants to engage in research requiring specialized instrumentation; large-scale, multidisciplinary efforts; and/or scientific user facilities. WDTS activities are aligned with the STEM workforce training recommendations of the Federal Advisory Committees of SC's research program offices, the strategic objectives of the National Science and Technology Council's Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan, and the Administration's goals for educating and training a diverse and skilled U.S. workforce for the 21 st century economy. SULI places students from two- and four-year undergraduate institutions as paid interns in science and engineering research activities at DOE laboratories, working with laboratory staff scientist and engineer mentors on projects related to ongoing research programs. Appointments are for ten weeks during the summer term and 16 weeks during the fall and spring terms. 475Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationCCI places community college students as paid interns in technological activities at DOE laboratories, working under the supervision of a laboratory technician or researcher mentor. CCI provides dedicated technical training for community college students who are interested in technical careers and provides a pathway for those who plan to pursue further educational objectives beyond community college. The VFP goal is to increase the research competitiveness of faculty members and students at U.S. institutions of higher education historically underrepresented in the research community, including MSIs. Through direct collaboration with research staff at DOE host laboratories, VFP appointments provide an opportunity for faculty and their students to develop skills applicable to programs at their home institutions. VFP helps increase the STEM workforce in DOE science mission areas at institutions historically underrepresented within the DOE enterprise. Appointments are in the summer term for ten weeks, and faculty may participate in the program for up to three terms. SCGSR's goal is to prepare graduate students for STEM careers critically important to the SC mission by providing graduate thesis research opportunities at DOE laboratories. The SCGSR program provides supplemental awards for graduate students to pursue part of their graduate thesis research at a DOE laboratory or facility in areas that address scientific challenges central to the SC mission. U.S. graduate students pursuing Ph.D. degrees in physics, chemistry, materials sciences, non-medical biology, mathematics, computer or computational sciences, or specific areas of environmental sciences aligned with the SC mission, are eligible for research awards to conduct part of their graduate thesis research at a DOE laboratory or facility in collaboration with a DOE laboratory scientist. Research award terms range from three months to one year. As an active participant in the SC-wide RENEW initiative, WDTS coordinates with SC research programs and DOE national laboratories to develop SC mission research focused training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from population groups and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. S&T ecosystem. WDTS has a unique role to play by significantly expanding SC outreach to students and educators from underrepresented and underserved groups and enabling additional pathways to help them advance along the STEM workforce development pipeline. From October to mid-December in 2021, WDTS completed ten listening sessions with MSIs, community colleges, and underrepresented groups (URGs) to understand the barriers that prevent underrepresented and underserved groups from participating in SC workforce development programs. WDTS is continuing the effort of collecting input from MSIs, community colleges, and underrepresented groups. Additionally, WDTS will, in collaboration with DOE laboratories and SC research programs, continue to develop and implement strategies and mechanisms to remove barriers and facilitate more application/participation by underrepresented and underserved groups, including experimenting with new training models or elements to enable application/participation. Funding will also support DOE National Laboratory-based research or technical training experiences for preparing future scientists, technicians, and professionals to support DOE mission needs. Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act of 1994 charges DOE with administering a fellowship program for elementary and secondary school mathematics and science teachers that focuses on bringing teachers' real-world expertise to government to help inform federal STEM education programs. Selected teachers spend 11 months in a Federal agency or a Congressional office. WDTS manages the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program for the Federal government. DOE and other Federal agencies support these Fellows. SC sponsors placement opportunities in WDTS and in Congressional offices. Other Federal agencies sponsor placement opportunities in their own offices. Participating agencies include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Library of Congress, the Department of Defense, the Smithsonian, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Department of Homeland Security. The Fellows provide educational expertise, years of teaching experience, and personal insights to these offices to advance Federal science, mathematics, and technology education programs. 476Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNational Science Bowl\u00ae The DOE National Science Bowl\u00ae is a nationwide academic competition testing students' knowledge in all areas of mathematics and science, including energy. High school and middle school students are quizzed in a fast-paced, question-and-answer format. Approximately 320,000 students have participated in the National Science Bowl\u00ae throughout its 31-year history, and it is one of the Nation's largest science competitions. WDTS manages the National Science Bowl\u00ae, and sponsors the National Science Bowl\u00ae finals competition. Regional competitions rely upon volunteers and are supported by numerous local organizations, both public and private. The National Science Bowl\u00ae regional winning teams receive expenses-paid trips to Washington, D.C. to compete at the National Finals in late April. Competing teams are composed of four or five students and a teacher who serves as an advisor and coach. WDTS provides central management of its regional events. Technology Development and On-Line Application This activity modernizes on-line systems used to manage application solicitations, review applications, and facilitate data collection, curation, and compilation to support evaluation for WDTS programs. A project to develop, build, and launch new online application and program support systems continues, with evolving new elements that improve accessibility to applicants, advance program oversight and assessment by WDTS program staff, and allow more efficient management and execution of programs by DOE laboratory staff. An important feature of the systems is the integration of a data analysis and visualization capability to support evidence-based management and evaluation of programs. Evaluation The evaluation activity supports work to assess whether WDTS programs meet established goals. This is accomplished through triennial reviews of its program performers, of WDTS itself, and of program performance. These reviews involve peer reviews and Federal Advisory Committee-commissioned Committee of Visitors reviews. In addition, as an important part of assessing STEM workforce training programs, activities are supported to measure short-term program outcomes and assess longer-term program impact. The supported activities include the compilation and analysis of data and other materials, including pre- and post-participation surveys, participant deliverables, notable outcomes (publications, presentations, patents, etc.), and longitudinal participant tracking/outcome analysis. WDTS is also tracking and reporting how its programs, and activities at DOE labs and SC scientific user facilities, fulfill program goals and objectives. The evaluation activity is aligned with the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010, which emphasizes the need for federal programs (including STEM education programs) to demonstrate their effectiveness through rigorous evidence-based evaluation. WDTS works cooperatively with SC programs, other DOE programs, and other federal agencies through OSTP/NSTC/CoSTEM to share best practices for STEM program evaluation to ensure the implementation of evaluation processes appropriate to the nature and scale of the program effort. In support of the RENEW initiative, the knowledge, infrastructure, and capabilities built through the evaluation activity for the current WDTS programs will be leveraged to help set the goals and craft strategies for assessing the new activities, in coordination with SC research programs and offices. Outreach WDTS engages in outreach activities, some in cooperation with other DOE program offices and select federal agencies, to widely publicize its opportunities. The WDTS website (https://science.osti.gov/wdts) is the most widely used tool for prospective program participants to obtain information about WDTS, and it provides a gateway to accessing the online applications for the WDTS programs. To help diversify the applicant pool and provide equitable access, outreach is conducted via multiple venues, with intentional brand messaging, such as hosting panels for and giving presentations to targeted stakeholder groups, sharing information with professional societies, and using virtual platforms to host internship and career fairs. WDTS leverages SC's social media resources to amplify the program opportunities to a broad range of stakeholders, including SC research grantees, scientific professional societies, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other MSIs, and community colleges with a focus on underrepresented and underserved groups. 477Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationWDTS also annually solicits proposals from DOE host laboratories and facilities to develop and execute outreach activities aimed at recruiting more diverse, equitable, and inclusive applicant and participant pools for WDTS laboratory-based programs, and to encourage WDTS program participants to pursue careers supporting the SC and DOE mission, including staffing needs at DOE national laboratories. Emphasis of laboratory outreach activities is on reaching potential applicants who are underrepresented in STEM fields, including building partnerships and targeted outreach to MSIs. Eligible DOE laboratories and facilities are those that host participants in the SULI, CCI, VFP, and/or SCGSR programs. Based upon reported outcomes of annually completed activities, a portfolio of model practices is evolving to help ensure that WDTS activities are fully open and accessible to all eligible students and faculty. The Laboratory Equipment Donation Program (LEDP) is operated under Outreach and provides excess laboratory equipment to STEM faculty at accredited post-secondary educational institutions. Through the General Services Administration Energy Asset Disposal System, DOE sites identify excess equipment and colleges, and universities can then search for equipment of interest and apply via the website. The equipment is free, but the receiving institutions pay for shipping costs. 478Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationWorkforce Development for Teachers and Scientists Funding (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 EnactedFY 2022 Annualized CRFY 2023 RequestFY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) 13,800 13,800 15,000 +1,200 Community College Internship Program (CCI) 1,900 1,900 2,200 +300Visiting Faculty Program (VFP) 1,800 1,800 2,100 +300 Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) Program4,600 4,600 5,000 +400 Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW)- - 10,000 +10,000 Internships and Visiting Faculty Activities at DOE Labs22,100 22,100 34,300 +12,200 Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship 1,200 1,200 1,200 - National Science Bowl 2,900 2,900 3,000 +100Technology Development and On-Line Application 700 700 700 - Evaluation 600 600 600 -Outreach 1,500 1,500 1,500 - Total, Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists 29,000 29,000 41,300 +12,300 479Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationProgram Accomplishments Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) \u2014 In FY 2021, approximately 1,053 placements were supported, of which 12.3 percent were from MSIs and approximately 27 percent were women. Among the participants, more than 98 percent reported positive impacts to their educational and career goals, and 99.6 percent would recommend SULI to their peers. As in prior years, participants continue to make notable contributions to research projects as evidenced by co-authorship in peer reviewed journals, patents, and/or presentations at scientific meetings. A new SULI eligibility category called \"Recent Graduates\" was implemented in the Summer 2019 Term application period, which replaced \"Graduating Seniors\" and extends the period of eligibility for graduates of 4-year institutions and community colleges to two years (formerly one year) between the date of their undergraduate graduation and the start of the SULI term. This change provides additional experience-based learning opportunities for students considering a STEM research career and addresses recommendations from the 2016 Committee of Visitors review. Community College Internship Program (CCI) \u2014 In FY 2021, 126 placements were supported, with 47.6 percent from MSIs. Among the participants, 99.1 percent would recommend CCI to their peers and more than 98 percent reported positive impacts to their educational and career goals. Nearly 95 percent of participants reported that they would consider a job or career at their host DOE laboratory or facility. Visiting Faculty Program (VFP) \u2014 In FY 2021, 63 faculty and 29 student placements were supported, and of these participants, 49.2 percent of the faculty and 41.4 percent of the students were from MSIs. Among the faculty participants, 16 percent were Black or African American and 22 percent were women. All VFP Faculty participants reported a positive impact on their careers, and all expressed interest in continuing their research collaboration. All would recommend VFP to their peers. VFP-Student participants reported receiving a high-quality internship experience (92 percent), with 96 percent reporting impacts to their educational and career goals, and 100 percent reporting they would recommend VFP to their peers. Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) Program \u2014 For FY 2021, the two planned solicitations were released, with one resulting in 65 new awards and the other going through review and selection process; for FY 2022, one of the two planned solicitations has been released for the online application period. As a result of the 2020 SC reorganization, two new program offices (Isotopes R&D and Production and Accelerator R&D and Production) were established, resulting in their research areas added to the SCGSR list. The mission areas from the two new offices were added to the SCGSR research area list. In FY 2022 and FY 2023, SCGSR program will continue the support of graduate research opportunities at DOE national laboratories in SC mission areas that are not well represented in academic curricula; in high demand, nationally and/or internationally, resulting in difficulties in recruitment and retention at U.S. universities and at DOE laboratories; for which the DOE laboratories may play a role in providing needed workforce development; and needed for the SC workforce. Additionally, the program received a steady increase of applications in the four convergence research areas started in FY 2019 and updated through FY 2021 (data science, microelectronics, conservation laws and symmetries, and accelerator science) to address workforce needs for SC's long-range vision on emerging frontiers in science discovery and innovation that increasingly require transdisciplinary approaches. Based on the evidence received in FY 2019-2021, the new convergence research areas will be continued with minor adjustments for the application cycles in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \u2014 All WDTS laboratory-based workforce training programs have been continuously offered and supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic via alternative arrangements. The Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021 Terms of the SULI, CCI, and VFP programs were impacted by restricted access and minimum operations status at DOE national laboratories due to the persisting pandemic. WDTS, in collaboration with DOE national laboratories, successfully delivered virtual internships to more than 1,400 undergraduate students from 2-/4-year colleges and universities, graduate students, and visiting faculty from underrepresented institutions. During the pandemic, the SCGSR program gave graduate awardees three options: delaying their start dates within a 12-month window of flexibility (normally 4-month window), conducting the research project via a hybrid mode, or modifying the project due to uniquecircumstances (such as proximity to graduation and family needs). The participants in these WDTS programs, their DOE 480Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationNational Laboratory scientist mentors, and the host DOE national laboratories were very positive about the virtual internships and hybrid training experiences. Reaching a New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) \u2014 As part of the RENEW initiative, WDTS started and will continue working with SC research programs and DOE national laboratories on understanding barriers that prevent underrepresented and underserved groups from participating in WDTS workforce development programs. WDTS will develop strategies/mechanisms to address these barriers. The effort adopts an evidence-based approach, including listening sessions with MSIs, community colleges, and underrepresented groups, and examining application/participation data from multiple terms for areas of development in outreach, selection, and recruitment and retention. The group effort is ongoing, and the associated findings will be incorporated into the further development and implementation of the RENEW initiative, including the development of metrics for evaluation. Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship (AEF) \u2014 In FY 2021, one of the six WDTS-sponsored AEF participants held a WDTS office appointment. As part of the efforts to expand federal agency participation, the 2020-2021 cohort included placements at the Smithsonian Institution and the U.S. Geological Survey. WDTS established partnerships with other agencies that have expressed interest, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who will host a Fellow during FY 2022. During the pandemic, the AEF participants of the 2020-2021 cohort engaged with their host federal agencies or Congressional offices remotely and actively participated in the program's professional development activities. National Science Bowl \u00ae \u2014 In FY 2021, more than 2,720 middle school students (from 355 schools) and 5,740 high school students (from 811 schools) participated in 108 regional competitions, with 44 middle school teams (211 students) and 64 high school teams (307 students) advancing to the National Finals in May 2021. Forty-nine U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were represented at regionals. More than 2,000 volunteers also participated in the local and national competitions. The National Science Bowl\u00ae Championship Finals are usually held at the Lisner Auditorium, located on the campus of The George Washington University, and feature a live web-streaming broadcast of the event; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all the regional events and the National Finals were held virtually in 2021. The virtual events, particularly those at the regional competition level, enabled more schools from underrepresented and underserved communities to gain access and participation in the events. Due to the virtual format, more than 250 volunteers served as officials at competitions all over the country in addition to their local event. Technology Development and On-Line Application \u2014 Due to the continued pandemic, significant adaptation of the WDTS Application and Review System (WARS) was made in FY 2020 and through FY 2021 to support the virtual internships, virtual mentoring, and collaborative research opportunities for students and faculty at DOE national laboratories. In FY 2021, a Data analysis And Visualization (DAV) capability was added within WARS to support evidence-based management and evaluation of programs. The DAV integration resulted in the synergy of data collection, data compilation, and data analysis in a streamlined process, which enabled the study from data across multiple attributes and years at various granularity levels. While the integration effort is still ongoing, the newly integrated feature has demonstrated its usefulness in providing annual program data summary reports to all host DOE national laboratories, compiling data and information to support both short-term and longer-term WDTS evaluation projects, and producing quick-turnaround data summary and evidence to address inquiries from public and DOE leadership and to support the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional briefings. In FY 2021, the technical development for an updated NSB online registration system to better support regional and national participants was completed, and the planning for the online management tool for the National Finals was initiated, which will have all travel, lodging, and logistical information accessible within WARS. SC went through a re-organization in FY 2020 and as the result, two new program offices were established (Isotope R&D and Production, and Accelerator R&D and Production). New WARS features were developed so the two new offices and their mission areas could be included in the SCGSR online application system. Additionally, the technical requirements and information architecture for a virtual National Science Bowl\u00ae training site on SC's website was continued. Additional development focused on the enhancement of a STEM activity reporting tool with inputs that include event type, sponsorship, targeted audience(s), amplification, and connection to the National STEM Education Plan per OSTP/NSTC/CoSTEM. The goal of this reporting tool is to establish a virtual workspace environment/portal for WDTS program collaboration with its program performers enabling labs to leverage, share, and use participant professional development content and capabilities. 481Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationEvaluation \u2014 In FY 2021, WDTS, in collaboration with the evaluation experts at the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), examined the existing evaluation activities and developed a work plan for building and sustaining a comprehensive evaluation portfolio to support evidence-based management and evaluation of workforce development programs and initiatives in WDTS and SC. Informed by the best practice in the STEM workforce development community, the plan clearly defined the goal, objectives, scope, and expectations for evaluation activities, and established the structure and mechanism for conducting regular short-term assessments of program outcomes and longer-term program impact studies. A list of candidates for short-term projects were developed, with a focus on understanding the information collected via pre- and post-survey about STEM skills/knowledge, career goals, and diversity and inclusion. In FY 2021, WDTS continued and made good process in the planning for the pilot longitudinal study with ORISE. The study was planned for longitudinal evaluation of the impacts of WDTS-sponsored undergraduate internship programs at DOE national laboratories. A proposed study plan has been developed and an internal view has been completed. The next step is to put the plan through a peer review process to gather feedback from external experts before finalizing it. In the meantime, initial efforts have been made to coordinate the study planning with the timeline needed for fulfilling the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and human subjects related regulations. In support of the RENEW initiative, the knowledge, infrastructure, and capabilities built through the Evaluation activity and plan for the current WDTS programs will be leveraged to help set the goals and craft strategies for assessing the new activities, in coordination with SC research programs and offices. Outreach \u2014 In FY 2021, WDTS, in collaboration with DOE national laboratories, completed the development of the DOE complex branded outreach materials. WDTS also supported the distribution of the materials to all DOE laboratories for outreach. In collaboration with ORISE, DOE laboratories, and higher education institutions, WDTS supported and co-hosted a series of virtual events (virtual career fairs and a virtual graduate student recruitment fair) to actively engage MSIs and individuals from underrepresented groups, and to enable equitable access to workforce training opportunities by all. WDTS also supported the development and updates of a comprehensive MSIs database that compiled the MSI designations, Carnegie Classification, institutional information from the Department of Education's Integrated Post-Secondary Data System, and the contact information of key administrators (provost, deans, chairs/directors) for STEM programs/activities at all MSIs. The database also includes the non-MSI institutions that conferred a high level of Associate's, Bachelor's, and Graduate (Master's and Doctoral) degrees to individuals from underrepresented race and ethnicity groups, including African Americans, Indigenous Americans, and Hispanics or Latinos. The MSIs database has been used to support the engagement efforts with MSIs and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusiveness in SC programs and DOE national laboratories. DOE host laboratories and facilities executed projects aimed at recruiting a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive applicant and participant pool to WDTS laboratory-based training programs, targeting recruitment of individuals traditionally underrepresented in STEM and addressing needs to increase the applicant and participant pool diversity for the WDTS programs currently implemented at DOE host laboratories and facilities. As one outcome, a \"Mini-Semester\" experience that brings prospective applicants from underrepresented communities to DOE laboratories in a week-long immersion experience is proving successful and being adopted by increasing numbers of host labs. In FY 2021, Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory hosted students during their \"Mini-Semesters.\" A complex-wide virtual career fair was also held during which laboratories were able to access and recruit potential applicants using an online \"recruitment booth\" presence. WDTS also supported a virtual Graduate School Fair that gave student interns an opportunity to learn about graduate school programs and opportunities directly from university representatives. WDTS completed the LEDP online system migration from the Office of Scientific and Technical Information to ORISE that integrates LEDP's equipment catalog, applications, reviews, and processing into WDTS online systems. In FY 2021, the summary reporting capability per General Services Administration requirement was completed and the development of an online reporting tool in WARS for LEDP grantee institutions was started, which would collect information on how the donated equipment were used to support STEM education activities by the receiving institutions. By using established online resources, and their capabilities, this migration improves the client experience when accessing and applying for equipment, and improves management and execution of equipment transfer processes. Updates to eligibility and use 482Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationrequirements better align LEDP to SC and DOE workforce mission priorities, as well as improves accountability for the excess donated equipment with the implementation of recipient reporting. 483Science/Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationWorkforce Development for Teachers and Scientists Activities and Explanation of Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 Request vs FY 2021 Enacted Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists $29,000 $41,300 +$12,300 Activities at the DOE Laboratories Laboratory Internship SULI supports approximately 1,132 students.The Request for SULI will support approximately 988 students with an increased allocation per participant.

The main priorities of the SLI program are improving SC's existing physical assets (including major utility systems) and funding new cutting-edge facilities that enable emerging science opportunities. The SLI program , consisting of Line-Item Construction Projects and General Plant Projects (GPP), also funds Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) to local communities around the Argonne, Brookhaven, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories as well as Nuclear Operations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and landlord responsibilities across the Oak Ridge Reservation. SC manages an infrastructure portfolio worth nearly $22 billion, which is composed of 13 sites with nearly 23 million gross square feet (gsf) in 1,570 government owned buildings. SC assets at the 10 national laboratories include major research and user facilities, laboratory and office buildings, support facilities, and a vast network of utilities that form the backbone of each site. SC provides significant stewardship of research facilities, the renovation and replacement of general-purpose infrastructure, including buildings and support infrastructure. However, approximately half of the buildings are rated substandard or inadequate to meet mission needs. In addition, nearly two-thirds of support infrastructure, including utility systems, is rated as substandard or inadequate. This resulted in unplanned outages, costly repairs, elevated safety risks and inefficiencies. In collaboration with SC programs and the laboratories, the SLI program works to address identified deficiencies to reduce the impacts on the mission. SC laboratories conduct rigorous and consistent analyses of the condition, utilization, mission readiness, and resilience of the facilities and infrastructure which are most critical to mission accomplishment. SC and the laboratories use these assessments to develop comprehensive Campus Strategies in the annual laboratory planning process. To support the core capabilities and achieve the scientific vision, each laboratory's Campus Strategy identifies activities and infrastructure investments such as Line-Item (LI) Construction and General Plant Projects (GPPs). SC leadership uses these Campus Strategies to determine the facilities and infrastructure needs and priorities, which, combined with complex-wide infrastructure analyses, form the basis of SLI budget requests. To sustain and enhance its general-purpose infrastructure, SC invested over $613.7 million in maintenance, repair, and construction in FY 2021. These investments came from a variety of funding sources including Federal appropriations for line-item and general plant projects and laboratory overhead funding of Institutional GPP (IGPP) projects as well as maintenance and repair. The SLI investments in line-item construction and science-supporting general infrastructure are key elements of this overall investment strategy. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request The SLI program Request continues to focus on improving infrastructure across the SC national laboratory complex. The FY 2023 Request does not include any new line-item construction projects. The Request also supports eleven ongoing construction projects: 1. Princeton Plasma Innovation Center at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL);2. Critical Utilities Rehabilitation Project at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL);3. Seismic and Safety Modernization project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL);4. Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Renovation and Expansion project at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF); 5. Large Scale Collaboration Center at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC);6. Critical Infrastructure Recovery & Renewal at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL);7.

Construction +34,650 Funding supports eleven ongoing line-item at ANL, BNL, FNAL, LBNL, 493Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationProgram Accomplishments Since FY 2006, the SLI program has invested nearly $1.8 billion in general purpose infrastructure across the SC-stewarded laboratory complex. These investments have provided state-of-the-art science user support facilities, renovated, and repurposed aged facilities, upgraded inadequate core infrastructure and systems, and removed excess. Line-Item Construction Projects. Since FY 2006, the SLI program has successfully completed 16 line-item projects while garnering thirteen DOE Secretary's Achievement Awards. These investments occurred following an FY 2006 SC decision to initiate a major effort to modernize infrastructure across the SC-stewarded laboratory complex. With these investments, the SLI program constructed more than 1,207,000 gsf of new space and modernized more than 452,000 gsf of existing space. As a result, an estimated 2,900 laboratory users and researchers now occupy newly constructed and/or modernized buildings that better support scientific and technological innovation in a collaborative environment. Core General Plant Project upgrades across SC Laboratories. Since FY 2016, SLI has funded nearly $203,000,000 in 36 laboratory core infrastructure improvement projects (GPP projects with TEC less than $20,000,000) including $133,000,000 in electrical and utility improvements, $35,340,000 in building renovations, $28,800,000 in safety and environmental projects and $5,730,000 in sustainability. Examples of recent SLI investments in core infrastructure include building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) upgrades at BNL, access control upgrades at Ames and Fermi and steam to hydronics conversion at PNNL. SLI also funded electrical substation and building HVAC system improvements at LBNL, cooling tower water reuse at TJNAF and facility improvement including fire protection at the Office of Scientific and Technical Information. Building 350 Legacy Project at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). As of the end of FY 2020, this SLI-funded project removed all 20,253 nuclear material items from the former New Brunswick Laboratory building. The project also cleaned up approximately 20,481 square feet of the building's 28,598 total square feet that is within this project's scope for cleanout, a part of which is currently being used for programmatic work. The project continues to remove the remaining nuclear materials and clean-up space so the building can eventually be renovated and repurposed as a radiological facility by ANL, with project completion scheduled for FY 2022. 494Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience Laboratories Infrastructure Infrastructure Support Description This subprogram supports investments that focus on laboratory core infrastructure and operations. Continuing investments in core infrastructure (e.g., utility systems, site-wide services, and general-purpose facilities) ensure that facilities and utilities are either upgraded or replaced as they approach end-of-life. Upgraded facilities have improved reliability, resilience, efficiency, and performance. This subprogram also supports nuclear operations at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), funds stewardship-type needs (e.g., roads and grounds maintenance) across the Oak Ridge Reservation, and funds Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) to local communities around the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and ORNL. Stewardship-type needs (e.g., roads and grounds maintenance) across the Oak Ridge Reservation are also included. Facilities and Infrastructure This activity supports minor construction investments (general plant projects of less than $20,000,000) that address urgent and emerging core infrastructure needs. SC laboratories conduct rigorous condition assessments of their core infrastructure, which determine the need for investments in these basic systems that form the backbone of their campuses. The Science Laboratories Infrastructure program maintains an active list of critical core infrastructure investment needs. Projects are evaluated on mission readiness, cost savings (including energy and water), environment safety and health issues, sustainability (including net zero initiatives), resilience, and reliability. Priorities are evaluated continuously, an d the highest priority projects are selected for funding upon entry into the corresponding execution year. Oak Ridge Nuclear Operations To support critical DOE nuclear operations, this Request includes funding to operate ORNL's non-reactor nuclear facilities (i.e., Buildings 7920, 7930, 3525, 3047, and 3025E).

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Princeton Plasma Innovation Center (PPIC) project is $10,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The TEC range for this project is $78,300,000 to $96,300,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $80,500,000 to $98,500,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $98,500,000. This project will provide a multi-purpose facility with modern, flexible, efficient, and agile research laboratories and office space to conduct plasma research activities in support of multiple SC programs.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The Princeton Plasma Innovation Center (PPIC) is envisioned as a 77,000 to 107,000 gross square feet (gsf) multi-story office and laboratory building at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) to serve as a single new multi-use facility that will house space for offices, medium bay research labs for diagnostics and fabrication, remote experiment participation and collaboration, and research support. Justification To advance the plasma science and fusion frontier in support of the DOE mission, PPPL requires new or enhanced facilities and infrastructure to foster innovation to make fusion energy a practical reality and further U.S. economic competitiveness. The primary SC program relevant to the PPIC project is Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), and the primary Core Capability is Plasma and Fusion Energy Sciences. The missions of SC's Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Basic Energy Sciences programs are also relevant to the mission need for the PPIC with second order effect to Large Scale User Facilities/Advanced Instrumentation and Systems Engineering and Integration. PPPL plays a key role in assisting FES achieve its strategic goals. The PPPL vision is \"enabling a world powered by safe, clean , and plentiful fusion energy while leading discoveries in plasma science and technology.\" To support this vision, PPPL carries out experiments and computer simulations of the behavior of plasma, which is hot electrically charged gas. Plasmas with sufficient temperature generate fusion reactions. Therefore, PPPL's aim is to be a leading center for future fusion concepts. The understanding of plasma and its related technologies also has a broad impact on many other scientific fields and applications that are central to U.S. economic health and competitiveness. This impact extends to astrophysics and space sciences, plasma-material interactions, plasma processing, particle acceleration, and high energy density plasmas. Many industries, such as the microelectronics industry, utilize plasmas to synthesize and shape the materials in their products. These industries are increasingly seeking collaboration with PPPL to improve their understanding of existing plasma processes and to develop new modeling and measurement techniques potentially leading to new processes and applications. PPPL, in collaboration with Princeton University, is strengthening its efforts to develop innovations for the nex t generation microelectronics to advance economic competitiveness, national security, and future energy applications. However, the current condition, capabilities, and configuration of PPPL infrastructure do not adequately support current or planned scientific efforts. In particular, the lack of adequate laboratory infrastructure, modern collaboration space, and modern office infrastructure are not optimal to support PPPL research. PPPL would benefit from office and laboratories capabilities that can effectively accomplish the advancement of the FES mission. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets. 516Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 21-SC-71, Princeton Plasma InnovationCenter, PPPL Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Critical Infrastructure Recovery & Renewal (CIRR) project is $4,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The preliminary TEC range for this project is $80,100,000 to $96,000,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $81,800,000 to $97,700,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $89,000,000. Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory's (PPPL's) increasingly unreliable, non-redundant, utility infrastructure is negatively impacting laboratory operations. Scientific productivity is dependent on a capable, available, flexible, maintainable, reliable , and resilient support infrastructure. This project will provide critical infrastructure needed to operate the laboratory missions safely and efficiently. These systems will be modern and energy efficient, reducing the operating cost and improving the resilience of the facilities. Significant Changes This project was a new start in the FY 2021 Request. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B Critical Decision (CD) is CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, which was approved on February 23, 2021.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The CIRR project at PPPL will revitalize critical infrastructure that supports the PPPL campus to ensure reliability and resilience. Upgrades that may be completed as part of the CIRR project include: the electrical distribution system; standby power; chilled water generation and distribution; distribution networks for steam, compressed air, sanitary waste, and condenser, storm, canal, and potable water; HVAC systems; and communication systems. The scientific activities that require reliable and resilient utilities include: NSTX-U; LTX- ; and FLARE. Justification PPPL is a significant element of the DOE capability in plasma science and directly supports the DOE mission to make fusion energy a practical reality and further U.S. economic competitiveness. To maintain system operability, it is essential to have reliable infrastructure in place. The current systems are at capacity, unreliable, and inefficient. Portions of the current system are part of the original infrastructure built in 1958. To maintain current missions and enable future ones, the infrastructure must be upgraded with modern, efficient, and reliable systems. CIRR will deliver significantly more modern and resilient general-purpose infrastructure. The combination of data collection and artificial intelligent monitoring systems will be able to adjust to trends, predict maintenance requirements, and react to extreme weather events, such as automatically transfer power to minimize impacts to mission critical scientific operations. Additionally, modern utility systems will be more efficient and sustainable. For example, replacing the obsolete hot deck/cold deck HVAC system will not only result in repair savings, but will generate significant energy savings as well. Every element of this project will be designed to consider the best available and most efficient technology. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets. 524Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 21-SC-72, Critical Infrastructure Recovery& Renewal, PPPL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Critical Utilities Rehabilitation Project (CURP) is $13,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The preliminary TEC range for this project is $70,000,000 to $92,000,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $71,000,000 to $93,000,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $93,000,000. This project will upgrade failing utility infrastructure that is still in use from BNL's origins as World War II Army Camp Upto n. Utility systems including steam, water, sanitary sewer, chilled water, and electrical systems will be revitalized and upgraded to meet the needs of supporting SC facilities and the Nuclear Physics (NP), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), High Energy Physics (HEP), Biological and Environmental Research (BER), and Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) programs. The project will address the most critical vulnerabilities and assure reliable and stable utility services to mission critical faci lities. By replacing failure-prone and inefficient equipment the utility systems will be revitalized and made more efficient. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2020. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-1/3A, Approve Alternate Selection and Cost Range/Approve Long Lead Procurements, which was approved on February 6, 2020. The project is constructing long lead procurements in accordance with the approved CD-3A scope. FY 2023 funds will support construction activities after the appropriate CD approvals. A Federal Project Director with the appropriate certification level (Level II: TPC greater than $50,000,000 and equal to or less than $100,000,000) was assigned to this project at CD-1.

Project Scope and Justification Scope CURP's scope is to revitalize and upgrade the highest risk major utility systems across the BNL campus by replacing piping in areas prone to water main breaks and provide other water system improvements to improve system operations and reliability. The project will also replace select sections of the sanitary utility systems with failing pumps, controllers, and /or manholes, and provide several required modifications to the central chilled water system in order to support growth of process loads and assure reliability. CURP will replace deteriorated and leaking steam systems along Cornell Avenue to assure safe, reliable, and efficient steam service to mission critical facilities on the north side of the campus. Also, older feeder cables and inadequate breakers will be replaced to increase capacity, reliability, and personnel safety. Justification BNL is a multi-program DOE national laboratory with recognized impact on national science needs. BNL provides scientific leadership in NP, photon sciences, energy science for BES, and data-driven discovery for ASCR, with leading programs in selected areas of HEP, BER, accelerator science and technology, and national security and non-proliferation. BNL utilizes world-class facilities and core expertise to: advance energy and environment-related basic research and apply them to 21 st century problems of critical importance to the Nation; and advance fundamental research in nuclear and particle physics to gain a deeper understanding of matter, energy, space, and time. Although there has been substantial investment in recent years to modernize and construct new research facilities at BNL, much of BNL's utility infrastructure serving these facilities is over 50 years old and some is over 70 years old, dating to BNL 's origin as a U.S. Army base during World Wars I and II. Efficient, maintainable, and reliable utilities are critical to the succ ess and mission capability of BNL's research facilities. Currently, a significant portion of BNL's utility infrastructure is beyond useful life and suffering from failures, decreased reliability, lack of redundancy, and limitations in capacity. For example, a June 2021 failure of a condensate pipe in the steam system will require approximately $3.2 million of repairs as part of the 532Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-71, Critical Utilities Rehabilitation Project, BNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationCURP project. As such, there is an urgent need to revitalize and selectively upgrade BNL's existing major utility systems to assure reliable service, meet capacity requirements, and enable readiness of facilities critical to the research mission. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The SSM project will construct a new facility on the existing cafeteria site to house the cafeteria, health services and operational support services (human resources, conferencing, and other potential groups) to meet the requirements of Risk Category III of the California Building Code (CBC). In addition, the second floor of the B48 (Fire House) will be seismically upgraded to meet Risk Category IV of the CBC. Justification Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) executes 22 of the Office of Science's (SC'S) 24 core capabilities and the mission of multiple SC program offices, with specifically strong presences of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), Biological and Environment Research (BER), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), and High Energy Physics (HEP) programs. LBNL is located on a 202-acre site in the hills above the University of California, Berkeley campus employs approximately 3,400 full time employees; and is home to five SC national user facilities: the Advanced Light Source, the Energy Sciences Network, the Joint Genome Institute, the Molecular Foundry, and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. In FY 2016, over 11,000 researchers used these facilities, representing roughly one third of the total for all SC user facilities. In pursuing the SC mission, LBNL leverages collaborative science to bring together teams of individuals with different fields of expertise to work together on common solutions to the SC mission. However, these research activities must be executed with a unique caution since LBNL is located less than one mile from the Hayward Fault and less than 25 miles from the San Andreas Fault, which would both pose a life safety risk to employees, visitors, and guests during a significant seismic event. The U.S. Geological Survey's newest earthquake forecast, the third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, states a 98 percent probability of a 6.0 magnitude or higher earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area before 2043. Recent engineering evaluations from a San Francisco Bay Area structural engineering firm have identified significant and extensive seismic safety hazards in critical LBNL support buildings, including the Cafeteria, Health Services, and Fire House. Structural deficiencies identified in these buildings will likely cause significant structural damage with life safety hazards during a magnitude 6.0+ earthquake on the Hayward Fault or a magnitude 8.3 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault and will impede LBNL's ability to resume operations. The SSM project will address seismic safety issues and emergency response capabilities, specifically related to facilities with large congregation areas as well as improve facilities and transportation capabilities that are necessary for emergency response personnel and maintaining continuity of operations. The facilities that are the primary focus of this project are the Cafeteria, Health Services, and Fire House sleeping quarters. Demolition of the cafeteria is anticipated to allow for construction of a new, more sustainable, and operationally resilient facility. Additional supporting functions such as utilitie s or site modifications may be included in the project if they are deemed necessary. 540Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-72, Seismic and Safety Modernization, LBNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationThe project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets .

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Renovation and Expansion (CRE) project is $2,000,000. The preliminary Total Estimated Cost (TEC) range for this project is $47,000,000 to $96,000,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $50,000,000 to $99,000,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $90,000,000. The CEBAF center at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) is currently overcrowded and has inadequate utility systems that are experiencing frequent failures. This project will renovate 131,000 to 250,000 gross square feet (gsf) of existing space in the CEBAF center and the Applied Research Center (ARC), upgrade high risk utility systems, and provide 82,000 to 150,000 gsf of additional space for visitors, users, research, education, and support. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2020. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B Critical Decision (CD) is CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, which was approved on March 18, 2019. FY 2023 funds will support Project Engineering and Design (PED) activities, and construction and associated activities. A Federal Project Director with the appropriate certification (Level II: TPC greater than $50,000,000 and equal to or less than $100,000,000) has been assigned to this project.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The scope of the CRE project will include renovating 131,000 to 250,000 gsf of existing space and providing 82,000 to 150,000 gsf of additional office and laboratory space (including acquisition of the ARC) for 120 to 200 research, education, and support staff. The renovation will include reconfiguration to provide more functional, flexible, and efficient spaces that meet current code standards. CRE will replace the mechanical systems in the existing CEBAF Center, which have exceeded their service life and experienced multiple failures. The renovated building will be energy sustainable and will meet high performance building standards, including energy conservation, green building principles, and sustainable design. Also, the project will design the building to meet Federal legislative objectives. Upon completion, SC will relocate administrative and support staff from the Service Support Center (SSC) (leased space) into the ARC, and TJNAF will dedicate the CEBAF Center to scientific staff to more efficiently address functional workspace needs for TJNAF staff and users. Justification With nearly 1,600 users, TJNAF supports one of the largest nuclear physics user communities in the world. The expanded scientific scope associated with the 12 GeV upgrade (e.g., double the energy with simultaneous delivery to four experimental halls) is creating more and larger collaborations, requiring more technical workshops, and resulting in more visitors to the Laboratory. The Laboratory expects staff and user population to increase 2 percent per year for the next 10 years and will soon exceed available space, which is already near capacity. Further, TJNAF is actively pursuing several large inter-entity transfer projects such as the cryomodules and cryogenics plants for Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)-I, LCLS-II-High Energy, Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), and the Utilities Upgrade Project (UUP) that will require additional staffing. TJNAF will continue to play a key role in the design and development of emerging SC initiative(s). Currently, TJNAF is lacking technically equipped and functional space to accommodate advanced scientific research and major missions on the immediate horizon. The existing CEBAF Center is well beyond full capacity. The current occupant 548Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-73, CEBAF Renovation and Expansion, TJNAF FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationdensity of this building is 110 gsf per occupant which is significantly below the DOE standard of 180 gsf per occupant. In addition, utility systems at the CEBAF center are inadequate, failing, and inefficient for the existing usage. TJNAF also continues to advance a strategic campus plan designed to deliver more attractive, mission-focused, and functional workspaces by consolidating the Laboratory workforce scattered over several leased buildings in a single center that provides more effective and efficient operations. This includes appropriately consolidating workers currently housed in the ARC and SSC leased spaces. This would allow for leases to be discontinued and reduce the cost to sustain existing buildings and infrastructure and more efficiently address functional workspace needs for TJNAF staff and users. This project will upgrade mechanical systems and provide 82,000 to 150,000 gsf of additional space for visitors, users, research, education, and support especially for projects such as 12 GeV and the newly planned EIC at BNL. The CRE project infrastructure and buildings will support climate resilience by being designed to account for projected changes in temperature and precipitation through building energy efficiency, precipitation retention, buried electrical distribution and enhanced monitoring of assets to reduce the risk of failure as climate conditions change. TJNAF must be prepared to accommodate planned staff and user growth which means additional office space must be programmed soon. The Laboratory is pursuing Major Items of Equipment (MIEs), several large inter-entity transfer projects for other national laboratories, and a pivotal technical role in a proposed Electron Ion Collider. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2. At CD-2 approval, the KPPs will be baselined. The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the desired project performance. Achievement of the Threshold KPPs will be a prerequisite for approval of CD-4, Project Completion.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost History Summary The FY 2023 Request for the Large Scale Collaboration Center (LSCC) is $30,000,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The preliminary TEC range for this project is $56,000,000 to $90,400,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $58,000,000 to $92,400,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $66,000,000. This project will construct a new facility allowing for collocation of cross-functional teams in a common building, providing synergies between all major SC-sponsored programs. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2020. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B Critical Decision (CD) is CD-1, Approve Alternative Selection and Cost Range, which was approved on November 18, 2019. The project performed an analysis of Alternatives and determined the preferred alternative is to construct a new building, which the SLI program approved. FY 2023 funds will support long-lead procurements and early construction activities after the appropriate CD approvals.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The LSCC project will construct a multi-office building of approximately 34,000 to 45,000 gross square feet (gsf) to consolidate and provide space for 100-150 occupants in a common building. The LSCC will provide synergies among all major SC-sponsored programs at SLAC and provide a centralized office and collaboration space for cross-functional teams with the necessary performance capabilities to grow the science research programs. Justification Advances in scientific exploration require the coordinated development of an extensive range of sophisticated imaging tools and extremely large amounts of data sets and images for current and future user facilities and research programs, including the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the LCLS-II and LCLS-II-HE, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (EM), at the Hadron Collider (LHC), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET)-II. Existing buildings provide sufficient laboratory and experimental space. Current office spaces near experimental areas, however, are fully occupied or oversubscribed, and projected staff and user increases exceed availability of adequate space. Office spaces in current buildings are not properly configured and do not address the pressing need to accommodate teams that are developing critical algorithms and data analysis techniques alongside staff scientists or visiting researchers and users. With growing numbers of scientific staff and users dealing with increased rates of data generation on the order of terabytes per second streaming from detectors, it is essential to reduce data volumes while preserving the science content of the data. This can be accomplished by collaborating with expertise in data science and massive-scale data analytics. The real- 556Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-75, Large Scale Collaboration Center, SLAC FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationtime computing for data reduction and, most importantly, for feedback defines the scale of the computing infrastructure required onsite and offsite. This real-time feedback, done during experiment operation and between shifts, is instrumental for the user to optimize the experiment and receive datasets as complete as possible before leaving the facility. Cross-functional teams that understand accelerator and instrument operations also need to collaborate to address the common and expanding need for substantial computation support. Furthermore, the High Energy Density program is also working closely with SLAC's LCLS directorate and the U.S. scientific community to advance the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) project, which will result in much improved optical and x-ray laser capabilities that will enable novel experiments to push the scientific frontier. Scientists at the MEC project will perform these activities in collaboration with LCLS and academic partners and users ahead of full-scale experiments at LCLS. SLAC currently lacks office spaces for scientists and staff to jointly explore challenges and develop solutions using large- scale data sets. Adjacent office spaces that enable researchers to benefit from collaboration with subject matter experts in computational science, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), exascale computing, data management, data acquisition, simulation, imaging, visualization, and modeling are also not currently available. To address these capability gaps, SLAC proposes to construct a new LSCC which will enable the lab to improve the ability to co-locate cross-functional teams that understand accelerator and instrument operations, provide synergies between all major SC-sponsored programs at SLAC, engage a broad spectrum of researchers in a common building to explore materials science, chemical science, cosmology, computational support, AI/ML, exascale applications, and quantum information science (QIS); engage in private partnerships; and provide a centralized office and collaboration space with the necessary performance capabilities to grow the photon science research program. LSCC is a modern, energy efficient, sustainable, and collaborative facility for data analytics which supports scientific research and development for energy savings, battery energy storage, charging infrastructure, electrical power grids, and artificial photo-catalysts to convert sunlight to fuel. LSCC will also use AI/ML in the building management system to provide energy savings in utility usage. LSCC is being analyzed to be SLAC's first campus net-zero and carbon-zero building. LSCC will also provide collaborative work, research, and meeting space for Energy@Stanford & SLAC conference, held annually at Stanford and SLAC. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets .

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Linear Assets Modernization Project (LAMP) is $23,425,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The preliminary TEC range for this project is $164,000,000 to $376,000,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $170,000,000 to $382,000,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $242,000,000. LAMP will upgrade high priority utility systems to increase the reliability, capability, resilience, and safety of LBNL's infrastructure to meet DOE's mission. The project will upgrade utility systems, including, but not limited to, domestic water, natural gas, storm drain, sanitary sewer, electrical, and communication. Significant Changes This project was initiated in the FY 2020 Enacted Appropriations. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B Critical Decision (CD) is CD-0, Approve Mission Need, which was approved on May 17, 2019.

Project Scope and Justification Scope LAMP will upgrade the highest priority utility systems to increase the reliability, capability, and safety of LBNL's infrastructure to meet the DOE's mission. The utility systems include, but are not limited to, domestic water, natural gas, storm drain, sanitary sewer, electrical, and communication. The project will first address higher priority/higher risk areas and will aim to resolve the most critical systems while focusing infrastructure investment considering operational risk and efficiencies, redundancy, utility bundling, and preparation for strategic growth including expanding the primary switching substation at Grizzly Peak to power the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to full capacity. LAMP will implement a multi-system-based, common geographical approach in the repair and improvement of LBNL's utility assets, considering potential synergies with nearby sustainment and improvement projects, particularly where utility reconfigurations may necessitate or otherwise provide opportunities for enhancement. Justification Established in 1931, LBNL is the oldest DOE national laboratory. SC utilizes the capabilities of LBNL to execute 23 of the 24 core capabilities and the mission of multiple SC program offices, including a strong presence of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Biological and Environmental Research, Basic Energy Sciences, and High Energy Physics, many of which support all dimensions of climate research initiatives. The mission need of this project is to support the SC mission and multiple scientific programs by increasing the reliability, capability, and safety of LBNL's utility infrastructure while significantly reducing deferred maintenance. Utility infrastructure represents almost half of LBNL's large, deferred maintenance backlog and represents a significant capability gap in LBNL's ability to provide reliable and safe services to meet DOE's mission needs. Direct investment is necessary to enable transformational infrastructure improvements to accelerate deferred maintenance reduction, restore operational reliability, increase resiliency, and enhance support for scientific advancements. Moreover, existing infrastructure is insufficient to support the future vision of planned facility modernization and growth. Without a modern utility infrastructure backbone, future growth of the science mission at LBNL may not be able to be fully accommodated. 570Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-78, Linear Assets Modernization Project, LBNL FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationAlthough LBNL has begun measures to strengthen the laboratory's resilience to unplanned outages due to natural hazards such as earthquake, wildfire, and extreme weather, the mission need of this project remains, which is to support the SC mission and multiple scientific programs by modernizing distributed utilities to increase reliability, resilience, and capacity to meet growing demands. The first sub-project of the LAMP project will enable an optimized NERSC -10 upgrade which will play a central role in breakthrough science in the climate arena. LAMP will deliver significantly more modern and resilient general-purpose infrastructure. The combination of data collection and artificial intelligent monitoring systems will enable the systems to adjust to trends, predict maintenance requirements, and react to extreme weather events, such as automatically transferring power to minimize impacts to mission critical scientific operations. Additionally, modern utility systems will be more efficient and sustainable. For example, the underground utility corridors will not only be upgraded to the best available technology but will be designed to be maintainable and monitored using artificial intelligence to enable predictive maintenance. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets.

Summary, Significant Changes, and Schedule and Cost HistorySummary The FY 2023 Request for the Critical Utilities Infrastructure Revitalization (CUIR) project is $25,425,000 of Total Estimated Cost (TEC) funding. The preliminary Total Estimated Cost (TEC) range for this project is $160,000,000 to $306,000,000. The preliminary Total Project Cost (TPC) range for this project is $164,500,000 to $310,500,000. Currently, these cost ranges encompass the most feasible preliminary alternatives. The preliminary TPC estimate for this project is $208,500,000. The primary objective of this project is to close utilities infrastructure gaps, such as utility piping breaks, power fluctuati ons, faults, and cooling water interruptions to support multi-program science missions at SLAC. Evolving technologies, instruments, experimental parameters, sensitivities, and complexity require increased reliability, resiliency, and service levels in electrical, mechanical, and civil systems site wide. The CUIR project will address the critical campus-wide utility a nd infrastructure issues by replacing, repairing, and modernizing the highest risk water/fire protection, sanitary sewer, storm drain, electrical, and cooling water system deficiencies. These needs have been identified through condition assessments, inspections, and recommendations from subject matter experts responsible for stewardship of the systems. Significant Changes This project was initiated in FY 2020 Enacted Appropriations. The most recent DOE Order 413.3B approved Critical Decision (CD) is CD-1, Approve Alternatives Selection and Cost Range, which was approved January 21, 2022. FY 2023 funds will support Project Engineering and Design (PED) activities, initiate long-lead procurement and early construction activities after the appropriate CD approvals. A Federal Project Director with the appropriate certification level (Level II: TPC greater than $50,000,000 and equal to or less than $100,000,000) has been assigned to this project.

Project Scope and Justification Scope CUIR's preliminary scope is to provide underground domestic water/fire protection, sanitary sewer, and storm drain systems site-wide. Additionally, it will provide updated major electrical gear, instrumentation, and cooling water systems for the two-mile long klystron gallery and accelerator housing constructed in 1962. Justification SLAC is currently implementing a Campus Strategy designed to support the DOE Science Mission, increase reliability, and minimize costs through safe, effective, resilient, and efficient operations. The objective of the CUIR project is to reduce ris ks and close the capability gaps identified in SLAC's infrastructure assessments and surveys as they relate to storm water, sanitary sewer, domestic water/fire protection, electrical, and cooling water systems. Disruptions caused by utility piping breaks, power fluctuations, faults, and cooling water interruptions have frequently impacted science research site wide. Electrical systems, pumps, and motors fail, valves on piping systems freeze, and there are inoperable or unsafe electrical components that require broad outages to respond and repair, which impact science research and the greater SLAC population. Workarounds and administrative controls placed on existing equipment and systems, which are underrated, not operating as intended, or not designed/operational for today's science needs, create tremendous inefficiencies and safety concerns, and sub-optimize operations. The proposed project will retire $18,000,000 in deferred maintenance. The timely delivery of this project is essential for the current and future success of SLAC's science programs. SC will evaluate alternatives during acquisition strategy development prior to CD-1. The CUIR project will also reduce operational risks in critical infrastructure and utility support systems for all science programs, decrease utilization of unique, old, and outdated equipment; and increase operational reliability, flexibility, and sustainability throughout site infrastructure. If these existing reliability gaps are not fulfilled, the operational efficiency , 580Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-79, Critical Utilities Infrastructure Revitalization, SLAC FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationreliability, productivity, and competitive viability in science programs and other related science research breakthroughs will continue to be impeded. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The UIP's preliminary scope includes upgrading the highest risk major utility systems across the FNAL campus. Specifically, this project will first evaluate the current condition of the industrial cooling water system, potable water distribution system, sanitary sewer and storm collection systems, natural gas distribution system, electrical distribution system, Kautz Road Substation, and the Central Utility Building. Selected portions of the systems will then be replaced to assure safe, reliable, and efficient service to mission critical facilities. In addition, the project will perform upgrades to obsolete, end -of- life components, which will increase capacity, reliability, and personnel safety for critical utilities. Justification DOE's Office of Science (SC) advances new experiments, international partnerships, and research programs to transform the understanding of nature and to advance U.S. energy, economic and national security interests. This mission requires the modernization of obsolete and severely deteriorated utilities infrastructure at FNAL. SC has identified a need to recapitalize FNAL's Central Utilities Building and distributed site utility infrastructure to ensure the stewardship of SC's investments and to provide modern, world-class facilities for scientific experiments and research. Although there has been substantial investment in recent years to modernize and construct new research facilities at FNAL, much of FNAL's utility infrastructure serving these facilities is over 50 years old. Efficient, maintainable, and reliable util ities are critical to the success and mission capability of FNAL's research facilities. Currently, a significant portion of FNAL's ut ility infrastructure is beyond useful life and suffering from failures, decreased reliability, lack of redundancy, and limitations in capacity. As such, there is an urgent need to revitalize and selectively upgrade FNAL's existing major utility systems to ensure reliable service, meet capacity requirements, and enable readiness of facilities critical to the research mission. The UIP will deliver a significantly more modern and resilient general-purpose infrastructure. The combination of data collection and artificial intelligent monitoring systems will be able to adjust to trends, predict failures, and react to extre me weather events, such as automatically transferring power to minimize impacts to mission critical scientific operations. Additionally, modern utility systems will be more efficient and sustainable. For example, inefficient boilers will be replaced and electrical metering equipment will be improved in order to identify future energy savings projects. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets . 590Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 20-SC-80, Utilities Infrastructure Project, FNAL Congressional Budget JustificationKey Performance Parameters (KPPs) The KPPs are preliminary and may change as the project continues towards CD-2.

Project Scope and Justification Scope The scope of the BioEPIC project is to construct a new, state-of-the-art facility between 55,000 and 90,000 gross square feet (gsf) with laboratory space to support high performance research by BER, ASCR, and BES programs. This facility will be constructed in close proximity to key LBNL facilities and programs. Research operations currently located in commercially leased space and dispersed across the campus will be collocated to the BioEPIC building. Collocation of researchers in this unique experimental facility, near other important Office of Science (SC) assets, will increase synergy and efficiency, which will better facilitate collaborative research in support of the SC mission. Justification The mission need of this project is to increase the synergy and efficiency of biosciences and other SC research at LBNL. LBNL has grown from a pioneering particle and nuclear physics laboratory into a multidisciplinary research facility with broad capabilities in physical, chemical, computational, biological, and environmental systems research in support of the DOE mission. Much of the biological sciences program at LBNL is located off-site, away from the main laboratory, while others are dispersed across several locations on the LBNL campus. This arrangement has produced research and operational capability gaps that limit scientific progress and is a significant roadblock to the kind of collaborative science that is requ ired for understanding, predicting, and harnessing the Earth's microbiome for energy and environmental benefits. This project will close the present capability gaps by providing a state-of-the-art facility that will collocate biosciences research and other programs. The BioEPIC building will bring together important SC programs and unique capabilities that are currently housed in leased space and buildings both on and off the LBNL campus that are not well-suited to BioEPIC programs. The current facilities are near 'end-of-life', are not energy efficient, and are prone to prolonged outages in the face of regular wildfire risks that trigger power shutdowns by the LBNL's local power authority. The experiments hosted within this resilient new facility will be able to run through power shutdown events because of the modern systems built into BioEPIC. The BioEPIC building is designed to directly address these issues through pursuit of LEED gold certification, optimization of natural lighting, and provision of adequate emergency power. BioEPIC will not use natural gas for space and water heating but rather will have 598Science/Science Laboratories Infrastructure/ 19-SC-74, BioEPIC, LBNL FY all-electric and plumbing systems. BioEPIC will bring together the LBNL's four BER 'science focus area' programs to focus on how soil-plant-microbe interactions impact growth of alternative energy feedstocks, agricultural productivity, water resources, and terrestrial carbon storage. Understanding and predicting responses to climate change is a central theme of all four programs. The project is being conducted in accordance with the project management requirements in DOE Order 413.3B, Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets. Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) The Threshold KPPs represent the minimum acceptable performance that the project must achieve. The Objective KPPs represent the desired project performance.

The M&O contractor evaluated various acquisition approaches and project delivery methods prior to achieving CD-1 and selected a tailored Design-Bid-Build approach with a Construction Manager as General Contractor as the overall best project delivery method with the lowest risk to DOE. The M&O contractor is also responsible for awarding and administering all subcontracts related to this project. The M&O contractor's annual performance evaluation and measurement plan includes project performance metrics on which it will be evaluated. ttt With the implementation of OMB's Reduce the Footprint initiative, DOE no longer maintains the space bank. Footprint is managed using the Facility Information Management System, with decisions on additions and offsets made in accordance with the DOE Real Property Efficiency Plan. 603Science/Safeguards and Security FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSafeguards and Security Overview The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science (SC) Safeguards and Security (S&S) program is designed to ensure appropriate security measures are in place to support the SC mission requirements of open scientific research and to protect critical assets within SC laboratories. Accomplishing this mission depends on providing physical and cyber controls that will mitigate possible risks to the laboratories' employees, nuclear and special materials, classified and sensitive information, hazardous materials, mission essential functions (e.g., DOE Isotope Program), and facilities. The SC S&S program also provides funding for cybersecurity for the laboratories' information technology systems to protect computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access. Highlights of the FY 2023 Request The FY 2023 Request for S&S is $189.5 million. The FY 2023 Request supports sustained levels of operations in S&S program elements including Protective Forces, Security Systems, Information Security, Cybersecurity, Personnel Security, Material Control and Accountability, and Program Management. The FY 2023 Request also includes $81.26 million in Cybersecurity to address long standing gaps in infrastructure, operations, and compliance to ensure adequate detection, mitigation, and recovery from cyber intrusions and attacks against DOE laboratories. Funding in this Request supports the implementation of Executive Order 14028 requirements for Maximum MFA, Maximum Encryption, Cloud Strategy/Security, Improved Logging and Supply Chain Management, and Zero Trust Infrastructure. The FY 2023 Request supports the S&S program's highest priority, which is to provide adequate security for the Category I quantity of special nuclear material housed in Building 3019 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The FY 2023 Request ensures the implementation of key and mandatory National and Departmental security policies. Funding supports the first stages of implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12); thereby providing the standardized Federal credential for not only cleared contractor employees and sub-contractors, but also for long-term uncleared employees and contractors. SC has approximately 50,000 long-term uncleared contractor personnel that require the credential and the associated Tier 1 background investigation. In future requests SC will need to consider the annual influx of new long-term uncleared contractor personnel that require the credentials and the associated Tier 1 background investigations. The funding includes the HSPD-12 associated modernization of physical access control systems at site entry points, buildings, and select internal facility locations. These systems mitigate threats to a range of national security interests, to include protection of employees (e.g., active shooter), high-consequence hazardous materials, classified matter, and intellectual property as outlined in the Department's Design Basis Threat policy. The FY 2023 Request provides the resources to implement the administration's policies associated with foreign national collaborations that assure the protection of U.S. science and technology. These new security mandates include the review of curriculum vitae to determine what intellectual capital to permit access to and rigorous validation of immigration documentation. Description The S&S program is organized into seven program elements: 1. Protective Forces2. Security Systems3. Information Security4. Cybersecurity5. Personnel Security6. Material Control and Accountability7. Program Management 605Science/Safeguards and Security FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationProtective Forces The Protective Forces program element supports security officers that control access and protect S&S interests, along with their related equipment and training. Activities within this program element include access control and security response operations as well as physical protection of the Department's critical assets and SC facilities. The Protective Forces mission includes providing effective response to emergency situations, random prohibited article inspections, security alarm monitoring, and performance testing of the protective force response to various event scenarios. Security Systems The Security Systems program element provides the backbone of the physical protection of Departmental personnel, material, equipment, property, and facilities through the deployment of HSPD-12 and local credentials, entry control points, fences, barriers, lighting, sensors, surveillance devices, access control systems, and power systems operated and used to support the protection of people, DOE property, classified information, and other interests of national security. Information Security The Information Security program element provides support to ensure that sensitive and classified information is accurately, appropriately, and consistently identified, reviewed, marked, protected, transmitted, stored, and ultimately destroyed. Specific activities within this element include management, planning, training, and oversight for maintaining security containers and combinations, marking documents, and administration of control systems, operations security, special access programs, technical surveillance countermeasures, and classification and declassification determinations. Cybersecurity The Cybersecurity program develops and maintains a comprehensive cybersecurity program for ten national laboratories and five dedicated offices. There are numerous adversaries with the goals of disrupting vital DOE Office of Science missions and stealing critical research intellectual property. The cyber goals for the Cybersecurity program are to empower mission and science, align cyber funding to opportunities for risk reduction, strengthen Cybersecurity security posture by embracing new security designs, and offer unified guidance and cybersecurity procedures. The Cybersecurity program responds to cyber incidents by supporting the activities needed to for incident management, prosecution, and investigation of cyber intrusions. The program supports both disaster recovery and incident recovery, as well as notifications within the cybersecurity community. Based on DOE directives, the DOE cybersecurity program management, site cybersecurity initiatives, and cybersecurity infrastructure management comprise the final component of the cybersecurity program. Personnel Security The Personnel Security program element encompasses the processes for employee suitability and security clearance determinations at each site to ensure that individuals are trustworthy and eligible for access to classified information or matter. This element also includes the management of security clearance programs, adjudications, security education, awareness programs for Federal and contractor employees, and processing and hosting approved foreign visitors. Material Control and Accountability (MC&A) The MC&A program element provides assurance that Departmental materials are properly controlled and accounted for at all times. This element supports administration, including testing performance and assessing the levels of protection, control, and accountability required for the types and quantities of materials at each facility; documenting facility plans for materials control and accountability; assigning authorities and responsibilities for MC&A functions; and establishing programs to detect and report occurrences such as material theft, the loss of control or inability to account for materials, or evidence of malevolent acts. Program Management The Program Management program element coordinates the management of Protective Forces, Security Systems, Information Security, Personnel Security, and MC&A to achieve and ensure appropriate levels of protections are in place through the conduct of security and/or vulnerability assessments, local threat assessments, and performance assurance activities. 606Science/Safeguards and Security FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSafeguards and Security Funding (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 EnactedFY Annualized CRFY 2023 RequestFY 2023 Request 2021 Enacted Safeguards and Security Protective Forces and Security FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationSafeguards and Security Explanation of Major Changes (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Enacted FY 2023 RequestExplanation of Changes FY 2023 FY 2021 Enacted $189,510 +$68,510 Protective Forces $44,200 $50,000 +$5,800 Funding maintains support for security officers and their required equipment and training necessary to maintain proper protection levels at all SC laboratories.The Request will maintain support for security officers and their required equipment and training necessary to maintain proper protection levels at all SC laboratories.Funding increases will support sustained levels of operations at increased overhead, inflation, and contractually obligated Cost of Living Adjustments for Protective Forces.

DOE's enabling authorization and subsequent legislation require DOE to provide publicly available collections of unclassified R&D results through the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI). The DOE Public Access Plan, required by a 2013 Office of Science and Technology Policy memorandum, added peer-reviewed, final accepted manuscripts to the types of unclassified scientific and technical information already made publicly accessible as required by longstanding statutes. For digital data resulting from sponsored research (as defined by OMB Circular A-110), the Plan requires the submission of data management plans with funding proposals to DOE and provides guidelines for preserving and ensuring access to digital research data as appropriate. Implementation of the Plan has been carried out through DOE internal agency policy directive, with requirements specified in national labs' management & operating contracts and annual performance plans, and in the terms and conditions of DOE financial assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements). Under the DOE policy, DOE-funded researchers are required to submit metadata and final accepted manuscripts to DOE or to their institutional repositories, and DOE makes these research papers freely accessible to the public within 12 months of publication through the portal DOE PAGES (Public Access Gateway for Energy and Science), developed and hosted by OSTI. Since implementation of the DOE policy, DOE is among the top agencies in implementing public access, with DOE PAGES providing free access to over 130,000 scholarly publications resulting from DOE research funding. More recently, the concept of \"public access\" has broadened to \"open science,\" where DOE has taken a leadership role in the federal government in assigning persistent identifiers to related research objects, such as the datasets and software underlying findings described in publications. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are an essential element in promoting research integrity, reproducibility, and discoverability, and DOE provides an \"identifier service\" to its national labs and, through interagency agreements, to several federal agencies. www Responds to the reporting requirement specified by the FY 2022 House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee Repo rt 117-98 to provide an update on the https://www.energy.gov/downloads/doe-public-access-plan; Facilities Maintenance and Repair The Department's Facilities Maintenance and Repair activities are tied to its programmatic missions, goals, and objectives. The Facilities Maintenance and Repair activities funded by the budget and displayed below and are intended to ensure that the scientific community has the facilities required to conduct cutting edge scientific research now and in the future to meet Department of Energy (DOE) goals and objectives.

Together, the Office of Science (SC) laboratories have over 1,400 operational buildings and real property trailers, with nearly 20 million gross square feet of space. Generally, facilities maintenance and repair expenses are funded through an indirect overhead charge. In some cases, however, a laboratory may charge maintenance directly to a specific program. One example would be when maintenance is performed in a building used only by a single program. Such direct-funded charges are not directly budgeted. Indirect-Funded Maintenance and Repair (including Deferred Maintenance Reduction) Facilities maintenance and repair activities funded indirectly through overhead charges at SC laboratories are displayed in the table above. Since this funding is allocated to all work done at each laboratory, the cost of these activities is charged t o funding from SC and other DOE organizations, as well as other Federal agencies and other entities doing work at SC laboratories. Maintenance reported to SC for non-SC laboratories is also shown. The figures are total projected costs across all SC laboratories. 623Science/SC Crosscuts FY 2023 Congressional Budget JustificationScience Costs for Indirect-Funded Maintenance and Repair (including Deferred Maintenance Reduction) (dollars in thousands) FY 2021 Planned CostFY 2021 Actual CostFY 2022 Planned CostFY 2023 Planned Cost Ames Laboratory 2,400 2,800 2,400 2,700 Argonne National Laboratory 46,768 Laboratory 29,749 39,833 31,051 27,886 Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education 480 511 656 901 Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Y-12 73,830 Report on FY 2021 Expenditures for Maintenance and Repair This report responds to the requirements established in Conference Report (H.Rep. 108-10) accompanying Public Law 108-7 (pages 886-887), which requires the DOE to provide an annual year-end report on maintenance expenditures to the Committees on Appropriations.
