Microglia play a critical role in brain injury and recovery after ischemic stroke. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) are based on a unique therapeutic principle, have various formulas, and have long been widely used to treat stroke. Therefore, the active compounds in TCHMs and their underlying mechanisms of action are attracting increasing attention in the field of stroke drug development. Purpose: To summarize the regulatory mechanisms of TCHM-derived natural compounds on the microglial response in animal models of ischemic stroke. Methods: We searched studies published until 10 April 2023 in the Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect using the following keywords: natural compounds, natural products or phytochemicals, traditional Chinese Medicine or Chinese herbal medicine, microglia, and ischemic stroke. This review was prepared according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Results: Natural compounds derived from TCHMs can attenuate the M1 phenotype of microglia, which is involved in the detrimental inflammatory response, via of neuroprotective response of microglia with the M2 phenotype can showed that TCHM-derived natural compounds that regulate microglial responses have significant and safe therapeutic effects, but further well-designed clinical studies are needed. Conclusions: Further research regarding the direct targets and potential pleiotropic or synergistic effects of natural compounds would provide a more reasonable approach for regulation of the microglial response with the possibility of successful stroke drug development.
