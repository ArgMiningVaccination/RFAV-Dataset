In the interest of a calmer, but still more productive future, we curated this list of the 5 best energy supplements of 2023 with a focus on balanced, safe energy supplements that facilitate your body's natural energy production instead of simply overclocking your motor with copious amounts of caffeine and sugar. If you're looking for a clean, effective energy drink that gives you a sustained boost without the crash\u2014 [Hi-Health Metabolic Fusion](https://hihealth.com/products/hi-health-metabolic-fusion-60-capsules?utm_source=TNI&utm_medium=best-energy-supplements&utm_campaign=hihealthmetabolicfusion-introtext) takes our top spot in this regard\u2014here are the best energy supplements on the market today. |Best Overall||Energy + Multivitamin||Pre-Workout| |Product||Hi-Health||Solaray||Zhou| - Pros - plant extracts, ketones, adaptogens, and more - Vegan-friendly supplement - Cons - On the pricier side - 2-capsule serving size Best for: Busy/working folks who want a safe, crash-free energy supplement that comes with weight-loss benefits. [Hi-Health Metabolic Fusion](https://hihealth.com/products/hi-health-metabolic-fusion-60-capsules?utm_source=TNI&utm_medium=best-energy-supplements&utm_campaign=hihealthmetabolicfusion-text) sponsors a multi-fronted war on fatigue that savvily takes advantage of more than one of the body's energy-producing mechanisms using the following ingredients: - Green Tea Extract - Green Coffee Bean Extract - Raspberry Ketone - Olive Leaf Extract - Caffeine Anhydrous Powder - Bacopa Extract - Garcinia Extract - CLA Oil Powder - L-Theanine - Forskolin Root Extract - BioPerine Black Pepper Extract The green tea and coffee bean extracts provide a strong shot of antioxidants, which help protect the brain against damage while improving cognition. The calming amino acid L-theanine helps to take the jittery edge off of the generous, but measured helping of caffeine (150mg) infused into each serving. The active ingredient in olive leaf extract (oleuropein), the bacopa extract, and the garcinia combine forces to naturally spin up your metabolism, promote weight loss, and even lower LDL (bad/low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Finally, the BioPerine black pepper extract provides a potent brain-boosting effect, and is often used to enhance the absorption of other nutrients.

Too often, attempts to bridge the gap from multivitamin to energy supplement amount to a half-hearted sprinkling of extra B vitamins, but [Solaray Multi Energy](https://hihealth.com/products/solaray-twice-daily-multi-energy-multivitamin-iron-free-60-capsules?utm_source=TNI&utm_medium=best-energy-supplements&utm_campaign=solaraymultienergy-text) is our model for merging these two (multivitamin and energy supplement) the right way. Of course, Solaray Multi Energy provides 8 B vitamins, but it also includes the following key micronutrients, to name a few: - Vitamins A/C/D/E - Calcium - Iodine - Magnesium - Zinc - Selenium - Copper - Manganese - Chromium Collectively, these nutrients cover all the major functional targets we want to see addressed by a multivitamin, including immune system health, vision, heart health, and more. The lack of caffeine, while a con for those looking for that extra edge, makes sense for a twice-daily multivitamin, and the B vitamins at least partially make up for it. You might miss the caffeine if you're looking for a more intense burst of energy to get you through a workout, long workday, etc., but the other side of the trade-off is the advantage of a well-rounded multivitamin that still provides sustained, focused energy. This makes Solaray Multi Energy one of the best energy supplements for chronic fatigue syndrome and other long-term use cases. Overall, [Solaray Multi Energy](https://hihealth.com/products/solaray-twice-daily-multi-energy-multivitamin-iron-free-60-capsules) is the best multivitamin + energy supplement we've seen to date, compromising very little on either front.

Each person's thyroid situation varies, and should be discussed with a physician, but in many cases, the hypothyroid crowd needs a way to supplement the key constituents of the thyroid hormone that they are deficient in\u2014 [iodine and tyrosine.](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/condition/hypothyroidism) While there are many iodine and tyrosine supplements out there, [NOW Thyroid Energy](https://hihealth.com/collections/all/products/now-thyroid-energy?utm_source=TNI&utm_medium=best-energy-supplements&utm_campaign=nowthyroidenergy-text) is one of the few that also includes three cofactors (selenium, zinc, and copper) of enzymes that release thyroid hormones throughout the body.

Along with most other B vitamins, [B-12](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-b12/#:~:text=Vitamin%20B12%2C%20or%20cobalamin%2C%20is,in%20the%20foods%20we%20eat.) is considered to be the best energy-boosting vitamin for its roles in cellular metabolism and red blood cell production. How can I boost my energy? You can use the ingredients in the above energy supplements as a model for the several ways to boost your energy, which include nootropics and adaptogens, stimulants, micronutrients like B vitamins, cellular energy enhancers like CoQ10, and more. Of course, a balanced diet, sleep, and exercise are crucial to keeping a healthy energy level. What deficiency causes low energy? Because fatigue can result from so many different problems and mechanisms within the body, this is a very broad answer. Some of the most common nutritional deficiencies that cause fatigue include vitamin D, B12, and iron deficiency. Hypothyroidism is also a common cause. This [Harvard Health article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/could-a-vitamin-or-mineral-deficiency-be-behind-your-fatigue) goes into more depth about the link between micronutrient deficiency and fatigue. Why do I have so little energy? Nutritional deficiencies, genetic factors, environmental factors (stress, etc.), mental health disorders (especially depression), and other factors can all cause fatigue in isolated or overlapping ways. It's a helpful practice to identify the suspected causes of your fatigue and address them one by one if it is safe and appropriate to do so given the context; changing your routine too drastically may obfuscate both the cause of the fatigue and the identity of the solution. How can I increase my energy naturally? It's not just what you eat, but how you eat\u2014and more. Consuming more whole-food-sourced vitamin B12 (chicken, fish, dairy, eggs, etc.) is a start, but it's also important to avoid having large amounts of starchy foods in one sitting. As always, optimizing your sleep (8 hours!) and exercise (at least 20-30 minutes a day) should help naturally increase your energy as well. Finally, there are plenty of [natural energy supplements](http://hihealth.com/products/hi-health-metabolic-fusion-60-capsules?utm_source=TNI&utm_medium=best-energy-supplements&utm_campaign=hihealthmetabolicfusion-faq) you can take advantage of, such as several of those listed above. Key Takeaways Increased energy can be achieved through several mechanisms, including increasing oxygen to the brain, optimizing chemical messengers in the brain to enhance alertness, fueling the mitochondria to generate energy on a cellular level, stimulation, and more. Plant-based nootropics are instrumental in promoting the above functions; understanding how to identify them in an ingredient list (and differentiate them from cheap stimulants) will help you discern between high-quality and low-quality energy supplements. It's important not to develop an unhealthy dependence on even high-quality energy supplements, as the core of your B12 (and other nutrient) intake should still come from whole food sources. Over-dependence on energy supplements can also foster bad habits, like staying up too late. As always, make sure your energy supplement has a reasonable amount of caffeine (if any), little to no sugar, and high-quality ingredients that promote sustained energy through multiple mechanisms. "}
