Consumers 18 years of age or older with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment can now buy hearing aids directly from stores or online retailers without the need for a medical exam, prescription, or a fitting adjustment by an audiologist. The rule applies to certain air-conduction hearing aids that meet specific performance specifications and device-design requirements. It also: (a) amends existing rules that apply to prescription hearing aids to ensure consistency with the new OTC category, (b) repeals the conditions for sale for hearing aids, and (c) includes provisions that address some of the effects of the FDA OTC hearing-aid regulations on state regulation of hearing aids.

Current law prevents the Food and Drug Administration from regulating a wide range of supplements, and even where they do have authority, regulators have been lax in enforcing the rules.

Joe Schwarcz, PhD, Director of McGill University's Office for Science and Society, has looked closely at \"SightCare,\" a supposedly revolutionary stem-cell-enhancing dietary supplement composed of vitamins, minerals, herbal extracts, and other chemicals. David Lewis, a product spokesperson, claims in a lengthy video it can cure all vision problems and is \"divinely elegant, that it has nothing to do with embryos or unborn babies, and is 100% Christian approved.\" The video offers SightCare for the \"special price of $69 a bottle.\" It warns that later availability could not be guaranteed, since the eye care industry is expected to protect its profits by campaigning to prevent SightCare sales. Dr. Schwarcz concluded: Leaving all the hype aside, the fundamental question here is whether the claim that this specific composition of ingredients can cure all visual problems is backed by randomized, double-blind studies. There is a simple answer. No! The evidence we are furnished is an anecdote from. . . David Lewis that his failing eyesight was restored and that members of his church have also been happy with the product. I cannot say that SightCare cannot have some effect on sight, but I will go out on a limb and assert that it cannot eliminate glasses or cure eye diseases. Indeed, I think such unsubstantiated promises are criminal and make me see red, another problem that cannot be solved with SightCare. [Schwarcz J.

A recent article spotlights Longevity House, a private club in Toronto with a $100,000 lifetime membership fee. The club claims to provide members the possibility of living to 120 years free from chronic illness and mental decline. Activities at a gathering of members last fall included sipping \"brain-boosting\" beverages linked with lion's mane mushrooms garnished with grapefruit, breathwork, and soaking up electronic pulses of a $20,000 \"BioCharger\" device. That's the same device that Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans claimed could cure COVID-19. (Evans subsequently received a $25,000 fine for doing so from the Therapeutic Good Administration, the regulatory body in Australia.) The club also offers high-performance exercise equipment, \"a Katalyst (an electronic muscle-stimulation garment that looks like a wetsuit and promises 'the world's most efficient workout'),\" a red-light therapy room, a full-body vibration plate, a tub, a custom-built sauna, [naturopaths, breathwork specialists](https://quackwatch.org/naturopathy/general/beyerstein/), a [chakra](https://skepdic.com/chakras.html) guy, a therapist who specializes in psychedelics, and \"functional-medicine doctors who read blood and stool samples like physiological tea leaves.\" Longevity House was launched by Michael Nguyen, who got his start as a tailor to the stars.

Exercise physiologist Nick Tiller, MRes, PhD, has examined the jargon-filled promotional claims and scientific evidence regarding kinesiology tape, also known as Kinesio Tape, KT Tape, or K-Tape, commonly used by athletes to stabilize injured joints. He concluded: When the omnipresence of K-tape in health and fitness is contrasted against the evidence for its benefit, the disparity is among the largest I have seen for any intervention, second only to chiropractic and homeopathy. Exactly how long this practice will endure, despite the damning evidence, remains to be seen, although if other pseudoscientific practices serve as an indication, K-Tape may be with us indefinitely. Notwithstanding, there is likely to be a potent placebo effect that some proponents will use to justify its continued use in the clinic. In fact, around 40 percent of athletic trainers and physiotherapists are already cognizant that K-tape works only via placebo. They use it anyway.

Jarry notes that studies into N.E.T.'s effectiveness almost always either lack a control group or use a poor control group. Thus, any non-specific effect of the technique, such as talking to a therapist, can make it appear to work. Nevertheless, Walker states toward the end of Stressed: \"We haven't found anything that [N.E.T.] hasn't improved.

The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. - The USPSTF concludes the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

Historical Perspective Various forms of spinal manipulation ... Chiropractic is a wide array of practices with emphasis on spinal \"adjustments.\" Chiropractic theory claims that (a) spinal misalignments, which chiropractors refer to as subluxations, impair health by interfering with the integrity of the nervous system and (b) spinal adjustments restore the integrity of the nervous system, enable the body's inherent recuperative power to restore health, and thereby prevent or remedy a wide range of health problems. Chiropractors may help people with certain musculoskeletal ailments, but the problems described in this chapter are widespread and, in some cases, integral to chiropractic philosophy and practice. Thus, even though some of the source materials and opinions cited in this essay originated long ago, they remain relevant to the current marketplace. Historical Perspective Various forms of spinal manipulation have been noted throughout recorded history [1]. The \"discovery\" of chiropractic was announced in 1895 by Daniel David (\"D.D.\") Palmer, a grocer, spiritualist, and \"magnetic healer\" who practiced in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer believed that he had restored the hearing of a deaf janitor by \"adjusting\" a hump on his spine. Even though the nerve that controls hearing is inside the skull and does not traverse the spine, Palmer concluded that the basic cause of disease was nerve interference caused by displaced vertebrae [2]. He originally declared that such misalignments cause abnormal tension (\"tone\") in the nearby nerves and that disturbed nerve tone causes 95% of all diseases. Later he elaborated a vitalistic doctrine which held that (a) \"Innate Intelligence,\" or \"nerve energy,\" flows throughout the nervous system and controls every bodily activity not under voluntary control; (b) even slight spinal misalignments hinder this flow, causing people to become ill; and (c) manual manipulation (\"adjustment\") of the spine is the remedy. He rejected the germ theory and had an aversion to drugs, surgery, and medical diagnosis. Palmer referred to spinal \"misalignments\" as \"luxations.\" A few years later a disciple began calling them \"subluxations,\" a term that became central to chiropractic theory and is still used today. The word \"chiropractic\" was derived from the Greek words cheir (hand) and praktikos (practice). Soon after his \"discovery,\" Palmer opened a school to teach his methods to others. The basic entrance requirement, as it was in many medical schools around the turn of the century, was the ability to pay tuition [3]. One of the first students was Palmer's son, Bartlett Joshua (\"B.J.\"), who became chiropractic's developer. In 1906 D.D. Palmer was convicted of practicing medicine without a license and spent 23 days in jail. After his release, B.J. denied him access to the school grounds and wound up purchasing D.D.'s interest in the Palmer School of Chiropractic. At that time about 100 chiropractors were practicing in the United States. Today there are about 65,000. Between 1913 and 1933, 40 states passed laws to license chiropractors; the remaining states gradually followed suit, with Louisiana being the last in 1974. Chiropractors have lobbied successfully in most states for laws that force insurance companies to pay for some of their services. In 1972 Congress legislated coverage under Medicare for \"treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation demonstrated by x-rays to exist.\" The International Chiropractors Association states that passage of this bill was spurred by more than 10 million letters received by members of Congress [4]. The x-ray requirement was eliminated in 2000. U.S. Census Bureau data indicate that the total reported income for chiropractic offices and clinics rose from $6.57 billion in 1997 to $11.4 billion in 2012. However, other data show that when inflation and other factors are taken into account, the average net income of chiropractors has dropped steadily [5]. Chiropractic Philosophy Chiropractic's uniqueness is not in its use of manipulation but in its theoretical basis for doing so. Jarvis describes chiropractic as \"a conglomeration of factions in conflict, bound together only by opposition to outside critics.\" [6] During the 1960s, Joseph A. Sabatier, M.D., who served for several years as chairman of the American Medical Association's Committee on Quackery, observed that, \"Chiropractic is the greatest tribute to the efficacy of technically applied public relations the world has ever known. These people have been delivering a package since 1895, the sale of which depends entirely on the wrapping. The contents are not there.\" [7] Philosophy and treatment methods vary greatly from one chiropractor to another, but there are two main types: \"straights\" and \"mixers.\" Straights tend to regard \"subluxations\" as the primary cause of ill health and spinal \"adjustments\" as the remedy. Some routinely manipulate the neck for complaints in all parts of the body. Many straights disparage medical diagnosis, some even claiming that their sole responsibility is to examine and adjust the spine. Mixers, who are more numerous, acknowledge that germs, hormones, and other factors play a role in disease; however, they tend to regard mechanical disturbances of the nervous system as the underlying cause (through lowered resistance). In addition to spinal manipulation, they may use measures that are standard in physical therapy as well as a wide spectrum of questionable nonmedical approaches. Mixers are more likely to diagnose medical conditions in addition to spinal abnormalities and to refer patients to medical practitioners for treatment. Both straights and mixers may claim that the nervous system is the master of all body functions, regulating everything from major organs to intricate cellular activities. This statement is untrue. However, charts and other materials relating the spine to the full range of illnesses can still be found in many chiropractic offices and online. Thus, even though nearly all chiropractors manipulate the spine as their primary treatment method, their rationales and techniques vary considerably. The spinal chart is from a chiropractic brochure. Many chiropractors use such charts to reinforce the idea that spinal problems are a major cause of disease. This one claims that \"spinal misalignments\" can cause more than 100 health problems, including allergies, amnesia, crossed eyes, deafness, gallbladder conditions, hernias, jaundice, and pneumonia. Other charts showing how nerves connect from the spine to the body's organs are used to persuade patients that regular spinal care is essential for good health. The message below is part of a chiropractic newspaper ad from the 1970s that illustrates chiropractic's tendency to overclaim. Many chiropractors detect \"subluxations\" in healthy individuals. A small percentage of chiropractors reject the subluxation concept and limit their practice to short-term treatment of musculoskeletal conditions using evidence-based procedures similar to those of physical therapists and osteopaths. Chiropractors also differ greatly about how treatment should be done. More than 200 \"technique systems\" have been advocated. In 1996, Thomas F. Bergmann, D.C., who edited the journal Chiropractic Technique, stated: A challenge for the future is to classify and place all chiropractic techniques into a framework that allows determination as to whether any of them has a basis in fact. . . . Studies designed to compare effectiveness have not been done. . . . No technique system has been demonstrated to be more or less effective than any other for any condition [8]. In 2011, Bergmann acknowledged that chiropractic research had not yet solved any these problems [9]. The two largest chiropractic organizations are the American Chiropractic Association (ACA, mixers) and the International Chiropractors Association (ICA, straights). Judging from their income tax returns and dues structures, the ACA appears to have about 8,000 members (not including students) and the ICA has about 2,500. The two groups have considered merging, but they are unable to agree on the definition and scope of chiropractic. The World Chiropractic Alliance, which has about 900 members, states that its mission is \"promoting a subluxation-free world.\" A small network of faculty members at some of the chiropractic colleges is attempting to place chiropractic on a scientific basis by determining which practices are valid and which are not. In 1995, Magner noted that negative research findings appeared to have little effect on what most chiropractors do [10]. That is still true today. The Elusive \"Subluxation\" Medical doctors and chiropractors use the word \"subluxation\" differently. The medical meaning is incomplete or partial dislocation\u00e2\u20ac\"a condition, visible on x-ray films, in which the bony surfaces of a joint no longer face each other exactly but remain partially aligned. Most partial dislocations occur in areas other than the spine and are the result of injury. Spondylolisthesis, a partial dislocation of a spinal bone, usually is congenital and causes no symptoms. Because the ligaments connecting the spinal bones are quite strong, vertebral dislocations rarely occur after birth and are unlikely without severe injury that would require surgical treatment, not chiropractic treatment. Chiropractors disagree on how their \"subluxations\" should be defined. Some describe them as \"bones out of place\" and/or \"pinched nerves,\" some speak of \"fixations\" and/or loss of joint mobility, some occupy a middle ground that includes any or all of these ideas, and a few renounce chiropractic's subluxation concepts completely. Chiropractors also disagree on whether their \"subluxations\" are visible on x-ray films. Those who claim that \"nerve interference\" results in too much or not enough \"nerve energy\" have never specified how this could be measured by scientific instruments. This children's storybook pictured to the right has been used to promote the notion that correcting subluxations promotes general health. After a chiropractor tells a little girl that she had a subluxation, she searches in vain under her bed and in her toybox to find it. She finally learns its location when the chiropractor says it was a bone in her neck that was \"not lined up with the other ones.\" The chiropractor explains: \"Subluxations make your body sick. Each time I push on your back, the bones are adjusted closer to their normal position. This opens up the pathways, so that your brain may talk properly with your body. As your subluxations are corrected, you become healthier.\" The booklet was marketed by a practice-building firm that promoted \"chiropractic pediatrics.\" The poster to the right has been used in chiropractic offices for more than 25 years to suggest that chiropractic care is necessary. A distributor calls it \"the most powerful single visual aid available.\" Chiropractors also differ among themselves about whether specific patients have subluxations and what to do about them. Several investigations in which many chiropractors have examined the same patient have found that the diagnoses and proposed treatments differed greatly from one practitioner to another [11]. - In 1989 Dr. William M. London visited 23 chiropractors in Ohio and Florida who had advertised free consultations or examinations. Each one espoused subluxation theory either during the consultation or in waiting room literature, and all but two recommended periodic preventive maintenance. Seventeen performed examinations. Of these, three identified subluxations (at differing locations), three said his left leg was shorter than his right leg, and two said his right leg was shorter than his left. Seven recommended treatment, and one treated him with a motorized roller device before examining him. - In 1994 ABC's \"20/20\" reported on visits to 17 chiropractors who had made it known through advertising or other means that they treated children. In one segment, an infant named Blake was taken by his mother to 9 chiropractors in the New York metropolitan area, accompanied by a \"friend\" who was carrying a hidden camera. Blake had experienced recurring ear infections, a problem that a pediatrician said could be managed with antibiotics and would eventually be outgrown. Every chiropractor found a problem, and all said they could help and recommended care ranging from several weeks to a lifetime. The first found \"a misalignment between the second and third bones in his neck.\" The second said it was \"on the right side of his neck between the first and second bones.\" The third, using muscle-testing, found \"weakness in the adrenal glands.\" The fourth said there was a subluxation because one of Blake's legs was shorter than the other. The fifth claimed he could diagnose the boy's problem by pulling on his mother's arm while she touched the boy on the shoulder. The sixth chiropractor did a similar test by pulling on the mother's legs while Blake lay on top of her back. After diagnosing \"jamming of the occiput (the back bone of the skull),\" the chiropractor said he corrected it by \"lifting\" Blake's occiput with his thumbs. He also said (a) Blake needed work on his immune system, (b) a learning disorder might be a problem, (c) both mother and son had \"eyes that don't team too well,\" and (d) the cameraman, whom the chiropractor incorrectly assumed was the boy's father, had the same eye problem. - The same program also reported on visits to eight Wisconsin chiropractors by a 5-year-old boy with chronic ear infections so severe that medical doctors wanted to insert tubes in his ears to drain them. All eight chiropractors found problems, but not usually the same ones. One diagnosed a pinched nerve in the boy's neck. Another said his left leg was shorter than his right. Another said his right leg was shorter than his left. Another diagnosed zinc deficiency. Another chiropractor blamed the boy's ear problems on \"food sensitivities\" and advised avoiding corn, cow's milk, and white flour. Another gave similar dietary advice but said that the main diagnosis was a \"subluxation\" in the top vertebra. Another said the boy didn't have an ear problem but had scoliosis\u00e2\u20ac\"a diagnosis disputed by a pediatrician and a radiologist who reviewed this chiropractor's findings. - In 2001, a healthy 11-year-old girl was taken by her uncle (a reporter) to five chiropractors in Toronto, Canada, for a checkup. The chiropractors were told the child was generally in good health but suffered from a few earaches, some mild headaches, and a few signs of allergy symptoms. The chiropractors were also told that the girl's mother was worried about the possibility of asthma and had heard from neighbors that chiropractic care could be beneficial for children. Four of the chiropractors found different subluxations and said that the girl needed chiropractic adjustments to get healthy. The methods they used to locate the alleged subluxations included spinal palpation, thermographic scans (looking for heat differences), and surface electromyography (SEMG), which merely measures muscle electrical activity. Among other things, the chiropractors said the child had one shoulder lower than the other, one leg longer than the other, one hip higher than the other, one ear lower than the other, something called \"anterior head carriage,\" scoliosis, early osteoarthritis, and numerous subluxations, all of which could cause earaches, headaches, allergies, asthma, arthritis, learning problems, and more serious problems later in life, including digestive and reproductive problems. - In 2004 a team of high school students contacted chiropractic offices in metropolitan Portland, Oregon, and found evidence of unscientific practice in every one. Following a script, they posed as a prospective patient and telephoned 42 local offices. All questions were answered by a member of the chiropractor's office staff, who sometimes consulted with the chiropractor. The students reported that all routinely or usually took x-rays during the first visit, 40 said they treated \"subluxations,\" 41 recommended \"maintenance\" adjustments, 38 offered craniosacral therapy, 37 recommended treatment for newborn infants, 29 treated newborns, and at least 28 did not recommend routine vaccination for children. Some physical therapists, athletic trainers, osteopathic physicians, and medical doctors use manipulative techniques. However, their intent is never to correct subluxations; it is to relieve pain and secondary muscle spasm by restoring the mobility of joints that have a mechanical malfunction. The notion that nerve interference is a major cause of disease clashes with established anatomic facts. During the early 1970s, Dr. Edmund Crelin, a prominent anatomist at Yale University, subjected subluxation theory to an actual test [12]. After collecting the spines of six people who had died a few hours earlier, he twisted them with instruments and observed the spaces between the vertebrae through which the spinal nerves passed. No nerve compression occurred, regardless of the force applied. In a later memorandum he commented further: Only 24 of the 43 pairs of nerves that pass from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body could ever be impinged upon in the [vertebral openings] by the excessive displacement of vertebrae. Why these 24 pairs should be causing disease, exclusive of all the others, defies a rational explanation. . . . Complete severance of spinal nerves to the heart, glands (salivary, thyroid, liver, pancreas, etc.) and smooth muscles of the lungs, stomach, intestines, etc., has only transient effects. The gland cells and smooth and cardiac muscles not only survive, but function normally. They surely do not become diseased [13]. Despite the unscientific nature of the subluxation concept, surveys have found that large percentages of chiropractors still cling to it. - In 2002, a cross-sectional survey of North American chiropractors conducted in 2002 found that (a) 88.1% thought that the term vertebral subluxation should be retained, (b) 89.8% thought that spinal adjustment should not be limited to treating musculoskeletal conditions, and (c) 62.1% rated the subluxation as a significant contributing factor in visceral conditions (diseases of the internal organs), and (d) 76.5% taught patients about a relationship between subluxations and visceral health [14]. - In 2006, in a randomized sample of US chiropractors, 70% of practitioners said their clinical practices were \"subluxation-centered\" and 59% agreed that the concept of subluxation was important to their clinical care decisions [15]. - In 2015, a survey of North American chiropractic students reported that more than 60% agreed or strongly agreed that the emphasis of chiropractic intervention is to eliminate vertebral subluxations [16]. - A survey conducted between 2018 and 2020 concluded that 56.8% of the 3,538 who responded were \"spine/neuromusculoskeletal-focused,\" 21.2% were vertebral subluxation focused.\" Although these numbers might indicate a sharp drop in subluxation focus, the authors noted that some chiropractors in the first two groups still subscribed to subluxation beliefs [17]. Mainstream chiropractic organizations are also strongly tied to the subluxation concept. In 2000, the ACA House of Delegates reaffirmed its core principle of subluxation by passing this resolution: The ACA will strive to reiterate this principle and further state that the core treatment of chiropractic is manual manipulation/adjustment of the articulations, both spinal and extra-spinal, to reduce subluxations, when called upon in relation to Federal legislative efforts, in addition to full scope of practice as allowed by state law. References to subluxation and chiropractic adjustments/manipulation should be made in ACA releases, whenever possible. In 1996, in an attempt to unify the profession, the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) adopted a subluxation-based \"chiropractic paradigm\" statement that contains this definition: A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence [18]. In 2005, the World Federation of Chiropractic, an association of chiropractic organizations in 85 countries, adopted an \"identity statement\" based on a survey in which thousands of chiropractors were asked how the public should perceive them. The survey found that 65% of respondents said that the phrase \"management of vertebral subluxation and its impact on general health\" fits chiropractic \"perfectly\" or almost perfectly [19]. Subluxation theory is not only entrenched in the practices of chiropractors; it is also embodied in all 50 of the state laws that govern chiropractic regulation. Twenty-states authorize chiropractors to treat subluxations, 25 authorize them to treat purported vertebral malpositions that interfere with nerve flow (or similar wording), and five authorize the use of whatever is taught at chiropractic colleges [20]. As a result, all states permit chiropractors to treat all or most diseases by adjusting subluxations to improve nerve flow. Chiropractic Education In 1973 the U.S. Office of Education approved the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) to accredit chiropractic schools. In 2018, the requirements for admission to a CCE-accredited school included 90 credit hours (about 3 years) of prechiropractic college education with at least a 3.0 (out of 4.0) grade-point average [21]. To receive the doctor of chiropractic (D.C.) degree, students must complete at least 4,200 hours of study over a 4-year period. Courses include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, public health, diagnosis and x-ray examination, related health sciences, and chiropractic principles and practice. Seventeen chiropractic programs in the United States have CCE accreditation. In 1968 a comprehensive study by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare concluded that chiropractic education did not prepare its practitioners to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment [22]. Chiropractic colleges have improved considerably since that time. However, all still discuss subluxations in their philosophy courses, some consider subluxations to be real entities, and a few still encourage students to treat \"subluxations\" rather than diseases or \"conditions.\" [23] The ACC paradigm statement says, \"Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on the subluxation.\" [18] The statement was signed by all of the U.S. chiropractic college presidents in 1996 and is still considered current. In 2018, researchers who investigated 46 chiropractic programs (18 in the United States and 28 elsewhere) found that among the U.S. programs, the average number of mentions of \"subluxation\" in course titles and descriptions was 7. Those with the most mentions were Life University (25), Sherman College of Chiropractic (18), and the Palmer College of Chiropractic\u2014Florida (17). \"Subluxation\" was mentioned by only a few the 18 non-U.S. programs. The research team concluded: Unscientific terms and concepts should have no place in modern health care education, except perhaps in discussions with historical context. Unless these outdated concepts are rejected, the chiropractic profession and individual chiropractors will likely continue to face difficulties integrating with established health care systems and attaining cultural authority as experts in conservative neuromusculoskeletal health care [24] Chiropractic colleges do not provide the depth of diagnostic and therapeutic training that physicians receive. Whereas most medical school faculties are large and contain experts in every aspect of medical practice, chiropractic colleges have few or no physicians on their faculty. Whereas the patients studied by medical students encompass the full range of disease, the vast majority seen by chiropractic students seek help for musculoskeletal problems. Although many of their courses are based on standard medical textbooks, chiropractic students lack much of the experience needed to make the information meaningful [25]. Some chiropractors try to downplay their lack of clinical experience by claiming that they spend more hours than medical students do in one subject or another. These claims are misleading because nearly all medical doctors undergo at least 3 additional years of full-time clinical training before going into practice, whereas nearly all chiropractors enter practice directly after graduation from their 4-year program. Moreover, in chiropractic colleges, instruction in many subjects, including pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology, is confined to the classroom, with little or no actual patient contact and no experience with hospitalized patients [25]. A team of research-oriented chiropractors recently stated: There is a tremendous void in how chiropractic graduates develop any meaningful hands-on clinical experience with real patients in real life situations. The chiropractic profession has an obligation to actively divorce itself from metaphysical explanations of health and disease as well as to actively regulate itself in refusing to tolerate fraud, abuse and quackery, which are more rampant in chiropractic than in other healthcare professions.\" [25] Critics also note that because much of chiropractic is based on a false premise, neither length of study nor accreditation of its schools can ensure that those who graduate will practice competently. Practice-Building Techniques After graduation many chiropractors take courses to help build their practices. These courses teach efficient office management, but some have taught unethical methods of recruiting and retaining patients. For example, one practice-building manual advised that \"Every action the chiropractor does should have the one purpose to slowly but surely direct the patient's attention to the fact that chiropractic is capable of correcting the 'condition' that is 'causing' the patient's ill health\" and provided detailed instructions for persuading all comers to have monthly spinal examinations [27]. Another suggested telling patients that \"the best health insurance you'll ever buy is regular adjustments of your spine, releasing nerve pressures.\" [28] Both of these books were authored by chiropractic college presidents and widely used for more than 30 years.\u00c2 Although neither book is still published, most current practice-builders teach the same techniques and thousands of chiropractors use them. A 1986 report by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that \"practice-building courses, popular with many chiropractors, advocate advertising techniques which suggest the universal efficacy of chiropractic treatment for every ailment known to humans.\" It also concluded that despite evidence of an increased emphasis on science and professionalism in the training and practice of chiropractors, \"there also exist patterns of activity and practice which at best appear as overly aggressive marketing\u2014and, in some cases, seem deliberately aimed at misleading patients and the public regarding chiropractic care.\" [29] A 1989 OIG report noted that the two most common reasons for disciplinary actions by state chiropractic boards were billing abuses (relating to utilization or fees) and advertising abuses [30]. Many chiropractors use messages that reinforce the idea of a special bond between themselves and their patients. The bumper sticker shown below was distributed by the American Chiropractic Association. The heart sticker is from a company that sells novelty items to chiropractors. Several companies sell birthday cards and other greeting cards with chiropractic themes. Research Findings Many studies have examined whether spinal manipulation can relieve back pain. Relatively few studies have looked at whether manipulation could help other problems. In properly selected cases, manipulation may relieve low-back pain of musculoskeletal origin. However, there is little evidence that it is effective for other musculoskeletal conditions and no evidence that it is effective for nonmusculoskeletal conditions. Homola has noted that \"chiropractic research has yet to pinpoint\u00c2 what chiropractors do that is beneficial.\" [31] During the early 1990s, manipulation received considerable publicity after reviews by the RAND Corporation [32] and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) [33] concluded that manipulation was effective for acute low-back pain in patients with no signs of lower-limb nerve root involvement. Although chiropractors promoted these reports as endorsements of chiropractic, they were not. They merely supported the use of manipulation in carefully selected patients. Only a few of the studies on which their conclusions were based involved manipulation by chiropractors; most were done by medical doctors and physical therapists whose practices were not identical to those of chiropractors [10]. Since that time, there have been many more studies and many more reviews. In 2003, a team that included RAND's project leader concluded: \"There is no evidence that spinal manipulation is superior to other standard treatments for patients with acute or chronic low back pain.\" [34] In 2005, after looking at 19 reviews related to back pain, Canter and Ernst concluded that \"those authored by chiropractors tended to generate positive results, whereas the others failed to demonstrate effectiveness.\" [35] In 2006, Ernst and Canter reported on 16 systematic reviews of clinical trials of spinal manipulation published between 2000 and May 2005 on back pain, neck pain, headache, non-spinal pain, menstrual pain, infantile colic, asthma, allergy, neck-related dizziness, and medical problems in general. They concluded: These reviews were largely negative, except for back pain where spinal manipulation was considered superior to sham manipulation but not better than conventional treatments. . . . Collectively these data do not demonstrate that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition. Given the possibility of adverse effects, this review does not suggest that spinal manipulation is a recommendable treatment [36]. A 2010 Cochrane review examined the effect of manipulation plus other modalities on low-back pain. The other modalities were heat and cold therapy, electrotherapy, mechanical devices, exercise, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification, and patient education. The reviewers concluded that although combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute and subacute low-back pain, \"there is currently no evidence to support or refute that combined chiropractic interventions provide a clinically meaningful advantage over other treatments for pain or disability in people with low-back pain.\" [37] A 2011 review drew similar conclusions for chronic low-back pain [38]. Although a 2019 Cochrane Review was slightly more favorable [39], Ernst concluded that the analysis was severely flawed and:: - The lead author and second author of the review team were chiropractors who had significant conflicts of interest, - The review actually produced no good evidence that spinal manipulation has effects beyond placebo. - Spinal manipulative therapy is still not supported by convincing evidence for back (or other) problems and does not qualify as the treatment of choice [40]. Little has been written about the fact that studies of manipulation in research settings may not reflect what takes place in typical chiropractic offices. Patients in research studies are likely to be better screened for appropriateness and are highly unlikely to face the many things that chiropractors do wrong in their offices. So even if manipulation is proven useful for carefully selected patients, consulting chiropractors outside of research settings may still be problematic. Problems for Consumers Although some research on the use of spinal manipulation is favorable, the situation faced by consumers is actually worse than these studies might seem to indicate. Most research on spinal manipulation is done in studies where the patients are appropriately screened and the treatment is limited by the experimental protocol. In the real world, however, the odds of getting appropriate treatment are much lower because the following problems are widespread. I have also noted that chiropractors seldom react constructively to criticism. When specific wrongdoings are exposed, they typically claim that the criticized practices are not representative, or that the critic is biased, or they attack the medical profession [41]. Exaggerated Scope Many chiropractors exaggerate what they can achieve. Tedd Koren, D.C., publishes many brochures and other practice-building supplies, one of which states: Nearly every condition to which the flesh is heir has responded to chiropractic, including ear infections, asthma, allergies, colic, bedwetting, hearing problems, skin conditions, digestive and menstrual problems, infertility, spine and nerve pain, colds and flu, headache, sciatica, emotional and neurological conditions and many others [42]. Koren also advised chiropractors they could double their practice \"practically overnight\" by having patients read one of his lists of conditions treated and asking: \"Do you know of any children, perhaps your own, or those of relatives or friends, that have any of the problems in this list?\" [43] A recent survey found that unsubstantiated claims are very common among chiropractic Web sites. In the fall of 2008, the researchers looked at the sites of 200 chiropractors and 9 chiropractic associations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each site was examined for claims which suggested that chiropractic treatment was appropriate for asthma, colic, ear infection/earache/otitis media, neck pain, whiplash, headache/migraine, and lower back pain. The study found that 95% of the surveyed sites made unsubstantiated claims for at least one of these conditions and 38% made unsubstantiated claims for all of them. The authors concluded: The majority of chiropractors and their associations in the English speaking world seem to make therapeutic claims that are not supported by sound evidence, while only 28% of chiropractor websites promote lower back pain, which is supported by some evidence. We suggest the ubiquity of the unsubstantiated claims constitutes an ethical and public health issue [44]. Patients who rely on exaggerated chiropractic claims may delay obtaining more appropriate care. Modde highlighted this problem when he said that \"malpractice is an inevitable result of chiropractic philosophy and training.\" [45] Unnecessary Treatment Many chiropractors claim that treating subluxations improves general health and is important throughout life. For example, in 1995 an ACA board member stated: \"I treat my patients as if each spinal adjustment has a virtually unlimited potential in improving their health. My father adjusted me on the day that I came home from the hospital, and I did the same with my children.\" [46] Many chiropractors suggest unnecessary \"spinal adjustments\" for \"preventative maintenance\" or for treating nonexistent conditions. Maintenance care is typically promoted with claims that undetected subluxations pose a serious health threat. A 2009 Koren pamphlet, for example, states: \"Subluxations are sometimes referred to as 'silent killers' because they can slowly eat away at your health and vitality for years without your knowing it.\" [47] Many chiropractors offer free evaluations with the hope that takers will contract for long-term care. These offers may be communicated through mall exhibits, free dinners, newspaper advertising, and various other channels. The \"danger signal\" ad shown below is from a telephone directory. It is misleading because (a) most of the listed symptoms are unlikely to be caused by pinched nerves, (b) most cases involving these symptoms are not serious, and (c) some of the symptoms (such as difficult breathing) are far more likely to be appropriate for medical rather than chiropractic evaluation. Contour analysis has no diagnostic value. The in-office sales pitch typically includes a recommendation for 50 to 100 visits over a 6- to 12-month period to promote wellness and/or prevent spinal degeneration. To increase compliance and discourage patients from stopping if their initial symptoms resolve, patients are offered a discount is they pay in advance for a specified number of treatments. As illustrated by the following case, such arrangments are usually a bad idea: In 2008, in response to an advertisement, Gertrude West, a 76-year-old retired attorney, sought help from a chiropractor for knee pain. The chiropractor performed a cursory examination, some diagnostic tests, and an x-ray examination and advised West that she had \"subluxation degeneration\" that would worsen without intensive chiropractic care. The chiropractor's written report of findings called for 100 visits at a total cost of $7080, but if she signed a contract and paid in advance the price would be discounted (15%) to $6,354. After 49 visits over a 4-month period, West concluded that she was not being helped and asked that payment for the unused visits be refunded. When the chiropractor refused, she sued him in small claims court. The contract GlimWest signed said that if she stopped before the 100 visits were completed, she would be charged at a nondiscounted rate for the visits she had and an additional 10% \"administrative fee.\" However, the judge ruled that the penalty clause was \"unconscionable\" and that West had been misled and was entitled to a full refund. A small claims appeal judge reduced the award to $4,589 but agreed that the contract was unreasonable. Chiropractors who offer \"discount\" plans should be avoided because such plans are a sign of overselling. Even when chiropractic treatment can be helpful, it is not possible to know in advance that a large specified number of visits will be needed. Some patient-recruitment programs have been packaged as an opportunity to participate in research. In 2008, for example, several chiropractic Web sites began advertising for \"research volunteers\" who would be evaluated free of charge. After the evaluation, they would then be invited\u2014as paying patients\u2014to \"commit to a 24-visit cycle, and continue coming until they reach their maximum potential.\" The ads are part of a practice-building program offered by Research & Clinical Science (RCS), which promised chiropractors that it would tabulate data that would ultimately pinpoint \"exactly what impact subluxations have on the body, and what benefits chiropractic might offer to people of various ages and health levels.\" RCS also promised that its program would generate between 10 and 25 new patients a month and promote long-term wellness and compliance among existing patients. To join the program, chiropractors would pay $7384 in advance or up to $8384 for an installment plan. In return, RCS provided the training, research technology, wall plaque, brochures, and other materials needed to represent themselves as \"RCS Authorized Clinical Investigators.\" [48] A real investigation of whether chiropractic can prevent disease in general found no evidence that it has done so [49]. Opposition to Immunization Many chiropractors say that vaccinations are ineffective and do not recommend them to their patients. In 1992, 36% of 178 chiropractors who responded to a survey agreed that \"there is no scientific proof that immunization prevents infectious disease\" and 23% said they were uncertain. In the same survey, 41% agreed that \"immunization campaigns have not substantially changed the incidence of any infectious diseases in the 20th century\" and 29% said they were unsure [50]. A more recent study looked at vaccination rates obtained from insurance data compiled in the state of Washington from 2000 to 2003. The researchers found that vaccination rates were much lower among children who saw chiropractors and naturopaths than among those who relied only on medical doctors [51]. The ACA, ICA, WCA, and International Chiropractic Pediatric Association oppose compulsory vaccination, and all but the ACA distribute anti-vaccination publications [52] Dubious Practices and Procedures - Many chiropractors use leg-length measurement, thermography, surface electromyography, or other dubious methods to detect alleged subluxations. The Chirobase Web site (www.chirobase.org) has detailed reports on these methods. - Many chiropractors use applied kinesiology muscle-testing, hair analysis, or other dubious methods as a basis for prescribing unnecessary vitamins, irrational \"dietary supplement\" formulations, herbs, and/or homeopathic products, most of which are sold to patients at two or three times their wholesale cost. - Many chiropractors x-ray most or all of their patients to look for \"subluxations.\" About 10% of chiropractors still obtain 14 x 36-inch full-spine x-ray films, which yield little or no diagnostic information and involve relatively high levels of radiation. - A 2003 survey by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners found that 89% of 2167 full-time practitioners who responded said they had used \"nutritional counseling, therapy or supplements\" within the previous year and that 46.4% said they had prescribed homeopathic remedies [53]. - Although not qualified by training to understand the use of prescription drugs, many chiropractors discourage their use. Consumer Reports has advised people to be suspicious of any chiropractor who does the following: - Takes full-spine or repeated x-rays - Fails to take a comprehensive history and perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of your trouble - Claims that the treatment will improve immune function, benefit organ systems, or cure disease - Offers to sell you vitamin cures, nutritional remedies, or homeopathic remedies - Solicits children or other family members - Advises against the immunization of children - Wants you to sign a contract for long-term care - Promises to prevent disease through regular checkups and spinal adjustments [54] Adverse Effects of Spinal Manipulation Most chiropractors manipulate the vast majority of patients who visit their office; some use techniques that have not been studied scientifically, and many emphasize a technique that is more vigorous (and therefore potentially less safe) than the controlled manipulation used by other practitioners. Manipulation, particularly of the neck, can be dangerous. In 1992 researchers at the Stanford Stroke Center asked 486 California members of the American Academy of Neurology how many patients they had seen during the previous 2 years who had suffered a stroke within 24 hours of neck manipulation by a chiropractor. The survey was sponsored by the American Heart Association. The 176 neurologists who responded said that they had treated 56 such patients, all between the ages of 21 and 60. One patient had died, and 48 were left with permanent neurologic deficits such as slurred speech, inability to arrange words properly, and vertigo (severe dizziness). The neurologists also reported treating 46 cases of nerve or muscle injury [55]. Although the percentage of chiropractic patients who are seriously injured is small, injury caused by an unnecessary manipulation is inexcusable. In 1995, Assendelft and colleagues reviewed 295 published reports of complications and concluded (a) it is difficult to estimate the incidence of complications of spinal manipulation because they are underreported in the scientific literature, (b) information about the risk of stroke should be included in an informed consent procedure for neck manipulation that involves thrusting, and (c) practitioners using rotatory manipulation should be avoided [56]. In 2008, Ernst reported that seven prospective studies had found that about half of the patients who received spinal manipulation experienced mild-to-moderate, transient adverse effects [57]. Local or radiating pain, headache, and tiredness occurred most often. Spinal manipulation can also result in serious injury to nerves, disc herniation, and, with neck manipulation, dissection of the vertebral artery followed by stroke [58]. Severe injuries are uncommon, but their actual incidence is unknown [59]. Excessive Use of X-Ray Examinations A recent review concluded that (a) in the vast majority of cases who present to chiropractors, the potential benefit from spinal X-rays does not outweigh the potential harms and (b) spinal x-rays should not be performed as a routine part of chiropractic practice [60]. A Plea for Reform In 2016, [Bruce F. Walker, D.C., Dr.P.H.](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/bruce-walker/), who heads the chiropractic program at Murdoch University (Australia), urged chiropractors to adopt a 10-point plan for \"a new chiropractic\" that would achieve full acceptance for his \"troubled profession.\" His report includes a list of \"bad\" practices that continue to cause significant reputational damage to the profession: - Adherence to a flawed chiropractic ideology centering on \"innate intelligence\" and vitalism - Anti-vaccination propaganda - Anti-physiotherapy sentiments - Over-servicing, including unnecessary treatment of babies - Use of the term \"subluxation\" as a valid diagnosis - Biologically implausible diagnostic tests and therapies without supporting evidence - Lifetime chiropractic care in the name of \"wellness\" - Claims of cures for visceral and other non-musculoskeletal conditions - Anti-drug and anti-medicine propaganda - Misleading and deceptive advertising - Unscrupulous contracts of care - Obligatory full-spine x-rays - Unfounded claims of decreased immunity from \"subluxation\" and increased immunity from chiropractic treatment - An unhealthy disregard of clinical research, evidence based practice, and non-specific treatment effects including natural history and the placebo effect Walker's proposed plan included \"marginalization of the nonsensical elements within the profession,\" unequivocal support of proven public health measures, increased research, and unambiguous statements from chiropractic organizations that support science and evidence [61]. His suggestions are excellent, but there is little reason to believe that most chiropractors will follow them. Some Final Thoughts The terms \"chiropractic\" and \"chiropractic treatment\" are ambiguous and are not synonymous with \"spinal manipulation.\" Chiropractic is both a philosophy and a treatment approach. Chiropractic treatment may include a wide variety of dubious measures in addition to appropriate or inappropriate manipulation. Thus, the potential usefulness of spinal manipulation may not counterbalance the unscientific philosophy or methods commonly embraced by chiropractors. References - Lomax E.

Associated Press, Aug 18, 2022] A recent article described false and misleading information in an article published on the Children's Health Defense website. [Mole B.

Vitamin D supplementation failed to lower fracture risk. A randomized clinical trial has found vitamin D supplements had no significant effect on total fractures, nonvertebral fractures, or hip fractures. The study followed more than 25,000 men and women who were at least 50 years old for a median time of 5.3 years. About half were given 2,000 international units of vitamin D while the others received a placebo. The trial was an ancillary study of VITAL, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial, that tested the effectiveness of supplementation for preventing cancer and heart disease. The 20% of participants who also took calcium were not found to have better outcomes. No benefit of supplemental vitamin D3 on fracture risk was found regardless of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the blood serum at the start of the study. Results of previous trials of vitamin D on fracture risk have had inconsistent findings. [LeBoff MS, and others. [Supplemental vitamin D and incident fractures in midlife and older adults](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106). New England Journal of Medicine 387:299-309, 2022] An editorial about the study concluded: A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level might be a useful diagnostic test for some patients with conditions that may be due to or that may cause severe deficiency. For example, persons living in residential settings with little or no sunlight exposure or malabsorption or those receiving treatments for osteoporosis that might cause hypocalcemia may benefit from vitamin D supplementation; the need for measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in these groups remains uncertain. Otherwise, the use of the terms vitamin D \"insufficiency\" and \"deficiency\" should now be reconsidered. What are the implications of VITAL? The fact that vitamin D had no effect on fractures should put to rest any notion of an important benefit of vitamin D alone to prevent fractures in the larger population. Adding those findings to previous reports from VITAL and other trials showing the lack of an effect for preventing numerous conditions, suggests that providers should stop screening for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or recommending vitamin D supplements, and people should stop taking vitamin D supplements to prevent major diseases or extend life. [Cummings SR, Rosen C. [VITAL findings\u2014A decisive verdict on vitamin D supplementation](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2205993?query=recirc_curatedRelated_article).

Terminology - COVID-19, which is short for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is the name of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). - \"Asymptomatic\" is a medical term that means \"no symptoms.\" - Asymptomatic spread\" refers to the fact that people who are infected can transmit the virus before they feel sick. [An article in the International Journal of Biosciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098030/pdf/ijbsv16p1678.pdf) describes how the COVID-19 outbreak developed. Schemes and Scams - Prevention scams: Many individuals and companies are claiming that their dietary supplements, herbal, and/or homeopathic products can prevent disease by \"supporting,\" \"boosting\" or \"strengthening\" the immune system.\" Many [chiropractors](https://quackwatch.org/chiropractic/chiropractors-sparring-over-immune-boosting-claims/)and acupuncturists are making similar claims about their procedures. All such claims should be ignored. - Research scams: The [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/23355-bbb-scam-alert-covid-clinical-study-scams-promise-big-bucks)has warned that scammers are sending out messages via text, email, and social media to invite people to participate in non-existent COVID-19 research Some offer payment as a lure to get personal information through a sign-up process. Others seek payment for enrollment in a non-existent trial. [Others offer nonexistent incentives for answering questions about vaccine status](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-warns-about-fake-post-vaccine-survey-scams). - Testing Scams: Scammers are selling fake at-home test kits or going door-to-door performing fake tests for money. Free test kits can be obtained from [COVIDtests.gov](https://www.covidtests.gov/), or by calling 1-800-232-0233. - Contact tracing scams: Legitimate health department contact traces may ask whether you have been exposed to COVID-19. But any such communication that asks for money, your social security number, a credit card number, or your immigration status should be regarded as a scam. - \"Mask exemption\" cards: Scammers are selling mask [mask exemption cards](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-protection/government-supported-mask-exemption-cards-are-not-legitimate/)that claim that the card-holder has a disability that prevents wearing a mask. Such cards may include the seal of a government agency. No such card is government-supported or has any legal significance. - Treatment scams: Scammers are selling fake vaccines, medicines, tests, and cures for COVID-19. Ignore electronic offers for a COVID-19 vaccine, cure, or treatment. Remember, if there is a medical breakthrough, you will not hear about it for the first time through an email, online ad, or other unsolicited sales pitch. - Supply scams: Scammers are claiming they have in-demand products, like cleaning, household, health, and medical supplies. When an order is placed, the scammer takes the money and never delivers the order. To avoid being victimized, check online reviews of any company offering COVID-19 products or supplies. Avoid companies whose customers have complained about not receiving items - Telemedicine frauds: Scammers are cold-calling people, claiming to offer free telemedicine visits, braces, or medicine in an attempt to get insurance information they can use to submit false insurance claims. - Charity scams: Scammers are fraudulently soliciting donations for non-existent charities to help people affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Scammers often use names that are similar to the names of real charities. Research any charities or crowdfunding sites soliciting donations in connection with COVID-19 before giving. Remember, an organization may not be legitimate even if it uses words like \"CDC\" or \"government\" in its name or has reputable looking seals or logos on its materials. Be wary of any business, charity, or individual requesting payments or donations in cash, by wire transfer, gift card, or through the mail. Do not send money through any of these channels. The [(FTC) Web site](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/how-donate-wisely-and-avoid-charity-scams)has additional tips on avoiding charity frauds. - Phishing schemes: Scammers, posing as local contact tracers or national and global health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are sending fake emails or texts to trick the recipient into sharing personal information, including account numbers, Social Security numbers, or login IDs and passwords. Such requests may also come via robocalls or offer free test kits. Never give your personal or financial information to someone unless you are absolutely sure they are legitimate. Make sure that the anti-malware and anti-virus software on your computer is operating and up to date. Do not click on links or open email attachments from unknown or unverified sources. Doing so could download a virus onto your computer or device. If you are eligible for a payment, you will receive a payment directly from the IRS.

The injury often results from extreme rotation in which the practitioner's hands are placed on the patient's head in order to rotate the cervical spine by rotating the head [1]. The vertebral artery, which is shown in the picture to the right, is vulnerable because it winds around the topmost cervical vertebra (atlas) to enter the skull, so that any abrupt rotation may stretch the artery and tear its delicate lining.

Stroke from chiropractic neck manipulation occurs when an artery to the brain ruptures or becomes blocked by a clot as a result of being stretched. The injury often results from extreme rotation in which the practitioner's hands are placed on the patient's head in order to rotate the cervical spine by rotating the head [1]. The vertebral artery, which is shown in the picture to the right, is vulnerable because it winds around the topmost cervical vertebra (atlas) to enter the skull, so that any abrupt rotation may stretch the artery and tear its delicate lining. The anatomical problem is illustrated on page 7 of [The Chiropractic Report, July 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20030308010050/http://www.chiropracticreport.com/samples/july99.pdf). A blood clot formed over the injured area may subsequently be dislodged and block a smaller artery that supplies the brain. Less frequently, the vessel may be blocked by blood that collects in the vessel wall at the site of the dissection [2] Chiropractors would like you to believe that the incidence of stroke following neck manipulation is extremely small. Speculations exist that the risk of a serious complication due to neck manipulation are somewhere between one in 40,000 and one in 10 million manipulations. No one really knows, however, because (a) there has been little systematic study of its frequency; (b) the largest malpractice insurers won't reveal how many cases they know about; and (c) a large majority of cases that medical doctors see are not reported in scientific journals. Published Reports In 1992, researchers at the Stanford Stroke Center asked 486 California members of the American Academy of Neurology how many patients they had seen during the previous two years who had suffered a stroke within 24 hours of neck manipulation by a chiropractor. The survey was sponsored by the American Heart Association. A total of 177 neurologists reported treating 56 such patients, all of whom were between the ages of 21 and 60. One patient had died, and 48 were left with permanent neurologic deficits such as slurred speech, inability to arrange words properly, and vertigo (dizziness). The usual cause of the strokes was thought to be a tear between the inner and outer walls of the vertebral arteries, which caused the arterial walls to balloon and block the flow of blood to the brain. Three of the strokes involved tears of the carotid arteries [3]. In 1991, according to circulation figures from Dynamic Chiropractic, California had about 19% of the chiropractors practicing in the United States, which suggests that about 147 cases of stroke each year were seen by neurologists nationwide. Of course, additional cases could have been seen by other doctors who did not respond to the survey. A 1993 review concluded that potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that children should not undergo neck manipulation [4]. Louis Sportelli, DC, NCMIC president and a former ACA board chairman contends that chiropractic neck manipulation is quite safe. In an 1994 interview reported by the Associated Press, he reacted to the American Heart Association study by saying, \"I yawned at it. It's old news.\" He also said that other studies suggest that chiropractic neck manipulation results in a stroke somewhere between one in a million and one in three million cases [5]. The one-in-a-million figure could be correct if California's chiropractors had been averaging about 60 neck manipulations per week. Later that year, during a televised interview with \"Inside Edition,\" Sportelli said the \"worst-case scenario\" was one in 500,000 but added: \"When you weigh the procedure against any other procedure in the health-care industry, it is probably the lowest risk factor of anything.\" According to the program's narrator, Sportelli said that 90% of his patients receive neck manipulation. In 1996, RAND issued a booklet that tabulated more than 100 published case reports and estimated that the number of strokes, cord compressions, fractures, and large blood clots was 1.46 per million neck manipulations. Even though this number appears small, it is significant because many of the manipulations chiropractors do should not be done. In addition, as the report itself noted, neither the number of manipulations performed nor the number of complications has been systematically studied [6]. Since some people are more susceptible than others, it has also been argued that the incidence should be expressed as rate per patient rather than rate per adjustment. In 1996, the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company (NCMIC), which is the largest American chiropractic malpractice insurer, published a report called \"Vertebrobasilar Stroke Following Manipulation,\" written by Allen G.J. Terrett, an Australian chiropractic educator/researcher. Terrett based his findings on 183 cases of vertebrobasilar strokes (VBS) reported between 1934 and 1994. He concluded that 105 of the manipulations had been administered by a chiropractor, 25 were done by a medical practitioner, 31 had been done by another type of practitioner, and that the practitioner type for the remaining 22 was not specified in the report. He concluded that VBS is \"very rare,\" that current pretesting procedures are seldom able to predict susceptibility, and that in 25 cases serious injury might have been avoided if the practitioner had recognized that symptoms occurring after a manipulation indicated that further manipulations should not be done [7]. A 1999 review of 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997 found 177 cases of neck injury associated with neck manipulation, at least 60% of which was done by chiropractors [8]. In 2001, NCMIC published a second edition of Terrett's book, titled, \"Current Concepts: Vertebrobasilar Complications following Spinal Manipulation,\" which covered 255 cases published between 1934 and 1999 [9]. [NCMIC's Web site claims that the book \"includes an analysis of every known case related to this subject](http://www.ncmic.com/NCMIC_Ins/DoctorsOfChiro/PracticeTools/educational_materials/cva_mono.asp).\" That description is not true. It does not include many strokes that resulted in lawsuits against NCMIC policyholders but were not published in scientific journals. And it does not include the thoroughly documented case of [Kristi Bedenbauer ](chiro.html#kristy)whose autopsy report I personally mailed to Terrett after speaking with him in 1995. In 2001, Canadian researchers published a report about the relationships between chiropractic care and the incidence of vertebrovascular accidents (VBAs) due to vertebral artery dissection or blockage in Ontario, Canada, between 1993 and 1998. Using hospital records, each of 582 VBA cases was age- and sex-matched to four controls with no history of stroke. Health insurance billing records were used to document use of chiropractic services. The study found that VBA patients under age 45 were five times more likely than controls to (a) have visited a chiropractor within a week of the VBA and (b) to have had three or more visits with neck manipulations. No relationship was found after age 45. The authors discuss possible shortcomings of the study and urge that further research be done [10]. An accompanying editorial states that the data correspond to an incidence of 1.3 cases of vertebral artery dissection or blockage per 100,000 individuals receiving chiropractic neck manipulation, a number higher than most chiropractic estimates [11]. In 2001, British researchers reported on a survey in which all members of the Association of British Neurologists were asked to report cases referred to them of neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of neck manipulation over a 12-month period. The 35 reported cases included 7 strokes involving the vertebrobasilar artery and 2 strokes involving a carotid artery. None of the 35 cases were reported to medical journals [12]. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter School of Sport and Health Sciences, believes that these results are very significant. In a recent commentary, he stated: One gets the impression that the risks of spinal manipulation are being played down, particularly by chiropractors. Perhaps the best indication that this is true are estimates of incidence rates based on assumptions, which are unproven at best and unrealistic at worse. One such assumption, for instance, is that 10% of actual complications will be reported. Our recent survey, however, demonstrated an underreporting rate of 100%. This extreme level of underreporting obviously renders estimates nonsensical [13]. In 2002, researchers representing the [Canadian Stroke Consortium](http://www.strokeconsortium.ca/08-spontads/08iii.sp-update.html) reported on 98 cases in which external trauma ranging from \"trivial\" to \"severe\" was identified as the trigger of strokes caused by blood clots formed in arteries supplying the brain. Chiropractic-style neck manipulation was the apparent cause of 38 of the cases, 30 involving vertebral artery dissection and 8 involving carotid artery dissection. Other Canadian statistics indicate the incidence of ischemic strokes in people under 45 is about 750 a year. The researchers believe that their data indicate that 20% are due to neck manipulation, so there may be \"gross underreporting\" of chiropractic manipulation as a cause of stroke [14]. In 2003, another research team reviewed the records of 151 patients under age 60 with cervical arterial dissection and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) from between 1995 and 2000 at two academic stroke centers. After an interview and a blinded chart review, 51 patients with dissection and 100 control patients were studied. Patients with dissection were more likely to have undergone spinal manipulation within 30 days (14% vs 3%). The authors concluded that spinal manipulation is associated with vertebral arterial dissection and that a significant increase in neck pain following neck manipulation warrants immediate medical evaluation [15]. In 2006, the Journal of Neurology published a German Vertebral Artery Dissection Study Group report about 36 patients who had experienced vertebral artery dissection associated with neck manipulation [16]. Twenty-six patients developed their symptoms within 48 hours after a manipulation, including five patients who got symptoms at the time of manipulation and four who developed them within the next hour. In 27 patients, special imaging procedures confirmed that blood supply had decreased in the areas supplied by the vertebral arteries as suggested by the neurological examinations. In all but one of the 36 patients, the symptoms had not previously occurred and were clearly distinguishable from the complaints that led them to seek manipulative care. This report is highly significant but needs careful interpretation. Although it is titled \"Vertebral dissections after chiropractic neck manipulation . . . \" only four of the patients were actually manipulated by chiropractors. Half were treated by orthopedic surgeons, five by a physiotherapist, and the rest by a neurologist, general medical practitioner, or homeopath. It is possible\u2014although unlikely\u2014that the nonchiropractors used techniques that were more dangerous than chiropractors use in North America. The authors suggested that the orthopedists' treatment was safer, but there is no way to determine this from their data. Regardless, the study supports the assertion that neck manipulation can cause strokes\u2014which many chiropractors deny. In 2006, Pediatrics Electronic Pages published the results of a comprehensive review of reports of adverse events associated with spinal manipulation of children who were eight years of age or younger. The seven cases classified as serious included a 3-month-old infant with died from subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding that compressed the brain) and two cases of atlas dislocation [17]. A retrospective study found that 12 out of 141 patients treated for vertebral or carotid artery dissection at the SF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois between 2008 and 2012 had recent chiropractic neck manipulation documented in their chart. The ages of the patients ranged from 22 to 45 [18]. In 2021, a stroke sue to vertebral artery dissection was reported in a 2-month-old infant whose neck had been manipulated by a chiropractor [19]. Two more reports illustrate chiropractic's denial. - In the first study, 377 members of the British and Scottish Chiropractic Associations and more than 19,000 of their patients were asked whether complications had occurred following neck manipulations. No strokes were reported, but symptoms that may have indicated neurologic involvement\u2014headache (reported in 3.9% of cases), numbness/tingling of the arms (1.3% of cases), and fainting/dizziness/lightheadedness (1.1% of cases) were reported. About 400 patients who discontinued treatment could not be reached for follow-up, so what happened to them is unknown [20]. - In the second study, David Cassidy and others compared insurance billing records and hospital discharge records and concluded that (a) the incidence of strokes was following primary-care (medical) visits was similar to the incidence of strokes following chiropractic visits, and (b) therefore the strokes that occurred in chiropractic offices were not caused by the treatment they received [21]. However, the study is meaningless because\u2014unlike the German Vertebral Artery Dissection Study Group\u2014the researchers did not examine clinical records and were not able to determine whether the diagnoses they tabulated were accurate or whether the strokes were related to the type of manipulation [22]. In addition, the study might have had a different outcome if it had used an observation period of a few days instead of a month because strokes related to chiropractic manipulation usually occur soon afterward. Chiropractors have also argued that case-control studies provide evidence that neck manipulation and vertebral artery stroke are unrelated. These idea has been persuasively rebutted [23]. Are Complications Predictable? Some chiropractors advocate \"screening tests\" with the hope of detecting individuals prone to stroke due to neck manipulation [24-26]. These tests, which include holding the head and neck in positions of rotation to see whether the patient gets dizzy, are not reliable, partly because manipulation can rotate the neck further than can be done with the tests. Listening over the neck arteries with a stethoscope to detect a murmur, for example, has not been proven reliable, though patients that have one should be referred to a physician. Vascular function tests in which the patient's head is briefly held in the positions used during cervical manipulation are also not reliable as a screen for high-risk patients because a thrust that further stretches the vertebral artery could still damage the vessel wall.\" In a chapter in the leading chiropractic textbook, Terrett and a colleague have stated: Even after performing the relevant case history, physical examination, and vertebrobasilar function tests, accidents may still occur. There is no conclusive, foolproof screening procedure to eliminate patients at risk. Most victims are young, without [bony] or vascular pathology, and do not present with vertebrobasilar symptoms. The screening procedures described cannot detect those patients in whom [manipulation] may cause an injury. They give a false sense of security to the practitioner [27]. Several medical reports have described chiropractic patients who, after neck manipulation, complained of dizziness and other symptoms of transient loss of blood supply to the brain but were manipulated again and had a full-blown stroke. During a workshop I attended at the 1995 Chiropractic Centennial Celebration, Terrett said such symptoms are ominous and that chiropractors should abandon rotational manipulations that overstretch the vertebral arteries. But, as far as I know, his remarks have not been published and have had no impact on his professional colleagues. The lack of predictability has been supported by data published by Scott Haldeman, DC, MD, PhD, a chiropractor who has served as an expert witness (usually for the defense) in many court cases involving chiropractic injury. In 1995, he published an abstract summarizing his review of 53 cases that had not been previously reported in medical or chiropractic journals. His report stated: These cases represent approximately a 45% increase in the number of such cases reported in the English language literature over the past 100 years. . . . No clear cut risk factors can be elicited from the data. Previously proposed risk factors such as migraine headaches, hypertension, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, oral contraceptives, recent head or neck trauma, or abnormalities on x-rays do not appear to be significantly greater in patients who have cerebrovascular complications of manipulation than that noted in the general population [28]. Haldeman's main point was he could not identify any factor that could predict that a particular patient was prone to cerebrovascular injury from neck manipulation. This report was published in the proceedings of 1995 Chiropractic Centennial Celebration and was not cited in either the RAND or NCMIC reports. In 2001, Haldeman and two colleagues published a more detailed analysis that covered 64 cases involving malpractice claims filed between 1978 and 1994 [29]. They reported that 59 (92%) came to treatment with a history of head or neck symptoms. This statistic has been used to assert that any association between manipulation and stroke is coincidental\u2014that because a dissection can produce headache or neck pain, patients who have already had a dissection may seek out care with chiropractors and others. However, it does not explain away what happened to the 8% of patients who had not sought treatment for head or neck pain. Nor can coincidence explain why the association between neck manipulation and stroke occurs more often among patients under age 45 than among older patients. Haldeman's reports provide insufficient information to judge whether manipulation could have been useful for treating their condition. Of course, malpractice claims don't present the full story, because most victims of professional negligence do not take legal action. Even when serious injury results, some are simply not inclined toward suing, some don't blame the practitioner, some have an aversion to lawyers, and some can't find an attorney willing to represent them. What Should Be Done? Chiropractors cannot agree among themselves whether the problem is significant enough to inform patients that vertebrobasilar stroke is a possible complication of manipulation [30,31]. In 1993, the Canadian Chiropractic Association published a consent form which stated, in part: Doctors of chiropractic, medical doctors, and physical therapists using manual therapy treatments for patients with neck problems such as yours are required to explain that there have been rare cases of injury to a vertebral artery as a result of treatment. Such an injury has been known to cause stroke, sometimes with serious neurological injury. The chances of this happening are extremely remote, approximately 1 per 1 million treatments. Appropriate tests will be performed on you to help identify if you may be susceptible to that kind of injury. . . . [31]. This notice is a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. A proper consent should disclose that (a) the risk is unknown; (b) alternative treatments may be available; (c) in many cases, neck symptoms will go away without treatment; (d) certain types of neck manipulation carry a higher risk than others; and (e) claims that spinal manipulation can remedy systemic diseases, boost immunity, improve general health, or prolong life have neither scientific justification nor a plausible rationale. In 2003, a coroner's jury concluded that Lana Dale Lewis of Toronto, Canada, was killed in 1996 by a chiropractic neck manipulation. Among other things, the jury recommended that all patients for whom neck manipulation is recommended be informed that risk exists and that the Ontario Ministry of Health establish a database for chiropractors and other health professionals to report on neck adjustments [32]. In 2005, the Canadian Chiropractic Association published a comprehensive clinical guideline for treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash.. Among other things, the document noted that very few studies have compared chiropractic treatment to no treatment, which means that it is difficult to determine the likely benefit of neck manipulation. The guideline also discussed risk factors and recommended that minimal rotation should be used when upper-neck manipulation is done [33,34]. In 2007, following an unnecessary neck manipulation, Sandra Nette developed \"locked-in syndrome,\" a condition that has been described as \"the closest thing to being buried alive.\" She is fully aware of her surroundings and suffers at times from extreme pain. She cannot swallow, speak, or breathe without regular mechanical ventilation and suctioning of her secretions. She cannot move her legs or left arm. Slight use of her right arm enables her to use a computer keyboard to communicate through a voice synthesizer. Her plight was readily apparent in videos posted to YouTube [35]. In 2008, she and her husband filed a class-action lawsuit intended to stop inappropriate chiropractic manipulation and force Canadian regulators to deal with this problem [35]. The court refused to certify a class action [36], but the suit against the chiropractor who treated her proceeded and but was settled with an undisclosed payment [37]. The Bottom Line As far as I know, most chiropractors do not warn their patients that neck manipulation entails risks. I believe they should and that the profession should implement a reporting system that would enable this matter to be appropriately studied. This might be achieved if (a) state licensing boards required that all such cases be reported, and (b) chiropractic malpractice insurance companies, which now keep their data secret, were required to disclose them to an independently operated database that has input from both medical doctors and chiropractors. Meanwhile, since stroke is such a devastating event, every effort should be made to stop chiropractors from manipulating necks without adequate reason. Many believe that all types of headaches might be amenable to spinal manipulation even though no scientific evidence supports such a belief. Many include neck manipulation as part of \"preventative maintenance\" that involves unnecessarily treating people who have no symptoms. Even worse, some chiropractors\u2014often referred to as \"upper cervical specialists\"\u2014claim that most human ailments are the result of misalignment of the topmost vertebrae (atlas and axis) and that every patient they see needs neck manipulation. Neck manipulation of children under age 12 should be outlawed [38]. For Additional Information |Reader Comment | From a former chiropractor: I have been doing a vascular surgery rotation for the past month, which is part of my postgraduate medical education. During my chiropractic training, when the subject of manipulation-induced stroke was brought up, we were reassured that \"millions of chiropractic adjustments are made each year and only a few incidents of stroke have been reported following neck manipulation.\" I recently found that two of the patients on my vascular service that suffered a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) had undergone neck manipulation by a chiropractor, one the day that symptoms had begun and the other four days afterward. If indeed the incidence of stroke is rare, one M.D. would see a case of manipulation-induced CVA about every 10 years. But I believe I have seen two in the past month! I therefore urge my medical colleagues to question their patients regarding recent visits to a chiropractor/neck manipulation when confronted with patients that present with the neurologic symptoms of stroke. I also urge potential chiropractic patients to not allow their necks to be manipulated in any way. The risk-to-benefit ratio is much too high to warrant such a procedure. \u2014Rob Alexander, M.D. References - Guide](http://www.chirobase.org/03Edu/C/homola.html).

After searching the Amazon website using the keyword immune in December 2020, researchers purchased a sample of each of the first 30 featured dietary supplement products that had received four or more stars. The research was funded by the U.S.-based Consortium for Health and Military Performance as well as Operation Supplement Safety. Laboratory analysis of the products revealed: - 17 of the products were inaccurately labeled - 13 of the inaccurately labeled products had 1 to 6 ingredients listed on the label, typically plant extracts, not found in the analysis - 9 products had substances detected but not claimed in their labeling - 23 of the products were labeled as having 6 to 32 ingredients - all 30 products had claims related to immune support, immune defense, and bolstering or boosting the immune system - product claims included \"all seasons immune support,\" \"immune strengthening ingredients,\" \"a powerhouse booster,\" and \"bolster up your body's immune support\" - 15 products had scientific-sounding claims by using terms science\" - no products had a third-party certification seal - only 13 products received a score indicative of at least the minimum level of safety in the Operation Supplement Safety Scorecard set up to protect U.S. military service members; 10 of those 13 had accurate labels The researchers wrote: Claims made on the labels of most dietary supplement products seem to stretch what would be considered as allowable claims, which can by statute and/or FDA regulations be made for dietary supplements. Some other claims sounded scientific but did not have any peer-reviewed publication cited. Therefore, it is unknown how or whether these claims were substantiated. [Crawford C. and others. [Analysis of select dietary supplement products marketed to support or boost the immune system](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794987). JAMA Network Open, Aug 10, 2022] In response to this study, Dr. Stephen Barrett submitted the following comment to the journal: During the past 20 years, countless \"immune support\" products have been marketed with very little media or government attention to the validity of this descriptive phrase. To be truthful, \"immune support\" should signify two things. One is that people who take the product should become more healthy than similar people who don't take the product. The other is that any such outcome should be related in some way to an improvement in some function of their immune system. To my knowledge, no \"immune support\" claim has ever met this standard. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over this claim but has not attempted to curb its use. Why not? Dr. Oz criticized for unethical product promotion. The Daily Beast has disclosed that Dr. Mehmet Oz had financial holdings in companies whose products were featured on the Dr. Oz Show and its website. [Brodey S.

In addition to giving talks at USANA events, he featured USANA products in promotional giveaways on his show and encouraged an audience member concerned about the health of her liver to take USANA's unproven Hepasil supplement The Dr. Oz Show ended its long run in January after Oz declared his Senate candidacy, but it might be resurrected if his election bid is unsuccessful.

According to a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1923141%20Benefytt%20-%20Complaint%20-%20MD%20Fla.pdf), Tampa, Florida-based healthcare and telemarketing company Benefytt Technologies, two subsidiaries, former CEO Gavin Southwell, and former vice president of sales Amy Brady, sold consumers sham health insurance plans. Benefytt and two of its subsidiaries have agreed to a [proposed court order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1923141%20Benefytt%20-%20Companies%27%20Stipulated%20Order.pdf) that would require them to pay $100 million in refunds for consumer redress, inform current customers of the order and allow them to cancel, sell all products without misleading consumers, and closely monitor other companies that sell their products. Separate proposed court orders for [Southwell](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1923141BenefyttOrderSouthwell1.pdf) and [Brady](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1923141BenefyttOrderBrady.pdf) include similar prohibitions on misrepresentations. The orders would also permanently prohibit them from playing any role in the sale or marketing of any healthcare-related product or service. Southwell's order further prohibits him from engaging in deceptive or abusive telemarketing practices. Brady's order prohibits her from participating in any telemarketing in the future. Along with their third-party partners, the defendants allegedly operated a series of deceptive websites such as \"Obamacareplans.com\" that targeted consumers who were searching for comprehensive health insurance plans qualified under the Affordable Care Act. When consumers navigated the websites, they were often led to a sales agent who would pitch them Benefytt's unqualified, sham plans misrepresented as comprehensive health insurance. Consumers were often charged hundreds of dollars per month but were left unprotected in a medical catastrophe. The FTC's complaint alleges that Benefytt's deceptive sales process violated the FTC Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act by: (a) lying about the nature of the plans, (b) bundling and charging junk fees for unwanted products without consent, and (c) making it hard to cancel.

FTC press release, Aug 8, 2022] Lawsuit against anti-competitive drug industry groups proceeding. Dr. Stephen Barrett has provided an update on an antitrust lawsuit that could lead to lower drug prices in the United States. Brand-name medicines often cost much less from licensed pharmacies in Canada and other countries than from pharmacies in the U.S. However, many online pharmacies are not legitimate. Since 2003, [PharmacyChecker](http://www.pharmacychecker.com/) has been helping smart consumers find the lowest prices on prescription drugs among online foreign pharmacies it has verified as legitimate. In 2019, PharmacyChecker filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York that accused the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), LegitScript, and three alleged drug-industry front groups of conspiring to suppress market competition, artificially inflating the price of prescription drugs, and spreading misinformation to frighten consumers away from legitimate foreign pharmacies. In 2021, the court largely denied defendants' motions to dismiss, concluding that with one exception, PharmacyChecker's allegations were sufficient for the case to proceed against all of them. The court granted dismissal to LegitScript on jurisdictional grounds, but not on the merits. In January 2022, the judge granted PharmacyChecker's request to transfer the LegitScript case to the U.S. District Court in Oregon. In July 2022, the Oregon court denied LegitScript's motion to dismiss. Companies ordered to stop selling mole- and skin-tag-removal products.

The website states that the company's products are available through \"10,000+ Dental/Medical Practices & Pharmacies.\" The online provider directory contains about 2,400 dentists. Tatch patented the Oral Recovery Kit in 2017 [5]. StellaLife's products are manufactured by [Homeocare Laboratories, Inc](https://fda.report/DailyMed/b701234a-0bd2-16d3-e053-2995a90a5b13)., of Yonkers, New York, which has received FDA warning letters in 2017 and 2020. both letters expressed concern about whether the company had adequate controls in place to evaluate the quality and safety of various homeopathic products before releasing them to the public. These letters were issued beforeHomeocare began manufacturing products for StellaLife. StellaLife's \"Research\" The \"Research\" page of StellaLife's website states that the company conducts \"high-quality research\" on all of its products [6]. The page lists 40 publications that supposedly support the use of its oral recovery products. To test whether a product works it is necessary to do properly designed studies that compare what happens to people who use it and people who do not (controls). Simply describing what happened in an uncontrolled study is not enough because improvement may have been due to the body's normal recovery processes. Proper design must ensure that the experimental and control groups are similar and that participants are \"blinded\" (don't know which group they are in) so that observer biases do not influence what they report. None of the 40 studies met these standards. - Twenty-four reports briefly described what happened at various times when one or more patients were treated. Eighteen involved just one case. Fourteen were authored by Dr. Tatch. To demonstrate effectiveness, it is necessary to compare treated and untreated patients, which case reports do not do. - Eight of the studies were conducted on cell or bacterial preparations in a laboratory. Laboratory studies cannot demonstrate that a product will work in humans. Stellalife's website states: \"Antimicrobial products such as the all-natural VEGA Oral Care Recovery Kit (StellaLife) specifically targets the anaerobic bacteria that cause periodontal disease and tooth decay. Research performed by StellaLife found that use of VEGA Oral Rinse reduced anaerobic bacterial loads by approximately 50% for up to 3 hours.\" [7] However, this description fails to mention that the claim is based on research done with [agar plates](https://www.rcpath.org/uploads/assets/05e95d6a-95e1-4d00-a8d737827a85314a/5-Agar-Plate.pdf), not people. - Three of the references were discussions that contained no patient data. - Two of the articles had no relevance to the products. - One article was a chart review in which Dr. Tatch compared the number of narcotic prescriptions filled by patients before and after dentists began using a protocol that included StellaLife's kit. No data were available on actual patient pain levels or outcome or even whether they took the prescribed pills. Tatch merely assumed that (a) patients did better because they filled fewer prescriptions for narcotics and (b) StellaLife's inclusion was responsible the assumed benefit even though the protocol included non-narcotic painkillers. The article included a conflict-of-interest statement that \"Dr. Tatch owns shares in the StellaLife company.\" But it did not disclose how much stock he owns, his patent ownership, his membership on the board, or his wife's involvement with the company. - One article was a small clinical trial that compared what happened to patients who used a StellaLife protocol with patients who did not. The study was controlled, but (a) their were only 20 patients in each group, (b) the groups may not have been properly randomized and the resultant differences could have affected the outcome, (c) six people dropped out of the StellaLife group, a fact that was not adequately explained, (d) there was no blinding\u2014both doctors and patients knew which group they were in, which could have influenced what they observed and reported. Homeopathic Puffery StellaLife actually admits that its claims are not evidence-based. Many of its web pages and marketing materials include a footnote that says: \"Claims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence.\" But, like all manufacturers who use this disclaimer, StellaLife fails to say that \"traditional homeopathic practice\" does not have the slightest basis in reality [8]. Homeopathy asserts that (a) substances that can produce symptoms in healthy people can cure illnesses that have similar symptoms and (b) the more dilute the product, the more potent it is. These assertions are false, and the most exhaustive review of homeopathic research has concluded that homeopathy has not been proven beneficial for any health problem [9]. In fact, the vast majority of homeopathic ingredients have never even been tested for effectiveness. The FDA tolerates the sale of homeopathic products as long as their ingredients are listed (monographed) in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeiea of the United States (HPUS) and the products are not claimed to be effective against serious diseases such as cancer. StellaLife claims that substances listed in the HPUS \"have been reviewed for homeopathic efficacy, toxicology, adverse effects and clinical use.\" [10] That description is false. HPUS monographs say nothing about the alleged medicinal purposes of the ingredients. They merely say how to prepare the ingredients from the raw materials [11]. FDA Registration? The footers of StellaLife's web pages include an image that says \"FDA REGISTERED.\" The image, shown to the right, includes an FDA logo, I believe that such use is improper. The FDA logo is for official use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA objects to private sector use because it might suggest that agency favors or endorses a compoany or its products, which the FDA does not and cannot do. Unauthorized use of the FDA logo may violate federal law and subject those responsible to civil and/or criminal liability [12]. StellaLife's use of this image may be additionally misleading. All companies that manufacture drug products are required to register with the FDA. Registration merely means that the company has told the FDA that it exists and what products it markets. It does not mean that the company or its products have met any standards if safety or effectiveness. American Dental Association Notified In October 2021, The Center for Inquiry expressed concern to the American Dental Association (ADA) that dentists were recommending Stellalife products to their patients [13]. The ADA president replied: Your request that the ADA remind its membership that product and treatment recommendations, especially homeopathic products, need to follow the tenets of the ADA Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct, has been forwarded to the ADA agency vested with the responsibility for ethics and professionalism, the Council on Ethics, Bylaws and Judicial Affairs. I have also requested that the Council assess the need for any such reminders, subject to any applicable legal and regulatory constraints that may apply [14]. In June 2022, I asked the ADA whether it planned to do anything to protect its members and the general public from being misled about the Oral Recovery Kit. Its president replied that his organization lacked the resources needed to evaluate the validity of my concerns and therefore would do nothing [15]. The Bottom Line There is no published scientific evidence or logical reason to believe that the homeopathic ingredients in StellaLife's Oral Recovery kit produce any medicinal benefit, \"promote oral health,\" or \"promote a lifetime of good health or well-being.\" It's possible that the kit's non-homeopathic ingredients provide a rinsing or covering action that can lessen post-surgical discomfort. Even if this were so, it would not justify paying $89.70 for any such product. References [Company profile](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0870/0750/files/Company_Profile_011321.pdf?v=1610647384).
