The providers listed in Attachment A would be funded using Measure A Base allocations. Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) requests your Board to approve Master Contract Amendments and Standard Services Agreement with various providers to provide essential medical, mental health, public health and/or substance abuse services. HCSA also requests your Board to authorize the Director of Health Care AGENDA ____ _ July 9 , 2019 The Honorable Board of Supervisors June 17, 2019 Page 2 of 4 Services Agency or her designee to execute Master Contract Amendments and Standard Services Agreements approved as to form by County Couns el, and send originals to the Clerk of the Board for filing . Also included in the three -year base allocation was $150,000 in Measure A funds, referred to as the Measure A health care services discretionary funds, per Supervisory District each fiscal year to address a myriad of critical health care needs that require immediate attention. Each Board office selects providers to receive the discretionary funds and works with HCSA to ensure that all selected programs comply with the Measure A ordinance and are approved by the full Board. Alameda County Pharmacist Association , led by Dr. Pamela Gumbs and Dr. Aglaia Panos, both licensed pharmacists, has a deep -seated commitment to promote health, prevent of substance abuse, provide education, and promote equity . Measure A funding will assist Alameda County Pharmacist Association in providing services to accomplish the following objectives: 1) reduce/prevent opioid misuse through education of appropriate opioid usage ; 2) promote harm reduction through the use of Naloxone ; 3) reduce/prevent nicotine addiction among the youth ; 4) promote appropriate usage of cannabis including regulations governing age ; and 5) conduct drug utilization reviews and medication therapy management . Your Board's approval of the Measure A health care services discretionary funds from District 4 in the amount $4,150 shall support education focused on drug abuse and misuse of prescription medication to Alameda County residents. Approval of this request would also allow the Auditor- Controller' s Agency to process the payment in the amount of $4,150 to the Alameda County Pharmacist Association for their public health education services. St. Rose Hospital is an independent community hospital located in Hayward that has provided critical safety -net services to the residents of Southern and Central Alameda County for over 50 years. St. Rose Hospital has for years experienced financial difficulties because it serves a large proportion of Medi- Cal and uninsured patients. In Fiscal Year 2017 -2018, app roximately 40% of inpatient utilization was Medi- Cal and 2.6% was uninsured. St. Rose Hospital receives a Measure A base allocation which was $1.5 million per year as part of the Measure A three- year plan (FY 16 -17 through FY 18 -19). The new Measure A three -year plan includes a $3.5 million augmentation for St. Rose Hospital, resulting in a $5 million base allocation per year beginning FY 19 -20 through FY 21 -22. One significant supplemental Medi- Cal payment program is the Private Hospital Supplemental Fu nd (PHSF) IGT. Intergovernmental Transfers (I GTs) leverage locally -generated funding to draw a federal match of 100 percent. Since FY 2004 -2005, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) has contributed $1.5 million annually to the PHSF IGT to benefit St. Rose, resulting in annual funding of $3 million. In FY 2014 -2015 Alameda County HCSA obtain ed State and federal approval to increase the federal payment maximum to $16 million. This maximum was reduced to $10 million in FY 2016 -2017 and FY 2017-2018. In FY 2018- 2019, the federal payment maximum was increased back to $16 million. Over the last 15 years, HCSA has allocated nearly $64 million to St. Rose, leveraging nearly $47 million in federal funding for total allocations to St. Rose of over $110 million. On June 5 , 2018, your Board approved $1 million Measure A one -time funds to match the City of Hayward's $1 million allocation and $2 million Measure A one -time funds to match the Kaiser Permanent Foundation, for a total of the $3 million in Measure A funding to support St. Rose Hospital in FY 2017-2018. Also on June 4, 2019, your Board approved $3.5 million in one -time Measure A funding and adopted a resolution to certify that the $3.5 million in funding as the non -federal share is available for the FY 2018 -2019 Private Hospital Supplemental Fund Intergovernmental Transfer. These Measure A one- time funds will not factor into the management fee of 3.75% of the net operating revenues that St. Rose pays Alecto Healthcare Services. D ue to longer than exp ected negotiations with the S tate, St. Rose Hospital did not complete the IGT in FY 2017 -2018 or FY 2018- 2019 . The Honorable Board of Supervisors June 17, 2019 Page 3 of 4 Your Board is requested to authorize the reallocation of the $1.5 million Measure A base allocation in FY 2018 - 2019 and the $6.5 million in Meas ure A one-time funds approved for use in FY 2017 -2018 and FY 2018 -2019 to be used FY 2019 -2020. Upon the Board's approval , HCSA will send the entire $8 million non -federal share requirement that will yield the $16 million maximum payment to St. Rose Hos pital in FY 2019 -2020. SELECTION CRITERIA AND PROCESS Alameda Boys & Girls Club, Inc., Center for Early Intervention on Deafness, Center for Elders Independence, Multicultural Institute, Preventive Care Pathways, Street Level Health Project, and City of San Leandro were selected through a public hearing process held on 1/24/11 in the Board of Supervisors' Chambers at 1221 Oak Street, Oakland, CA 94612. The selection process included reviewing a recommendation of providers and funding allocation submitted by HCSA , the public hearing on 1/24/11, and Board approval on 4/12/11. The Board of Supervisors reauthorized this base allocation and providers list on 11/6/12 and most recently at the 12/8/15 Board meeting. Measure A base allocations for the most recent three -year funding cycle, which started in FY 2016 -2017 and ended FY 18 -19, included the continuation of long- term base allocations such as Alameda Boys and Girls Club, Inc., Center for Early Intervention on Deafness, and the City of San Leandro to provide continued critical health care services and prioritiz ed services in underinvested areas or areas experiencing declining funding using existing needs assessment processes. Multicultural Institute and Street Level Health Project were identified as provider s serving a unique population, described as \"Health Services for Day Laborers\" in the Measure A budget. The allocation to Preventive Care Pathways is identified as \"Direct Medical and Support Services (Oakland)\" in the Measure A budget. In 2006, HCSA and the Probation Department jointly designed medical services to be offered at the new Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center. It was determined that integrated health services would be provided, and an informal procurement was conducted looking at the follo wing criteria: quality of services, cost of service, reporting and data collection capacity; experience with at -risk youth; and expertise with youth and young adults in the justice system. Niroga Institute was selected because 1) its business model makes i t one of the few affordable providers of integrated practice, 2) its commitment to careful evaluation and data- driven analysis was unique among providers surveyed, 3) it had demonstrated effectiveness in serving youth and young adults involved with the Juv enile Justice system, and 4) it was the only local provider of these services with a demonstrated track record with at -risk youth. This allocation is identified as \"Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Health Services\" in the Measure A budget. LifeLong Medi cal Care was selected as the contractor for the Heart to Heart Program based on a review by representatives of the HCSA , Board of Supervisors District 5, and the City of Berkeley Health Officer. LifeLong secured start -up funding for the program, was experi enced in delivering chronic disease prevention services in the target community, and proposed a model of prevention that integrated primary care best practice, community empowerment, and resident engagement. Alameda County Pharmacist Association was sele cted by District 4 under the Board of Supervisor 's Measure A allocation. HCSA worked directly with District 4's Office to ensure that the program services comply with the Measure A ordinance and are approved by the full Board of Supervisors. All providers , except for the City of San Leandro, are non- profit, community -based organizations providing direct services to County residents and are exempt from the requirements of the Alameda County Small, Local and The Honorable Board of Supervisors June 17, 2019 Page 4 of 4 Emerging Business (SLEB) Program. The City of San Leandro is a government entity and is therefore exempt from the requirements of the SLEB Program. FINANCING Funding for these recommendations comes from Measure A and is included in the Fiscal Year 2019- 2020 Final Budget. A budget adjustment is requested to transfer $6.5 million in appropriation from Discretionary Services and Supplies (610000) to Other Charges ( 640000 ), where the IGT will be expensed. Approval of these recommendations and associated budget adjustments will have no impact on net County co sts. VISION 2026 GOAL Maintaining critical safety net medical services for vulnerable populations in Alameda County meets the 10x goal pathways of Healthcare for All in support of our shared vision of a Thriving and Resilient Population.

The clients are eligible and will continue receiving meals and daily checkins as long as their status remains the same.

Contracted Services The Multicultural Institute (MI) (\"Contractor\") shall provide Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) with services that conform to the Measure A Ordinance, which provides emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health and substance abuse services to indigent, lowincome and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors and other residents of Alameda County. MI was incorporated as a 501(c) (3) nonprofit in 1995. Its mission is to accompany immigrants in their transition from poverty and isolation to workforce participation and prosperity. With its health services provided through the Life Skills/Day Laborer Program, MI aims for overall health wellness and strives to be a key instrument of health awareness and prevention. Contractor shall provide Alameda County Health Care Services Agency as follows: bridging the cultural, logistical, language, and other gaps that exist as obstacles to many Latino immigrant low income residents seeking health care services; offering culturally and language appropriate information and resources on health conditions and their common causes along with healthy best practices. Health related services and prevention resources are also offered on topics that are a need to the population served. MI concretely aids individuals and prevents emergencies through the timely resolution of smaller health problems. III. Program Information and Requirements A. Program Goals Contractor shall provide services to accomplish the following goals: 1.

More than 50% of the individuals served are Guatemalan with Mexican being the second largest racial ethnic group. Nearly 99% of individuals served are monolingual Spanish speakers. This makes it difficult for them to have access to certain services offered by the health system, a system that is hard to maneuver regardless of the language one speaks.

The outreach team does morning street outreach 5 days a week and 34 hours a day. The following MI health services are offered out on the street where day laborers congregate making resources more accessible to them while they look for work: (1) Health care referrals and patient navigation support; (2) Health education and public health promotion workshops on various topics (e.g., occupational health/safety, sexual health, oral health, substance abuse, and diabetes) along with health care program enrollment; (3) Health care treatment and services (e.g., medical, optometric and mental health services) through partnerships with providers and /or contracting such services; (4) Health education and public health promotion workshops on nutrition, and health education; and (5) Hosting the Alameda County Health Care for the Homeless Mobile Van onsite biweekly, whom offers services/referrals to day laborers and other homeless individuals. 2.

The Street Level Health Project community center is an entry point to the health care and social service system for those most often overlooked and neglected, namely the uninsured, underinsured, and recently arrived. Founded in 2002 by two premed students, Street Level Health Project has become the \"safety net of the safety net\", and serves as a critical entry point in the health care and social service system for the medically uninsured. Programs include: Health Access Program, where clients are connected to local health care providers and offered basic health care; Immigrant Rights and Empowerment, where health and safety trainings, job referrals, and leadership development opportunities are offered; and the Wellness and Prevention Program, where staff improve health by providing educating, case management, food access program.
