Subscribe to Our Newsletter you are reading this, we believe that you or one of your loved one is suffering from cancer and trying their best to deal with it. However, with advances in treatments, there's hope. Chemotherapy is one form of treatment offered to cancer patients where chemicals or drugs are used to kill the malignant cells. The downside of the treatment is even healthy cells die in the process. While there are a lot of precautions, advice and counselling given to people while on chemo, most of the time a person is unaware about how to deal with the treatment. Here, Dr Meghal Shangvi, onco-surgeon from Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai, tells you the dos and don ts to follow during chemotherapy. Here are [13 foods that help to fight cancer. ](https://www.thehealthsite.com/photo-gallery/diseases-conditions-foods-for-cancer-to-prevent-cancer-and-diet-for-cancer-patients-d815-319584/) 1. Maintain high standard of hygiene When the chemicals and drugs do their job of killing the diseased cells, they also kill the healthy cells like RBCs and WBCs, making your immunity go weak. This makes you prone to infections and diseases. So maintain good hygiene, whether it s your personal health or your eating habits. You just can t take a chance. Here are a few hygiene tips to follow: 2. Avoid crowded places Not that you should not be socialising while on chemotherapy, but know that you are not at the best of your health. Going to crowded places like a mall, theatre or even a house party can increase your chances of catching an infection. Instead, go to parks or open grounds for a stroll and get fresh dose of oxygen that can help you feel better and boost your immunity. Avoid places that are highly polluted. Here are [nine healthy habits that can reduce your risk of cancer.](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/habits-that-can-reduce-your-risk-of-cancer-d1215-354103/) 3. Avoid sharing your items with family [Cancer](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/cancer/) is not contagious, but it makes sense to avoid sharing your utensils and other personal stuff like towel, napkin, etc., with your family. This is because you might have a tendency to catch an infection if your personal items are shared with others. 4. Look for antioxidants from natural sources While your body s immune response is at an all time low, it is important for you to replenish it with food and the right kind of antioxidants to get healthy. Eat fruits, juices, herbs like ginger, garlic and aloe vera that reduce inflammation and also help your body to respond better to the drugs. Don t forget the berries and herbal teas which can also help. However, always have a detailed discussion with a dietician about the right foods to eat. Here is [what a cancer patient should eat during and after treatment.](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diet-for-cancer-patients-during-and-after-treatment-p214-116904/) 5. Take your medications on time One of the biggest worries of chemotherapy is the side effects that one has to face. However, medications are always prescribed to help one deal with the side effects. Stopping medications mid-way could be a big blunder. So, even if you don t feel nauseated, it is better to pop your pill (if you have not completed the dosage given for the days) and not stop it abruptly just because you don t experience the symptoms. 6. Stay activeb Surely you do not have the strength and stamina to go for a jog, run or gym, but keep yourself active to boost circulation and help your body regain the vigour. Even a stroll in your living room will do. 7. Notice the signs of infection Apart from fever, there can be a number of signs that could indicate an infection cold and cough, stiffness in the neck, sore throat, nasal congestion, soreness and redness in your surgical area, diarrhoea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, vaginal discharge, increased urination, pain while urinating are just a few to name. Unless you learn about these symptoms beforehand, you will not know how to communicate these with your doctor and when to ask for help. In any case, during chemotherapy, never ignore any unusual symptom that you might face and report it to your doctor. Here are [some of the side effects of chemotherapy.](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/what-is-chemotherapy-and-what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-treatment-104752/) 8. Talk to your doctor often This is more for a caregiver to do than the patient. But even for your caregiver to know what to ask and what to talk with your doctor, confide about everything. If you can t talk about your problems right away, make notes and carry it along to the clinic during your appointment. 9. Go for counselling It is possible that you suffer from mood swings or depression during this phase. If you find yourself feeling weak, irritable or uneasy most of the times, seek the help of a counsellor. 10. Maintain a positive attitude Of course, you are not at the best of your time but know that feeling dejected or negative isn t going to make things any better. Remember, people around you and your loved ones are putting in equal efforts to help you sail through this phase. So, don t give up hope just yet. Smile, breathe and stay calm.
