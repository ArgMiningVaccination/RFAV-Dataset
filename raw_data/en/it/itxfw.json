This Issue's articles focus on the racial, ethnic, and gender disparities that are rampant within the United States' healthcare system. The Spring 2021 Advance Directive Issue will dive into a broad spectrum of topics within the current conversation taking place in the United States surrounding racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities. These issues have been brought to the forefront of healthcare discussion by recent events including the COVID-19 pandemic and racial unrest. This Issue addresses health disparities that have an adverse impact on populations that experience systemic obstacles in accessing quality healthcare in the United States. This Issue also aims to evaluate the constitutionality of state and federal responses to current and future health crises. Additionally, this Issue proposes novel ways to fund healthcare programs using tax dollars. Further, the Issue discusses the impact of racism and discrimination in both accessing and receiving culturally competent care. Finally, this Issue draws attention to the use of current technology to reduce disparities commonly seen in the healthcare system. The range of topics covered in this Issue exemplifies the widespread failure of the United States healthcare system in addressing racial, ethnic, and gender disparities.

INTRODUCTION It is well documented that systemic health and social inequalities have put many individuals belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of being exposed to and dying from COVID-19.1 Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.2 For individuals that belong to racial and ethnic minority groups, inequalities in social determinants of health are interrelated and create barriers that prevent them from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional help. COVID-19 has amplified the effect of these disparities.3 Now, after nearly a year of social distancing, a vaccine has been authorized and has kicked off the most urgent mass immunization campaign since polio shots were rolled out in the 1950s.4 In the race to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19, there are growing concerns about racial and 1 Health Equity Considerations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups, CTRS.

Additionally, the federal government has left it up to the states to decide on their own plan for which groups of people will be vaccinated first.10 For these reasons, this article will not address policies and legislation that should be implemented 5 Ari Shapiro, Early Data Shows Striking Racial Disparities In Who's Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, NPR (Jan. 28, 2021), https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/28/961703505/early-data-shows-striking-racial-disparities-in-whos-getting-the-covid-19-vaccin. 6 Id. 7 Samantha Artiga & Jennifer Kates, Addressing Racial Equity in Vaccine Distribution, KAISER FAM.

Instead, this article will focus on steps that states can take on a local level. On a state and local level, vaccination disparities can be addressed by greater implementation of evidence-based interventions, including the use of reminder/recall systems, standing orders for vaccinations, regular assessments of vaccination coverage levels among provider practices, vaccination registries, and improving public and provider awareness of the importance of vaccination. Multi-sector collaborations including culturally relevant communications to reach specific target populations are important parts of reducing vaccination and health disparities, generally. While systemic health and social inequalities may seem insurmountable, there are a variety of policies and steps that can be implemented to mitigate the growing disparity in COVID-19 vaccination levels across racial and ethnic groups. II. A HISTORY OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN VACCINATION RATES Disparities in vaccination levels among racial and ethnic groups are not novel.11 In 2014, the 2012 National Health Interview Survey was analyzed to assess adult vaccination by race and ethnicity for six vaccines routinely recommended for adults.12 Vaccination coverage was substantially lower among African Americans and Asian Americans when compared to white Americans.13 Factors like age, education, insurance coverage, usual place of care, and number of physician visits were independently associated with the receipt of a vaccine.14 After taking these factors into account, the study showed that racial and ethnic differences narrowed, but gaps still remained.15 11 See generally Peng-jun Lu et al., Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Vaccination Coverage Among Adult Populations in the U.S., 49 AM.

In addition to these inequalities, another contributing factor is difference in the level of trust placed on physicians and the healthcare system among racial and ethnic groups.16 Trust is a key component in the physician-patient relationship.17 In healthcare, trust in physicians is generally defined as the belief that the physician will act in your best interest and that the physician is honest and competent.18 It is commonly believed that trust in physicians has declined over the past forty years in the United States.19 This decline can be attributed to the growth of for-profit healthcare, prior episodes of unethical research, malpractice, and publicity surrounding medical errors.20 This distrust has centered on the African American population because of the long history of negative treatment and abuse of African Americans dating back to slave experimentation and including the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.21 Researchers for the American Journal for Public Health conducted a study to examine the differences in physician trust among racial groups and found distrust of physicians was higher among African Americans and Hispanics than among Whites.22 III.

In Illinois more than four million vaccinations have been administered so far.27 In Chicago, the vaccination rate in majority-Black or Latino ZIP codes has averaged five percent while majority-White ZIP codes have averaged thirteen percent.28 Mayor Lori Lightfoot has repeatedly acknowledged the long history of distrust of vaccines in the African American community and plans to implement an equitable inoculation campaign in the parts of the city that have been hit hardest by the virus.29 Still, recent polls conducted in Chicago indicate that only twenty-four percent of African Americans and thirty-five percent of Hispanics plan to get the new vaccine, while fifty-three percent of white residents said they plan to get inoculated.30 Based on this data, it is clear that public outreach campaigns 23 Frequently Asked Questions about Vaccination, supra note 10. 24 COVID-19 Vaccination Program Operational Guidance, CTRS.

Once the vaccine is widely available to the public, vaccine providers will play a key role in insuring vaccines reach all patients who need them.31 Local and state officials need to ensure that providers are implementing systems and programs that provide effective vaccine delivery and maintain coverage in their practices.32 Currently the CDC is working with state and local health agencies to administer a quality improvement program to introduce and sustain new or improved immunization practices.33 These programs are intended to motivate health professionals to try new immunization service delivery strategies and incorporate changes into their practices.34 In order to reduce disparities in vaccine coverage, routine monitoring and reporting of vaccine coverage by race, ethnicity, and other socio-demographic factors might be needed.35 Combating distrust of physicians will not be an easy task, but it is crucial towards bridging the vaccination gap. There are several ways in which healthcare providers can implement patient-focused vaccination strategies within their own practices.36 A strong recommendation by a health care provider is still one of the most powerful motivators for patients to comply with a vaccination.37 Research has shown the way a healthcare professional approaches a vaccination recommendation makes a difference.38 When the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, (Dec. 19, 2020), https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-vaccine-black-latino-20201219-x6wlkklgqzbunovx5jub4w4dwi-story.html. 31 Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers, CTRS.

Another way to combat physician distrust is by creating a \"culture of immunization\" within a practice.43 According to the CDC, one way to accomplish this goal is designate an immunization coordinator.44 This individual would be the provider site's point person for all immunization activities including ensuring all staff know how to address questions from patients to maintain consistent messaging about vaccinations and promoting and motivating staff implementation of vaccination quality improvement strategies.45 The immunization coordinator would also be responsible for setting up a system for vaccination reminders that help their fellow providers remember to recommend vaccinations.46 In the United States, the general public may begin to have access to the vaccine by as early as April 2021.47 Most states are still prioritizing who will 39 Id. 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Id. 43 Id. 44 See id.

From examining the history of disparity among vaccinations it is clear that a tailored approach and multi-sector collaborations that include culturally relevant communications to reach specific target populations is necessary. These approaches can be effective interventions that play a crucial rule in reducing vaccine disparities. At the time of this writing, most states are still trying to get the vaccine to those in the first recommended phases of the rollout: healthcare workers, individuals over the age of seventy-five, and frontline essential workers.50 In the coming months, state and local officials will bear much of the responsibility for distributing the vaccine.51 Funding will be critical for vaccine storage, public education, and vaccine transportation.52 Promoting equality in the vaccination will require investment and resources to ensure that outreach to minority groups is effective.53 In addition to better funding, there are additional steps that the states can take individually. It is unlikely that the federal government or the state governments will mandate vaccination.54 So, the states may need to consider 48 How Are States Prioritizing Who Will Get the COVID-19 Vaccine First?, KAISER FAM.

CONCLUSION Social determinants of health and distrust of vaccinations and physicians are significant barriers to combating vaccination disparities among racial and ethnic groups. State and local governments will have the greatest responsibility when it comes to combating these disparities. Culturally relevant communications that are designed to reach targeted groups will be an effective way to reduce vaccination disparities. In addition to these efforts, it is critical that healthcare providers and physicians are implementing best practices for vaccination, to create an \"culture of immunization.\" Implementation of these evidence-based interventions will help spread awareness about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination. 55 Id. 56 Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers, supra note 31. 110 Advance Directive Vol. 30 111 Importance of Improved Privacy and Security Regulations Regarding Telehealth in Order to Better Ensure the Safety of Information Given From Undocumented Hispanic Immigrants to Healthcare Professionals Anne Bohnert I. INTRODUCTION With healthcare spending on the rise, and no obvious way to prevent it, policymakers are looking to telehealth as a way to cut back costs while also increasing access to care for many.1 Telehealth uses technology in order to facilitate remote communication between the patient and healthcare provider.2 The idea behind telehealth is that it will help to improve areas of medicine such as education and self-management, as well as make specialists available to those who may live in remote areas or far away from the specialist they need.3 Not only will there be easier access to care, but the use of telehealth also enables physicians to track information about the patient such as glucose monitoring, sleep patterns, and lung function, through wearable devices.4 The ultimate goal is for telehealth to be a convenient and cost-efficient route to receive care, especially for those from underserved communities and backgrounds.5 1 Sydne Enlund & Caroline Vesey, Increasing Access to Health Care Through Telehealth, NATL.

This article will begin by discussing current regulations in telehealth as well as undocumented Hispanic immigrant's history navigating the health care system. This article will then provide an explanation as to why increased regulations in telehealth are needed for Hispanic immigrants. Lastly, this article will discuss and propose ways to help improve the privacy and safety surrounding telehealth for the Hispanic immigrant population. II. CURRENT REGULATIONS REGARDING TELEHEALTH In the early months of 2020, the healthcare industry understood the importance of utilizing telemedicine in responding to the COVID-19 public health emergency.8 The technology to implement it has been around for a while, however, prior to COVID-19, physicians were not appropriately reimbursed for providing telemedicine.9 For example, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, the patient must first have an in-person visit with the physician.10 Even after having the initial visit face-to-face, physician's 6 Altaf Saadi & Jorge A.

Many in the healthcare industry believe protocols such as these relaxed HIPAA regulations will revert back to its original guidelines once the pandemic has subsided and life goes back to \"normal.\"16 This leads one to question whether the uptick in the use of telehealth will continue after COVID-19 has subsided, or if telehealth usage will decrease due to the countless regulations that make it a daunting but a much safer route for physicians to communicate with their patients.17 Even without these relaxed regulations, there are many concerns regarding the security and privacy of information being discussed during a telehealth 11 Id. 12 Id. 13 U.S. DEPT.

UNDOCUMENTED HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS HISTORY WITH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM In March of 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in the hopes of bettering the healthcare system in the United States.35 Although this was a great benefit for many Hispanic immigrants who were now eligible for healthcare coverage, the process of applying was complex and confusing for most due to obstacles such as language barriers.36 Even with translation, many had never heard most of the complex words and terminologies that make up the insurance industry.37 In addition to these barriers, immigrants in the U.S. had another major concern: deportation. 38 Authors Karen Hacker, Maria Anies and Leah Zallman compiled sixty-six published articles and concluded sixty-five percent of the articles mentioned deportation as a barrier due to the fear of authorities being notified that an undocumented immigrant was being taken care of at the hospital.39 Still, several other barriers included an inability to find necessary transportation as well as a fear of being fired if they miss work for an appointment.40 All of these fears have been exacerbated by the changes being made to the public charge rule under our past administration, which makes immigrants ineligible for lawful permanent residence (LPR) status.41 An undocumented immigrant is considered a public charge if they receive at least one public benefit for more than twelve months within a three-year period.42 The list of 35 Inst.

Many fail to realize that different cultures are going to place an importance on different areas of telehealth.54 For example, a Hispanic undocumented immigrant may place a much larger importance on the privacy of their conversations with a physician, compared to a legal citizen, who may not worry about the small likelihood of someone hacking into their medical information. Because of this, there is a great need to explore telehealth from the perspective of all cultures, including American citizens as well as undocumented immigrants.55 Other potential stressors for undocumented immigrants include whether the process will be easy and straightforward, if they will have someone to converse with that speaks their language, as well as having access to a safe and reliable internet source.56 49 Saadi & Rodriguez, supra note 6. 50 Id. 51 Id. 52 Id. 53 Id. 54 Ann Blandford et al., Opportunities and Challenges for Telehealth Within, and Beyond, a Pandemic, 8 LANCET 1364, 1365 (2020). 55 Id. 56 Id. 2021 Privacy Regulations for Telehealth 119 V. PROPOSED WAYS TO IMPROVE PRIVACY AND SECURITY REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS An increase in the regulations will allow for many immigrants, including Hispanic immigrants, to feel a sense of safety when utilizing new technology such as telehealth. COVID-19 has brought much attention to the lack of protection guaranteed to undocumented immigrants who utilize these services.57 Dr. John Emdur, a doctor in Colorado, began a non-profit called Clinica Colorado, to give undocumented immigrants access to volunteer doctors and medical students via telehealth.58 This organization promises safe, free access, to bi-lingual health care providers who are HIPAA compliant.59 This service, which will remain after the pandemic is over, gives undocumented immigrants in Colorado somewhere to turn to where they are not afraid that deportation is going to be the end result of a health scare.60 This program has helped to prevent surges in the health care system and has been used to educate immigrants on when it is appropriate and necessary to go to the emergency room.61 Non-profits, such as the one mentioned above, give hope that more options like that will be made available to undocumented immigrants moving forward in other states as well. Telehealth is not just a cost-effective way to give immigrants the medical services that they need, but it can also be a great route for preventative care and education.62 Lack of knowledge regarding proper treatment is an issue for immigrants.63 Cultural beliefs and practices, 57 Id. at 1364. 58 Georgia Perry, Clinica Colorado Provides Telehealth Services to Undocumented Immigrants, DENVER'S MILE HIGH MAGAZINE, (May 2020), https://www.5280.com/2020/05/clinica-colorado-provides-telehealth-services-to-undocumented-immigrants/. 59 Id. 60 Id. 61 Id. 62 Alejandro Portes et al., The U.S Health System and Immigration: An Institutional Interpretation, NAT'L INST.

There are many important steps to ensuring this safety. One topic discussed is the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) when logging in to meet with a healthcare provider.69 It has been proven that having MFA prevents 99.9% of hackers from hacking into your personal information.70 By using MFA, instead of simply asking for a username and password to enter a telehealth appointment, the patient would need to answer an additional security question or enter a code given from the physicians' 64 Id. 65 Id. 66 Id. 67 Id. 68 Id. 69 Jessica Davis, Must-Have Telehealth, Remote Work Privacy and Security for COVID-19, HEALTHITSECURITY, (March 31, 2020), https://healthitsecurity.com/news/must-have-telehealth-remote-work-privacy-and-security-for-covid-19. 70 Id. 2021 Privacy Regulations for Telehealth 121 office.71 This would help to reduce unauthorized individuals from obtaining confidential patient information.72 Another well-liked idea is to dictate how much access clients have available to them based on what type of device they are using for the telehealth appointment.73 For example, if using FaceTime on their phone, a patient may only be able to have the conversation, whereas if they are using a healthcare app on their laptop, they would have access to information such as their health history.74 Another relevant factor is education for both provider and patient.75 Providers need to make sure that all employees have a baseline understanding of how to use the applications in order to ensure that they keep patient information confidential and do not end up sharing information with the wrong person.76 Patients also need to be educated on how they can help to make sure their information stays confidential.77 One way they could make sure education is received on both ends would be to require all workers to receive proper education as well as requiring patients to watch an educational video prior to beginning the use to telehealth. Not only is the lack of privacy and security a common concern for all, but it is one of the biggest worries of undocumented immigrants.78 As mentioned throughout this article, immigrants fear that law enforcement will be able to access the information they share with providers via telehealth.79 In order to help ease the concerns of immigrants, healthcare providers utilizing telehealth should be required to inform patients of the risks associated with 71 Id. 72 Id. 73 Id. 74 Id. 75 Mike Miliard, Telehealth Privacy and Security: Investment and Education are Key, Attorney Says, HEALTHCARE IT NEWS, (June 25, 2020), https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/telehealth-privacy-and-security-investment-and-education-are-key-attorney-says. 76 Id. 77 Id. 78 Saadi & Rodriguez, supra note 6. 79 Id. 122 Advance Directive Vol. 30 using telehealth to ensure they are properly informed.80 This will help to ensure that there is a level of trust between patient and provider.81 Groups such as undocumented immigrants, who could benefit greatly from telehealth, must be a top priority as organizations and healthcare facilities begin to figure out ways to improve the current system.82 VI. CONCLUSION There are a lot of obstacles to navigate in order to be able to properly and efficiently utilize telehealth now and in the future. Undocumented Hispanic immigrants make up a large proportion of people who could greatly benefit from the usage of telehealth. From being able to speak with physicians without having to find transportation or miss work, to being able to watch videos in their native languages to educate themselves, there is a lot of great that could come from the increased use of telehealth. Before telehealth can be further implemented, there are many issues within privacy and security that need to be assessed, and it is key that groups such as immigrants are of upmost concern when discussing ways to improve the system as a whole. 80 Id. 81 Id. 82 Id. 123 Equitable State Policies for Increasing Insulin Access Scott Hulver I. THE INSULIN PROBLEM Diabetes is a terrible, pervasive disease in the U.S., afflicting an estimated fifteen percent of Americans,1 and leading to a range of other health complications from kidney disease to death.2 Although not curable, diabetes is manageable thanks to insulin.3 For decades now, insulin has extended and saved millions of lives.4 However, this much-needed access to insulin is being threatened by several changes in the pharmaceutical industry and with insurance. First, the price of insulin is skyrocketing. From 2012 to 2016 alone, the average national price of insulin nearly doubled, averaging $666 per prescription in 2016.5 High costs create a large barrier to obtaining insulin; there are reports of patients rationing their insulin because they are unable to afford it.6 Second, people are losing access to insurance, a tool that can help cover the costs of insulin.7 Although the Affordable Care Act 1 Diabetes, CTRS.

Whereas about 7.5% of white people are diagnosed with diabetes, people of color are diagnosed at rates as high as twice that, with Native Americans diagnosed at a rate of 14.7%.12 Black and Hispanic populations are diagnosed at rates of 11.7% and 12.5% respectively.13 Similarly, Black people are almost twice as likely as white people to be uninsured, and Hispanic people are more than three times as likely to be uninsured.14 These rates illustrate how not only is the need for insulin higher in communities of color because of higher rates of diagnoses, communities of color also have a more difficult time than white people accessing affordable insulin because of higher uninsurance rates. State governments have long been both innovators and experimenters of healthcare policy, and policies around insulin access are no exception.15 8 Id. 9 Josh Bivens & Ben Zipperer, Health Insurance and the COVID-19 Shock, ECON.

This article will preview a selection of different state approaches to reducing the cost of insulin. This article will then analyze how these different approaches either do or do not help close racial disparities in insulin access and discuss what approach legislators should take when designing insulin access policies. II. STATE INSULIN ACCESS POLICIES As the great laboratories of the U.S., states have taken many different approaches to increasing access to insulin.19 Although price is not synonymous with access, it is the biggest barrier to insulin (be it through copays, out of pocket expenses, affording insurance, etc.).20 Accordingly, 16 Although President Trump signed several executive orders to lower the price of pharmaceuticals, these actions are seen as severely inadequate solutions to the problem.

The first is by regulating the price of insulin, where price is defined as the amount for which a drug manufacturer sells their product.21 The second way is by regulating the cost of insulin, with cost meaning the amount that a patient ends up paying to purchase insulin.22 Price and cost are often very different in the pharmaceutical world because there are so many middle distribution players who are offered discounts and rebates off the manufacturers' price, in turn selling insulin to patients at a cost lower than the list price; insurance also helps reduce the cost patients see. For instance, Eli Lilly may market a certain dosage of Humalog (its brand-name insulin) at a price of $530.40.23 However, when a patient goes to fill their prescription, the insulin might end up costing the patient between $0 and $95 (with private insurance).24 a. Price-based regulation Price-based regulations have both benefits and drawbacks to their use. One large benefit is that by regulating the price, patients are less likely to see companies compensate for losses by raising other prices the patient would 21 This is commonly known as the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). Joey Mattingly, Understanding Drug Pricing, U.S. PHARMACIST (June 20, 2012), https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/understanding-drug-pricing. 22 There is not a standard method to measure the cost patients pay, in part because there are so many variables including whether a patient is insured or uninsured, and differences of insurance formularies, etc. Charles Ornstein & Katie Thomas, Prescription Drugs May Cost More with Insurance Than Without It, N. Y.

Although Eli Lily says that most patients with private insurance would not pay more than $95 for a monthly prescription, some patients pay an average of $345 a month (depending on the formulation). Id. 2021 Insulin Access 127 have to pay.25 For instance, with a cost-based regulation that caps how much an insurance company can charge for insulin medication and supplies, such an insurance company could simply increase yearly premiums, deductibles, or other aspects of a plan to compensate for a loss of revenue. But price-based regulations target the drug manufacturer; drug manufacturers do not have other charges they can shift price increases into.26 This helps ensure that patients receive net cost savings, instead of net paying the same amount across different charges.27 A second benefit is that, by targeting the first seller, price-based regulation passes on savings to all patients, regardless of whether a patient is insured or what type of insurance they have. When a drug manufacturer has a cap on the price they can sell a drug, subsequent sales of the drug also tend to be lower.28 Thus, it will not matter whether a patient pays out of pocket or has insurance; the entity the patient buys from will have previously bought the insulin at a lower price, and savings will be passed on to the consumer.29 One caveat is price-regulation does not guarantee how much of the price savings will passed to patients. The other entities in the distribution chain - pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, etc. - are all vying for a 25 Insurance companies have many types of costs associated with coverage including monthly premiums, deductibles, and co-pays.

If a rational insurance company did not want to lose money but the copays for insulin were capped, it could raise another charge like premiums to compensate. 26 Technically, if only the price of insulin was regulated, drug manufacturers might respond by raising the cost of non-insulin medicines. However, this would likely depend on a host of other market factors. 27 For example, if the state regulates insurance companies to charge $30 less for insulin copays than they otherwise would, insurance companies could increase premiums by a multiple of $30 to balance out for the lost revenue. 28 Paul R.

Price is set by manufacturers, who are far upstream in the distribution chain; pharmaceuticals often are bought and sold by wholesale distributors, pharmacies, and others before the patient can buy the medicine.33 When a drug manufacturer first sells a particular product, the sale is unlikely to occur in the regulating state (because that first sale is not to the patient), which raises dormant commerce clause considerations.34 In practice, Maryland passed a good example of such a price-based regulation in 2017.35 The law restricted drug manufacturers from \"price-gouging\" pharmaceutical products (not limited to insulin), defined simply as an \"unconscionable increase.\"36 Although an \"unconscionable increase\" is not defined, the law requires the Maryland Attorney General to be notified when a drug's wholesale acquisition price increases more than fifty percent from the previous year, suggesting at least some of the cases the legislature 30 Health Strategies Consultancy, Follow the Pill: Understanding the U.S. Commercial Pharmaceutical Supply Chain, KAISER FAM.

Cost-based regulation Like price-based regulations, cost-based regulations have benefits and drawbacks. The biggest benefit is that this approach ensures effectiveness; cost-based regulations guarantee that patients will only be charged the regulated amount, as it fixes the amount in the sale to the patient instead of an amount higher upstream in distribution.40 Another advantage is this approach is well-established to be within states' powers to regulate; there is little risk that a cost-based regulation would be struck down in court. States have exercised this power over areas, such as housing.41 The entities involved in selling insulin directly to a patient all have a presence in the state - for instance, the pharmacy and the patient's insurance company - thereby avoiding the dormant commerce clause concerns of a price-based regulation.42 37 Md.

Frosh, 887 F.3d at 667. 130 Advance Directive Vol. 30 However, there are drawbacks to the cost-based approach, the major one being that the system is so complex it can be difficult to regulate accurately and effectively.43 First, not all patients have insurance.44 Among those covered by insurance, there are many different types of plans, each with its own formulary structure.45 There is also a large amount of variation within pharmacies (for instance, brick and mortar pharmacies versus mail order pharmacies).46 In theory it may be simple to place cost caps on these entities, but given the relationships between each other and great deal of variance, there are likely to be unintended consequences.47 For instance, an insurance company could simply raise premiums for consumers to replace any revenue lost with a price cap.48 If patients end up paying the same amount between insurance charges and the insulin itself, cost-based regulation would not be effective.49 One example of cost-based regulation is Illinois's new insulin law, which caps the amount that a patient would have to pay for a 30-day supply of insulin at $100.50 This is limited to patients who are covered by insurance, and for patients whose plans provide coverage for insulin.51 Illinois's 43 See Health Strategies Consultancy, supra note 30 (describing the complex distribution chain). 44 See e.g., Bivens & Zipperer, supra note 9 (describing how the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the number of insured people). 45 See generally, Stephane A.

A STATE LEVEL SOLUTION Before jumping into what state legislators should do, it is worth pausing to say what legislators should not do. Most importantly, state legislators should not assume that taking either a price-based approach or cost-based approach alone will fix the problem.53 Price-based regulations are difficult to implement because of where pharmaceutical entities are located and restrictions stemming from the dormant commerce clause.54 Cost-based regulations, on the other hand, do not guarantee that cost savings will actually be passed on to patients, and even if savings were, people of color are disproportionately not insured and so would not equitably benefit.55 The pharmaceutical landscape is constantly changing in the wake of scientific innovation and federal regulation,56 so any insulin policy will likely need to be flexible to adapt and multi-pronged. It is also important to note that state policy will not be a substitute for federal action; only federal regulation has the potential to regulate the price of drugs and bring the associated costs down across the healthcare system.57 52 215 ILCS 5/356z.41(g). 53 Diabetes has many associated costs besides insulin that need to be addressed.

Frosh, 887 F.3d 664, 667 (4th Cir. 2018). 132 Advance Directive Vol. 30 I propose cost-based plus regulation as the basic cost-based regulation discussed above, plus additional regulations that help eliminate the drawbacks. After all, in theory, regulating the end-cost of insulin to patients guarantees a maximum amount they will pay.58 Regulating the end cost is important to ending racial disparities in insulin access because of the disparities in insurance coverage. Insulin can be very expensive without insurance59 and if only the price were regulated, distribution entities could still drive the price up.60 There are still problems that come with this approach. For cost-based regulation, that problem is insurance agencies being incentivized to increase other costs like premiums to offset losses from a price cap. There are two additional strategies states should consider: increasing insurance coverage and aggregate buying. It would be very difficult for a state to put a price cap on the different charges of an insurance plan such that an insurer would be forced to absorb some increased cost of insulin coverage; it is simply too complex.61 But what a state can do is incentivize insurance companies to spread those cost increases out, so that individuals see cost savings. Most importantly, diabetes is a costly disease for patients not just because of insulin, but because of all the other costs and associated diseases.62 Given that people of color are both disproportionated effected by diabetes 58 Infra note 40 and accompanying text. 59 See ELI LILLY, supra note 23 (stating that \"[i]f you do not have prescription medication insurance coverage, or if your insurance does not cover Humalog, you can expect to pay close to the list price [as high as $530.14] shown above, plus any additional pharmacy charges depending on where you purchase your medicine.\"). 60 See Senate Insulin Report, supra note 31 (describing how pharmacy benefit managers have driven the price of insulin up). 61 See Key Facts: Cost Sharing Basics, CTR.

Not only does this help create equitable care, this also means insurance companies are able to increase revenues and spread out costs among more people. If, for example, a patient saves $500 a year under a cost-based regulation, but their premiums also increase $500 a year, under a cost-based plus regulation where more people are insured, patients' premiums might rise by a smaller amount. Aggregate buying is a different additional strategy that could help ensure cost-based regulations turn out to net zero savings for patients. Essentially, insurance companies would be less likely to increase other charges if insulin was cheaper to acquire. Although states cannot force drug manufacturers to sell insulin at a lower cost,64 there are things that could help put pressure on manufacturers to lower prices. One such tool is allowing entities to buy insulin together. Economics suggests that increased buyer power leads to lower prices;65 if buyers come together to negotiate and purchase insulin, they could in theory buy insulin at lower prices than if they had bought insulin separately. Another way this could be implemented is for the state to use its own buying power, through Medicaid programs. Already many states require pharmaceutical manufacturers to sign supplemental rebate agreements for the pharmaceutical company's products to be covered by Medicaid.66 States could expand these agreements to require pharmaceutical 63 Statistics About Diabetes, AM.

Regulating the cost of insulin will be insufficient to completely end racial disparities in diabetes patients; lawmakers must consider the larger context in which diabetic patients buy medicines. Diabetes usually requires much more than just insulin to treat; at a minimum, patients require devices to inject the insulin, like a syringe or a pump.67 Diabetes is also closely linked with a range of other expensive diseases to treat.68 Ensuring insulin access alone will not help patients afford treating these closely related diseases.69 One way to help cover these costs is for states to help everyone gain insurance coverage. Although insurance will not pay for all of these costs, insurance will help lower the costs for patients.70 About twelve states still have the option to make easy gains in insurance coverage by expanding Medicaid.71 Right now, the \"Medicaid gap\" population (those who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little for ACA subsidies) lack an accessible insurance option.72 If these states were to enroll in Medicaid, an estimated two million people would gain insurance coverage, making the costs of diabetes and related diseases more affordable.73 67 Insulin Injection Know-How, ASS'N OF DIABETES CARE & EDUC.

CONCLUSION The high prevalence of diabetes and exorbitant cost of treatment makes access to insulin incredibly important.74 The problem is further exacerbated by racial disparities in both diabetes diagnoses and insurance coverage.75 To increase access to insulin and decrease racial disparities, state legislators should regulate the cost of insulin to patients, in addition to expanding insurance coverage and promoting aggregate insulin purchasing.76 74 Supra notes 1-10 and accompanying text. 75 Supra notes 11-14 and accompanying text. 76 Supra Part III: A State Level Solution. 136 Advance Directive Vol. 30 137 Using mHealth to Close Racial and Ethnic Health Care Disparities: Proposals for Indiana Leanne Jossund I. INTRODUCTION Mobile health technology, also known as mHealth, refers to a vast array of wireless devices and technologies, including mobile phones.1 With smart watches and cellular devices being more widely available than before, there are additional means by which the average lay person can become actively involved in their health care.2 Blood glucose monitors, menstrual cycle trackers, activity or sleep tracking, and heart rate monitoring are just some of the many ways anyone can track their health.3 Many fitness trackers work alongside phone applications to monitor and report health information, but some of these phone applications can be utilized regardless of fitness tracker ownership.4 Some phones can track your heart rate directly on the phone, utilizing the camera or another type of sensor, allowing easy fitness and heart health tracking.5 Indiana is now positioned to employ these important and 1 Sarah Iribarren et al., What is the Economic Evidence for mHealth?

BACKGROUND The Medicaid expansion from the ACA was an important component of beginning to improve racial equity in access to care.8 In January 2015, then-governor Mike Pence reached an agreement with the Obama administration on a waiver allowing Indiana to try a form of Medicaid expansion called the Healthy Indiana Plan (\"HIP\") 2.0, an offshoot of the already existing Healthy Indiana Plan.9 HIP is a sub-plan of multiple services offered by Indiana Medicaid.10 An estimated six and a half million people in Indiana were covered by Medicaid as of 2019, and insured rates increased six percent in the state between 2013 and 2017.11 In 2013, racial and ethnic minority google-pixel-phones-will-soon-track-heart-rate-using-only-the-camera/ (describing a new phone model tracking heart rate); See also Samsung, https://www.samsung.com/us/heartratesensor/ (last visited Feb. 8, 2021) (describing how Samsung devices, both wearables and phones, can measure one's heart rate). 6 See ISDH: About Minority Health, IND.

III. PROPOSAL Indiana's OMH has numerous means of approaching this problem using mHealth including providing financial support to organizations, engaging in direct outreach, or subsidizing mHealth devices. These programs look like direct funding or grants to local health systems and organizations, subsidies, compensation to purchase or use mHealth interventions, or engagement and training Medicaid recipients on mHealth tools. Indiana should utilize its position as a state health authority to close health care access disparities, and its smaller population makes the state an excellent test ground for implementing these types of outreach methods. One way the Office could accomplish its goals is by providing additional funding to organizations and health care providers who have promised to take similar steps, and amending existing initiatives to emphasize mHealth interventions as an important tool.24 This approach is favorable because these hospital systems and health care providers are already established in their communities, have the existing physical and digital infrastructure to take on mHealth outreach, and see a significant volume of patients.25 Additionally, this includes other programs already established by OMH, such as the EMPOWERED program.26 Since this program is focused on grants to statewide partners specifically focused 24 Press Release, Indiana University, IU establishes Pandemic Health Disparities Fund; committee work begins (June 26, 2020), https://news.iu.edu/stories/2020/06/iu/releases/26-pandemic-health-disparities-fund-established.html.

Importantly, the community infrastructure and trust is already in place.31 These health networks have been embedded in their communities for years, and therefore are better suited to understanding the specific needs of patients.32 Moreover, these networks have explicitly pledged to \"regularly measur[e], monitor[] and improv[e] the care of underserved populations\" as well as advocate for investments that \"achieve improvements in access, quality and health outcomes in communities.\"33 The OMH should also work with local university health programs to reach out to marginalized young adults.34 Indiana University, which also operates IU Health, established a \"Pandemic 27 Id. 28Indiana State Partnership Grant Program to Improve Minority Health, supra note 19. 29 Id. 30 WTHR.com staff, 3 Central Indiana Health Systems Address Racism in Health Care, WTHR (October 22, 2020) https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/3-central-indiana-health-systems-address-racism-in-health-care/531-8da91190-4fa3-4a17-96c9-f37532664386. 31 Disha Kumar et al., Mobile Phones May Not Bridge the Digital Divide: A Look at Mobile Phone Literacy in an Underserved Patient Population, 11 CUREUS 1, 7 (2019). 32 Id. 33WTHR.com staff, supra note 30. 34 Press Release, Indiana University, supra note 24. 2021 mHealth for Indiana 143 Health Disparities Fund\" targeted at addressing the needs of African American or Hispanic students.35 Indiana University is uniquely poised to conduct outreach to marginalized young people given its position as an educational institution and its existing digital and physical infrastructure.36 The University established public health and safety measures for these specific programs, including screening and testing, mental health services and other student wellness programs targeted specifically at Black or Hispanic students.37 Community Healthcare System uses an application and website called MyChart, which allows patients to access and view test results, appointments, and other components of their medical records.38 This is a secure application used by many other health networks throughout the country and combined with technology support, could assist patients of these systems in understanding their personal health information.39 Since the application is so widely used by different health systems on the web and on mobile applications, there is the potential for a lot of feedback on the design and usability aspects of this software.40 Outreach by Indiana state and health systems to counsel underrepresented groups in the usage and understanding of this software would significantly help community members engage more 35 Id. 36 See id.

BlueCross BlueShield provides \"rewards\" such as gift cards (measured through a point system) to those who engage in \"healthy activities\" that are tracked on the website or application.42 Walgreens pharmacies use a program called \"myWalgreens health goals\" where an individual receives \"Walgreens Cash\" rewards for making healthy lifestyle choices and tracking them through the mobile application or website.43 The State of Indiana as an insurance provider should look to these methods as a model for incentivizing mHealth tracking and utilization. Additionally, providing subsidies or free mobile devices is a strong selling point and helps bridge the gap between owners of mobile phones and non-owners, which is a known barrier to mHealth utilization.44 However, these devices are not immune to damage or theft, and therefore these programs may not be wholly effective at ensuring adherence and engagement with mHealth interventions.45 IV. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS One drawback of using mHealth tools is a potential lack of technological literacy, especially among older adults in Indiana's population.

Inevitable and unpredictable technological \"hiccups\" could also interfere with mHealth management, such as lost passwords or login information, damaged or broken devices, and server issues.74 Server issues can arise from increased usage of any online sites.75 Outages are inevitable under normal conditions, but with the increased load of traffic due to the recent transition to a primarily online workforce, schooling and entertainment, outages rose dramatically in March 2020.76 Further, with many patients from across the country rushing to book vital appointments, such as COVID-19 vaccines on centralized sites like MyChart, serious outages can potentially occur.77 Avoiding these issues is not entirely within Indiana's power, as many programs are hosted by companies in other states or locations, however, the failure of technology is a potentially mitigating factor in how accessible and helpful any mHealth tools could be.78 Generally, mHealth interventions and programs have significant potential to improve health outcomes in the United States.79 mHealth applications can be adapted to meet language capacities of underserved populations, and they 73 Id. 74 Anderson-Lewis et al., supra note 44, at 6. 75 Revealed: COVID-19's Impact on Internet Disruptions, DATACENTERNEWS, https://datacenternews.us/story/revealed-covid-19-s-impact-on-internet-disruptions. 76 Id. 77 See generally Cleveland Clinic, Ohio COVID-19 Vaccine Appointments (https://my.clevelandclinic.org/landing/covid-19-vaccine/ohio) (Cleveland Clinic instructions for scheduling COVID-19 vaccines utilizing MyChart). 78 See EPIC https://www.epic.com/ (last visited April 28, 2021) (Epic Systems, which runs MyChart, is in Verona, WI and Indiana likely does not have significant influence over their operations). 79Anderson-Lewis et al., supra note 44, at 8. 2021 mHealth for Indiana 149 can be localized to a person's geographical area.80 Because of this flexibility, mHealth applications should not be overlooked as state and local municipalities in Indiana aim to close the racial and ethnic health disparity gap.81 Fortunately, there is also acceptance of mHealth application use among many patients.82 In a 2014 study, sixty-one percent of those surveyed said they would like to receive text messages from providers, and seventy percent would download and use an app to track their mental health, another seventy-three percent would access general health care information on their phones.83 These numbers reinforce the positive influences of \"acceptance facilitating interventions\" that illustrate the positive correlation with individuals' opinions and attitudes toward mHealth interventions and the likelihood individuals will use these services.84 Health care practitioners with a higher proficiency in handling technologies would likely see a significant benefit from incorporating mHealth applications into patient care, as age and familiarity with technologies impact attitudes and acceptance of applications.85 Indiana's adoption of this technology has the potential to improve health care across the board, as providers and patients become more proficient with the technology.86 80 Id.

CONCLUSION Mobile health technologies, also known as mHealth, are an emerging component of health care delivery and monitoring in the United States. Mobile phone usage and ownership is becoming increasingly widespread, including among lower-income communities in the United States.87 In Indiana, a significant portion of Medicaid and HIP recipients identify as racial and ethnic minorities.88 Therefore, Indiana's OMH should direct funding to community organizations committed to using mHealth as a tool to close the racial health care access gaps identified statewide. Additionally, Indiana in its role as a Medicaid insurer could promote the use of these technologies through financial incentives and insurance benefits. While an organization's foray into mHealth is not without obstacles; as some communities have low rates of technology literacy, mobile phone ownership, and the potential for general technology issues, mHealth remains a key tool to closing these disparities because of its high versatility and adaptability.89 Many of these concerns can be ameliorated through sensitive design philosophies and outreach programs.90 To increase access, Indiana could potentially develop \"free phone\" programs, which would be beneficial to these populations in aspects of their lives other than just the use of mHealth technology.91 A successful mHealth program in Indiana could serve as inspiration for additional states to follow, just as other states and programs have informed these proposals. Indiana has taken the first steps to reduce health access disparities among racial and ethnic minorities by developing the state Office of Minority Health and should not overlook mHealth 87 See generally Enid Montague & Jennifer Perchonok, Health and Wellness Technology Use by Historically Underserved Health Consumers: Systematic Review, 14 J.

INTRODUCTION Unconscious bias plagues the medical field and threatens the diagnosis, treatment, and physician-patient relationship between doctors and patients of color.1 The disparities affecting people of color in the United States include \"access to health care, the quality of care received, and health outcomes.\"2 Healthcare disparities are exacerbated by bias, stereotyping, and prejudice.3 Unconscious racial bias perpetrated by healthcare professionals has been increasingly addressed through the implementation of racial bias trainings in hospitals and medical schools.4 However, such bias training becomes ineffective when the medical benchmarks and medical devices used to test, diagnose, and treat patients are inherently biased due to the biases of the healthcare professionals, scientists, and developers bleeding into the creation 1 See Jasmine R.

DEVICE REGULATIONS A. FDA Regulatory Process The FDA's authority for device regulations stems from the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FD&C Act\").33 Medical devices go through numerous steps before they become available on the U.S. market. In determining whether a product meets the definition provided under the FD&C Act, the FDA further explains that the applicant should define the intended use and indications for use of the product.34 Once it is determined that the product meets the definition of a medical device, then the applicant must \"determine if an appropriate product classification exists for the product.\"35 The development process for devices varies based on the device's FDA classification.36 Before being approved for market use, the life cycle of a medical device begins at the conceptual and design phase with a market analysis.37 Manufacturers will then conduct clinical trials for the devices, which are sometimes randomized or blinded studies.38 These trials may also be \"under strict oversight\" by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health if the device is considered high-risk.39 After the trial, the device is from use of the device for its indented uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks.\"). 33 A History of Medical Device Regulation & Oversight in the United States, FDA, https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/history-medical-device-regulation-oversight-united-states (last visited Mar. 8, 2021). 34 Classify Your Medical Device, FDA, https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/how-determine-if-your-product-medical-device (last visited Mar. 5, 2021). 35 Id. 36 Device Development Process, FDA, https://www.fda.gov/patients/device-development-process/step-1-device-discovery-and-concept (last visited Mar. 8, 2021). 37 Jill Jin, FDA Authorization of Medical Devices, 311 JAMA 435, 435 (Jan. 2014), https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1817798. 38 Id. 39 Id. 2021 Left to Their Own Devices 159 reviewed by the FDA or \"deemed exempt from review, depending on the device class and what types of similar devices are already on the market.\"40 The medical device classification system based on risk level was established by Section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.41 Each device is assigned to one of three regulatory classes: \"Class I, Class II or Class III, based on the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.\"42 Class I encompasses the devices that \"pose the least amount of risk to consumers,\" such as oxygen masks or surgical tools.43 The devices within this classification are subject to \"general controls\" which ensures that the devices are safe and effective once manufactured.44 General controls include good manufacturing practices, standards and reporting adverse events to FDA, registration, and general recordkeeping requirements.45 As for Class II devices, FDA classifies these devices as \"posing more risk than Class I and thus, require special controls in addition to general controls,\" such as labeling requirements, device specific mandatory performance standards, and device specific testing requirements.46 Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, pregnancy test kits, and powered wheelchairs are all examples of Class II devices.47 Class II devices are likely to be exempt from review if they are extremely low risk or similar to other released devices, but they \"usually undergo a 510(k) review.\"48 A 510(k) review 40 Id. 41 21 CFR \u00a7 860.130.

RECOMMENDATIONS There are multiple ways the FDA can build upon the Action Plan to address many of the disparities in the current regulatory and approval process of devices with AI/ML algorithms. As previously discussed, a major concern of AI/ML algorithms lies in the lack of diverse data sets and the resulting inaccuracies of the devices on patients of color as well as the increased distrust and skepticism between patients and the devices.79 The Action Plan proposes to build transparency between users and manufacturers through required labeling and continuous monitoring.80 In addition to labeling, however, the required transparency should be between the FDA, 74 ACTION PLAN, supra note 59, at 4-5. 75 Id. at 5. 76 Id. 77 Id. 78 Id. 79 See Marcelin et al., supra note 1. 80 ACTION PLAN, supra note 59, at 5. 164 Advance Directive Vol. 30 manufacturers, healthcare systems and physicians, so that physicians can confidently recommend the devices to all patients.81 Aiding in the mission of transparency, the data sets used to source the AI/ML algorithms need to be reported to the FDA in the manufacturer's FDA approval application and must be the basis for consideration for approval.82 If the device fails to take into account a diverse data set, then it should not reach the market.83 However, if the FDA continues to approve a device created from a non-diverse data set, then prospective users should be informed of the device's potential limitations.84 By being transparent and improving the approval process, inaccurate readings with devices that use AI/ML algorithms and PPG signaling could be eliminated altogether by preventing the devices from even passing the FDA approval process unless they adhere to incorporating diverse data sets.85 Furthermore, this Action Plan must not only look forward, but must also be applied retroactively.86 Over 160 AI/ML-based SaMDs have been approved by the FDA with seventy of those AI/ML-based SaMDs being approved in 2019.87 Of the total approved AI devices, only seven disclosed \"the racial makeup of the study population\" and thirteen disclosed the gender 81 See Marcelin et al., supra note 1. 82 See Elise Reuter, FDA-Cleared AI Devices Lack Critical Information on Performance, Equity, Med City News (Apr. 13, 2021), https://medcitynews.com/2021/04/fda-cleared-ai-devices-lack-critical-information-on-performance-equity/; ERIC WU ET AL., HOW MEDICAL AI DEVICES ARE EVALUATED; LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM AN ANALYSIS OF FDA APPROVALS, 27 NATURE MEDICINE 582, 584 (APR. 2021). 83 See Sjoding, supra note 24. 84 See WU ET AL., supra note 82. 85 Id. 86 ACTION PLAN, supra note 59. 87 Bethany J.

CONCLUSION It has never been more apparent that health care must be a united effort. From the physician-patient relationship to the tools used to diagnose, decreasing racial health disparities has to be prioritized for health care to be effective.91 As health care becomes more dependent on AI/ML-based technology, the industry, as a whole, should use the FDA regulatory process as an opportunity to address past and present racial biases and to prevent further marginalization in the health care space to better the future health of all. 88 Casey Ross, Explore STAT's Database of FDA-Cleared AI Tools, STAT (Feb. 3, 2021), https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/fda-artificial-intelligence-clearance-products/. 89 Sjoding, supra note 24. 90 Amit Kaushal et al., Health Care AI Systems Are Biased, SCI.

INTRODUCTION In the health care world today, many women feel their providers are either ignoring or dismissing their symptoms.1 In a recent study, twenty percent of women felt dismissed by their providers, while about only fifteen percent of men felt their providers were either ignoring or dismissing their symptoms.2 Why is it that women feel more like this? Are their feelings justified? Maya Dusenbery, author of the book, Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick, believes that providers take a man's symptoms more seriously than a woman's.3 Her belief stems from a cultural belief that women are normally allowed to show more emotion than men. Therefore, when a man shows emotion and asks for help, it is taken more seriously.4 Maya Dusenbery concluded over her two years of research that this leads to delayed diagnoses for women, and the doctors who failed to diagnose the patient, never found out that they failed to diagnose their patient correctly.5 Societal norm are not the only factors that play a role when it comes to why genders are not being properly diagnosed. The term \"gender bias\" 1 Emily Paulsen, Recognizing, Addressing Unintended Gender Bias in Patient Care, DUKE HEALTH (Jan 14, 2020), https://physicians.dukehealth.org/articles/recognizing-addressing-unintended-gender-bias-patient-care. 2 Id. 3 Jenara Nerenberg, How to Address Gender Inequality in Health Care, GREATER GOOD (March 9, 2018), https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_address_gender_inequality_in_health_care. 4 Id. 5 Id. 168 Advance Directive Vol. 30 generally refers to when an assumption is made that males and females are the same, and their needs are the same.6 However, this is not the reality that we are faced with. Males and females do not react the same or have the same symptoms in a vast amount of different medical situations.7 For example, cardiovascular disease in men causes significant pain and is very alarming to a man.8 However, the symptoms are significantly less painful in women, which causes doctors to say the symptoms arise from less life-threatening conditions.9 This creates an issue that Maya Dusenbery calls the \"trust gap,\" which results from doctors not believing that a woman's symptoms are significant enough to be life threatening.10 Cardiovascular disease is one of many medical conditions that are under-researched.11 Others include autoimmune disease, fibromyalgia, and many chronic pain conditions.12 Studies are constantly being published which demonstrate that this is a common occurrence in health care. Nature Communications published a study they conducted looking at almost seven million cases of men and women in the Danish healthcare system.13 Their final results showed that men were diagnosed before women in over 700 diseases.14 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) demonstrated a real-life example of what happens when men and women are treated the same in 6 Thomas Jefferson U.

This disparity has led to misunderstanding and misinformation on how to treat men, women, and the LGBTQ community differently. Many doctors only focus on the big differences. For example, the reproductive function of women.26 Policy must be implemented to correct these mistaken beliefs and help undo the gender disparities occurring in the health care system. The best place to begin implementing these polices is in medical schools across the country. The Department of Education has given the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) power to accredit medical schools in the United States and Canada.27 The Department of Education must enforce new policies upon the LCME to ensure medical students are being taught in ways that do not lead to gender disparities. II. WHAT MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE TEACHING As it stands today, medical research into diseases and treatments have a strong bias to the number of male participants compared to female participants.28 In a screening of over 3,802 medical studies, it was concluded that only twenty-two of the medical studies fully broke down all the differences between a man and a woman in the study.29 This is an issue because medical students begin conducting their medical research while they are in medical school. Medical students learn habits and strategies that stick with them for the rest of their career.30 This ultimately leads to any future 26 Id. 27 What is the LCME?, AUGUSTA U., https://www.augusta.edu/mcg/coffice/evaluation-services/lcme/index.php, (last visited Feb 4, 2021). 28 Thomas Jefferson U.

III. THE LCME & WHY THEIR REQUIREMENTS MUST BE CHANGED The LCME is recognized by the U.S. Congress as the authority responsible for accrediting medical schools.42 The U.S. Department of Education renewed their federal recognition of the LCME on August 22, 2018 for the following five years.43 The LCME is supposed to foster growth among medical schools and help improve them.44 However, as discussed above, this \"growth\" has not kept up with the times. Only medical schools that are accredited by the LCME become eligible for federal grants and programs.45 These federal grants and programs are essential when it comes to medical schools conducting their own medical research.46 Without these grants, many universities would lose professors who rely on these grants for research.47 This in turn does not only hurt the universities, but this also hurts the entire health care field.48 Every year the LCME releases their standards that accredited schools, or schools that want to be accredited must follow.49 Unfortunately, these standards do not do much to help the issue of gender disparities.

This first step means we must implement education in medical schools about the differences between men, women and the LGBTQ community and how they react in different medical situations.58 This is an important first step because we need to gather research and see if this begins to help eliminate gender disparities.59 50 Standards, LIAISON COMMITTEE ON MEDICAL EDUCATION (2020), https://lcme.org/publications/#Standards. 51 Id. 52 Id. 53 Id. 54 Maria Luisa Panisello & Inma Pastor, Health with Equality: A Proposal for the Incorporation of the Gender Perspective in Health Care Systems, 20 CIENC. & SAUDE COLETIVA, 1555 (2015), http://www.scielo.br/pdf/csc/v20n5/1413-8123-csc-20-05-01555.pdf. 55 Id. supra note 1. 57 Id. 58 Katarina Hamberg, Gender Bias in Medicine, 4 WOMEN'S HEALTH 237, 241 (2008) https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/17455057.4.3.237. 59 Id. 174 Advance Directive Vol. 30 The second step is incorporating more women and LGBTQ members in medical school lectures and research, which will allow medical students to see the differences of the genders earlier in their education, allowing them to grow better habits. The rest of this article will focus specifically on the changes that must be made in medical school's research, clinical, and lecture work as well as the policies that can be implemented to ensure compliance. IV. HOW TO FIX GENDER BIAS ARISING FROM MEDICAL SCHOOLS The LCME needs to implement stronger standards for medical schools in teaching medical students about gender differences. This is an essential first step because this helps medical students develop habits that are essential for their careers.60 As mentioned before, many doctors do not know they have gender bias habits, thus if medical schools can prevent the bias from forming, this is a great start.61 Research in medical school can lead to the production of more medical research later on in that medical student's career.62 This allows the medical student to form no gender bias, and may increase the amount of research that is going into gender disparities.63 Lastly, studies have shown that conducting research in medical school leads to doctors providing better care for their patients.64 The PAHO created a template to help design programs and research to integrate gender.65 The five steps are: identifying the health problem and separating it by sex; analyze the data with a gender perspective; create a program consistent with international standards; and select intended outputs 60 Why Research Is Important for Medical Students, ST. JAMES SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (July 25, 2019), https://www.sjsm.org/2019/07/why-research-is-important-for-medical-students/.) 61 Paulsen, supra note 1. 62 Standards, supra note 50. 63 Id. 64 Id. 65 Pan American Health Organization, supra note 15. 2021 LCME is Failing Medical Students 175 to redress inequities.66 This template is a good example of how the LCME can require medical research at a medical school to be conducted. The PAHO also created the \"gender assessment tool\" (GAT) which helps to evaluate programs and ensure that the program is gender responsive. The GAT lists twenty-six questions that help determine if the program should be used.67 Answering 'yes' to eleven questions between the questions of 1-20, the program is deemed 'gender transformative.'68 This essentially means that the program helps take away gender bias. If the answer to two questions between the questions of 21-26 is 'yes,' the program may be considered gender blind or unequal.69 The LCME should use the GAT when they examine schools for accreditation. Medical schools also need to make changes to their clinical and lecture requirements. In many medical school textbooks, it is stated that men and women are basically the same and use a man as the normal reference point when discussing issues.70 The LCME standards does not require an in depth look at the differences between men, women and member of the LGBTQ community.71 This must become a standard in medical schools across the country. If medical students are not exposed to the differences when they go to their clinical work they will have a gender bias. To make matters worse, the LCME only requires that medical students have an \"adequate\" amount of experience on both genders.72 This definition is not appropriate when it comes to the lives of millions of people. Stricter standards must be enforced and monitored. Overall, both in research and clinical training, the results 66 Id. 67 Id. 68 Id. 69 Id. 70 Ross & Wang. supra note 46. 71 Thomas Jefferson U. Online, supra note 6. 72 Id. 176 Advance Directive Vol. 30 must be evaluated.73 The results will help provide an understanding if this is helping with gender disparities, doing nothing, or making matters worse.74 Due to these reasons, the LCME should apply the GAT when accrediting schools. The LCME additionally needs to change their policy to clearly define what medical schools need to do in order to address the different needs of men, women, and the LGBTQ community. However, the Department of Education needs to ensure that the LCME is following through and ensuring that these policy changes are taking place. There must be repercussions in place for if/when the LCME does not follow the new standards. V. HOW TO IMPLEMENT POLICY CHANGE The LCME's power is given to them by the U.S. Congress, through the Department of Education.75 Medical schools can only be accredited and receive federal funding if the LCME gives them the accreditation.76 This gives the Department of Education the power to implement policy changes that are needed. Policy changes can be implemented through two different avenues. First, the Department of Education has granted the LCME accreditation power until 2023.77 When that contract expires, the Department of Education can force the LCME to enact new standards, such as including in the contract that unless they are satisfied with the new LCME standards, it can rescind its accreditation. Second, if the LCME does comply with the new policies, the medical schools must all go through the accreditation process again. LCME, 73 Ross & Wang, supra note 46. 74 Id. 75 Thomas Jefferson U. Online, supra note 6. 76 Id. 77 Id. 2021 LCME is Failing Medical Students 177 as they currently do, will be able to rescind accreditation or warn schools that their accreditation will be taken if the new standards are not followed.78 Medical schools rely heavily on federal funding for research and other needs.79 For example, in 2016 Harvard received about $600 million from the federal government.80 If LCME does not accredit medical schools based off their new standards and the Department of Education begins to cut funding for those schools, many medical schools will find themselves in a lot of trouble. This will lead to a lot of schools following the new standards laid out by the LCME or losing their grants. Changing the standards alone for the LCME is not enough to prevent gender bias from occurring. With the LGBT community growing rapidly, and existing gender bias in medical schools, the LCME needs to examine schools for accreditation more than they are currently.81 As it stands today, the LCME does an accreditation visit to a medical school once every eight years.82 This means that if the LCME does adopt new standards in 2023, some schools may not be visited until 2030.83 Information concerning gender bias and how the different genders have different needs is constantly growing. Eight years is far too long of a time to ensure that all medical schools are up to date with the proper procedures. Thus, if the Department of Education decides to renew the LCME accreditation rights, the LCME should accredit schools every four years. Because the medical field is constantly evolving, eight years is far too long to not change standards. If the LCME does implement new standards, the Department of Education needs to ensure that the LCME is actually applying the standards. Therefore, 78 Id. 79 Ross & Wang, supra note 46. 80 Id. 81 Cohen, supra note 36. 82 ASS'N OF AM. MED. COLLS. https://www.aamc.org/services/first-for-financial-aid-officers/lcme-accreditation. 83 Id. 178 Advance Directive Vol. 30 unlike previous contracts with the LCME, the Department of Education should only give the LCME their accreditation power for two-year increments.84 This will allow the Department of Education to survey schools and determine if the new standards are making a difference. VI. CONCLUSION Medical schools help shape the type of doctors that medical students will be throughout their career. The habits medical students learn throughout medical school will be with them forever. In order to stop gender disparities and increase the amount of quality medical research, polices must be implemented to ensure the proper education of these students through the accreditation process. If medical schools do not follow the new standards to remedy the gender disparities, schools should lose their accreditation and lose federal funding. If the LCME fails to uphold the new standards, they should lose their power to accredit medical schools. 84 LIAISON COMM. ON MED.

INTRODUCTION Reproductive justice combines reproductive rights, social justice, and culturally competent approaches to further the goal of intersectional representation.1 Culturally competent medical treatment ensures individuals receive the best treatment possible by honoring cultural backgrounds, acknowledging racial and ethnic inequities, and providing medical autonomy.2 While race is a social construct, there are cultural differences and environmental factors that warrant heightened attention from a medical standpoint.3 In this article, I will explain the timeline of the relationship between the U.S. Government and American Indians4 as it relates to what access to reproductive healthcare is currently available. Next, I will argue that increased federal funding is central to reproductive justice for two reasons: (1) It will increase the access to healthcare facilities for American Indian 1 Reproductive Justice, SISTERSONG.NET (last visited Feb. 7, 2021), https://www.sistersong.net/reproductive-justice. 2 Cultural Competence in Health Care: Is it Important for People with Chronic Conditions?, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HEALTH POL'Y INST.

Lastly, I will discuss the complicated conversation regarding abortion as a reproductive healthcare necessity. II. BACKGROUND American Indians are often overlooked in conversations surrounding healthcare, and even more so in reproductive healthcare.5 Rooted in a tumultuous history with the U.S. Government, American Indians have fought for access to healthcare.6 However, little aid has been provided and what aid has been provided fails to match the need.7 As early as the mid 1800's, the U.S. Government traded land for healthcare with American Indians tribes.8 Yet current data shows that the healthcare facilities sustained through the Indian Health Services (IHS) are only located on tribal land despite the fact that only forty percent of American Indian peoples reside on reservations.9 On March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act as part of the Affordable Care Act.10 Yet to this day, most IHS locations lack birthing centers.11 This lack of healthcare is deeply seated in systemic racism when healthcare was purposefully withheld from American Indians in order to prevent future generations of American 5 The Road to Reproductive Justice: Native Americans in New Mexico, FORWARD TOGETHER (last visited March 14, 2021) https://forwardtogether.org/tools/the-road-to-reproductive-justice-native-americans-in-new-mexico/. 6 Barbara Gurr, The Failures and Possibilities of a Human Rights Approach to Secure Native American Women's Reproductive Justice, 7 SOCIETIES WITHOUT BORDERS 1, 2 (2012). 7 Id. 8 Id. at 8. 9 Id. at 9. 10 Indian Health Care Improvement Act, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES.GOV (last visited April 11, 2021), https://www.ihs.gov/ihcia/. 11 Gurr, supra note 6, at 11. 2021 Cultural Competency and the Law 181 Indians.12 Further examples of distrust include a history of studies targeting American Indians where findings were purposefully withheld and communities were not awarded the benefits of risking their health to contribute findings for the rest of the population.13 Reproductive healthcare includes mental and physical wellbeing for all matters involving the reproductive system.14 Sexual and reproductive healthcare is essential because it ensures people have healthy births and the ability to choose if and when to start and build families.15 People of color are disproportionately provided inadequate reproductive healthcare at both the individual and social level. Some of the relevant factors include \"fewer neighborhood health services, less insurance coverage, decreased access to educational and economic attainment, and even practitioner-level factors such as racial bias and stereotyping.\"16 III. ANALYSIS Federal funding and regulations would greatly aid in providing better and easier accessible reproductive healthcare to American Indians. In regard to federal funding, specific access to culturally competent reproductive healthcare and education would not only ensure communities receive adequate care, but further provide communities with the information needed to make decisions about family planning.

A. Access Access to adequate reproductive healthcare in American Indian communities is a twofold problem: not only must there be greater access to medical centers, but there also must be an assurance that culturally competent care be provided at these facilities. One of the first barriers an individual experiences when attempting to receive treatment from an IHS facility is twofold: they first they must prove they are a registered American Indian, and then they have to provide proof that they are currently receiving Medicaid.17 Both are exceptionally challenging for individuals without access to computers or internet.18 Besides the limited, if any, birth control options available at these facilities, restrictions on access from the U.S. government exacerbate abortion and family planning options.19 To address the issue of accessibility, an increased number of healthcare facilities and birthing centers in and near reservations would alleviate this major barrier and allow increased access to reproductive healthcare. Currently, traveling to hospitals and birthing centers can take several hours.20 Keeping in mind the fact that many American Indians already live in poverty, sacrificing time and resources to utilize essential treatment prevents patients from even seeking aid.21 An example of the disproportionate amount of health facilities is the 17 Barbara Gurr & Nikki McGary, Restricted Access: The Intersections of Reproductive Health, Rights and Policy for Minors and Native American Women, 11 J.

While an online doctor appointment does not replace a birthing center, telemedicine has been utilized by American Indians communities since the 1970's.24 This practice can be helpful to encourage more culturally common birthing practices, such as midwifery, if a doctor can be on call while the mother is still able to utilize whatever method she chooses.25 Yet an important criticism of telemedicine is that many reservations have little to no internet service.26 To exacerbate this issue, there is a severe sense of mistrust between communities and IHS facilities. Some women have reported that doctors force women into labor not because the woman or child is ready for childbirth, but because the woman is already at the medical center and it would be very challenging for her to return.27 The most dark and overarching reasoning behind the mistrust stems from a history of forced sterilization of American Indian women.28 Sterilization practices started in the 1930's, but grew with Congress's Family Planning Services Act in the 1970's.29 One study found that from 1973-1976 in just four IHS serviced areas, there were 3,406 involuntary sterilization of American Indian women ranging in age 22 Montana: Crow Reservation, NATIVE PARTNERSHIP (last visited March 14, 2021) http://www.nativepartnership.org/site/PageServer?pagename=PWNA_Native_Reservations_Crow. 23 Usha Ranji et al., Beyond the Numbers: Access to Reproductive Health Care for Low-Income Women in Five Communities, KFF (Nov. 14, 2019) https://www.kff.org/report-section/beyond-the-numbers-access-to-reproductive-health-care-for-low-income-women-in-five-communities-crow-tribal-reservation-mt/. 24 Kruse et al., supra note 20, at 1. 25 Loretta J.

Education While more birthing centers and telemedicine increase the accessibility of some reproductive healthcare, it does not ensure that American Indian will be welcomed and treated by culturally competent doctors and medical professionals.32 In general, birthing centers often are not equipped with cultural competency training.33 This is dangerous because medical training is typically centered around white men, and thus, medical professionals are less able to treat and trust pain management in women of color.34 Further, because traditional methods of medicine have been so ostracized and critiqued, American Indians have additionally lost trust and self-confidence to advocate for systemic change.35 This also means that American Indians are often less educated about their own reproductive health, and doctors are not trained to teach medicine to lower educated populations and thus the majority of communities lose the ability to make educated decisions.36 30 Christina M.

Funding cannot just target adolescents; it must connect with the entire community and must include community participation and influence.43 An example of a cultural practice that impacts education surrounding sexual health is religious and traditional beliefs inhibiting any conversation about these topics.44 Lastly, it is essential for education to be centered around the specific tribes and communities in which medical facilities provide care for.

Abortion While topics of sexual health are traditionally kept private, abortion continues to spark controversy and discord between different American Indian communities, with the U.S. Tribes around the country holding different views on abortion. To some, the trauma of forced sterilizations and abuse influence their stance as protecting any and all American Indian lives, including unborn embryos.46 Tribes, such as the Osage, fiercely believe abortion furthers colonizers' attempts to eradicate them.47 The Osage people, like many other tribes, interpret time and life as a circular concept and the act of birth is not a barrier to differentiate peoples who deserve protection.48 Due to this deep-seated belief, many women report experiencing further trauma to their mental health because they are eliminating a life they hold so sacred.49 However, not all communities and tribes share this view of abortion.50 The Iroquois people, for example, have used naturopathic remedies as contraceptive methods for hundreds of years before modern medicine.51 This reliance on nature as medicine coupled with matriarchal societies resulted in autonomy for women to decide what to do with her body.52 Further, the Iroquois believe in protecting the happiness of children and fostering their 45 In general, A Guide to Build Cultural Awareness, SAMHSA (Jan. 2009), http://tribalnations.mt.gov/Portals/229/docs/SMA08-4354_mod.pdf. 46 Shandiin Vandervere, What does \"Pro-Choice\" Mean to Natives?

While the battle for access to abortion has affected all people in the country, American Indians, like other women of color, have been disproportionally challenged. Access to abortion on a federal level typically involves the legalization of abortion, however, the funding for access is the core issue for American Indians.55 With so few clinics and health facilities available to American Indians, many rely on the IHS who ultimately decide what services they want to provide.56 This problem is exasperated when states pass abortion regulations that prohibit federal funding to abortions because this can create \"abortion deserts.\"57 These \"abortion deserts\" are dangerous because women must choose between risking unsafe abortion procedures, or spending time and resources to drive hours to another facility.58 Ultimately, this lack of funding discriminates against poor women and strips them of opportunities to make safe and healthy choices.59 Abortion is important in reproductive health care for two reasons: it allows women to choose to abort an embryo when the pregnancy is unhealthy for the mother and child, and it allows for family planning.

Despite that compared to other women in the U.S., American Indian women are twice as likely to experience sexual assault, the IHS provides little to no support to victims if they elect to get an abortion.60 Not only is birth control rarely available, but some IHS facilities are not equipped with rape kits.61 When a woman does opt for an abortion, she has traumatizing and unfair barriers to overcome.62 Increased funding to IHS facilities and heath care facilities surrounding reservations clears at least the hurdle of access. While this article does not intend to provide a moral stance on abortion, from a health care perspective, funding for any kind of reproductive health care must include funding for birth control including abortion. Additionally, the discussion around abortion perfectly highlights the importance of culturally competent medical care because medical practitioners in various areas must know how tribes and communities in their area view this health care option and why. Erasing the history and root of mistrust of health care perpetuates insensitive medical care and furthers the divide between accessible aid and patients in need. IV. CONCLUSION Cultural competency training and education should be federally funded, and federal funding cannot exclude cultural sensitivity and reproductive justice. Federal funding is integral because reproductive health not only affects current populations, but it determines how generations of American Indians will live.

INTRODUCTION Maternal morbidity and mortality, and associated low infant birth rate remain among the most notable disparities in health between White Americans and African Americans.1 The staggering difference in maternal health and infant birth weight can be attributed to several factors, including differences in socio-economic statuses, access to prenatal healthcare services, psychosocial stress, occupation status, and increased perinatal infections amongst African American women.2 Ultimately, economic inequalities and systemic racism that disproportionally affect African American women lead to a lack of family-supporting employment opportunities, food deserts, high crime and incarceration, and inadequate transportation and housing, all of which can adversely affect maternal health and subsequently lead to low infant birth weights.3 Low infant birth weights occur at a remarkably high rate in African Americans compared to White Americans.4 Complications of low infant birth weight include developmental delays and disorders, deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, attention deficit disorder, and poor performance in school.5 This paper will 1 Rose Molina & Lydia Pace, A Renewed Focus on Maternal Health in the United States, 377 NEW ENGLAND J.

II. BACKGROUND: MATERNAL MORTALITY Maternal mortality is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy or death directly or indirectly attributed to the pregnancy within forty-two days of delivery.6 The United States has a low maternal mortality rate compared to low-income nations at 230 deaths per 100,000 live births, but surprisingly the United States' maternal mortality has doubled since 1990 and its rate is high compared to high-income nations.7 What is most disturbing about the maternal mortality rate in the United States is the racial disparities seen with maternal mortality; low-income women and rural women are more likely to die during pregnancy, and even more troubling is that a non-Hispanic Black woman is three times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy than a White woman, as noted by an analysis looking at twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia.8 The causes of the disparities in maternal mortality are complex, but they can be tied to biases in the delivery of healthcare and social determinants of health.9 For one, chronic diseases, including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and thrombotic pulmonary embolism, which are associated with an increased risk for maternal mortality occur at a higher prevalence and are less controlled in African American women.10 Another cause of adverse 6 Molina & Pace, supra note 1. 7 Id. 8 Marian F MacDorman et al., Trends in Maternal Mortality by Sociodemographic Characteristics and Cause of Death in 27 States and the District of Columbia 129, OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY 811, 815 (2017). 9 Molina & Pace, supra note 1, at 1706. 10 Emily E.

BACKGROUND: LOW INFANT BIRTH WEIGHT Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as a weight at birth of less than 2,500 grams.22 There is an alarming trend that shows that African American babies are approximately twice as likely to have a LBW compared to White babies.23 Specifically, studies have shown that the rate of LBW in African American babies was seven percent, while the rate of LBW in White babies was three percent.24 Unfortunately, LBW can lead to various complications in babies, including death; the infant mortality rate was 10.2 per 1,000 live births for black babies, compared to 5.4 per 1,000 live births for white babies.25 Black babies were also three times as likely to die from causes linked to perinatal events, including prematurity.26 18 Singh & Lee, supra note 15, at 49. 19 Those with Inadequate Access to Food Likely to Suffer from Obesity, University of Texas at San Antonio, SCIENCEDAILY (2019), www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190123144522.htm. 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Sims et al, supra note 4, at 12. 23 Id. 24 Kenneth C.

PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS Racial disparities in maternal health and LBW are deeply rooted in structural racism, which is defined to mean racism that is not simply the \"result of private prejudices by individuals as much as it is produced and perpetuated by laws, rules, and practices endorsed and implemented by various levels of government, and it is cemented in the economy, cultural practices, and societal norms.\"37 One of the first steps at addressing the racial disparities that exist within the healthcare system is acknowledging that such issues exist and the effects that these racist practices have created.38 Another step that the medical and public health community should take is to look within themselves both as individuals and as an institution to understand the effects that structural racism has had on minority populations, which should be seen on a daily basis based upon their actual healthcare practice locations and patient populations.39 34 Id. 35 Id. at 22. 36 Id. at 23. 37 Zinzi D.

Speaking in terms of Medicaid coverage mentioned prior, there have been legislative efforts to reduce Medicaid coverage and eligibility by reducing federal Medicaid funding by thirty-five percent by 2030.49 This proposal could be damaging to pregnant women for numerous reasons; for one, decreasing Medicaid funding would decrease the prenatal care, care during childbirth, and postpartum care.50 Additionally, decreasing Medicaid eligibility would cause gaps in coverage if a woman were to become pregnant because many new mothers who were eligible for Medicaid solely because they are pregnant would then lose insurance coverage for sixty days after delivery; if a woman lost her insurance coverage, any chronic diseases that she may have had would then be untreated and can have adverse effects on the fetus should she become pregnant.51 To address these issues, public policy should be implemented on a federal level that would require states to cover new mothers via this pathway beyond these sixty days until at least one year after giving birth, and require full Medicaid benefit coverage during this period.52 Arguably, this policy would alleviate the aforementioned issues, such as ensuring that there is no gap in 47 Id. 48 Jamila Taylor et al, Eliminating Racial Disparities in Maternal and Infant Mortality: A Comprehensive Policy Blueprint, Center for American Progress. 1, 10 (2019). 49 Molina & Pace, supra note 1, at 1706. 50 Id. 51 Id. 52 Taylor et al, supra note 48, at 9. 2021 Maternal Health and Infant Birth Weight 199 coverage during this critical time for the mother's and infant's health and extending their care, especially in the African American population where Medicaid is more likely to be the primary insurance provider and subsequently covers over half of all births in the United States.53 There should also be public policy focused on expanding Medicaid coverage, particularly in the States that did not expand Medicaid coverage after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).54 Research has shown that infant mortality rates have declined in the states that expanded Medicaid coverage, with the greatest decline seen among African American infants.55 This research has also shown that if Medicaid is expanded in the seventeen non-expansion states, 141 infant deaths could be averted per year.56 This finding is especially important because the African American women who are most affected by the discontinuation or loss of insurance live in the Southern United States, which is a region where most states have chosen not to expand Medicaid coverage.57 The South Side of Chicago also has its share of safety-net hospitals, which is defined as hospitals that organize and deliver a significant level of health care and other health-related services to patients with no insurance or with Medicaid.58 These hospitals are shutting down or suspending their maternal health services in the South Side of Chicago, partly due to reduced Medicaid reimbursement.59 Due to delayed and reduced Medicaid reimbursement, these safety-net hospitals cannot recruit and retain quality physicians to give poor patients the maternal health services they desperately deserve and need.60 SB 2541 and SB 1864 that were recently signed by Illinois Governor 53 Id. 54 Id. at 9 55 Id. 56 Id. 57 Taylor, supra note 49, at 10. 58 Characteristics of Safety-Net Hospitals, 2014, Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK401306/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK401306.pdf. 59 Black, supra note 40. 60 Id. 200 Advance Directive Vol. 30 Pritzker, as mentioned prior, provide financial relief to safety-net hospitals, and thus provides increased funding and reimbursement for the Medicaid-majority patients seeking maternal care services at these safety-net hospitals to the tune of $3.9 billion.61 Citing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 includes a provision that provides a five percent point increase in the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for the twelve states that currently have not expanded Medicaid coverage pursuant to the ACA.62 Again, whereas this progress has arguably been realized in the face of a pandemic, arguably, public policy changes need to be advocated for in terms of the funding models and formulas used to calculate Medicaid reimbursement, especially for the at-risk safety-net hospitals in the South Side of Chicago.63 V. CONCLUSION While the United States has a low maternal mortality rate amongst low-income nations, it is extremely troubling to note the relatively high rate of maternal mortality amongst other high-income nations. This observation is even more pronounced when compared between White Americans and African Americans. This staggering disparity in maternal health and associated maternal mortality can be attributed to several factors. Some of these causes include differences in socio-economic statuses, access to prenatal healthcare services, quality and quantity of healthcare services available, presence of chronic and preexisting diseases, psychosocial stress, food and housing considerations, lack of transportation, and increased perinatal infections amongst African American women. A general theme amongst these important issues is the presence of systemic racism that 61 Gov. Pritzker Signs Hospital Assessment Legislation Bringing $250 Million in Additional Federal Funding for Health Care to Illinois, supra note 45. 62 McDermott et al., supra note 46. 63 Black, supra note 40. 2021 Maternal Health and Infant Birth Weight 201 disproportionately affects African American women more than White women, as further demonstrated by a lack of economic and employment opportunities, risky behaviors, food desserts, and high crime and incarceration, all of which adversely affects maternal health and can subsequently lead to LBW in infants. There is also a marked disparity in LBW amongst African American babies compared to White American babies, which can have notable consequences, such as developmental delays and disorders, blindness, cerebral palsy, attention deficit disorder, and poor performance in school. Public policy initiatives are imperative, such as access to quality healthcare services, insurance coverage for women regardless of pregnancy status, access to prenatal care, Medicaid coverage and qualification, and overall bridging of the gap to equilibrate the disparities seen between African American and White American mothers and infants. Progress has certainly been made with regards to access to maternal care and expansion of Medicaid funding and reimbursement, both on a state and more recently on a federal level. However, further public advocacy is needed both on a state and federal level to ensure that maternal health services are prioritized, and Medicaid funding meets the unique, ever-changing needs of the disparate population in the low-income areas of Chicago. 202 Advance Directive Vol. 30 203 Addressing International Physician Credentialling in Arizona Robert Morlock I.

CHANGES TO THE LICENSING OF INTERNATIONALLY TRAINED PHYSICIANS A. States Change International Physician Licensing Requirements During COVID-19 COVID-19 imposed unprecedented strain on hospital systems, overwhelming some acute care facilities.30 Multiple states lowered their licensing requirements for internationally trained physicians in an effort to increase their physician workforce.31 The general structure of these changes can be split into two frameworks.32 First, some states lowered the amount of time internationally trained physicians were required to spend in a qualified residency program.33 Second, other states allowed physicians who had international licenses and training to practice under a temporary license, regardless of their amount of training in the United States.34 New York serves as an example of a state that lowered the number of years an internationally trained physician was required to spend in a qualified residency program before seeking a license.35 In New York, the governor 28 See Barbara Sibbald, Made-in-Canada Accreditation Coming for Medical Schools, 186 CANADIAN MED.

An Unused Workforce of International Physicians It is notable that even before COVID-19 it was stated that there is a population of internationally trained health care workers who were either underemployed or unemployed in the United States due, in part, to licensing requirements.42 However, the changes made by the states during the pandemic further demonstrate that there is a substantial workforce of internationally educated physicians in the United States who are able to fill 36 Id. at 14. 37 NY Exec.

PROPOSAL FOR ARIZONA TO CHANGE ITS FOREIGN PHYSICIAN LICENSING REQUIREMENTS Arizona has a severe shortage of medical providers.45 Approximately two in five Arizonans live in a \"health care shortage area.\"46 The federal government gives this designation to identify areas and people with unmet health care needs.47 Arizona ranks forty second in the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 people.48 The current estimated shortage of primary care physicians in Arizona is 558.49 This gap is only expected increase to 1,941 physicians by 2030.50 Further, Arizona's physician population is aging.51 In Arizona, the average physician is close to 50 years old.52 Unfortunately, Arizona does not have a sufficient pipeline of graduating physicians to meet the current demands of its growing population, or provide replacements for its elderly workforce.53 43 Id. at 11. 44 Id. 45 Xiaoming Zhang et at., Physician Workforce in the United States of America: Forecasting Nationwide Shortage, 18 HUM.

REV. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 32-1422(A)(1-2) (stating that an applicant must graduate from a medical school that the board deems of equivalent quality and have twelve months in an approved internship, residency, or clinical fellowship program); see Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-67-302.5 (b) (2020) (stating applicants must have \"studied medicine in a medical school located outside the United States which is recognized by an organization approved by the division\"). 76 Id. 77 De Pena, supra note 58. 78 Susser, supra note 6, at 2. 79 See Batalova supra note 5, at 11 (stating that after amending its licensing requirements to allow foreign physicians with five years of good standing in a foreign country and one year of practice in the last five years to apply for a license, New Jersey received over 1,000 applications for licenses). 214 Advance Directive Vol. 30 regulations.80 However, by doing so, Arizona would expand the pool of physicians eligible to work in the state.81 As need for additional physicians is greatest in rural communities and tribal lands, Arizona should drive physicians licensed under these relaxed requirements to rural and underserved areas.82 As seen in New York during the COVID-19 pandemic, provisional licenses can be used to restrict a licensee's ability to practice to specified facilities.83 While New York's licenses only restrict the facilities where a licensee can practice, Arizona should go further and adopt a model similar to Canada's which can also restrict a license to a geographic location.84 By restricting provisional licenses to designated facilities within rural and underserved areas, Arizona can increase access to care in rural and tribal areas, improving health outcomes in these populations.85 V. CONCLUSION Arizona has some of the strictest rules governing the licensing of foreign physicians.86 At the same time, Arizona faces a severe physician shortage that disparately affects residents in rural and tribal areas.87 To help address the physician shortage and improve health outcomes Arizona should amend its licensing requirements to ease the restrictions on the licensing of international physicians.

Further, internationally trained physicians with at least one year of post graduate training in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, New Zealand or South Africa should be allowed to apply for an Arizona license. And, internationally trained physicians who have five years of good medical standing in a foreign country and have practiced during one of the last five years should be able to apply for an Arizona medical license. Finally, to help address disparities in rural and tribal health, Arizona should restrict the licenses granted under this proposal to facilities within rural and tribal regions. 216 Advance Directive Vol. 30 217 The Intersection of Health Policy and Immigration: Consequences of Immigrants' Fear of Arrests in U.S. Hospitals. Mambwe Mutanuka I. INTRODUCTION Immigrants comprise of almost fourteen percent of the total U.S. population.1 Despite being legally eligible to apply for numerous health-related services, many immigrants do not pursue conventional health care services.2 Language, literacy, stigma, and fear of deportation, are contributing factors that deter immigrants from enrolling in these programs.3 Lack of access to conventional health care and fears of deportation push many immigrants to seek unregulated care or avoid seeking care entirely.4 This not only results in increased societal costs but contributes to racial and socioeconomic disparities within health care.5 The resulting harm also affects U.S. citizens and exacerbates inequities within already disadvantaged populations.6 It is essential to replace anti-immigrant policies that limit access to health services with inclusionary measures that promote access to 1 Abby Budiman, Key findings about U.S. immigrants, PEW RSCH.

Implementing policies that allow immigrants to seek care without fear of arrest will not only decrease societal costs but will help reduce inequities in health care and reduce strain on hospitals.8 This article will first provide an overview of the intersection between the U.S. immigrant household and access to health care. Next, this article will examine the current environment of immigrant arrests in hospitals and the resulting impact on immigrants, the health care industry, and the public. Finally, this article will propose that the solution to the current undesirable policy environment is to enact a federal law that prohibits arrests in hospitals. II.

THE IMPACT OF EXCLUSIONARY IMMIGRANT HEALTH POLICIES ON HOSPITALS Immigration policies that deter documented immigrants from seeking health coverage or access to health care have a detrimental effect on society in many ways, including straining the health care system.31 Fear of arrest experienced by mixed-status immigrant families creates a barrier for documented individuals to access health care or to provide aid to family members in their health journey.32 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") currently maintains a policy that prohibits arrests in hospitals as designated \"sensitive locations,\" except (1) in \"exigent circumstances,\" (2) when certain exceptions are met, or (3) \"prior approval is obtained.\"33 This policy, however, is discretionary, and ICE can roll it back at any time.34 Therefore, despite pleas by officials for immigrants to seek medical treatment when needed,35 fear of arrest 29 See id.

It is difficult to determine the exact number of immigrants impacted by arrests in hospitals due to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) lack of transparency.38 However, \"[o]n an average day in November 2017, ICE had custody of thirty-eight individuals in ten hospitals across five states.\"39 There is evidence that ICE does not always follow its sensitive locations policy.

COVID-19 infection rates are disproportionately higher in immigrant communities than in non-immigrant communities.62 Early data shows that immigrants are underrepresented among the demographics of vaccinated people, thereby risking the spread of disease for fear of detention.63 Understanding the gravity of public safety threats during the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE released a 57 Swetlitz, supra note 54. 58 Id. 59 See 2018 NATIONAL AGING AND LAW CONFERENCE.

Therefore, it is in the public's best interest to remove all barriers to care, beginning with codifying a national sensitive locations law that would prohibit arrests in hospitals. IV. SOLUTION The U.S. lacks a coherent centralized immigration health policy.66 Although the federal government has exclusive reign over immigration,67 federal law provides great discretion to the states in decision-making about immigrant access to health care.68 The decentralized model results in a \"messy reality\" in which both federal and state levels of government have a role in regulating the intersection between health and immigration policy.69 Despite evidence showing that immigrant inclusive policies improve health outcomes,70 reduce health inequities,71 and improve economies, state policies remain stagnant.72 To address the gap between immigration and health policy, legislators must enact a federal law that: (1) further clarifies what \"at or near\" a \"sensitive location\" means; and (2) expands the definition of \"sensitive locations\" to include a \"more comprehensive list of locations.\"73 64 Lanard, supra note 35. 65 Id. 66 Makhlouf, supra note 6, at 1682. 67 Id. at 1697 68 Id. at 1708. 69 Id. at 1697 70 Wobert, supra note 8. 71 Makhlouf, supra note 6, at 1727. 72 Id. 73 Fortuny, supra note 2. 2021 Immigrant Arrests in U.S. Hospitals 227 Under the principle of federalism, states are encouraged to engage in policy experimentation and act as laboratories so that other states may replicate successful policy templates.74 However, this experimentation does not always produce optimal results.75 Between 2016 and 2017, at least eight states introduced bills to prohibit arrests in sensitive locations; however, none have passed into law.76 Additionally, even if such bills were to pass, it is unlikely that DHS would honor such state policies.77 Lacking federal and state laws that prohibit arrests in sensitive locations, some states have resorted to enacting laws and policies that deter cooperation with federal immigration agents.78 However, despite state legislators' good intentions, such laws and policies are inadequate in mitigating the number of arrests in sensitive locations.79 Instead, the solution is to enact a federal law that prohibits ICE from entering all sensitive locations, including hospitals, schools, and places of worship, and imposing an injunction against agents to prohibit their presence within a certain vicinity of sensitive locations.80 Notably, legislators have made such efforts at a federal level.81 In 2017, in an attempt to codify hospitals as sensitive locations, Rep.

CONCLUSION A law prohibiting arrests in sensitive locations is \"common sense policy.\"96 The most vulnerable individuals in our communities deserve to feel secure when seeking medical care.97 When immigrants do not feel safe seeking care and accessing benefits for which they are eligible, health disparities and societal costs increase.98 The fear immigrants experience transcends legal status, race, and ethnicity.99 It is therefore incumbent on the U.S. to enact national legislation that prohibits arrests in hospitals, except under exigent circumstances.100 ICE policies that are subject to change at any time are not sufficient, and individual state laws are too fragmented to address this national issue.101 Congress must codify ICE's sensitive locations policy by passing the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act into law, thereby transforming indeterminate guidelines into \"statutory, enforceable law.\"102 93 Makhlouf, supra note 6, at 1774 (using Medicaid as an example to explain that patchwork policies of noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid are exclusionary and \"federal leadership is needed in order to enact inclusive policy[...]\"). 94 Rogerson, supra note 53, at 296. 95 Id. at 1773. 95 Nandi, supra note 23. 96 American Bar Association, supra note 59, at H-21. 97 Saadi et al., supra note 55. 98 Morey, supra note 5. 99 Hardy et al., supra note 15. 100 Rogerson, supra note 53, at 296. 101 Makhlouf, supra note 6 at 1697. 102 Id. at H-25. 230 Advance Directive Vol. 30 231 Black Box Software: Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Cristal Nova I.

UNDERSTANDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTHCARE In 1974, the MYCIN clinical decision support algorithm was used to diagnose blood-based bacterial infections and recommend treatment.17 As one of healthcare's earliest expert systems, MYCIN analyzed and learned bacteria types with information gathered from medical experts and made inferences from its associated symptoms to recommend treatments.18 Expert system algorithms are programmed to automatically analyze data and generate conclusions, without ethical sensitivities.19 MYCIN operates through 350 rules and diagnosed bacterial infections with greater accuracy than practicing physicians at the time.20 Yet, the algorithm was not programmed to include patient records, facility capabilities, or adjust for recovery and mortality rates\u2014all determinative factors in successful care delivery.21 This decision support algorithm yielded greater health outcomes than decisions made without it, adding support to the movement for AI in other clinical specialties.22 However, AI requires reliance of massive data 17 E.g., McCarthy, supra note 6, at 11; B.J.

CONTEMPLATING INEQUALITY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The ethical examination of whether to consider a patient's race when providing care and assigning a value to this variable have long been disputed in scientific research.26 Some scholars believe that intentionally incorporating racial and ethnic factors can improve health outcomes and revolutionize the field of personalized genomic medicine.27 Others caution that doing so accepts race as a genetic predictor, and if not analyzed properly, can reinforce harmful notions of biological bigotry.28 Despite the friction surrounding this discussion, many diagnostic algorithms are built to modify 23 See AI in Healthcare: 5 Privacy & Security Considerations When Leveraging the Latest Technology, IMPRIVATA, (Mar. 28, 2019), https://www.fairwarning.com/insights/blog/ai-in-healthcare-5-privacy-security-considerations-when-leveraging-the-latest-technology. 24 See Cade Metz & Craig Smith, Warnings of a Dark Side to A.I. in Healthcare, NY TIMES (Mar. 21, 2019) https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/science/health-medicine-artificial-intelligence.html (discussing the rise in adversarial attacks on healthcare algorithms); see also Samuel Finlayson et al., Adversarial Attacks on Medical Machine Learning, 363 SCIENCE 1287, 1287(Mar. 22, 2019) (discussing the motivations of adversarial attacks on healthcare algorithms and possible cures). 25 See Ziad Obermeyer et al., Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations, 366 SCIENCE 447, 447 (Oct. 25, 2019) (discussing a widely adopted risk-prediction algorithm which disproportionally limited access to healthcare services for African American patients). 26 Jennifer Tsai, What Role Should Race Play in Medicine?

ANALYSIS Machine learning tools that lack a methodological explanation are often referred to as \"black box\" software.66 In health care, this software is shaped using a vast repository of generally accepted clinical practice guidelines. 67 Currently, this black box effect leaves purchasers, users, and regulators in the dark about the data sources used to power artificial intelligence tools.68 Disclosure of AI improvements are further narrowed by business choices to safeguard emerging technologies.69 This protection is generated by substantial patent investments70 and reliance of trade secrecy protections.71 Between 2002-2016 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office observed an annual influx of artificial intelligence applications submitted from 30,000 to 60,000.72 Companies that have not secured patent approval can rely on trade secrecy laws and the HIPPA privacy rule retain their data sources and 63 Id. 64 See Kendi, supra note 50, at e375. 65 Obermeyer, supra note 25, at 447. 66 See Gregory Daniel et al., Current State and Near-Term Priorities for AI-Enabled Diagnostic Support Software in Health Care 14 (Patricia Green ed., 2019). 67 See CHRISTINA SILCOX ET AL., TRUST, BUT VERIFY: INFORMATIONAL CHALLENGES SURROUNDING AI-ENABLED CLINICAL DECISION SOFTWARE 14 (Patricia Green ed., 2020). 68 Id. at 8. 69 Id. 70 Id. 71 Id. 72 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVENTING AI: TRACING THE DIFFUSION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH U.S. PATENTS, 5 IP DATA HIGHLIGHTS 2 (5th ed. 2020). 2021 Black Box Software 241 methodologies away from the consuming public and independent researchers. 73 Advocates outside of the health care industry have made Congress well aware of AI's potential to amplify bias, foster discrimination, and exploit consumers.74 The Algorithmic Accountability Act was introduced to grant federal authority to screen, evaluate and provide risk-mitigation guidance on AI and machine learning high-risk automated decision systems which either contribute to discrimination or influence sensitive decision-making using data collected from consumers' behavior patterns.75 The Algorithmic Accountability Act would invite the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") among other federal agencies to scrutinize the high-risk automated decision systems employed by corporations earning above $50 million in annual revenue, companies that receive data from at least one million people or devices and corporations that function as brokers in consumer data transactions.76 This criteria hopes to incline technology's stakeholders to improve the algorithms used to predict consumer behavior, direct consumer's legal rights and rectify those that amass data from publicly accessible physical places.77 For decades, the FTC has defended consumer rights against automated predictive tools that perpetuate unfair and discriminatory outcomes in financial credit underwriting.78 Realizing the potential risks of using intelligent predictive models, the FTC is committed to holding AI 73 Silcox et al., supra note 67, at 10. 74 Joshua New, How to Fix the Algorithm Accountability Act of 2019, CTR.

CONCLUSION Artificial intelligence is here to stay - its ability to comb through patient health information, seeking patterns and providing reliable data for clinicians at the bedside is a remarkable innovation that should be celebrated and made accessible throughout nearly all healthcare facilities. However, we must be conscious of the assumptions these prototypes rely on to deliver care. Socioeconomic factors may be embedded in these algorithms to expose clinicians to areas of care they have long overlooked.

INTRODUCTION Marginalized communities have long suffered from various health disparities including access to healthcare.1 Native Americans in particular suffer from a wide range of socioeconomic, physical, and mental health disparities.2 More than twenty-five percent of Native Americans are living in poverty, and in some reservations, the rate of unemployment is up to thirty-five percent.3 When it comes to being the victim of a violent crime, Native Americans have the highest per capita rate of any marginalized group.4 These factors alone cause an indescribable amount of mental and physical suffering, yet Native Americans suffer significantly from health inequity.5 This article will discuss how telehealth can mitigate these disparities by providing greater access to care. First, the article will look at the history of 1 See generally Paula A. Braveman et al., Health Disparities and Health Equity: The Issue Is Justice, 101(S1) AM. J. PUB.

BACKGROUND In July of 1955, the Indian Health Service (\"IHS\") was created as a part of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") as a way to \"provide federal health services to American Indians and Alaskan Natives.\"6 This agency was created in part because of the Meriam Commission, which pressured an inspection of Office of Indian Affairs.7 This inspection led to the Meriam Report, which exposed the health disparities suffered by American Indians in comparison to the general population, highlighting high death rates and high rates of tuberculosis and trachoma.8 The Meriam Report called for immediate action to create public health clinics and incited a movement in the 1920's to improve overall health outcomes.9 This movement drew attention to the problems and inequities in Native American health care which eventually led to the transfer of Native American Health programs from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Public Health Service in 1954, and a year later the IHS was created.10 IHS has been able to 6 Agency Overview, INDIAN HEALTH SERV. https://www.ihs.gov/aboutihs/overview/ (last visited Feb. 4, 2021); Everett R.

ANALYSIS Telehealth has long been used as a way to ensure that those in remote areas have access to healthcare services.14 About fifty-four percent of American Indians and Native Alaskans live in rural areas, meaning over half of the population suffers from rural health disparities caused by \"geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to healthcare specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities.\"15 As a way to mitigate travel costs and increase access, telehealth has become a crucial part of the IHS's delivery of care.16 This section will discuss the different efforts made to bring telehealth to Native Americans in rural areas. 11 Fact Sheets, Quick Look, INDIAN HEALTH SERV., https://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/factsheets/quicklook/ (last visited Feb. 4, 2021). 12 Smith, supra note 5. 13 Howard Hays et al., The Success of Telehealth Care in the Indian Health Service, 16 AM.

Native American Connectivity Act In 2004 a bill was introduced to Congress called the Native American Connectivity Act (\"NACA\").17 The act was introduced as a way to provide federal grants to tribal governments so they could set up infrastructure to provide telecommunications.18 The Committee on Indian Affairs noted that at the time only ten percent of families living on tribal lands had access to internet and only around seventy percent had telephone service.19 Rural Native American households suffered the same deficiencies.20 NACA was introduced as a way to provide support to these communities.21 One of the specific purposes of the bill was to \"enhance the health of Indian tribal members through the availability and use of telemedicine and telehealth.\"22 The NACA devised a block grant program that would authorize $20 million in 2005 to be appropriated to tribes and organizations whose applications met the necessary criteria.\"23 Though this grant program would easily provide assistance to these communities and improve access to healthcare by making telehealth and telemedicine possible, it did not make it past the Senate.24 It was reintroduced to the 109th Congress in 2005, but once again failed to receive the needed support.25 17 Native American Connectivity Act, S. 2382, 108th Cong.

Rural Health Care Support Mechanism Though the NACA was unsuccessful, Native Americans living in rural areas could benefit from the Rural Health Care Support Mechanism.26 The Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") selects applications for their Rural Health Care (\"RHC\") Pilot Program meant to create infrastructure necessary to support telehealth.27 A significant amount of applicants to the Pilot Program (hereafter \"the Program\") were Native American communities.28 The FCC recognized that tribal lands traditionally have inadequate access to care and the lowest levels of telecommunication services.29 This made them prime candidates for the Program. One example of the Program in action is the Health Care Research and Education Network, meant to serve a large population of Native Americans.30 This Network plans to use its grant to facilitate health care delivery to underserved, rural Native American communities.31 In doing so, and expanding access to care the Program could, in turn, relieve some of the health disparities that plague these communities.32 In 2013, the FCC reformed the Pilot into the Health Care Connect Fund.33 The revision expanded access to broadband for health care providers.34 Part of this involved consulting with the IHS to help incorporate broadband, specifically in the way of collection of data from providers electronically.35 The Health Care Connect Fund goes as far as to mention that it will not preclude the IHS from receiving support because its core purpose is to reach 26 Id.

Affordable Care Act One of the primary goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") is increasing access to healthcare.37 Consistent with this theme the ACA permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (\"IHCIA\").38 The IHCIA is essentially a \"statutory foundation for the provision of health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\"39 In its reinstatement, there were certain modifications made to the IHCIA to improve access to healthcare for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.40 As it pertains to telehealth there are two relevant sections: the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and the Indian Youth Telemental Health Demonstration Project.41 The goal of the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (\"IHCIF\") is to help eliminate disparities in health status and resources in American Indian and Native Alaskan communities in order to make them more equitable.42 In the interest of meeting this goal, IHCIF authorizes the Secretary to appropriate funds to \"[meet] the health needs of Indians in an efficient and 36 Id. 37 David Blumenthal et al., The Affordable Care Act at 10 Years: What's the Effect on Health Care Coverage and Access?, COMMONWEALTH FUND (Feb. 26, 2020) https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2020/feb/aca-at-10-years-effect-health-care-coverage-access. 38 Donald Warne & Linda Bane Frizzel, American Indian Health Policy: Historical Trends and Contemporary Issues, 104(53) Am.

IV. IMPACT The aforementioned programs and Acts were created to increase access to healthcare to Native American populations, but the question remains as to whether or not these provisions truly made a real change to these underserved communities. Unfortunately, there are still remarkable gaps in healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives.48 This is partially due to a lack of funding to the IHS.49 Aside from underfunding, access to care remains a major issue in these communities who sometimes have to travel hours to 43 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(a)(3) (2010). 44 Heisler, supra note 42, at 28. 45 Native American Youth Depression and Suicide, CHILD WELFARE INFO.

The fact is access is still a major issue in Native American communities.66 Only about ten percent of tribal lands have proper access to broadband.67 Cultural views towards technology must be carefully balanced with these technological improvements in order for them to be truly effective.68 Education, both on part of these communities and those trying to promote telehealth, plays a major role in its success.69 If the needs of these local Native American communities are properly implemented into the telehealth system it is likely that usage will expand and improve.70 Even with expansion and improvement of telehealth, the fact is for the 2.2 million Native Americans still living in rural areas, geography remains a major obstacle when it comes to access to care.71 Even those who live in more tribal clinics use telehealth for a range of disciplines: behavioral health, dermatology, cardiology, maternal health, nephrology, rheumatology, endocrinology, infectious diseases and more.\"). 63 Id. 64 Id. 65 See generally Care Beyond Walls and Wires, Using Remote Monitoring to Enhance Patient Care, QUALCOMM WIRELESS REACH (2017) https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/united-states-care-beyond-walls-and-wires.pdf (showing data regarding the benefits of telehealth). 66 Clemens Scott Kruse et al., Telemedicine Use in Rural Native American Communities in the Era of the ACA: A Systematic Literature Review, 40(6) J.

One being to modify the federal spending scheme to make it possible for the IHS to receive IHCIF funding annually, which can be done by modifying the current discretionary spending scheme.86 The President's budget outlines the amount of funding recommended for each program.87 It is possible to propose that the current appropriations to IHS and other American Indian and Alaska Native healthcare need to be revised.88 With the current changes in the political climate of the United States, it is more likely that these social programs will 80 General Questions, supra note 79. 81 IHS Profile, INDIAN HEALTH SERV. https://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/factsheets/ihsprofile/ (Aug. 2020). 82 Fact Sheets, Quick Look, supra note 11. 83 Joe, supra note 75. 84 Smith, supra note 5. 85 Id. 86 See generally, Policy Basics: Introduction to the Federal Budget Process, CTR ON BUDGET AND POL'Y PRIORITIES https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-the-federal-budget-process (Apr. 2, 2020) (discussing the different ways in which Congress makes spending decisions each year). 87 Id. 88 Niv Elis, Biden $1.5T Budget Proposes Major Hike in Social Programs, HILL https://thehill.com/policy/finance/547341-biden-15t-budget-proposes-major-hike-in-social-programs (Apr. 9, 2021) (\"The White House pointed to significant proposed spending increases in programs it said would make the country healthier and more equal...\".). 258 Advance Directive Vol. 30 get much-needed attention.89 Using this momentum would be an attractive opportunity to bring light to the underfunding issue and take this initial step towards mitigating the challenges and barriers the American Indian and Alaska Native communities face in regard to their health and well-being. V. CONCLUSION Native Americans have historically lacked proper access to health care.90 With shorter life expectancy, and higher rates of diabetes, suicide, chronic liver disease and more, Native Americans are a highly vulnerable population.91 Though American Indians and Alaska Natives experience poorer health outcomes than the general population, they face greater access issues.92 The IHS was created as a way to deliver health care services to Native Americans but it remains highly underfunded.93 As a way to cut costs and improve access, telehealth has become a staple in these communities.94 Over the years there have been a few interventions by the Federal Government to help provide the infrastructure to rural Native American and tribal communities to allow for telehealth.95 These interventions have allowed for a multitude of different disciplines to improve care outcomes through telehealth.96 89 Id. 90 Smith, supra note 5. 91 See Arnav Shah et al., The Challenge of COVID-19 and American Indian Health, COMMONWEALTH FUND (Aug. 12, 2020) https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/challenge-covid-19-and-american-indian-health (\"American Indians die at higher rates from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, unintentional injuries, assault/homicide, and self-harm or suicide.\"). 92 Id. 93 Friedman, supra note 48. 94 Hays et al., supra note 13 at 986. 95 See supra note 66, at 7 (discussing the different interventions the Government has implemented or attempted to implement over the years). 96 See generally Hays et al., supra note 13 (noting the different ways telehealth has been used to improve health outcomes over the years). 2021 Telehealth for Native Americans 259 Even with these successes, several barriers remain.97 Access to internet continues to be an issue.98 Beyond access, there are cultural opinions regarding technology that bring an air of skepticism.99 Access to care can be mitigated by telehealth but only to an extent. Without proper funding and attention to the cultural and structural barriers, access will always remain a disparity in the Native American community. 97 See generally, Kaitlynn Ely, Addressing Determinants of Health and Barriers to Care for Native Americans, AMJC (Feb. 11, 2018) https://www.ajmc.com/view/addressing-determinants-of-health-and-barriers-to-care-for-native-americans (discussing barriers that plague Native American access to care in the United States). 98 Kruse et al., supra note 67, at 7. 99 Id. at 8. 260 Advance Directive Vol. 30 261 Those Caught in Between: Why the Government Must Safeguard the Patients Who Rely on Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs Tom Saviski I. INTRODUCTION Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs (\"PAPs\") are programs operated by charitable entities separate from pharmaceutical manufacturers which serve to provide financial assistance to patients who struggle to afford their premiums or cost-sharing obligations.1 Since 2015, large drug manufacturers have been subject to lawsuits by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") under the Anti-Kickback Statute (\"AKS\"), which prohibits the knowing and willful payment of remuneration to induce the generation of business involving any item payable by the Federal health care programs.2 These suits have come about because these manufacturers use PAPs to induce Medicare beneficiaries to use their drugs by covering the patients' cost-sharing obligations for the manufacturer's products yet providing no such coverage for low-cost generic drugs which serve an equivalent purpose.3 These now-common lawsuits can result in multi-million dollar settlements,4 1 John C.

To minimize adverse effects on low-income racial minorities, the government should preserve this economic safety net as much as is reasonably possible without rendering its actions toothless. As such, the OIG should not entirely eliminate patient assistance programs, but instead should provide tighter regulations to ensure transparency in what types of treatments their programs cover and why, and to guarantee coverage of all suitable versions of a treatment with priority towards low-cost generics. The OIG may achieve this by requiring PAPs to submit to regular audits of their operations by independent review organizations to certify compliance with the AKS, similar to the provisions already in place in the CIAs applied to manufacturers in settlements.11 This policy could greatly reduce the risk of fraud without forcing underserved communities to foot the bill and worsening racial disparities in access to medication. While overarching legislation could remedy the loss of a safety net, this article will discuss actions that are currently within the OIG's authority. In doing so, this article will demonstrate how high out-of-pocket expenses have an outsized effect on racial minorities. Next, this article will elaborate on the OIG's duty to minimize barriers to racial minorities' healthcare access that it may cause by regulating Independent Charity PAPs.

II. Background An Independent Charity PAP are programs operated by 501(c)(3) organizations that provides payment assistance for the copays of patients in need.12 These entities provide co-pay assistance to a variety of specialty drugs which can vary in size, the disease they focus on, and what other forms of aid they provide.13 To this end, PAPs are notoriously opaque as to the dollar amounts of co-pay assistance provided to patients, the amount of patient drug use induced by these programs, and how these programs make coverage decisions upon receipt of patient applications.14 This distinct lack of transparency has prevented researchers from fully evaluating the structure and efficacy of these programs.15 Nonetheless, PAPs frame themselves as providing critical relief to patients \"who make too much money to qualify for a free drug program,\" but remain unable to afford expensive copays.16 While there are PAPs directly affiliated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, Independent Charity PAPs are supposed to remain separate from pharmaceutical manufacturers and insulated from their influence.17 However, Independent Charity PAPs are generally funded by contributions from pharmaceutical manufacturers, and there are reports indicating that 12 Hood, supra note 1, at 643-44 13 Id. at 646-47. 14 So-Yeon Kang et al., Financial Eligibility Criteria and Medication Coverage for Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs, 322 JAMA 422, 427 (2019). 15 Id. 16 Id. at 645; Rebecca E.

Greber is central to the AKS, as it established the \"one purpose\" rule.26 This rule states that if any purpose behind an action is to induce referrals, the whole action violates the statute.27 While this rule enables the OIG to safeguard the Federal Healthcare system against fraud, it does not address how to handle patients who were reliant on the financial assistance provided by PAPs, and are now without their primary means of accessing healthcare.28 Thus, the benefits in preventing manufacturer kickbacks caused by Independent Charity PAPs go primarily to insurers and do not immediately transfer to patients who have relied on the cost-sharing support provided by these PAPs as prices continue to rise.29 One area of concern is the risk that removing the PAPs safety net poses in light of an affordability crisis.30 Increased healthcare costs pose a risk to low-income racial minorities who already face high barriers to medication access and adherence to medication regimens.31 As the poverty rates for racial minorities are generally higher than non-Hispanic whites, the loss of cost- 25 See Generally DEP'T OF HEALTH AND HUM.

AN OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE While the OIG's scrutiny of Independent Charity PAPs and pharmaceutical manufacturers for AKS violations is within its authority,38 it must consider how discouraging charities, fearful of expensive litigation,39 from continuing their operation of the programs these patients rely on for financial assistance may hinder these patients' access to medication. As they currently operate, Independent Charity PAPs raise prices to the benefit of pharmaceutical companies without considering how rising prices may affect a community's ability to access its medications.40 Nonetheless, Independent Charity PAPs have positioned themselves as a de facto safety net for patients unable to afford their cost-sharing obligations.41 To this end, it has been argued that the OIG's aggressive enforcement of the AKS, which cost eight drug companies over $645 million dollars combined in 2019 alone,42 has a chilling effect on both charities and donors at the expense of vulnerable patients.43 Thus, regulating PAPs in a manner that would strip vulnerable communities of a lifeline. However, permitting PAPs to exist as proxies for manufacturer kickbacks only worsens a primary barrier to equal healthcare access\u2014high cost.44 As it works to end the use of Independent 37 Hood, supra note 1, at 642. 38 See Generally, Inspector General Act of 1978, 5a U.S.C. \u00a74; About OIG, HHS-OIG, https://oig.hhs.gov/about-oig/. 1, at 641. 40 Howard, supra note 21, at 98. 41 Wolitz, supra note 16, at 1199. 42 Scott Liebman et al., Scrutiny of Patient Assistance Program Funding is Rising\u00b8 LAW360 (Dec. 5, 2019), https://www.law360.com/articles/1225231/scrutiny-of-patient-assistance-program-funding-is-rising. 43 Hood, supra note 1, at 641. 44 Off. of Disease Prevention & Health Promotion, Access to Health Services, HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020, https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Access-to-Health-Services (last visited Feb. 14, 2021). 2021 Those Caught in Between 269 Charity PAPs as vehicles for kickbacks, the OIG must preserve the safety net PAPs provide to ensure that it does not worsen racial disparities in medication access. To this end, the OIG should make AKS compliance terms clearer by further tightening regulations on PAPs and requiring transparency in the source and use of donations, mandating coverage of low-cost generics, and allowing certifications of compliance by third party auditors such as independent review organizations. V. TRANSPARENCY IN DONATIONS Information transparency is crucial for effective medical treatment, yet information surrounding Independent Charity PAPs funds and their uses remains unacceptably opaque.45 Requiring greater transparency grants the OIG more certainty that a PAP will comply with regulations and will enable the agency to set clearer standards for what constitutes an AKS violation as greater transparency requirements allows for more to be data available as to PAPs' donation sources, patient application processes, and reasoning for their criteria for which drugs are eligible for copay-assistance.46 These requirements may allow the OIG to better pinpoint the practices or organizational structures that allow manufacturers to use PAPs as conduits for kickbacks.47 A key criticism of the OIG's 2014 special guidance bulletin is that it still enables PAPs to operate with little transparency as to which drugs are eligible under their program.48 45 Kang et al., supra note 14, at 427, SUZANNE M.

Similarly, a Congressional Research Service report found that the lack of transparency makes it difficult to determine the actual effectiveness of PAPs in aiding patients access their medications.53 Public disclosure will make proving AKS violations significantly easier and faster, and will drastically increase the risk and cost of litigation borne by ill-intentioned manufacturers.54 Compare similar applications of greater information transparency regarding medical malpractice through communication-and-resolution programs: swift disclosures of harm, commitment to investigating 49 Id. 50 Id. 51 Id. 52 Katrina Armstrong et al., Racial/Ethnic Differences in Physician Distrust in the United States, 97(7) AM.

Such disclosures would also allow pharmaceutical manufacturers to make tax-deductible charitable contributions to PAPs without fear of a lawsuit, while also preventing them from using those contributions for kickback schemes. This may serve to deter the troublesome practice of manipulating prices. VI. INDEPENDENT CHARITY PAPS MUST PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR GENERICS Manufacturers' main price-raising method is narrowing the criteria the PAP uses to provide cost-sharing assistance to such a degree that only patients who opt for their specific brand will receive said assistance.58 The OIG has addressed this concern in previous bulletins, requiring that all Independent Charity PAPs: 1) refrain from narrowing the definition of widely recognized disease states; 2) refrain from maintaining any disease fund providing assistance for copays for a single drug or the drugs of a single manufacturer; and 3) refrain from limiting assistance to high-cost or specialty 55 Chih-Ming Liang, Rethinking the Tort Liability System and Patient Safety: From the Conventional Wisdom to Learning from Litigation, 12 IND.

Some states such as Massachusetts and California have taken steps to prohibit manufacturers from providing payment assistance for drugs with generic equivalents.64 These statutes do not prevent PAPs from offering assistance to patients, but instead hold PAPs to the standard set out according 59 Supplemental Special Advisory Bulletin, supra note 6, at 31121. 60 Kang et al., supra note 14, at 427. 61 Warren and Whitehouse, supra note 46, at 3. 62 Kang et al., supra note 14, at 423. 63 Id. 64 Richard P.

Nonetheless, it is important to consider that if Independent Charity PAPs are stripped of their ability to allow manufacturers to skirt the AKS, these manufacturers may cease their contributions, and PAPs' abilities to assist patients might drop significantly as said contributions constitute a significant portion of their funding.67 Existing enforcement actions have already caused a decrease in manufacturer contributions to PAPs.68 However, this trend may indicate that Independent Charity PAPs' existence in the industry was primarily to enable kickbacks, a detriment to the U.S. healthcare system as a whole. Regardless, the OIG's obligation should not be to preserve PAPs in spite of their harm to the system, but to ensure that any deprivation of racial minorities' access to healthcare that results from its regulatory actions is kept to a minimum.69 VII.

To assist in this process, the OIG should allow audits by independent review organizations to certify compliance with the AKS to remove any uncertainty that may discourage the operation of Independent Charity PAPs in their entirety. Such a requirement is a hallmark of the CIAs put in place by the OIG in settlements with companies like Pfizer, which involve Independent Charity PAP abuse.73 While charitable foundations and manufacturers alike will undoubtedly be displeased to undertake frequent audits, they are bound to be less expensive and time consuming than expensive settlements, which are likely to require such audits in the resulting CIAs anyway.74 These audits should be performed with the end goal of determining the best means for PAPs to adhere to OIG guidelines. To this end, a study investigating desired improvements to PAPs in clinical staff found eighty-four percent pointing towards a need for greater standardization for the patient application process and eligibility.75 70 Hood, supra note 1, at 641. 71 Id. 72 Publication of OIG Special Advisory Bulletin on Patient Assistance Programs for Medicare Part D Enrollees, 70 Fed.

Further, such audits could be used to determine if foundations are not properly disclosing how funds earmarked for PAPs are being used.76 Taken another way, these audits can allow the OIG to be proactive in enforcing the requirements as laid out in the 2005 and 2014 special advisory bulletins as opposed to bringing forth a lawsuit for every single infraction. It is important for the OIG not to make it profitable to violate the AKS, but it also should not make it too risky in terms of cost for PAPs to operate in general. To this end, a regular audit provides both charities and manufacturers a relative certainty as to cost, compared to the variable cost of litigation.77 While manufacturers are reasonably concerned about the increasing costs of healthcare compliance, the penalties of violations are not to be ignored.78 Therefore, for the OIG to certify that an Independent Charity PAP is compliant with the 2005 and 2014 Special Advisory Bulletins may quell fears from the charities and the manufacturer's that their actions will prompt a billion-dollar lawsuit. In recognition of this point, the OIG notes that compliance with the requirements set out in its guidance will keep the PAP in the OIG's good graces.79 Despite this, manufacturers and PAPs may be unwilling to pay the extra cost of compliance, which may even deter even well-intentioned charitable efforts.80 To require that the OIG verify every individual PAP that 2014) (citing to KS Duke et al., Patient-Assistance Programs: Assessment of and Use by Safety-Net Clinics, 62 AM.

VIII. CONCLUSION Overall, Independent Charity PAPs have undoubtedly served as a conduit for kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers to patients who, in the face of rising costs, have become reliant on the financial aid PAPs provide.81 The OIG is well within its authority to regulate PAPs so no violation of the AKS goes unpunished, but in doing so it should consider those caught in between: low-income patients, an outsized portion of whom are racial minorities.82 In light of well documented disparities in access to medication in minority populations, it is especially important that the OIG does not exacerbate these disparities in its attempts to safeguard the federal healthcare system. For the OIG to best preserve the safety net Independent Charity PAPs provide, the OIG must hold PAPs to a higher regulatory standard: mandating greater transparency in donations, mandating PAPs cover generic alternatives, and requiring regular certifications that the PAPs are compliant with OIG guidelines. To this end, transparency will allow for both the OIG and academia alike to better scrutinize PAPs for possible AKS violation while mandatory support for generics may serve to eliminate the main method manufacturers use to steer patients to their products. In turn, the OIG should require the PAPs undergo regular audits so it may certify that PAPs are compliant with their guidelines, granting manufacturers and charities alike a degree of certainty their actions will not result in costly litigation.

INTRODUCTION The opioid epidemic began in the 1990s and has since persisted with ferocity, wreaking havoc across the nation.1 Opioids are a class of drugs used to treat pain and can come in the form of prescription opioids, fentanyl, or heroin.2 Millions of Americans have felt the devastating effects of addiction to these drugs with white people, specifically white men, experiencing the highest rates of misuse.3 Unsurprisingly, given that racial disparities pervade virtually every level of the U.S. healthcare system, minorities do not have the same access to opioid treatment as their white counterparts, however, minorities are experiencing opioid overdose.4 Drugs like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone have been proven to reduce opioid use by 1 Understanding the Epidemic, CTRS.

Then it will cover the toll the epidemic has taken on society and briefly present the treatment options available to those with opioid addictions. Finally, this article will analyze the racial disparities in access to effective opioid addiction treatment and propose solutions to this problem of inequity. II. BACKGROUND A. The History of the Opioid Epidemic A number of factors contributed to making the opioid epidemic what it is today, however, the general consensus is that pharmaceutical companies can take the lion's share of the blame.6 In the second half of the twentieth century, there were growing concerns within the medical community of the under-treatment of pain.7 The World Health Organization responded to the issue of under-treatment, specifically of cancer patient pain, with the Cancer Pain Monograph in 1986.8 Soon after, in 1990, Ronald Melzack published an article in Scientific American questioning why opioids were not being used regularly to treat other chronic pain states.9 This sentiment grew and by 1990 5 Heroin Research Report: What Are the Treatments for Heroin Use Disorder?, NAT'L INST.

The Toll of Addiction and Treatment Options Opioids are highly addictive because they have the ability to provide intense feelings of pleasure.21 These feelings of pleasure can only be replicated by increasing dosages as tolerance to the medication builds thereby creating an inescapable dependence.22 This dependence often results in drug seeking behaviors and a number of other undesirable side effects.23 Opioid addiction takes a personal, societal, and economic toll on those affected.

ANALYSIS A. The Problem -- Inequitable Access to Treatment on the West Side The opioid epidemic has largely been focused on white suburban and rural communities.33 Yet, Black/African American drug overdose deaths increased by forty percent between 2015 to 2016 compared to a twenty-one percent increase for the general population.34 The west side of Chicago, comprised of predominantly black neighborhoods,35 is an area that has been hit particularly hard by the opioid epidemic.36 Black people make up about thirty-two percent of the Chicago population but account for forty-eight percent of all opioid deaths in the city.37 A number of factors have contributed to this result, but the problem is certainly exacerbated by unequitable access to treatment. As Bechteler and Kane-Willis of the Chicago Urban League explain, \"most large cities do not have the capacity to treat all of those who need treatment.\"38 Considering that 32 Id. 33 See generally, Julie Netherland, & Helena B.

Those living in poorer neighborhoods where people are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, like the West Side, are largely left out of the treatment equation.39 Thomas Britton, the CEO of the Gateway Foundation, which has a treatment center on the West Side, said in an interview with Crain's that the waiting list for residential care of Medicaid recipients can reach 1,000 people whereas those with private insurance can usually get in the same day.40 This is the result of low state reimbursement rates that simply cannot compete with the three to four times higher reimbursement rates that private insurance will pay.41 In addition, federal rules cap the number of patients that doctors may prescribe treatment drugs like buprenorphine to. \"In Illinois, seventy-seven percent of providers are limited to thirty patients.\"42 The maximum amount of patients a doctor can be treating with buprenorphine at a time is 275.43 While there certainly needs to be measures taken to address opioid addiction in these communities before it begins, -- like investment in underprivileged schools, childcare, and jobs programs -- the solutions presented in this article will focus on access to treatment after addiction to opioids has already occurred. 39 Schorsch, supra note 4 (\"Those who can afford private insurance jump to the front of the line.

Potential Solutions Illinois is notorious for its unbalanced budget and fiscal woes.44 This fact often means that calls for increased spending, especially for something like drug addiction, fall on deaf ears. However, law makers ought to look at the bigger picture. One where spending now saves costs later. For example, the State of Virginia, started the Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services (ARTS) program in 2017 to radically raise reimbursement rates for opioid use treatment covered by Medicaid.45 Following the implementation of this initiative, in the first nine months, the number of Medicaid recipients on opioids who received treatment increased by twenty-nine percent, while opioid use disorder related ER trips declined thirty-one percent.46 Additionally, treatment providers grew to 2,544, about three times the pre-program mount.47 Recently, Illinois proposed an amendment to its Medicaid State plan that was approved to increase rates of reimbursement for certain mental health and substance use disorder services by just two percent, effective July 1, 2020.48 To understand the effectiveness, or lack thereof, compare this approved increase with the recent Virginia's ARTS reimbursement rate increases. For example, the old rate for substance abuse intensive outpatient treatment was a few dollars/hour. Under the new program, the rate is several hundred dollars per day.49 In order to see similar decreases in opioid 44 See generally Ted Dabrowski & John Klingner, The History of Illinois' Fiscal Crisis, ILL.

It will ultimately create more equitable access to treatment for those on the West Side and have the added bonus of being a cost saving measure in the long run.50 For those in poverty, like many on the West Side, transportation and childcare are additional barriers to access medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction.51 Ideally, Illinois would see a similar increase in the number of providers that Virginia saw thereby increasing access and reducing treatment wait times. An expansion in providers can help integrate healthcare into the West Side community with the increased locations helping to mitigate transportation issues. Childcare concerns could be addressed with individualized treatment plans that allow for less frequent in-person visits. With the rise of telehealth,52 state and federal laws should adjust to allow providers to determine more flexible treatment plans that enable patients to visit with physicians either from a computer or by cell phones, which are more commonly available. Additionally, the city should incentivize physicians, particularly those serving the West Side, to get certified in buprenorphine administration.

IV. CONCLUSION The opioid epidemic is not going anywhere and for communities like the West Side, it will only get worse as they are left out of the treatment equation. In order to address the disparate treatment of opioid use among minorities on the West Side, a wide array of solutions must be considered and implemented. However, the state should start by drastically increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for treatment. The City of Chicago can further help by incentivizing physicians with patient capacity to get certified in the prescribing of buprenorphine.

INTRODUCTION The 1973 case Roe v. Wade established that United States citizens have a constitutionally protected right to obtain a safe abortion without excessive government restriction.1 This right to abortion was vested in the right to privacy, be it from the Fourteenth Amendment or Ninth Amendment.2 However, this right is not absolute, as states maintain the right to regulate and ensure the safeguarding of their citizen's health and to protect potential life.3 Immediately following Roe v. Wade, several states passed individual restrictions to attack abortion through funding, waiting periods, and any other requirements.4 These states are very clear about the intent behind their restrictions, as they also have laws declaring the state's intent to ban abortion to the full extent permitted by the United States Constitution.5 One of the most consequential challenges to Roe came not from the states but from the federal government in the form of the Hyde Amendment in 1979.6 This Amendment was created to limit federal funding, namely Medicaid funds, from paying for any non-emergency abortion.7 In the years 1 Roe v.

McRae, where the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that while the state could not excessively restrict someone from seeking an abortion, as it was under no obligation to remove obstacles such as financial burden.9 The dissenting opinion indicated that the Hyde Amendment effectively allows states to ban the right to abortion for low-income individuals who heavily rely on Medicaid to pay for all their medical care.10 The result of the holding of this case not only perpetuates the cycle of poverty; it also continues to disproportionately impact women of color.11 As of 2015, approximately 12.9 million women in the United States rely on Medicaid, including twenty percent women of reproductive age (women aged 15-44).12 This rate is even higher for black and Hispanic American women.13 Encouraging women to rely on Medicaid for necessary coverage while allowing states to restrict the ability of Medicaid to pay for abortive care essentially creates a two-tier system of rights where only those with the ability to afford abortion truly have the right to it.14 One in every three low- 8 Id. 9 Harris v.

Finally, these arguments will be applied to abortion and the Hyde Amendment to demonstrate how the Government's decision to fund childbirth but not abortion is both coercive and corrupting of the supposedly constitutionally guaranteed right to choose to get an abortion. II. ARGUMENT A. Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine The Spending Clause grants Congress almost limitless power in how it chooses to distribute resources.21 However, there is one caveat; the government may not deny a discretionary benefit such as cash to a person on any basis that infringes upon their constitutional protected rights, specifically that of freedom of speech.22 This principal, known as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, was established by the Supreme Court in 1926 in Frost & Frost Trucking Company v. Railroad Commission of California.23 Nearly 100 years later, the seemingly inconsequential doctrine has been interpreted and applied by the Court in many ways,24 creating notoriously complicated, 21 Stephen Miller & Dylan Alper, Re-examining funding and the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, LEGAL INTELLIGENCE (Mar. 14, 2013), https://www.cozen.com/news-resources/publications/2013/re-examining-funding-and-the-unconstitutional-conditions-doctrine. 22 See id.

Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192 (1991) (Upholding funding conditions forbidding family planning organizations from discussing abortion as a family planning option because the speech restrictions were within the scope of the funding program), with Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 549 (2001) (Rejecting funding conditions forbidding civil legal aid organizations from voicing challenges on the constitutionality of current welfare laws despite being within the scope of the program). 2021 Hyde Amendment's Commodification 295 convoluted, and inconsistent rules.25 However, as constitutional scholars have noted, this ambiguity is no reason to avoid the doctrine, as it plays a vital role as a sort of constitutional \"glue.\"26 Disregarding it would empower the government to act both coercively toward the individual and in a way that corrupts the public good of some rights,27 specifically the right to choose to get an abortion.28 B. Anti-Commodification A vital part of having rights is the ability to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over when to exercise those rights.29 While this autonomy is a core constitutional value, constitutional rights exist to do more than simply maximize autonomy.30 Consider, for example, the right to vote. Most of society would agree that allowing people to sell their right to vote to the government would be damaging despite it being a restriction of autonomy.31 The anti-commodification doctrine seeks to explain and prevent potential issues that can arise when rights are treated as transferable commodities.32 Anti-Commodification arguments generally fall into one of two categories: coercion or corruption.33 25 See Philip Hamburger, Unconstitutional Conditions: The Irrelevance of Consent, 98 VA. L. REV. 479, 480 (2012). (\"This enigma is notoriously complex, and unconstitutional conditions therefore are considered a sort of Gordian knot.\"). 26 Louis W.

Coercion Much of the debate around anti-commodification is focused on coercion and consent.34 The main worry is that conditions of extreme inequality might create a situation of desperate economic necessity in which people have fundamentally no choice but to waive their rights.35 Not only can socioeconomic realities coerce people into waiving their rights, but due to the way inequality is structured in the United States, it can create a future in which the rightsholders are divided into classes based their socioeconomic status.36 Although the Court has struggled with inconsistent application and contradictions over time,37 the unconstitutional conditions doctrine's modern interpretation of coercion has been used to prevent the federal government from overly conditioning funding based on principals of federalism38 and free speech.39 Regarding the topic of Medicaid expansion in NFIB v. Sebelius, the Court struck down the requirement that states expand Medicaid duties to cover all people under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty line.40 The court reasoned that threatening states with a \"loss of over 10 percent\" of their budget was coercive and violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine because it left them with \"no real option but to acquiesce.\"41 34 Id. 35 Glenn Cohen, Regulating the Organ Market: Normative Foundations for Market Regulation, 77 L. & CONTEMP.

The cost incurred by voters to transport themselves to the polls is not nearly as significant as the burdens that low-income pregnant people faces as they scavenge, scrimp, save, sell, and sacrifice to pay for unsubsidized medical care.55 For most indigent pregnant people, the offer of funded childbirth versus out-of-pocket abortion is so coercive that they are left with no real option but to acquiesce to the government's preferred choice.56 ii.

Alliance for Open Society International, Inc. in which the Court struck down the government's restriction of funding to U.S-based NGO's who refuse to adopt policy \"explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking\"63 The Court ruled the policy requirement placed an unconstitutional condition on the NGO's ability to exercise their First Amendment rights.64 In the context of abortion, AID is vital as it highlights the Court's modern, consistent, approach to unconstitutional conditions questions regarding the first amendment.65 While the majority in AID claims to apply a \"scope of the program test,\"66 upon closer inspection, the line the Court attempts to draw is incredibly 58 Cohen, supra note 35, at 73. 59 Fisher, supra note 26, at 1190. 60 Id. 61 Glenn Cohen, The Price of Everything, the Value of Nothing: Reframing the Commodification Debate, 117 HARV.

Not only does allowing the right to vote to be sold pose issues where lower-income citizens are coerced into selling their rights, it also denigrates the value of the right for those who have not sold it.79 Similarly, the sale of free speech rights also would produce adverse effects on the citizenry at large.80 This reasoning is further supported by the Courts revisiting of AID in 2020 as applied to non-citizen NGO's, where it was held that foreign citizens do not have First Amendment rights and therefore the rights cannot be coerced or corrupted.81 The holding of McRae stated that Medicaid did not create an obligation for the government to cover any healthcare benefits.82 The government instead could choose to exclude certain benefits as part of Medicaid or structure conditions for receiving certain benefits.83 This essentially is a rephrasing of the scope of the program test later rejected by AID, as it allows the government excessive control and power in deciding what conditions restricting Medicaid funding are allowed or commodifiable.84 The restriction of funding abortion while funding childbirth costs essentially translates into a governmental purchase of the right to choose an abortion.85 Not only does this raise issues with coercion of low-income pregnant people based on their socioeconomic status, but it corrupts the right of the individual people to autonomously choose to get an abortion and structure their life the way they choose.86 In addition to this loss of individual dignity, 78 Id. 79 Sandel, supra note 62, at 118. 80 William T.

Several states courts have ruled that bans on state Medicaid funding for abortion violate the state constitution.89 Massachusetts, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, and West Virginia have all used framework under the neutrality principal to argue that a government's decision to fund one option of a protected choice while failing to fund the other is unconstitutional.90 III. CONCLUSION As more is put under the shadow of its influence, the common law jurisprudence of the Hyde Amendment deserves a contextual reproach. The Hyde Amendment claims to be a constitutional way for the government to subsidize certain constitutionally protected conduct while refusing to subsize others. This decision is counterintuitive to the unconstitutional conditions doctrine because it forces pregnant people to sacrifice their right to choose to get an abortion to not incur a structural deficit. To continue to allow the Hyde Amendment to prevent Medicaid from funding abortion while allowing it to fund child rearing is to coerce a pregnant person to give up their first 87 Harris v.

INTRODUCTION Amidst the constant political bickering concerning America's national debt,1 many fail to consider that tax expenditures on employer-sponsored insurance plans lose the American government upwards of a trillion dollars every year in unrealized federal tax revenue.2 Employer-sponsored insurance (\"ESI\") plans are group health care plans provided by employers that offer coverage to employees and usually include the employees dependents and spouses.3 Of the nearly $1.3 trillion deducted in tax revenue in 2019,4 $234 billion of potential federal tax revenue came from costs relating to health care.5 Exclusion of employer-contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care was by far the most costly, costing an estimated $227 billion in potential tax revenue in 2021.6 For contextual purposes, consider that the expected next most-costly tax expenditure in 2021 will likely be preferential rate structure for capital gains and dividends, which is estimated to cost the 1 McBride et al., The National Debt Dilemma, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELS (Sept. 9, 2020, 8:00 AM), https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/national-debt-dilemma (last visited Mar. 2, 2021). 2 Policy Basics: Federal Tax Expenditures, CTR.

Section I of this article includes a brief perspective on the lost potential in unrealized federal tax revenue that comes from not taxing ESI plans, while section II offers background on tax expenditures for ESI plans. Section III discusses previous failures to overhaul tax expenditures for ESI plans, and section IV offers a reasonable model for tax expenditures on ESI plans, including several sub-sections explaining the benefits of this proposed model. II. BACKGROUND ON ESI TAX EXPENDITURES Tax expenditures are losses in potential tax revenue for the federal government due to special exclusions which result in either a tax exemption or a deferral of tax liability.8 Tax expenditures first became intertwined with employer-sponsored insurance plans in the Revenue Act of 1918, specifically section 215 article 294, which declared \"[p]remiums paid by a partnership for accident and health insurance policies covering the lives of the individual partners are not deductible from gross income of the partnership.\"9 This expenditure did not initially benefit many Americans according to Melissa Thomasson, an economist at Miami University.10 Thomasson writes that prior to 1930, most patients were simply treated by their family members as 7 Id. 8 Tax Expenditures, U.S. DEP'T OF TREASURY (2020), https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/tax-policy/tax-expenditures. 9 Treas.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY TAX EXPENDITURES ON ESI PLANS There have been numerous attempts in the past to either abolish or limit the amount of tax benefits ESI plans receive.16 For example, the Reagan administration proposed taxing ESIs in 1983, which at the time, was expected to raise $2.7 billion a year.17 The issue with President Reagan's plan lies in 11 Id. at 4. 12 Treas.

Consider that, in 2019, an astounding 49.6% of Americans received their healthcare through ESI plans.26 Completely abolishing tax expenditures for ESIs would likely result in many employers refusing to offer ESI plans, potentially leaving tens of millions of Americans suddenly without insurance.27 While it is true that many of these employees would quickly be able to find and enroll in another insurance plan, especially with the tax credits proposed by McCain, expecting tens of millions of Americans to immediately find an insurance plan that is risky. IV. A REASONABLE MODEL FOR TAX EXPENDITURES ON ESI PLANS A reasonable approach to tax expenditures on ESIs would be to limit tax expenditures on ESI plans above certain thresholds - for example, using the Cadillac Tax's threshold of $8,500 for individuals and $23,00 for families.28 25 Megan Messerly, Biden Predicts Cadillac Tax Repeal, Promises Culinary Members Can Keep Their Union Health Plan If He's Elected President, NEV.

Encouraging Proper Healthcare Competition Limiting tax expenditures on ESIs and using the revenue to provide a tax credit to Americans who do not opt-in to their employer's ESI would encourage proper competition in the American healthcare industry, which would result in lower prices and benefit most Americans.37 Many economists consider the cause of America's high healthcare costs to be a lack of proper competition in the industry.38 Currently, high-income healthcare consumers who benefit from tax expenditures on ESI plans have no reason to shop around for their healthcare, meaning that healthcare companies have no reason to act competitively, which results in high healthcare costs.39 Economist Bruce Bartlett succinctly summarized this phenomenon stating; \"overbuying health insurance fueled medical cost inflation, which raised health insurance premiums, which drove up the cost of employee compensation while pushing down cash wages.\"40 This phenomenon was caused by the fact that employees with ESI plans had no reason to be concerned with rising healthcare costs as those employees were already covered through their plans.41 Subsequently, the cost of healthcare skyrocketed for those that either had their own health insurance plans or who 36 U.S. GOV'T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-12-166R, JOB LOCK AND PPACA, 3 (2011). 37 CONG.

President Biden has not yet made an official statement on this issue since taking office, but as he was President Obama's Vice President when the Affordable Care Act was passed, and because the Affordable Care Act was intertwined with the Cadillac Tax, Biden could have an interest in the matter.68 President Biden could very well abandon any plan to limit tax expenditures on ESI plans due to the Cadillac Tax's unpopularity with American voters.69 This unpopularity is understandable - if you ask any American what they would think of eliminating tax expenditures on ESI plans, most would likely oppose the idea. Without an in-depth explanation of the benefits of limiting tax expenditures on ESIs, most Americans do not realize limiting tax expenditures and using the funds to give tax credits to Americans would result in proper competition in the American health care 67 See Glassdoor Team, INFOGRAPHIC: The Age of Social Recruiting, GLASSDOOR (March 1, 2013), https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/infographic-the-age-of-social-recruiting/#prettyPhoto (Glassdoor 2013 survey finding that 43% of employees are more incentivized to take a job if an employer offers health benefits; this proved to be more popular than if an employer offers a flexible work schedule (37% of respondents), if an employer offers work-from-home options (23% of respondents), and if an employer offers stock options (15% of respondents)). 68 See Healthcare, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT (2021), https://joebiden.com/healthcare/ (stating that President Biden plans to \"build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate\", meaning that Biden plans to keep some elements of the Affordable Care Act.

INTRODUCTION Federalism is especially pronounced in Medicaid due to the program's joint federal-state structure predicated on cooperation that gives states wide latitude in tailoring both the implementation of covered benefits and the eligibility for coverage.1 This has led to fragmentation and exclusion since the program's inception.2 The dynamic has been accentuated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (\"ACA\") efforts to encourage the expansion of Medicaid through enhanced federal matching funds, an incentive that did not entirely succeed\u2014owing in large part to the Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business (\"NFIB\") v. Sebelius.3 In NFIB v. Sebelius, the Court concluded that mandatory Medicaid expansion would be coercive because a state's refusal of the ACA's financial inducement entailed the loss of all of that state's pre-ACA Medicaid funding.4 As a result, the Court rendered Medicaid expansion 1 Abbe Gluck & Nicole Huberfeld, The New Health Care Federalism on the Ground, 15 INDIANA HEALTH L.

The first part of this paper addresses the purpose of health care federalism\u2014whether it is an end it itself or a means to better outcomes\u2014by examining emerging evidence of better health outcomes across an array of measures for patients in states that have chosen to expand Medicaid. The second part of this paper focuses on a proposal to finance federalized Medicaid using certain ACA taxes or creating other substantially similar ones. The notion may be appealing because it could be a way to advance the goal of uniformity in Medicaid coverage, but it also raises difficult questions concerning opinions of Medicaid in general. The prospect of financing federalized Medicaid as a solution necessitates confronting problems of fragmentation and exclusion in health care. II.

REDUCED RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND GENDER DISPARITIES By a number of measures, Medicaid expansion has resulted in improvements in racial, ethnic, and gender disparities and better health outcomes.26 States that have expanded Medicaid as the ACA provides have seen significant reductions in racial disparities in maternal health and infant health, with lower maternal mortality rates and lower infant mortality rates.27 Medicaid expansion has given women of childbearing age greater 21 Nicole Huberfeld, Federalizing Medicaid, 14 U.

This raises pointed questions about why some states have chosen not to expand Medicaid.51 Evidence suggests that opposition is at least partly ideological or partisan: for instance, the Maine legislature passed bills to implement expansion five times only to have them vetoed each time by Governor LePage, a staunch opponent of the ACA.52 Even after a referendum passed with 59% of Maine voters supporting expansion, Governor LePage stated that he would rather \"go to jail\" than expand the program, out of ardent concern for the effects of expansion on the state budget.53 Likewise, when the ACA was debated in 2010, a Texas congressman characterized Medicaid expansion as an \"unprecedented loss 50 Id. 51 See Ian Millhiser, supra note 25, at 536 (stating that \"[u]nder our current system, programs like Medicaid can be disrupted either by federal officials or by state governments that refuse to cooperate\u2014just ask the millions of Americans denied health insurance because their state governments would not participate in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion\"); see David Orentlicher, supra note 14, at 186-87 (posing the questions, \"Does the ACA signal a more generous view of the deserving poor, or even an abandonment of the distinction between the poor and the 'deserving' poor? Or does the ACA tell us more about the nature of health care than about societal views of the poor?

Indeed, in the study showing better health outcomes after heart attacks for patients in a Medicaid expansion state, the control state was Florida, whose governors since the passage of the ACA have been stalwart in refusing its incentives to expand the program.55 Consequently, Florida has denied about 1,362,000 Floridians coverage under Medicaid, of whom an estimated 384,000 have no realistic alternative route to health insurance coverage, reflecting a coverage gap.56 As a result, Florida has in effect also turned away $65.2 billion over the next decade in additional federal funding.57 A similar situation in Texas has resulted in about 1,685,000 Texans who would have been covered if the state implemented the ACA as provided, with Texas turning away in effect some $114.2 billion over the next decade.58 The refusal to accept federal funding for Medicaid expansion reflects the continuing ideological and partisan contentiousness of Medicaid expansion.59 These stalemates suggest that some states may view the 54 See 156 Cong.

IV. FEDERALIZING AND FINANCING MEDICAID Transforming Medicaid into a program run by the federal government could be a solution to both the problem of fragmented implementation and the uncertainty of budgetary impacts on states.60 Medicaid reimagined as a fully federal program could relieve states of the burden of budgeting for Medicaid spending altogether and thereby remove the political pressure on governors and state legislatures in non-expansion states to modify the aims of Medicaid in order to uphold disparate ideological or partisan commitments.61 To be sure, successful ballot initiatives have highlighted the mismatch between voters' support for Medicaid expansion within non-expansion states and the refusal of their governors and/or state legislatures to implement the provision as enacted by the ACA.62 But the analysis here essentially brackets issues of whether federalizing Medicaid would face legislative and political challenges and other potential issues that would arise from the precise form of such legislation. Thus, rather than grappling with the notion that health care federalism might be constitutionally expansion as \"still a contentious issue\" in states where \"the legislature and/or governor are still strongly opposed to accepting federal funding to expand Medicaid\"). 60 Huberfeld, supra note 21, at 473. See, e.g., Makhlouf, supra note 1, at 1760 (noting that state constitutional balanced budget mandates \"[mean] that during economic recessions, states must find ways to cut spending...[which] disproportionately affect countercyclical spending programs such as Medicaid...there is pressure for the state to restrict eligibility criteria and services in order to limit spending\"). 61 Huberfeld, supra note 21, at 473; Millhiser, 25, at 537; see, e.g., Sarah Kliff, supra note 52 (discussing the strategy of using a ballot initiative in 2017 to pass a referendum on Medicaid expansion in Maine, which led to similar campaigns in Nebraska, Utah, Idaho, and Missouri\u2014all states whose governor and/or state legislatures opposed expansion). 62 See id.

Debates over the preservation of states' roles are not based on considerations about the primary function of each level of government with respect to health insurance regulation and finance...rather, they are mainly about policy disagreements.\"). 64 Snyder & Rudowitz, supra note 18.

V. CONCLUSION Following the Supreme Court's decision in NFIB v. Sebelius, the ACA's provision for Medicaid expansion preserved, and arguably enhanced, health care federalism. The current impasse in Medicaid expansion reflects certain states' fundamental disagreements over the purpose of the program and raises questions about the purpose of health care federalism in the 97 See, e.g., Doug Badger, Medicaid Work Requirements Could Help the Poor, NAT'L REV. (Jan. 8, 2019), https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/medicaid-work-requirements-way-out-of-poverty/ (framing work requirements in terms of Medicaid recipients' self-interest, in that Medicaid coverage otherwise creates \"perverse incentives...Work requirements help break this dynamic, discouraging long-term dependency.\"). 98 Huberfeld, supra note 21, at 435. 99 See supra notes 8-13 and accompanying text; see discussion supra Sections II, III. 100 Garfield & Rudowitz, supra note 13. Moreover, access to Medicaid is increasingly bound up with the aim of advancing quality measurement. See, e.g., Quality of Care Performance Measurement, Medicaid.gov, https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/quality-of-care-performance-measurement/index.html (last visited Apr. 10, 2021) (stating that, \"[t]he use of quality measurement helps strengthen accountability and support performance improvement initiatives at numerous levels\" and listing seven areas of focus that suggest that higher quality care and better outcomes are major goals of access to care through Medicaid). 101 See generally Huberfeld, supra note 21. 102 Id. 2021 Financing Federalized Medicaid 337 abstract\u2014whether it is an end in itself or a means to better health outcomes. Emerging evidence demonstrates that Medicaid expansion results in increased access to care and better health outcomes across several measures, from maternal and infant health to more timely primary care, more effective cardiac care, and earlier cancer treatment, with significant reductions in racial, ethnic, and gender disparities. Federalizing Medicaid may be a solution for two enduring problems. First, it would mitigate fragmentation and inefficiency in the way Medicaid, as it currently exists, is implemented and administered. Second, it would prevent use of the dual federal and state structure of Medicaid as a mechanism to withhold programmatic cooperation for partisan purposes. The survival of the ACA to date suggests that financing such a solution may be politically realistic as well as scalable. Still, the appeal of fully federalizing Medicaid likely cannot be separated from difficult, perhaps intractable, issues concerning attitudes toward the people Medicaid helps and toward the role of government generally\u2014whether state, federal, or something else.
