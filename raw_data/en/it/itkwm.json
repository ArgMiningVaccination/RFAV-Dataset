Fax: (413) 545-0231; E-mail: henshawm@ent.umass.edu The social wasps of the genus Polistes are an important model system for understanding the evolution of cooperation. Theirrelatively simple societies lack the distinct morphologicalcastes which characterize many of the social insects, and newlyemerged females possess a variety of reproductive options(Reeve 1991). A female may remain on her natal nest as a helpergaining indirect tness; usurp a foreign nest and becomereproductively dominant; initiate a new nest independently;reproduce on a satellite nest; or initiate a new nest in coopera-tion with other wasps (Strassmann 1981; Reeve 1996; Queller et al. 2000). By characterizing the reproductive payoffs associated withdifferent reproductive strategies, we are better able to under-stand how cooperative societies are maintained. Recently, microsatellite genetic loci have greatly extended our ability to characterize the reproductive strategies used bysocial wasps (Hughes 1998; Queller et al . 1993a). Using micro- satellite loci we can reconstruct pedigrees, and estimaterelatedness. Using this information, unobserved events suchas queen death, nest usurpation or past reproductive domin-ance can be inferred (Queller et al . 1993a,b; Field et al . 1998; Hughes 1998). In this paper, I describe microsatellite lociisolated from the social wasp Polistes dominulus , one of the best studied Polistes species. We followed published protocols for the isolation of micro- satellite loci (Strassmann et al . 1996) with clarications and modications to those protocols as noted below. DNA wasextracted from 1 to 1.5 g of pupal thoraces ground in a mortarand pestle which had been chilled in liquid nitrogen. Theground tissue was suspended in grinding buffer (0.1 m NaCl; 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.1; 0.05 m EDTA; 0.05% SDS), and puried three times with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol then three times with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1).The puried genomic DNA was then ethanol precipitated,and resuspended in distilled water. Genomic DNA was digested with Sau 3aI, and 300-1000 bp inserts were ligated into the pZErO plasmid (Zero Back-ground cloning kit, digested with HI. We transformed TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) to obtain approximately5000-6000 clones. Nylon replicates of the genomic library were probed with ve oligonucleotides (AAT 10 , AAG 10 , AAC 10 , TAG 10 , and CAT 10 ) which were end-labelled with [ g - 33 P]-dATP . Probes of the nylon replicates yielded 151 positives and subsequentprobing of plasmid DNA on the southern blot conrmed 34unique positives. Clones which were positive on the south-ern blot were sequenced on an ABI 377 automated sequencer(Perkin-Elmer), and 19 sets of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)primers were designed from the 28 resulting sequences usingMac Ventor 5.0 (Kodak Scientic Imaging Systems). We optimized PCR primers on an MJ Research PTC- 100 thermocycler using 10 m L reactions (Peters et al . 1998), and assessed within-species polymorphisms for eight speciesof polistine wasps, using from one to eight unrelated femalesfor each species (Table 1). PCR products were visualized on6% polyacrylamide/8 m Urea sequencing gels. Twelve of the loci tested were polymorphic within our P . dominulus population and had a mean observed hetero- zygosity ( H O ) of 0.76. Loci with a minimum of ve uninterrupted repeats were polymorphic, and heterozygosity increasedlogarithmically with the number of uninterrupted repeats(Fig. logarithmic R 2 = 0.454, P = 0.0016). The loci retained much of their polymorphism in other Polistes with six . fuscatus and P . apachus which had a mean H O of 0.48. No polymorph- isms were detected outside of the Polistes genus, however, it is likely that some polymorphisms went undetected due tothe small number of individuals screened in the other species(Table 1).

Fax: 90 13 59 fady@avignon.inra.fr Nuclear microsatellites, or single sequence repeats (nSSRs), have been characterized in many tree species and are powerfulmarkers for genetic diversity studies in natural populations(e.g. Echt et al. 1996; Pfeiffer et al. 1997). Although nSSR enrich- ment protocols have successfully been applied to conifers(Edwards et al. 1996), identication of single-locus, reproducible markers is difcult, probably because of their large genomesize and complexity (Pfeiffer et al. 1997; Soranzo et al. 1998). In this study, we report the successful isolation of nSSRs inPinus halepensis Mill. and their Mendelian segregation . halepensis and P . brutia , two closely related Mediterranean pines. A microsatellite library enriched for di- (GC, halepensis , following the method described by Edwards et al. (1996). A total of 43 clones containing a microsatellite were detected from 47 clonesrandomly chosen from and run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea using an ALF Pharmacia automatic sequencer. Primerswere designed for the amplication of 25 dinucleotidenSSRs using the computer program Primer (http:/ /www-genome.wi.mit.edu/genome_software/other/primer3.html). Total genomic DNA extracted from leaf and mega- gametophyte tissue was used for testing the primer pairs. Theprocedure described by Doyle and Doyle (1990) and theNucleon Phytopur DNA extraction kit were used for leaftissue and mega-gametophytes, respectively. Polymerase chainreaction (PCR) was carried out using a Gradient 96 StratageneRobocycler: the reaction solution (25 mL) contained four dNTPs (each 0.2 m m), 0.25 mm of each primer, 2.5 mL reaction buffer (100 m m Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 15 m m MgCl 2, 500 m m KCl), 25 ng of template DNA and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Pharmacia).After a preliminary denaturing step at 95 \u00b0C for 1.5 min, PCR amplication was performed for 35 cycles: 1.5 min denaturingat 94 \u00b0C, 1.5 min at annealing temperature (Table 1) and 1.5 min extension at 72 \u00b0C, with a nal 5 min step at 72 \u00b0C. After amplication, PCR products were mixed with a loading buffer(98% formamide, 10 m m EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% 0.1% xylene cyanol and 10 m m NaOH), heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, and then set on ice. Fragments were electrophoretically separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained usingsilver nitrate (Rajora et al. 2000). Out of 25 primer pairs, nine (36%) either gave no amplica- tion ( n = 4) or produced multi-band patterns ( n = 5). Sixteen produced fragment amplication in the expected size range,of which eight were polymorphic within one or the otherspecies (Table 1). This proportion of functional markers is com-parable to what is generally observed in conifers (e.g. EchtMEC1053.fm Page 2157 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AM2158 PRIMER NOTES \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234Table 1 Primers and characteristics of seven microsatellite loci that polymorphic within Pinus halepensis or brutia al. 2000), polymorphic in halepensis and P . . brutia do not share common alleles (sizes 205 and 155 bp respectively). \u00a7 HO is the frequency of heterozygotes in the sample and HE is the unbiased expected heterozygosity (Nei 1978), where HE = (2 n/2n - 1) (1 - Spi2).MEC1053.fm Page 2158 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AMPRIMER NOTES 2159 \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234et al. 1996; Pfeiffer et al. 1997). A single marker was found to be polymorphic in Pinus pinaster when the same 25 primer pairs were tested (Mariette et al. 2000). Transfer of nSSR markers across species of the same genus is generally difcultin conifers (e.g. Echt & May-Marquardt at population level using 50 P . brutia individuals (two populations) and 47 P . halepensis individuals (three populations). The maximum number ofalleles per locus was four, and the expected heterozygosity perlocus was between 0.479 and 0.676 (Table 1), which lowerthan observed for other conifers, e.g. Pinus sylvestris (Soranzo et al. 1998) or Picea abies (Pfeiffer et al. 1997), but higher than found using isozymes (Schiller et al. 1986; Teisseire et al. 1995). Mendelian tested on 1-3 bi-allelic com-binations in all polymorphic loci (Table 1). No signicantdeviation from the expected 1:1 ratio was observed. nSSRs are thus potentially helpful markers for studying populationdiversity in P . halepensis and P . brutia .

Yu (1994)suggested that several mole shrews might share the sameburrow system, as three or four mole shrews were oftencaught successively by one trap placed on the same spot.Thus, the mole shrew may have the peculiar social structureand behaviour common to some other subterranean mammals(Nevo 1979). As a preparatory step for studying behaviouralgenetics, we have characterized 11 microsatellite loci that arepolymorphic and suitable for use to address questions regard-ing social structure in Anourosorex squamipes . Genomic DNA for constructing the partial libraries was prepared according to procedures described by Sambrook et al. (1989). Genomic DNA was digested with Sau3A and fractioned in a 2.5% NuSieve GTG gel (FMC, Rockland, ME, USA). DNAof size range of 300-700 bp was isolated, puried with a Gene-Clean III kit (Bio101 Inc.) and ligated plasmid protocols. plasmids were transformed into com-petent SURE cells or XL-2 Blue ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). Recombinant clones containing inserts were transferred to Hybond N + nylon membranes (Amersham), which were hybridized CT(ATCT)6, DIG Oligonucleotide 3 \u00a2-End Labelling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization was performedat 45 \u00b0C for 16 h in a standard hybridization buffer consisting of 5 \u00b7 SSC, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.2% SDS and 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim).

Chemi-luminescent detection was performed witha DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The exposure time ranged from 15 to 30 min. Positive clones were chosen for sequencing to conrm suitable length and base composition. The sequencingreactions were performed with a Big Dye dye-terminator kit,following the manufacturer's protocols, and analysed onpolyacrylamide gels with ABI 377 automated sequencer(Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems).

Individual genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR reactions were performed eitherwith non-radioactive primers or radioactive primers. For non-radioactive PCR, 25 mL reactions were performed, containing 200 ng template DNA, 10 m m Tris-HCl, 50 m m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75 m m Mg 2+, 0.15 m m dNTP, 0.5 mm of each primer and 2 units Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Ampli-cation was carried out according to the thermal prole:95 \u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, optimal annealing temperature (Table 1) for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, with a nal extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. PCR products were run on 6% native polyacrylamide gel, stainedby ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV light box. Thenon-radioactive PCR was used to screen for polymorphicloci and the initial round of genotyping. For radioactive PCR, one primer from each pair was 5 \u00a2 end-labelled with [ g 32P]-ATP (NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Boston, MA, USA), following the manufac-turer's protocols. Each PCR reaction totalled 10 mL, containing 200 ng template DNA, 10 m m Tris-HCl, 50 m m KCl, 0.1% Tri- ton X-100, 0.25 m m dNTP, 0.2 mm of each unlabelled primer, 0.6 m m Mg 2+, 0.25 units Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 0.5 pmol [ g32P]-ATP labelled primer. Amplication was carried out according to the thermal prole: 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, optimal annealingtemperature (Table 1) for 2 min and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a nal extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. PCR products were run on a regular denaturing 6% polyacrylamide sequencinggel. The sizes of alleles were estimated by using control DNA (PUC18) from a Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit(Amersham) as markers. The radioactive PCR was used for a second round of screening: all the alleles of different sizes detected in the rst round of screening were run on com-parison gels to accurately determine their sizes. Running radioactive PCR products on denaturing gels also helpsreduce the confusion caused by the heteroduplex bands thatsometimes appeared in the rst round of screening. Eleven clones were conrmed to be polymorphic (Table 1) by typing 36 mole shrews collected from Taiwan. The numberof alleles per locus ranged from 10 to 20, and the observedand expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.33 to 0.92and from 0.82 to 0.96, respectively. The observed genotypesdeviated from Hardy-Weinberg expectation at the 11 loci(all P < 0.05), resulting from heterozygote deciency, which may be caused by combining samples from various disparatelocalities (Wahlund's effect).

Abundant biological and ecological data for the Floridamanatee have been collected, and the information has formedthe basis for management and conservation programmes.However, to plan and implement biologically sound manage-ment programmes for this marine mammal, knowledge of theamount of genetic diversity present and a thorough under-standing of the evolutionary relationships among geographicalpopulations are essential. Genetic studies employing allozymes(McClenaghan & O'Shea 1988) and mitochondrial DNA(Bradley et al. 1993; Garcia-Rodriguez et al. 1998) have identiedlow levels of genetic diversity, and failed to resolve population structure for the Florida manatee. A technique with a higherresolution of genetic population structure and pedigree ana-lysis is needed. We report the development and characteriza-tion of microsatellite DNA markers in the Florida manateeand test the utility of these markers in three closely relatedSirenian species. Two methodologies were used to generate microsatellite- enriched libraries for T. m. latirostris . Four enriched libraries were produced by Genetic Identication Services (Chatworth,California, USA) using proprietary magnetic bead capturetechnology. An additional library was constructed and screenedfor polymorphic loci following a protocol modied fromArmour et al. (1994). For this protocol, approximately 50 mg of manatee genomic DNA were digested with Sau3AI (Life Technologies, reaction (PCR) amplications were per-formed in a 100 mL volume containing 15 ng of puried DNA, 50 m m KCl, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 m m MgCl 2, 0.2 m m dNTPs (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA), 1 mm Sau-L-A primer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).The following amplication programme was used: 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 68 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1.5 min, followed by 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.

Sequencing reactions wereelectrophoresed on an ABI 377 automated sequencer (AppliedBiosystems). From the two sets of libraries, primers were designed in the flanking regions of 61 microsatellite-bearing clones usingoligo 5.1 (National Biosciences, Molecular Biology Insights Inc., Cascade, Colorado, USA). Microsatellite DNA amplicationreactions consisted of 200 ng DNA, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.20 m m dNTP, 5 pmol of forward and reverse primer and 1.0 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega)in a total volume of 20 mL.

Fourteen sets of primers amplied fragments of expected size from Florida manatee genomic DNA (Table 1). Thesemarkers were screened in 50 manatees collected throughoutthe Florida peninsula. Eight of the 14 loci were polymor- phic in this initial survey, and overall levels of heterozygos- ity averaged 41%. Low levels of allelic diversity wereobserved in the Florida manatee. The maximum number identied was six average observed at polymorphic loci was 2.9. This paucityof genetic diversity suggests a founder effect or major popu-lation bottleneck of evolutionary signicance (see Garcia-Rodriguez et al. 1998). In addition, this study reports one of the lowest levels of genetic diversity observed in species-specicmicrosatellite DNA markers [see Nyakaana & markers were polymorphic for the Antilleanand the Amazonian manatee (Table 1). At least nine markerswere polymorphic in the dugong; the polymorphism islikely to be under-estimated due to the small samplesize ( n = 3). This suite of markers appears to be ideal for the identication of population structure and possiblypedigree analysis in all four Sirenian species, and providesa nuclear DNA-based approach to complement existingmitochondrial DNA genetic information for these vulnerablespecies.

Luise.Kruckenhauser@univie.ac.at Two species European sciurid rodents are of particular interest for behavioural ecology and genetics:Marmota ) inhabits higher elevations of the European Alps and some isolated mountain massifs. Autochthonous popu-lations occur only in the Alpine core area and in a small areanear Berchtesgaden. The distribution of the European ground-squirrel ( S. citellus ) comprises the grassland of the Pannonian plain ranging from eastern Europe to the foothills of the Alps.It is presently listed as endangered (Berner Convention 1999).We isolated six new microsatellite markers for each of the twospecies ( M. marmota : L. Kruckenhauser; S. citellus : S. Hanslik). Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen liver ( M. marmota ) or ethanol-stored tissue samples from the tail ( S. citellus ) using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction method (Sambrooket al. 1989). Following the protocol of Rassmann et al. (1991), partial genomic libraries were established for M. marmota and S. citellus and around 1400 clones from each species were screened for the presence of microsatellite sequences using adinucleotide simple sequence polymer probe AC/GT. Fifty-eight marmot clones showed a positive signal. Twenty- two sequenced using the SequiTherm EXCEL IIDNA (Epicentre bio-tinylated primers and the SAAP/CSPD detection system (USBiochemicals, Inc.). Primer pairs were synthesized for 11 loci;six of these microsatellite loci showed unambiguous allelicpatterns in M. marmota (Table 1). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplications were performed on a HYBAID Omnigenethermocycler in a volume of 12.5 mL containing 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 150 m m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 U DynaZyme DNA polymerase (Finnzymes OY),2 pmol of each primer (forward primer labelled with IRD-800),200 mmol of each dNTP, 0.25 mL DMSO and 50 ng template DNA. The amplication protocols were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, then two cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, annealing temperature plus 6 \u00b0C for 20 s, 70 \u00b0C for 20 s, then 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing temperature for 20 s, 70 \u00b0C for 20 s, and nally 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. PCR products were 6% polyacrylamide gels in a Li-Cor was carried out usingRFLPscan (Scanalytics). The six loci were tested in 19 indi-viduals of M. marmota from the Austrian allochthonous population Turracher Nockberge. In addition, 10 individualsof S. citellus were cross-tested with the same primer sets.MEC1053.fm Page 2163 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AM2164 PRIMER NOTES \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234Thirty-six positive ground-squirrel clones were sequenced with the M13-40 forward primer using Sequenase version 2.0(Amersham Life Sciences). Sequencing products were 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualizedautoradiographically. Primers were designed with the oligo software package (National Biosciences Inc., version 5.0). PCRamplication was carried out on a HYBAID Omnigene ther-mocycler in 10 mL reaction volume with 10 m m Tris -HCl (pH 9.0), 50 m m KCl, 0.1% X-100, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 200 mm dNTPs, mmol of each primer (0.02 pmol forward primer end-labelled with g 32P), 50 -100 ng template DNA, and 0.5 units Taq DNA polymerase. A 4 min initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 47-61 \u00b0C (depending on the primer combination), 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, and a nal extension at 72 \u00b0C for 45 min. PCR products were separated on a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Alleleswere sized by of M13 next tothe amplied microsatellites. Six primer pairs yielded clearamplication products in S. citellus (Table 1). The six loci were analysed in 54 ground-squirrel and 10 marmot individuals. Observed and expected heterozygosities were calculated using genepop (version 1.2; Raymond & Rousset 1995). Altogether 12 microsatellite loci were tested in both species,the results for these are shown in Table 2. Ten loci ampliedin both species, two amplied in M. marmota only. All loci were polymorphic in at least one of the two species, and up toseven different alleles were observed in one species. Signicantdeviations from the Hardy-Weinberg expectations as calcu-lated with the program genepop (version 1.2; Raymond &Rousset 1995) were found for the loci SB10 ( P = 0.0038) and SX (P = in the ground-squirrel population and MS56 (P = 0.0001) in the marmot population. These deviations might be due to null alleles in the respective populations. So far, only a small number of microsatellite loci have been identied for M. marmota (Klinkicht 1993), and no markers have been isolated for S. citellus . The primer sets for 12 loci compiled here should provide sufcient information forgenetic investigations not only in M. marmota and S. citellus but also over a larger species range within the two genera.

E-mail: bectodd@yahoo.com Ever since microsatellites were rst amplied using the poly- merase chain reaction (PCR) and shown to be variable, theyhave been enthusiastically adopted by population geneticists.Microsatellites quickly became the molecular marker of choiceduring the 1990s because of the speed and ease with whichthey can be applied to large samples, and the possibility oftheir amplication from poor-quality samples collected bynon-invasive methods. The level of variability found atmicrosatellite loci has meant that they can be used to answerphylogenetic questions on many levels (McDonald & Potts1997). However, the main disadvantage in the use of micro-satellites is the frequent need to develop a set of markers foreach species under investigation; this limitation will diminishas more markers are isolated for different species. This paperreports the development of ve polymorphic microsatellite locifrom red squirrel.The loci were isolated using the enrichment method of Armour et al. (1994). Three partial genomic libraries were constructed using DNA extracted from Sciurus vulgaris tissue and digested with the enzyme (400-1300 bp),as described in Armour et al. (1994), and used to prime a whole-genome PCR reaction. The product of this reactionwas further size-selected before hybridization selection wascarried out. Each library was constructed using genomicfractions selected by hybridization to a different set oftetra-, tri- and dinucleotide reactions were carried out as described by Armour et al. (1994). The selected fraction was re-amplied in a whole-genome PCR and the Prime PCR Cloner Cloning System (5 Prime 3 Prime, Inc.). These ligations were used to transform Epicu- rian coli XL2-Blue MRF ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). and stored as glycerol stocksin microtitre plates; the contents of each plate were replicatedonto nylon lters and probed with labelled target oligonucle-otide repeat sequences. Positive colonies were identied andsequenced manually using either isolated plasmid DNA oramplied PCR products as template M13for poly-merase enzyme (Pharmacia Biotech) following a protocolbased on protocol 11 described in Hoelzel & Green (1998).Primers for all useful repeat sequences were designed (withthe aid of the computer program oligo ; National Bioscience) and tested for variability on a panel of 10 DNA samples. PCR amplication of variable loci was optimized using the method described by Cobb & Clarkson (1994).

Five loci, named RS m1, RSm3, RSm4, RSm5 and RS m6, were found to be polymorphic in the Eurasian red squirrel (Table 1).These loci were amplied from 163 samples of red squirrelDNA in individuals taken from 11 populations in Belgiumand Germany (Todd 2000); the proportion of individuals foundto be heterozygous at each locus is also given in Table 1. Thestudy included samples of more than 20 individuals fromthree large populations, and these were used to test for nullalleles. Fisher's exact test was carried out using Biomstat(version 3.2) (Applied Biostatistics Inc.) on the observed andexpected number of heterozygotes at each locus in the threepopulations, and no evidence to indicate the presence of nullalleles was found ( P > 0.2).

Its geo-graphical distribution also includes the Black Sea, the AzovSea and the North-Eastern Atlantic (Whitehead et al. 1984). This species is abundant in the Mediterranean and inhabitsvarious biotopes such as shallow rocky areas and seagrassbeds (Michel et al. 1987; Francour 1997). The ocellated wrasse is a partially sedentary sh, with territorial males, exclusivemale parental care and conspicuous male nuptial colorationand courtship (Warner & Lejeune 1985), and thus constitutesan interesting species for investigating various aspects ofpopulation genetics and behavioural ecology of marine shes.Here we report seven microsatellite loci of the labrid microsatellite loci were cloned as described by Estoup et al. (1993) and in detailed protocols by A. Estoup and J. Turgeon available at http:/ /www.inapg.inra.fr/dsa/microsat/microsat.htm. The genomic library was constructedwith about 10 mg of DNA isolated from muscle tissue of a single ocellated wrasse from a population near Marseille(France). Approximately 1500 colonies were screened formicrosatellites using a mixture of six probes (TC) 10, (TG)10, (CAC)5CA, CT(CCT)5, CT(ATCT)6 and positiveclones was puried using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit(Qiagen). Both strands of the wrasse DNA inserts weresequenced using a Thermo sequenase cycle were carried out according tothe recommendations of the manufacturers, and sequencereaction products were resolved on an automated DNAsequencer (model 4200; Li-Cor). Here we report the seven microsatellite loci (Table 1) for which we so far have successfully designed primer pairs.The genomic DNA for genotyping was prepared either usinga phenol-ethanol extraction method or a rapid BIO RAD (Celex 100 resin) extraction protocol as described by Estoupet al. (1996). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplications were carried out in 10 mL volumes using a PTC100 machine (MJ Research, USA). Each reaction contained 20 ng genomicDNA, 2 pmol of each primer, one of which an infra-red fluorescent dye (IRD800), MgCl 2 (concen- tration T able 1), 0.06 m m of each dNTP, 1 \u00b7 PCR buffer (Qiagen) and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). Reactionconditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step of5 min at 95 \u00b0C, ve cycles consisting of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at annealing temperature (see Table 1) and 75 s at 72 \u00b0C, 25 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at annealing tempera- ture and 75 s at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a nal 5 min extension at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products were analysed on an automated DNA sequencer (model 4200), and amplied fragments of clonedalleles were used for size determination at the respectiveloci. Variability of the loci was tested in ve populations ofS. ocellatus from the French Mediterranean coast (Cap Martin, St Jean Cap Ferrat, Antibes, Cannes and Marseille). Ten individuals from each population were analysed. The number of alleles per locus and the observed and expectedheterozygosities are listed in Table 1. All loci were polymor-phic, with the number of alleles per locus ranging between11 and 30 and the observed heterozygosity between 0.76 and 0.96. Additionally, we tested the amplication of these prim- ers in the labrid Coris julis and four other species of the genus : S. tinca , S. roissali , S. rostratus and S. cin- ereus (Table 2). All specimens were sampled along the French Mediterranean coast between Cap Martin and Cannes.

Although a number of microsatellite loci have been isolated for some the subfamily Ponerinae[e.g. Diacamma (Doums 1999), Gnamptogenys (Giraut et al. 1999) ], the availability of genetic markers for the unique Australianant Nothomyrmecia macrops has been poor. Of 16 allozyme loci studied by Ward & Taylor (1981) only one locus was poly-morphic. Colonies appear to have low nestmate relatedness(Ward & Taylor 1981) but these estimates must be interpretedwith caution because of limited sample size. N. macrops has great signicance in evolutionary sociobiology because it possessesa relatively large proportion of ancestral characters (e.g. Taylor1978). Thus, a more detailed knowledge of the genetics ofthis ant is desirable and will perhaps shed new light on anumber of issues related to the evolution of eusociality inthe Hymenoptera. In this paper we describe the isolation ofvariable microsatellite loci that can be used for precisecolony- and population-level genetic analyses in Nothomyrmecia , and in the most closely related subfamily, the Myrmeciinae. Genomic DNA was extracted from ve worker pupae as described by Baur et al. (1993). The DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes Sau3AI and RsaI, and size-selected fragments (300-600 bp) were ligated the site of the vector pUC19. Electrocompetent Escherichia coli JM109 strains were transformed by genepulser and colonies were hybridized onto HybondN + (Amersham) nylon membranes. Approximately 9000recombinant colonies were screened with a radiolabelled (GA) 10 oligonucleotide probe and 117 positive clones identied. Thirtyclones were sequenced either manually using the fmol\u00ae cycle sequencing kit (Promega) or using the Big Dye Terminatorcycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin Elmer) with anABI Prism 377 DNA auto-sequencer. Primers were designed for 18 loci using the computer program oligo TM (Macintosh version 4.0, National Biosciences Inc.). DNA for microsatellite analysis was prepared from gasters of single Nothomyrmecia workers using a modication of the Chelex\u00ae 100 Resin extraction protocol (Walsh et al. 1991). Polymerase chain reactions contained 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl2, 0.1% Triton\u00ae X-100, 165 mm dNTPs, 0.1 mm of forward primer, 0.03-0.06 mm of forward primer end-labelled with [ g33P]-ATP , 0.4 mm of reverse primer, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.4 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 2 mL of template DNA in a total volume of 10 mL. Ampli- cations were conducted in a Corbett thermal cycler usingthe following temperature prole: 2 min at 94 \u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 93 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 or 55 \u00b0C for annealing (see Table 1) and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C, and a nal elongation step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. The amplied byautoradiography. Of the 18 sets of primers, two failed to amplify and one gave a banding pattern that was difcult to interpret. Theother 15 loci yielded repeatable and scorable results. Asample of 36 workers from Poochera, South Australia (takenfrom trees in an area of approximately 200 \u00b7 20 m) was used to assess the variability of these markers. We found that allbut one of the 15 loci showed considerable polymorphism(Table 1), which is surprising given the small and geograph-ically restricted sample analysed. Each polymorphic locushad between three and 12 alleles. The expected heterozygo-sity based on allele frequencies ranged from 0.53-0.90 witha mean of 0.70 across all loci. We tested for heterozygotedeciency using the computer program genepop (web version 3.1c) in order to detect the presence of null alleles. Except forthe signicant excess of homozygotes at locus Nmac expected heterozygosities were discovered. We investigated cross-species amplication in two species of Myrmecia and found that a large proportion of the loci could be amplied in M. forcata (see Table 1). Despite being highly polymorphic in Nothomyrmecia , the loci Nmac 11, 28 and 45 turned out to be monomorphic in M. pyriformis (three individuals from each of ve colonies examined). The relat-ively high success rate of cross-species amplication maysupport the general contention that the two subfamiliesNothomyrmeciinae and Myrmeciinae are closely related(Baroni Urbani et al. 1992). In other groups of ants, successful cross-species amplications have been reported most fre-quently among genera within the same subfamily (e.g. Doums1999) suggesting a relatively low level of conservation of microsatellites across ant taxa.

Currently the methods used to control aflatoxin con- tamination are expensive and cannot guarantee the totalelimination of toxins. A possible solution to the problem is the use of nontoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus to competitively exclude their toxigenic counterparts: a biological controlstrategy. Knowledge of genetic diversity, dispersal and poten-tial for genetic exchange are essential for predicting the likely success of such a strategy. Small-scale studies of A. flavus and A. parasiticus populations carried out to date have used random amplied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers andDNA sequence data (Geiser et al. 1998; Tran-Dinh et al. 1999). Studies on a larger scale will require markers that areinexpensive and easy to apply, but also highly discriminatoryand reproducible. We, therefore, set out to develop micro-satellite markers that could be amplied from the genomesof A. flavus and A. parasiticus. In this note, we characterized seven polymorphic micro- satellite markers for A. flavus and A. parasiticus . To our know- ledge, no microsatellite markers have been reported for A. flavus or A. parasiticus . We also examined the ability to amplify these loci from six other species of Aspergillus. Microsatellites were found in GenBank using microsatellite motifs as queries for searches. Searches were performed onsubmitted sequences from A. flavus and A. parasiticus , and the two closely related species, A. oryzae and A. sojae . Six markers were found in this way (AFPM2-AFPM7). GenBankaccession numbers are shown in Table 1. One microsatellitemarker (AFPM1) was found by hybridizing DNA ampli-ed from and A. parasiticus by RAPD-PCR with chemiluminescent microsatellite probes (Carter et Hybridizing bands were identied, reamplied and sequenced. Primers for polymerase chain reaction designed from sequences flanking the microsatellitesusing oligo version 4.0 (National Biosciences) software. One primer from each pair was 5 \u00a2-labelled with a fluorophor (PE Biosystems) (Table 1). All primer pairs were designedwith an annealing temperature of 54 \u00b0C and amplied fragment sizes were optimized to allow analysis of all themicrosatellite markers in a single lane. PCR amplicationswere carried out in 25 mL reaction volumes using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Reaction mixtures contained 1 \u00b7 PCR buffer (10 m m Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.001% gelatin), 200 mm each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). Each reactioncontained approximately 20-40 ng of DNA, which was isolatedusing small-scale extraction protocol (Lee & Taylor 1990).Reactions were subjected to an initial denaturing step of 5 minat 94 \u00b0C, 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 54 \u00b0C, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a nal elongation step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Electrophoresis was conducted using an ABI 373 XL sequencerwith genescan version 3.0 (PE Biosystems) software. Fragment sizes were determined with reference to a TAMRA 500 (PEBiosystems) internal standard. Microsatellite variability was analysed using 20 isolates of A. flavus and 15 isolates of A. parasiticus that have previously been found to be genetically diverse (Tran-Dinh et al. 1999). All of the microsatellite markers were reliably ampliedfrom each isolate. The number of alleles, range of allele sizes,numerical index of discriminatory power (Hunter 1991) andobserved heterozygosities for the two species are detailedin Table 1. All loci were polymorphic, with some showinghigher degrees of polymorphism. Greater variation was seenwithin A. flavus than in A. parasiticus , which was consistent with our previous analysis using RAPD markers (Tran-Dinh et al. 1999). Amplication of the microsatellites was also attemptedwith DNA from A. A. oryzae and A. sojae produced clear amplication products. These species are thought toTable 1 PCR primer sequences, number of alleles, size range, discriminatory index, microsatellite No. of alleles D\u00a7 no.

In conclusion, given the levels of polymorphism and the ease of amplication and analysis, the microsatellitemarkers presented here will be very useful for investigat-ing the diversity and population structure of A. flavus and A. parasiticus.

This species is a primary host of Schistosoma mansoni , the prevalence of which may be as high as 90% in some natural rodent populations (Rey 1993). Becauserodent tness is not reduced by infection (D'Andrea et al. 2000), migrating rats, once infected, will carry the parasiteand establish new infective foci in sites where secondary parasitehosts ( Biomphalaria species) are present. These characteristics make the presence of water-rat populations a complicatedfactor for schistosomiasis control. Several populations of N. squamipes studied with random amplied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) showed limited differentiation indicating effects ofmigration or recent range expansion (Almeida et al. , in press). Microsatellites were developed as a tool for studyingmigration patterns of N. squamipes and for evaluating its potential in spreading infection. Genomic DNA was digested with AluI, and 200-700 bp fragments were excised and puried (QIAquick Extraction,QIAGEN) following separation in ligated to (Pharmacia) and transferred to Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells. Some 18 210 recombinant colonies were transferred to nylonmembranes (NEN) following Sambrook et al. (1989). Nylon lters were with (GAA)7 and (GATA)5 oligonucleotides. of 11 224 colonies were hybridized with (GT)10, 12 984 with (CT)10, with (GAA)7, and 5981 with (GATA)5. One hundred and eleven positive colonies were detected and 53 were sequenced with an ABI PRISM377 automated Biosystems). Thirty-three 28 well resolved sequences, allhad (CA) n microsatellites motifs except for two, indicating that this was the most abundant in N. squamipes . Eight microsatellites were characterized of which only ve were polymorphic (Table 1). Genomic DNA of N. squamipes was extracted from blood or liver tissue of several water-ratpopulations by the standard proteinase-K/phenol-chloroformprocedure (Sambrook et al. 1989). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in nal volumes of 15 mL with ~10 - 40 ng of genomic DNA, 10 m m Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50 m m KCl 2, 2.5 m m MgCl2, 7 pmol of fluorescence labelled forward primer, 10 pmol of reverse primer, 300 mm of each dNTP and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase conditions: an initialdenaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles (except for Nec15 and Nec18 with 34 cycles) of 15 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at T a \u00b0C (Table 1), 30 s at 72 \u00b0C and a nal extension period of 4 min at 72 \u00b0C. Fragment analyses were conducted with an ABI PRISM 377 with standard loading and electrophoresisconditions. Alleles were sized relatively to an internal sizestandard (ROX GS 500; Applied Biosystems) and analysedwith genescan version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). A maximum of 110 N. squamipes individuals was analysed for each locus (Table 2). Five microsatellites were polymorphic(Table 2) with the number of alleles ranging from 12 - 26. Linkagedisequilibrium between all pairs of loci was not detected(P > 0.5 Fisher's exact test) when tested using genepop versionMEC1053.fm Page 2172 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AMPRIMER NOTES 2173 \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-22343.2 (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Expected heterozygozity was signicantly higher than observed heterozygosity for all butone locus (Table 2). Although this was probably a result ofthe Wahlund effect (Hartl & Clark 1997), and since sampleswere collected in eight different localities, the existence of nullalleles cannot be ruled out until a more detailed populationstudy can be performed. The ve polymorphic microsatellites loci, the rst known for Nectomys , will be useful for assessing genetic variability within and among water-rat populations as well as fordetecting differentiation and migration.

In this system, hybrids transmit a clonal R. ridibunda haplotype by mating with a syntopic R. lessonae , while hybrid by hybrid crosses result in inviable offspring (Graf & M\u00fcller 1979; Uzzell et al.Table 1 loci of Nectomys squamipes Ta temperature Locus Primer squamipes. number of alleles per loci; Freq., frequency of the most common allele; HO, observed heterozygosity; HE, expected heterozygosity Locus NA Freq.

Hybrid lineages, therefore, represent frozen lineages that are assumed to be subject to an accumulation of deleteri-ous mutations; mutations that are expressed when a hybridby hybrid cross occurs and are suppressed when backcrosseswith the parental species occur (Uzzell et al. 1980). The obvious lack of tness benets for R. lessonae individuals involved in LL \u00b7 LR pairings make investigations of mate choice and sexual selection in this complex of great interest (Abt &Reyer 1993; Reyer et al. 1999). As well, pure R. esculenta popu- lations have been detected, while theoretical investigationsshow that such pure populations cannot persist in isolation(Som et al. 2000). Even when a few R. lessonae are present, these generally are involved in hybrid matings due to the pre-dominance of hybrids, which suggests that immigration byR. lessonae into such populations is required for population maintenance (Som et al. 2000; Hellriegel & Reyer in press). In these cases, management of pure or almost pure hybrid popu-lations also requires identifying and managing R. lessonae source ponds. With these and other applications in mind, we identied and characterized a suite of CA repeat microsatellite lociderived from R. lessonae . We constructed a highly enriched subgenomic library following standard protocols (Tenzeret al. 1999). A brief outline follows: genomic DNA isolated from a single male R. lessonae was digested to completion with Tsp509I (New England Biolabs) and the 500-1000 bp size fraction was isolated from LM-MP agarose (BoehringerMannheim) using freezer linkers merase chain reaction (PCR) as follows; total reaction volumewas 25 mL and included 100 ng DNA, 1 U Taq polymerase (Quantum-Appligene), 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m 2, 0.01% TritonX100, 0.2 (Quantum- Appligene), 100 dNTP (Promega), and 1 mm of TSPADSHORT. PCR was performed on a Techne Geniusthermocycler (Techne Ltd) using the following thermotreat-ment: 2 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0. A total of 32 PCRs were carried out, pooled, cleaned and concentrated to minimizethe likelihood of redundant products being detected duringscreening for positive clones (B. Gautschi et al. submitted). PCR products were cloned following the OriginalTA Cloning\u00ae Kit (Invitrogen) protocol. White colonies weredot-blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N +, Amersham Pharmacia) and screened for CA repeats using the ECL 3 \u00a2- oligolabelling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia)and CA oligonucleotide. All positive clones forward reverse primers, followingthe ABI Prism\u00ae BigDye Terminator SequencingReady Reaction Kit protocol, version 2.0 (PE Biosystems) andusing the ABI 377 automated sequencing system (PE Bio-systems). Primer design was carried out using primer 3software & Skaletsky 1998) 55 \u00b0C andelectrophoresed 8%, nondenaturing, 14.5 cm by 17 cm acrylamide gels at 80 V overnight. Those primers amplifyingpolymorphic products using ve test templates (Table 1)were used for subsequent analyses reported below. PCR amplication of frog DNA isolated from a sample of R. lessonae and R. esculenta adults captured and toe-clipped at a pond near Hellberg, north of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland wasperformed as follows. Reactions were 10 mL total volume and contained 50-100 ng template DNA, 0.5 U Taq polymerase (Quantum-Appligene), buffer components and dNTPs as listedabove, and 0.5 mm of both forward and reverse primer. All PCR was performed using the following conditions: 3 min at94 \u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 57 or 58 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a nal step of 2 min at 72 \u00b0C. Products were electrophoresed on the size of the alleles generated. All electro-phoresis was performed using the SEA 2000 advancedsubmerged gel electrophoresis apparatus (Elchrom ScienticAG, Switzerland) at 100 V for 60-120 min, depending onallele size, then scored against the M3 Marker ladder (ElchromScientic AG, Switzerland) and a 20-bp ladder (Bio-Rad).Expected and observed counts for homozygotes/heterozygoteswere determined using genepop , version 3x ( Raymond & Rousset 1995) and tested for signicant deviations usingChi-square analysis (null hypothesis rejected at P < 0.05). All 10 loci were variable in R. lessonae and as well in R. esculenta (data not shown). Locus RlCA1b5 amplied an allele 137 bp in length only in R. esculenta individuals and is most likely the clonally transmitted R. allele all appear to only asingle allele in a sample of R. esculenta tested in two other populations not reported here. Only R. lessonae frogs were used to test for homozygote excess, for obvious reasons. LociRlCA5, RlCA1b17, RlCA1b20 and RlCA2a49 all exhibitedhomozygote excess ( P 0.05), which may indicate the presence of at least one null allele at each of these loci. Considering thebizarre nature of the LE complex, these homozygote excessesmay instead be indicative of a departure from Hardy-Weinbergdue to a violation of the assumption of random mating.

Following autoradio- graphy, clones exhibiting strong signal were sequenced (ABIPRISM Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit andABI 377 mediated automated detection) and, where possible, appropriate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers weredesigned (assisted by Primer Select software, DNASTAR Inc.). Characterization of primer sets involved both nonisotopic and isotopic screening. Atlantic salmon DNA was extractedfrom liver tissue by a rapid phenol-based method (Taggartet al. 1992). Common components in both assays (10 mL nalvolume) were: 50 ng template DNA, 50 m m KCl, m Tris- HCl pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton 0.9-1.5 m m 2, 130 mm each nucleotide and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). For nonisotopic PCRs 1 mm of each primer was included. For isotopic assays 0.1 mm of each primer was added with 10% of one primer being end-labelled with [ g32P]-ATP (4500 Ci/mMol). Cycling parameters, using a Hybaid TouchDown thermocycler,were: 96 \u00b0C for 3 min, four cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 50 s, xx \u00b0C anneal- ing for 50 s, 72 \u00b0C for 50 s and n cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 50 s, xx \u00b0C annealing for 50 s, 72 \u00b0C for 50 s, where xx is locus specic annealing temperature (Table 1) and n = 28 for nonisotopic or 25 for isotopic reactions. gels (SequaGel XR; National Diagnostics) followed were determined relative to pBluescript II KS(-) sequence reactions run on each gel. Level of variability at each identied locus was assessed in 21 wild adult salmon. Polymorphic loci were also screened intwo Atlantic salmon families (each consisting of two parents+46 progeny). Cross-species amplication was assessed inseven other salmonid species (Table 2). Two individuals of eachspecies were screened (nonisotopically) using two differentannealing temperatures (1 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C below optimum for Atlantic salmon) and 1.5 m m MgCl 2. Additionally four brown trout ( Salmo two were screened for polymorphism using identical isotopicconditions to those employed for Atlantic salmon.

To study the influence of this specialized pollination systemon genetic population structure and to estimate gene flowamong morphologically similar, coflowering Ophrys species with presumably different pollinators, variable and codominantgenetic markers are needed. We, therefore, isolated and char-acterized microsatellite loci from Ophrys araneola and tested their variability in two O. araneola populations. Furthermore, we assessed whether these loci can be amplied in otherOphrys species. Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf material stored in silica gel using the CTAB protocol (Doyle & Doyle 1990).Microsatellite loci were isolated and identied from a partialgenomic library enriched for GA/CT repeats, followingTenzer et al. (1999). Enriched DNA was ligated into pGEM\u00ae-T vector and cloned using JM109 high efciency competent cells(Promega). The 672 colonies blotted ontonylon lters (Hybond-N +, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) GA/CT repeats using the ECL 3 \u00a2-oligolabelling and detection systems (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Plasmid DNA of 74 positive clones was TM Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Biosystems) using the universalprimers pUC/M13 forward and an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser. Microsatellite motifswere found in 51 clones. Primers annealing to regionswere designed for 21 loci using MacVector 6.0 (OxfordMolecular LTD). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) wereperformed in 10 mL reaction volumes containing 4.5 mL ddH 2O, 10 m m Tris-HCl, 50 m m KCl, 0.4 mm of each forward and reverse primer, 200 mm of each dNTP, 0.5 U AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae DNA Polymerase (PE Biosystems), 1.5 m m MgCl2 and 10 - 50 ng of DNA. PCRs were run on a Perkin-Elmer 9700 thermocycler. An initial denaturation step (95 \u00b0C, 10 min) was followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at the locus specic annealing temperature (see Table 1), 30 s at72 \u00b0C; a nal extension step for 5 min at 72 \u00b0C was performed at the end. Products were visualized on an ABI PRISM310 Genetic Analyser (PE Biosystems) using labelledprimers or labelled (Table werescored against the internal Genotyper\u00ae 2.1 software(PE Biosystems). Seven out of 21 primer pairs ampliedfragments of the expected size.Levels of variability detected at these seven loci are high, with numbers of alleles ranging from 7-22 and observed hetero-zygosities ranging from 37-92% (Table 1). Using genepop 3.1c (Rousset & Raymond 1995) we found a signicant ( P < 0.01) for loci OaCT2 and OaCT6 in the Swiss O. araneola population, and for OaCT5 and OaCT6 in the French population. Loci OaCT1 and OaCT7 exhibit signicantlinkage disequilibrium across both populations ( P < 0.01). We tested for cross-species amplication of O. araneola primers with six other Ophrys species of increasing phylogenetic distance to O. araneola (M. Soliva et al. , unpublished results), using two individuals per species. PCR conditions were thesame as described above. Qualities of PCR products wereclassied according to Smulders et al. (1997).

DNA-based genetic markersare necessary for assigning parentage to quantify reproductivesuccess in promiscuous mating systems, such as chipmunks(Callahan 1981). Here, we: (i) characterize primers for 11 micro-satellite loci suitable for parentage studies of yellow-pinechipmunks; and (ii) minimus ) (Stevens et al. 1997). We extracted DNA from the kidney of a yellow-pine chip- munk taken from the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta and constructeda plasmid library consisting of 250-400 bp fragments usingthe method described by Dawson et al. (1997). Briefly, approxim- ately 10 mg of DNA was digested and fragments containing 250-400 bp were puried from an agarose gel and cloned intoa plasmid vector. The library was transformed into XL1-Blue(Stratagene) competent cells and plate lifts made using Hybond-N (Amersham-Pharmacia) nylon membranes. Approximately50 000 colonies were polymers[ (TG) n and (TC)n (Amersham-Pharmacia) labelled 165 positive clones were identied. Twenty-ve clones,each containing a single insert, were sequenced by MOBIXCentral Facility, McMaster University, using dye-terminatorchemistry on an ABI 373 A Stretch DNA sequencer. Primers toamplify regions containing repeats were designed from 17clones using primer (version 0.5; Lincoln et al. 1991); however, only 11 of these primer pairs were sufciently variable forparentage studies (i.e. 3 alleles). To assess variability of these 11 loci, we used DNA from ear tissue collected from 76 chip-munks (43 adults, 33 juveniles) in the Kananaskis Valley in1999. DNA was extracted using QIAGEN\u00ae QIAmp tissue kits.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the samplesgenerally following Dawson et al.

Amplication products were resolved on polyacrylamide gels, as described in Dawsonet al. (1997) except gels were run at 70 W. PCR reactions (1 mL volume) consisted of the following reagents; 2.5 m m of MgCl 2 (MBI Fermentas), PCR buffer [75 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20 (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween (MBI Fermentas)] 1 mg/mL BSA (Amersham-Pharmacia), 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas), 0.2 pmol of the forward primerlabelled with [ g- 33P]-ATP (Amersham-Pharmacia), 0.3 pmol of the unlabelled forward primer, and 0.5 pmol unlabelled reverseprimer. Table 1 describes the primer sequence, size of cloneproduct, annealing temperature, and number of observed allelesfor each locus. We determined whether there were deviationsfrom Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each locus from adultchipmunks using genepop (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Only EuAmMS 114 was found to deviate from Hardy-Weinbergexpectation due to heterozygote excess (Table 1). To assess the utility of these microsatellite loci for parentage analysis, we used the likelihood-based approach and simula-tion procedures of cervus 1.0 (Marshall et al. 1998). Using this program, we were able to assign maternity to all 33 juveniles(100%) with 80% condence, 18 (54.5%) of these with 95%condence. Using known maternity data, we were able toassign paternity to 30 juveniles (90.9%) with 80% condence,20 (60.6%) of these with 95% condence. The microsatelliteloci presented here provide adequate information to assessparentage in yellow-pine chipmunks. We also attempted to amplify samples of yellow-pine chip- munk DNA using four primers which amplify squirrels and least chipmunks (Loci: GS3,GS17, GS20, and GS34) (Stevens et al. 1997). Only two alleles were observed among samples from 22 chipmunks for GS22. At alow-stringency annealing temperature (50 \u00b0C) we found only GS20 to amplify, producing one allele. These primers were notconsidered to be appropriate for further parentage analysis. Acknowledgements We thank Liliana De Sousa for superb technical assistance.

School of Biological Sciences, University of cetaceans by genetic methods is moving increas- ingly towards the estimation of kinship among individualsusing genetic data. Microsatellite loci are ideal for this kindof study given their high mutation rates and co-dominantinheritance. However, a large number of loci need to begenotyped in order to ensure reliable estimation of kinship.Even for relatively small sample sizes, reliable identicationof parent-offspring pairs is likely to require more than 17 locigenotyped in each individual (Palsb\u00f8ll 1999). Towards thisend, we isolated an additional nine polymorphic microsatelliteloci from genomic DNA of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae , which are presented here. The loci originate from the same partial genomic library from which we previously presented tri- and tetra-nucleotidemicrosatellite loci (Palsb\u00f8ll et al. 1997).

The discovery ofpolymorphic mononucleotide repeats in the chloroplast genomesof plants analogous to nuclear microsatellites, or simple sequencerepeats, has provided a new approach to detecting cytoplasmicvariation that had previously gone undetected using tradi-tional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies.These chloroplast microsatellites have been used for the high- resolution analysis of cytoplasmic diversity in both crop speciesand natural plant populations (Provan et al. 1999b, 2000). This report describes the development of chloroplast microsatellite in the weedy crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae). Despite Arabidopsis being the model organism for studies into the physiology, genetics and develop-ment of higher plants, very little work has been carried outon the analysis of natural populations of the species. Indeed,to date there have been no published studies investigatinglevels of cytoplasmic variation in Arabidopsis and only a limited number assessing levels of nuclear diversity in natural popu- lations (Vander Zwan et al. 2000 and references therein). The complete chloroplast sequence of A. thaliana (EMBL accession number AP000423) was searched for mononucleotiderepeats of n = 8 or greater using the ndpatterns program(Genetics Computer Group). A total of 231 repeats were found and primers were designed to amplify seven mononucleotiderepeat loci in noncoding regions using the primer program (Genetics Computer Group; Table 1) . Primers were tested on 22 A. thaliana accessions from 11 populations in Europe and the USA, as well as on six Brassica species (see Table 2). Poly- merase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a total volumeof 10 mL containing 50 ng genomic DNA, 10 pmol 32P end- labelled forward PCR reac- tion buf fer [20 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 m m KCl], 15 m m MgCl2, 0.05 U Taq polymerase (Gibco BRL). Reactions were carried out on a Techne GENIUS thermal cycler using thefollowing parameters: initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s; nal extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. After addition of 10 mL loading buffer (95% formamide), products were resolved on 6% denaturingpolyacrylamide gels containing 1 \u00b7 TBE buffer and 8 m urea at 80 W constant power for 2 h. Gels were transferred onto3 mm blotting paper (Whatman) and exposed to X-ray lm overnight at -70 \u00b0C. All seven loci were polymorphic in the sample studied, with between two and six alleles detected per locus (Table carinata B. juncea ATCP112 88 8 8 88 ATCP7905 44 44 44 44 44 44 ATCP28673 44 44 44 44 44 44 ATCP30287 44 4 4 ATCP46615 44 44 44 44 44 44 ATCP66701 44 4 4 44 ATCP70189 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 \u2014 Strong amplication; 4 \u2014 Weak amplication; 8 \u2014 Poor or no amplication.

Intrapopulation variationwas detected in several populations, highlighting the resolv-ing power of the chloroplast microsatellite technique even inhighly inbreeding species such as Arabidopsis , which is believed to have a selng rate of \u00bb99%. Although no previous cyto- plasmic studies have been carried out in Arabidopsis , it is unlikely that such levels of variation would be detected withRFLPs. This has been observed in chloroplast microsatellitestudies of other inbreeding species, e.g. barley (Provan et al. 1999a), where diversity levels were far in excess of thoserevealed by chloroplast RFLPs. Due to high levels of conservation of both sequence and gene organization in plant chloroplast genomes, primers designedto amplify chloroplast microsatellites in one shown to amplify polymorphic products in related species,even at the intergeneric level (Provan et al. 2000). Consequently, the primers developed for Arabidopsis were tested on several Brassica species (Table 2). Although primer pair ATCP112 did not amplify in the Brassica species and primers ATCP30287 and ATCP66701 gave poor and/or nonspecic amplication,the other four primer pairs amplied a single, strong productin all six species tested. This suggests that these primers mayhave considerable value in studying cytoplasmic variationwithin the Brassicaceae. In summary, these chloroplast microsatellite primers offer new opportunities to study levels and patterns of cytoplasmicvariation within and between Arabidopsis natural populations and ecotypes. A comparison of chloroplast and nuclear micro-satellite markers will provide new insights into the relativeroles of seed and pollen movement in shaping the geneticstructure of natural populations. Furthermore, their utilityacross the Brassicaceae means that this ability to discriminateseed and pollen movement will be of value in assessing modesof potential transgene escape in genetically modied oilseedrape ( ) and in possible hybrids between B. napus and its wild relatives.

Examples of applications include gene mapping (e.g. Lindner et al. 2000), pedigree analysis (e.g. Estoup et al. 1998), and population assignment (e.g. Olsen et al. 2000). Through these studies researchers have become more discriminating in their choiceof microsatellites to meet specic project objectives locus polymorphism, annealing tem-perature, and PCR amplication quality. New microsatellitesare needed to improve the selection of loci for each species ofPacic salmon. In particular, there is need for tetranucleotidemicrosatellites. This class of microsatellites does not generallyexhibit the complicated banding ('stutter') dinucleotide polymorphism for various applications(Jarne & Lagoda 1996). Here we report the developmentof primers ). TAGA tetranucleotide microsatellites were identiedby Genetic Identication Services (GIS, Chatsworth CA) usingan enrichment protocol similar to Edwards et al. (1996).

The resulting fragments were ligated into the HindIII site of pUC19. Recom- binant molecules were electroporated into Escherichia coli DH5alpha. clones were selected at forsequencing. Sequencing was visualized 373 DNA sequencer. Primer pairs for 27 sequences were designed using the pro- gram Primer 3 (Rozen & Skaletsky 1996). Unlabelled primers,purchased from Operon Inc. (Alameda, CA), were tested foramplication effectiveness in four sockeye salmon usingagarose gel electrophoresis. PCR was carried out in 10 mL volumes 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 m m KCl, 3.0 m m MgCl 2, 0.2 m m each dNTP, 0.5 units AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp, Foster City, CA), 0.15 mm each primer, and 100 ng DNA template] using an MJ Research PTC-225thermocycler. DNA amplications involved the followingprole: 92 \u00b0C (5 min); 25 cycles of 92 \u00b0C (30 s) + 56 \u00b0C (30 s) + 72 \u00b0C (30 s); 72 \u00b0C (30 min). The PCR product was electrophoresed for 2 h at 100 V in a 2% agarose gel, stainedwith ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultravioletlight (312 nm). Four primer pairs failed to yield distinct PCR products. Fluorescein-labelled forward primers were purchasedfor the remaining 23 sequences from Perkin-Elmer Corp.(Foster City, CA). Fourteen of these 23 primer pairs yieldedhigh-quality amplication product as determined using anABI 377-96 DNA sequencer in GeneScan mode (ABI labelled primers in a 4.5% denaturing polyacry-lamide gel (Table 1). Estimates of polymorphism were obtained for the 14 loci by genotyping 89 sockeye salmon using the ABI377-96. Allele scoring was performed with Genotypersoftware, version 2.0 (ABI 1996b). The number of allelesper locus ranged from 6 to 30 and averaged 20 (Table 1).The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.44 to 0.94 andaveraged 0.87. The observed and expected heterozygositydiffered ( P < 0.05) at One100 . The allelic size averaged 103 bp and ranged from 24 bp ( One105 ) to 280 bp (One103 ).

It can be found in a range ofanthropogenically modied habitats, ranging from nearlypristine to highly polluted waters (Zimmerman et al. 1980), and has intermediate sensitivity to habitat degradationrelative to other shes in the region (Zimmerman et al. 1980; Gillespie & Guttman 1989). The species is the focus of intens-ive study by the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency due to its biological and distributional character-istics. An important aspect of this research is to understand thene-scale genetic structure of the species across its nativerange, and to determine how this 'genetic landscape' relatesto underlying environmental processes. To date, genetic ana-lyses focused on multi-locus ngerprints generated bythe random amplied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method todelineate levels of similarity among and within populations(Silbiger et al. 1998). Because allelic counts are highly sensitive to recent changes in population size, highly polymorphicmicrosatellite DNA markers should provide genetic informa-tion that is highly complementary to the RAPD data and mayreveal ner levels of population structuring. Here, we reporta suite of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers developedfor the central stoneroller.Table 2 Results of cross-species testing of sockeye salmon microsatellite primers.

After removal of excess fragments were amplied by a primer complimentary tothe Sau3AI linker. The whole genomic library was enriched for sequences containing CA repeats by hybridization to abiotinylated CA probe.

PCR products were separated fluorescent dye using a FluorImager 595 fluorescentscanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, California, USA). A total of 17 microsatellite markers were identied as highly polymorphic for C. anomalum (Table 1). The other 10 primer sets either failed to produce a reliable PCR product or werenot polymorphic for the samples assayed. Two of the 17primer sets that were informative for C. anomalum produced a PCR product of similar size for all of the other ve cyprinidspecies tested (Table 2). In addition, nine primer sets pro-duced a PCR product of similar size in at least one of theother cyprinid species. The extensive polymorphismsidentied for these markers within C. anomalum , and their apparent applicability to other species, indicate that they willhave utility for future population studies.

For the non-enriched library, the 200- 800 bp were ligated into plasmid vector pUC18/ BamHI (Amersham/ Pharmacia). Highly competent coli One Shot, Invitrogen) were transformed with plasmids, and resultantcolonies were simultaneously screened for microsatellites usingdigoxigenin (DIG)-end labelled (GA) 10 and (CA)10 exactly as described by Estoup & Turgeon (1996). We used lter hybridization (Armour et al. 1994) to gen- erate a CT-enriched library, following methods described bySegelbacher et al. (2000) (see also Piertney et al. 1998). A 1 mg aliquot of the A. vaga 200-800 bp fragments was ligated to a SauL linker molecule, denatured and hybridized to a 1 cm 2 piece of Hybond N + membrane (Amersham/Pharmacia) to which synthetic (GA)n polymers had previously been bound (Schl\u00f6tterer 1998, pp. 241-244). After overnight hybridiza- tion at 65 in 2 \u00b7 SSC and 0.1% SDS, nylon membraneswere given three washes of 2 \u00b7 SSC and 0.1% SDS, and then the enriched fragments were stripped from the membrane byheating to 95 \u00b0C for 5 min in water. The enriched fraction was precipitated and complementary strands were reformedin a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (30 cycles consisting of1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C) using the SauL-A oligonucleotide as a primer (Schl\u00f6tterer 1998). Linkerswere removed from the fragments by digestion with Sau3AI, and the fragments, now enriched for CT/GA sequences, weresubsequently ligated into a plasmid, cloned and screenedexactly as described above for the non-enriched library. From the non-enriched library, four of 732 screened colonies were positive (0.5%), and, from the enriched library, 154 of435 screened colonies were positive (35.4%), demonstrating theutility of the enrichment protocol. Plasmid DNA was extractedfrom positive colonies, inserts were cycle-sequenced usingBig Dye Terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer), and fragmentswere resolved on an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer.Table 1 Description of 19 microsatellite loci for Andrena vaga heterozygosities (5 3\u00a2) Repeat sequenceFragment size (and range) 2000 8:58 AMPRIMER NOTES 2191 \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234The four colony plasmids from the non-enriched library each contained a unique (CT)n repeat, whilst 45 of 49 colony plasmids from the enriched library each contained a unique (CT)n repeat. PCR primers were designed on sequences flank- ing 22 perfect dinucleotide repeats using the software packageAmplify, version 1.2 (www.wisc.edu/genetics/CATG/Amplify). DNA for PCR was extracted from thoracic tissue using a high-salt protocol (Paxton et al. 1996). PCR amplica-tions were performed in 10 mL reaction volumes using an MJ Research PTC-100 thermal cycler. Individual mixes con-sisted of 10 ng template DNA, 4 pmol of each primer, 75 mm of each dCTP, dGTP Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl,0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mm spermidine and 0.4 units of thermostable DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). Samples wereprocessed through one denaturing step of 3 min at 94 \u00b0C followed by 25 cycles consisting of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at the annealing temperature specied in Table 1, and 45 s at 72 \u00b0C, with a nal elongation step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Nineteen of 22 primer pairs gave an amplication product using A. vaga as template DNA, many with numerous alleles per locus (Table 1). Primers were also successful in amplifyingDNA extracts of other andrenid bees, although less success-ful in DNA from phylogenetically taxa,namely anthophorid, apid and halictid bees (Table 2).

While population sizes areoften large in suitable habitats, they are small in many range-marginal populations, such as along the rivers Mosel, Lahnand Nahe in Germany (Gruschwitz 1985), where populationsare in danger of becoming extinct as a consequence of eitherstochastic catastrophic events or genetic erosion. On the otherhand, allochthonous populations in Switzerland that resultfrom introductions of a small number of founding individualsmay be very large (Mebert 1993). To assess the levels of gen-etic variation within large natural populations, declining range-marginal populations and allochthonous populations,suitable molecular markers are necessary. Allozymes or mito-chondrial DNA are not suitable for this purpose because levelsof genetic variation in small populations are typically verylow, or because relatively large amounts of fresh blood or tissueare necessary. Microsatellites, on the other hand, are oftenvariable even in small and endangered populations and canbe easily amplied from minute amounts of DNA recoveredfrom blood samples, shed skin or faeces. We constructed a partial genomic library enriched for CA and GA repeats using a slight modication of the proceduresdescribed by Tenzer et al. (1999) and Gautschi et al. (2000). Briefly, total genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples using astandard phenol-chloroform extraction protocol (Sambrooket al. 1989). DNA was digested with Tsp509I (New England Biolabs), 200-700 bp fragments were isolated and ligated to TSPADSHORT/TSPADLONG linker sequences (Tenzer et al. 1999). DNA linker molecules were amplied according toGautschi et al.

Enriched fragments were again amplied and products were cloned using theOriginal TA Cloning\u00ae Kit (Invitrogen BV) following the \u00a2- oligolabelling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia) were used to screen for inserts contain ing CA and GA repeats. The hybridization was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids from positive clones were sequenced as described in Gautschi et al.

Primer design was carried out using primer 3 software ( Rozen & Skaletsky 1998), oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth GmbH(Switzerland), and one primer for each pair was labelled withfluorescent dye (see Table 1). PCR amplication for polymorphism assessment was performed in a 10 mL reaction volume containing 10 ng of genomic DNA, 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 150 mm of each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia), 0.5 mm each of forward and reverse primer and 0.5 units of Taq DNApolymerase (Amersham and observed ( HO) and expected ( HE) heterozygosities in samples from populations from Lake Lugano (Switzerland) ( n = 10) and Lake Garda (Italy) ( n = 19).

Observed and expectedheterozygosities for each locus were calculated using Popgeneversion 1.32 (Yeh & Boyle 1997). All eight microsatellite loci reported here were variable in Natrix tessellata and detected between four and 11 alleles in the two populations studied. Likelihood ratio tests indicatedsignicant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium(HWE) at loci mNt1 and mNt3, suggesting that null alleles may be present at these loci. Genotype frequencies at all other lociconformed to HWE. These microsatellites will therefore pro-vide a valuable tool for the analysis of genetic variation innatural and allochthonous populations of the dice snake andhelp to devise appropriate conservation management strategiesfor small and endangered populations.

Fax: + 41 1635 57 11; E-mail: babagaut@uwinst.unizh.ch During one hundred years the bearded vulture, Gypaetus barbatus , has suffered extreme population declines in Europe primarily because of hunting, but changes also inagriculture, and especially in grazing practices, have resultedin poor food conditions for carrion feeders. Small populationshave survived in the Pyrenees, on Corsica and Crete. Thepopulation in the Alps was completely extinct by the beginningof the 20th century. To re-establish a self-sustaining popula-tion in the Alps, over 90 juvenile bearded vultures have beenreleased since 1986, all originating from a captive population.The amount of genetic variability in the captive and releasedpopulations, genealogical relationships between individuals,and the degree of gene flow among wild populations in thepast (represented by over 200 Museum specimens) and atpresent are important criteria in the development of a geneticmanagement strategy. We describe the development of 14microsatellite primers for conservation genetic analyses ofthe bearded vulture. We designed the primers with specialemphasis on their later use for ancient DNA (aDNA) and testedtheir suitability for use in other Old World vulture species. We constructed a genomic library enriched for CA and GA repeats using a modication of the method described inTenzer et al. (1999). Digestion of total genomic DNA with Tsp509I (New England Biolabs), fragmentsand TSPADSHORT/TSPADLONG linker sequenceswere carried out to Tenzer et al. (1999). The ligation produces blunt-ended molecules that were amplied in 4025 mL reactions containing 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 50 m m KCl, each dNTP, 1 mm of TSPADSHORT (primer), and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Appligene oncor). The thermal prole on a PTC100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research)was 30 cycles of 93 \u00b0C for 1 min, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. An initial 5 min extension step at 72 \u00b0C allowed the DNA polymerase to synthesize the nick between genomicDNA and linker sequences. Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) products were hybridized to biotinylated (CA) 13 and (GA)13 probes that were immobilized onto Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (DYNAL, France). Hybridization was November 15, 2000 8:58 AM2194 PRIMER NOTES \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234as described in Tenzer et al. (1999). Retained fragments were amplied in a second PCR as above without the initial exten-sion step. PCR products were digested with EcoRI onto selective dot-blottingcolonies onto Nylon-Membrane (Hybond-N +, Amersham Pharmacia), the library was screened for inserts containingCA and GA repeats using oligonucleotide probes labelledwith ECL3 \u00a2-oligolabelling and detection system out in accordancewith the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids from positive clones were sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers and the ABI BigDyeTerminator Sequencing Ready Reaction (PE analysed on an ABI Prism 310 GeneticAnalyser and edited with Sequence Navigator Software (PEBiosystems). Primers were designed using Primer 3 software(Rozen & Skaletsky 1998). Where possible, we consideredonly primers that did not bind to a template thymine orcytosine residue at the 3 \u00a2 end because these nucleotides are most likely to be degraded in aDNA (P\u00e4\u00e4bo 1989). One primerfor each pair was labelled with fluorescent dye (Table 1). To assay variation among individuals, amplications were performed in 10 mL volumes containing 10 ng of genomic DNA, 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 150 mm per dNTP, 0.5 mm of each primer, 0.5 U of Taq DNA Polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia), and the followingthermotreatment: 25-30 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at locus specic annealing temperature (Table 1) and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C. An initial denaturation step (95 \u00b0C for 5 min) was included and the last cycle was followed by an 8-min extension. Ampliedproducts were diluted and mixed with formamide containingGENESCAN-350(ROX) Size Standard (PE Biosystems) andthe genotype ABI using GeneScan Analysis\u00ae software version 2.1 (PE Biosystems). We screened30 bearded vulture individuals from the captive population(Table 1), 15 Egyptian vultures, Neophron percnopterus , 15 black vultures, Aegypius griffon vultures, Gyps fulvus , from France (Table 2).Table 1 Genetic characteristics of 14 bearded vulture microsatellite loci.

Lynxconservation programmes have been attempted in Colorado(Kloor 1999) and are currently in development throughout thecontiguous United States. Because an understanding of thegenetics of wildlife populations may assist in their conserva-tion, we set out to identify microsatellite markers that mightfacilitate population genetic studies of Canadian lynx. Muscle tissue chips from a single lynx were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to powder. High molecular weight genomicDNA was then isolated by phenol extraction (Sambrook et al. 1989) and digested to completion with Sau3A.

Six of these loci (Table 1) gave strong, cleanPCR products. Furthermore, multiplexing allows the ampli-cation of these six loci in three 15 mL reactions: Lc 106, Lc 110 and Lc 118 = 0.16 mm each primer, 160 mm dNTPs, 2 m m MgCl 2, 0.36 U Taq DNA Polymerase (prepared as in Engelke et al. 1990) and approximately 50 ng genomic DNA [extractedusing QIAamp spin columns (QIAGEN)] BSA); Lc 111 and Lc 120 = 0.16 mm each primer, 160 mm dNTPs, 2m m MgC1 2, 1.44 U Taq DNA Polymerase and 50 ng template DNA in PCR buffer; Lc 109 = 0.16 mm each primer, 120 mm dNTPs, 2 m m MgC12, 0.3 U Taq DNA Poly- merase and 50 ng template DNA in PCR buffer. All cyclingreactions were performed as in Davis & Strobeck (1998) andtheir products analysed on an ABI 377 Sequencer withGenescan and Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems). Twenty-nine lynx tissue samples were genotyped to estimate the variability of each locus (these samples do notrepresent a population as they were collected from a varietyof sites in Alberta over approximately 15 years).

The two most geographicallywidespread members of the genus are the short-nosed fruitbat ( Cynopterus sphinx ) and the lesser dog-faced fruit bat (C. brachyotis ). There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the taxonomic relationship between C. sphinx and C. brachyotis , and the status of the many named forms within C. sphinx (Storz & Kunz 1999). The availability of polymorphic micro-satellite markers for cynopterine fruit bats would greatly aidefforts to elucidate species boundaries and genetic correl-ates of morphological variation within species. The primarymotivation for developing microsatellite markers for C. sphinx was to investigate the influence of polygynous mating andharem social organization on population genetic structure(Storz et al. 2000a,b). Efforts are also underway to investigate comparative levels of geographical differentiation in bodysize and microsatellites in Indian populations of C. sphinx (see Storz et al. 2000c). Genomic DNA was isolated from wing-membrane biopsy samples of C. sphinx using QIAamp extraction columns (Qiagen). Microsatellite loci were isolated from three genomiclibraries enriched for tri- and tetranucleotide repeat motifsfollowing the methods of Jones et al. (2000). Following partial digestion with a combination of seven blunt-end restrictionendonucleases, size-selected containeda HindIII restriction site. Genomic fragments were subjected to magnetic bead capture using the following 5 \u00a2-biotinylated oligonucleotides: ATG 8, CATC8, and TAGA8 (Integrated DNA Technologies). Captured fragments were Polymerase chainreaction (PCR)-amplied using primers complementary to the adapter sequences. The resultant products were ligated into DH5 a by electroporation. Colonies were screened accord ing to the protocol of Jones et al. (2000). Following PCR amplica- tion, a total of 27 clones in the size range 350-650 bp weresequenced using Prism Cycle Sequencing kits and labelleddNTP's Biosystems). were esolved automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). sequences contained at least one microsatellite locus. Primers were designed for a total of 21 microsatelliteloci using the program Designer PCR version 1.03 (ResearchGenetics). Primer pairs were tested by amplifying DNA fromeight individual C. sphinx sampled from various localities in peninsular India. Sixteen primer pairs amplied variablePCR products, as revealed by electrophoresis in 3.5% agarosegels followed by ethidium-bromide staining. Nine primerpairs that yielded the most consistent results were selectedfor further testing, and the forward primer of each pair wasfluorescently labelled with 6-FAM, TET, or HEX (AppliedBiosystems). PCR was performed using 20 mm of each primer, 5 m m dNTP's, 25 m m MgCL 2, 0.012 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 10 \u00b7 PCR buffer (100 m m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, 500 m m KCl), ddH2O, and 10 ng of template DNA in a total reaction volume of15 mL. Thermal cycling was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) under the followingconditions: initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55-57 \u00b0C (Table 1) for 45 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C forTable 1 Primer sequences and characteristics of nine tri- and tetranucleotide repeat microsatellite loci used in the genetic analysis o f Cynopterus sphinx from Pune, India (18 \u00b032\u00a2 N, 73\u00b051\u00a2 E).

Allele sizes were quantied using an ABI Prism 377 automatedsequencer and analysed using genescan software (PE Applied Biosystems). To assess levels of variation in C. sphinx and C. brachyotis , microsatellite genotypes were obtained for a total of 731 bats(620 C. sphinx and 111 C. brachyotis ). A total of 431 adults and juveniles of C. sphinx from a single population in Pune, India (Storz et al. 2000b) were genotyped at all nine loci (Table 1). A total of 185 known mother-offspring pairs were examined,and no genotypic mismatches were observed at any locus. Using a subset of ve microsatellite loci, an additional 189 C. sphinx that were sampled from localities in south-western India (see Storz et al. 2000c), and 111 C. brachyotis that were sampled from high-elevation wet forest sites in the WesternGhats were genotyped. In the total sample of C. sphinx (n = 620), mean number of alleles per locus was 12.4 (range = 6-21;Table 2). Although preliminary screening of 20 individualsindicated that CSP-2 was monomorphic in C. brachyotis , the remaining four loci segregated 4 -17 alleles. Relative to C. sphinx , homologous loci in C. brachyotis segregated alleles that were generally shorter in length (Table 2). These markersshould open up many new opportunities for studying thepopulation biology and phylogeography of Old World fruitbats.

Interest has been directed towardresource enhancement, and accordingly, millions of P . olivaceus are released into Japanese coastal sheries grounds everyyear (Furusawa 1997), yet little is known about reproductivesuccess of the stocked sh. To promote effective stockingmanagement, it is necessary to monitor the fate of stockedsh and their relatedness apart from naturally reproducedsh. Microsatellite DNA loci are expected to provide aninvaluable tool for this purpose because of the power andability of microsatellite markers in regard to resolutionfor genetic relatedness among individuals (Blouin et al. 1996) and parentage determination (O'Reilly et al. 1998). Here, we describe the characterization of microsatellitesisolated from P . olivaceus that will be useful to address the stocking effects. The method described by Sekino et al. (2000) was used for cloning P . olivaceus microsatellites. In brief, genomic ranging bp recovered.The fragments were ligated into SrfI site of pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), and binant transformed into XL2-Blue MRF\u00a2 Single-stranded DNA was prepared, and selective second-strand DNAsynthesis was employed using (CA) 12 oligonucleotide and cloned pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The resultant double-strand DNA was transformed into XL2-Blue MRF \u00a2 cells again and these transformants were referred to a (CA)n- enriched library. From the library, 80 clones were randomly chosen, and plasmid DNAs were were determinedin directions using Thermo Sequenase cycle Biotech) in sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Of the 80 clones, 59 contained one or more repeatsequences. We designed 27 polymerase chain reaction(PCR) primer pairs using a Premier software package(Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). To examine microsatellite polymorphisms, PCR was employed. PCR amplication was carried out in a 20 mL reaction volume, which included 20 pmols of each primer set (one primer in each pair was 5 \u00a2 end-labelled with Cy5), 100 mm of each dNTP, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.001% gelatin, 0.5 U of Ampli Taq Gold TM (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA, USA), and approximately 50 ngof template DNA using PC-960G gradient thermal cycler(Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). PCR ampli-cation were as follows: 12 min at 95 \u00b0C, 35-40 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at a primer-specic temperature, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, and nal elongation for 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. Analyses of PCR products were performed using ALFexpress sequencer in combination with an Allelelinks software package (Amer-sham Pharmacia Biotech). All 27 microsatellite loci were successfully amplied,out of which we nally chose 16 primer sets (the remain- ing 11 having been rejected because their polymorphismswere low, and/or they produced unexpected PCRproducts in an initial sample of P . olivaceus ) and assessed further microsatellite polymorphisms in a natural P . olivaceus population collected from the Japanese coast of the JapanSea. As shown in Table 1, the number of alleles ranged from 4-40, and the observed and expected heterozygosity rangedfrom 0.43-0.99 and 0.43-0.97, respectively. All to Hardy-Weinberg's (HW) equilib 000 dememorization steps), usingan Arlequin verion 1.1 software package (Schneider et al. 1997). At the Po31 locus, the observed genotype frequen- cies showed signicant departure from HW expectations (P < 0.05) with a large discrepancy between the observed and expected heterozygosity (0.34 and 0.91, respect-ively). This may be explained by sampling errors due tolimited sample size or substructuring of the samples, how-ever, this seems unlikely because the observed genotypefrequencies in all other 15 loci were consistent with theexpectations. We believe that the presence of null alleles(Pemberton et al. 1995) may be a valid explanation causing these results. Further investigation of this topic isnecessary. Microsatellite DNA loci described in thepresent study possess hypervariability, suggesting that these loci will be useful for genetic monitoring of stockedP . olivaceus in furthering our understanding of stocking effects.

Strassmann. Fax: subfamily Stenogastrinae live in South-east Asia and comprise about 50 described speciesin six genera (T urillazzi 1996). Most species in this tropical subfamily of Vespidae have a colony with a small numberof individuals and a simple temporal division of labour whichmakes them a suitable group for studying the origin ofsociality in wasps (Turillazzi 1991; Strassmann et al. 1994). Microsatellite loci are useful tools for studying Stenogastrine population structure, relatedness within colonies and brood,and for determining males (Queller & Strassmann 1993). Allof these are crucial factors for understanding Stenogastrinesocieties. In this paper, we describe 33 microsatellite loci isolatedfrom Eustenogaster fraterna that are likely to be useful in this and many other species of the subfamily Stenogastrinae. We made a partical genomic library of E. fraterna follow- ing published protocols (Strassmann et al. 1996), but used a positive-selection plasmid whicheliminated with Sau3AI then ligated the fragments rang- ing from 300 - 900 bp into pZErO-2.1 plasmids. We transformedTOP10F\u00a2 cells to obtain a 15 000 clone library which was plated into nylon. Probing library replicates with oligoncleotides ofall 10 trinucleotide motifs yielded 361 positives. Southern blotsof plasmid DNA conrmed 121, 70 of which were sequenced.We designed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for 31clones containing ve or more trinucleotide r epeats, and two clones consisting of long dinucleotide repeats (T able 1). We evaluated these primers for heterozygosity on 24 individuals from six species following standard protocols (Strassmann et al. 1996). We extracted genomic DNA rst and then performed PCR in a 10- mL volume with nal concentra- tions of 50-200 ng genomic DNA, 250 n m of each primer, 100 mm of each dNTP, 50 m m KCl, 10 m m Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.55 m m MgCl 2, 1.875 mCi 35S-dATP and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase under an oil overlay. We ran 40 cycles of 30 s at 92 \u00b0C denaturing, 30 s primer annealing (temperature varied depending on each primer and species)and 45 s extension at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 5 extra minutes at 72 \u00b0C to allow for the complete extension of all PCR frag- ments using a and anM13 sequence was used as a size standard.Of the 33 primer pairs we designed, 29 yielded scorable microsatellite alleles. The number of alleles and expectedheterozygosity of each variable locus in different speciesare detailed in Table 2. Out of 33 microsatellite loci, 27 werepolymorphic in E. fraterna though heterozygosity varied 0.20-0.81. Eighteen and 15 loci were polymorphic inE. calytodoma and Eustenogaster sp., respectively. Six polymorphisms of microsatellite loci decrease withincreasing phylogenetic distance cross species (Ezenwaet al. 1998; Zhu et al. 2000). We analysed the relationship between repeat length and heterozygosity. Repeat length was represented by two meas-ures: (i) the number of longest perfect, uninterrupted repeats;and (ii) total number of repeats including ones with base pairimperfections. We found signicantly positive correlationsbetween heterozygosity and repeat length (both perfectP = 0.038 and total P = 0.011, Spearman correlation). We had more than two microsatellite loci in E. fraterna for three repeat motifs, AAG, AAT and GAC. If we split the analysis fordifferent motif types, we found no signicant relationshipsbetween repeat length (either perfect or total) and hetero-zygosity for these three repeat motifs. Both correlations for the GAC motif were insignicant. Small sample size leads toa lack of power and might obscure any relationship betweennumbers of repeats and heterozygosity for these motifs.

Green spotted puffersh has not been bred incaptivity and little is known about its biology, especiallyreproduction. Most researchers rely on individuals collected from the wild, but very little is known about natural popula-tions of the species. Microsatellites have been successfully applied to assess genetic diversity, population structure and individual related-ness in animals and plants. To our knowledge, no micro-satellite has been characterized in T. nigroviridis . This paper describes the isolation and characterization of seven micro-satellites from the genome of this puffersh species. Thirty-two adult green spotted puffersh were obtained from a local sh dealer in Singapore. Genomic DNA wasextracted from muscle using a standard phenol-chloroformextraction protocol. A (CA) n-enriched plasmid library was constructed using DNA from one sh as described previously(Yue et al. 2000). More than 7500 clones were obtained, most of them (approximately 99%) were white on plates containingX-gal. The insert length of clones was checked by colonypolymerase chain reaction (PCR) using M13-20 and M13-reverseprimers. Out of 192 clones tested, 58 contained inserts in the sizerange of 250-1000 bp. Colony PCR products of these cloneswere puried and sequenced as described (Yue et al. 2000).Table 2 Expected heterozygosities and number of alleles 0.661 (3) (3)EF131CAT + + +EF184AAC 0.720 + + (1) (1) + + 0.000 (1) + +Number of polymorphic loci27 18 15 6 6 10 +, no PCR product.MEC1053.fm Page 2205 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AM2206 PRIMER NOTES \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234Out of the 58 clones sequenced, only 7 (~12%) contained microsatellite repeats, which is about 6 times lower than thepercentage obtained from Asian arowana (Yue et al. 2000) by using the same enrichment procedure. This result mightindicate low abundance of CA-repeats in the genome ofT. nigroviridis . However, data from large scale sequencing performed on the T. nigroviridis genome do not support this hypothesis (Roest Crollius et al. 2000b). Alternative inter- pretation of the result might be that the CA-repeats in this com-pact genome are relatively short and are difcult to enrich by the method used. Among the seven microsatellites isolated,only ve contained CA/GT repeats, the other two comprisedGCA-repeats and GACA-repeats, respectively (Table 1). Primer pairs were designed to the flanking sequences of repeats using software PrimerSelect (DNASTAR). Thirty-twoT. nigroviridis individuals were genotyped for the seven microsatellites as described previously (Yue et al. 2000), except using different annealing temperatures (in the range of 45-60 \u00b0C) and MgCl 2 concentrations (1.5 or 3.0 m m; see Table 1). Six out of seven microsatellites showed specic prod-ucts and polymorphism (Table 1), while was polymorphic. The average number of alleles at the polymorphicloci was 12.7 (range: 5-22), whereas the average observedheterozygosity ranged from 0.22-0.95 with PF29, to Hardy-Weinberg expectations when tested using chi-squareanalysis, while the other three did not. A signicant hetero-zygosity decit was displayed at locus PF203 , suggesting the appearance of null alleles. One duplex-PCR was established for the PF12 and PF29 loci according to Yue et al. (1999). The 25 mL reaction contained 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 150 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 100 mm of each dNTP, 0.2 mm each of PF12 primers, 0.4 mm each of PF29 primers, 30 and cycling conditions were:an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, with a nal extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The detection of PCRproducts and the sizing of alleles were performed on the ABI 377 sequencer as described previously (Yue et al. 2000). In order to become a good model not only for genomics, but also for genetics and developmental biology, T. nigroviridis must be bred routinely in captivity. The polymorphic micro-satellite markers described here will assist the analysis ofnatural populations and breeding experiments. Acknowledgements We thank H.

Garner. Fax: + 41 635 68 21; E-mail: twjg@zool.unizh.ch Sperm competition in yellow dung flies ( stercoraria ) has been extensively investigated since Parker's seminal work (e.g. Parker & Simmons 1991; Ward1993; Hosken & Ward 2000; reviewed in Hosken 1999). Theseflies serve as a model system for understanding the mechan-isms and outcomes of sperm competition in internal fertilizers.Invariably however, these investigations have been labor-atory based, and typically involved competition betweenonly two males. How the results of such studies relates to free-living flies is unknown, but it is unlikely that the experimentalconditions employed exist in nature, and therefore outcomesmay not reflect true female sperm utilization patterns (Eady& Tubman 1996). This is exemplied by a study of spermcompetition in pseudoscorpions, which showed that second-male mating advantage breaks down when females matewith more than two males (Zeh & Zeh 1994). In addition,Ward (2000) has shown that females are able to subtly alterpaternity patterns under conditions that are likely to becommon in the eld. With this in mind, our aim was todevelop appropriate genetic markers to allow paternity to beaccurately assigned in clutches laid by free-living femaleyellow dung flies. A subgenomic library enriched for CA repeat microsatellites was constructed following standard protocols outlined inTenzer et al. (1999), with slight modications. Genomic DNA isolated from a single S. stercoraria male using standard phenol- chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (Sambrooket al. 1989) was digested using Tsp509I (New England Biolabs). A 500-1000 bp size fraction was isolated from a LM-MPagarose (Boehringer Mannheim) gel by rst excising theappropriate size range from the gel. The gel fragment wasmelted in a 65 \u00b0C water bath and volume was increased to 500 mL using double distilled water. An equal volume of equilibrated phenol (pH 8.0) was added, the solution vortexedbriefly and then put at - 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. The sample was then thawed and extraction was completed following standardphenol-chloroform extraction methods (Sambrook et al. 1989). This isolate was used for ligation with TSPADSHORT/TSPADLONG linkers (Tenzer et al. 1999) and then amplied via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using TSPADSHORTas a primer. PCR was performed using the following condi-tions: Total reaction volume was 25 mL included 100 ng DNA,1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Quantum-Appligene), 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.01% TritonX100, 0.2 mg BSA (Quantum-Appligene), 100 mm each dNTP (Promega), and 1 mm of TSPADSHORT. PCR was performed on a Techne Genius thermocycler (Techne Ltd) using the following thermo-treatment: 2 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C. A total of 32 PCRs were carried out, pooled, cleaned and concentratedto minimize the likelihood of redundant products beingdetected during screening for positive clones. PCR prod-ucts were hybridized to biotinylated (CA) DYNAL, France) and cloned following the OriginalTA Cloning\u00ae Kit (Invitrogen) protocol. White colonies weredot-blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N +, Amer- sham Pharmacia) and screened for CA repeats using the ECL3\u00a2-oligolabelling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia) and a 40mer CA oligonucleotide. All following the ABI Prism\u00ae BigDye TerminatorCycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit protocol, version 2.0(PE Biosystems) using M13 forward and reverse primers,and using the ABI 377 automated sequencing system (PEBiosystems). Primers were designed using Primer3 \u00b0C and 8%, nondenaturing, 14.5 cm \u00b7 17 cm acrylamide gels at 80 V overnight. Those primers that amplied polymorphic products using ve test templateswere used for all following analyses. Only eld-caught male S. stercoraria were used for PCR analysis, as almost every eld-caught female is alreadymated (Parker 1970b), and extraction from fertilized femalescould therefore result in contamination by sperm DNA. Eachsample male was extracted using the QIAamp\u00ae DNA minikit (Qiagen). Twenty males were used to characterize suit-able primers, and PCR was carried out using approximately100 ng of template DNA and the following cycle treatment;initial step of 3 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 27 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 58-61 \u00b0C (see Table 1), and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C, with a nal extension step of 2 min at 72 \u00b0C.

The long-est sperm storing capacity among mammals is documented inthe noctule bat. Females can store sperm in the uterus after cop- ulation in autumn for up to six months until fertilization inspring (Racey 1973). Therefore, noctule bats are likely can-didates to show high levels of multiple paternity that couldbe analysed most efciently Microsatellite of were isolated from a size-selected partial genomic library (Rassmann et al. 1991). Total genomic DNA was isolated from muscle tissue of afemale bat and was digested with three restriction enzymes(AluI, HaeIII and RsaI). Fragments ranging from 300-600 bp in were ligated in SmaI digested M13mp18 and M13mp19 cloning vectors (Yanisch-Perron et al. 1985). Ligation products were transformed into competent XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene)which were plated onto LB pates containing X-gal andIPTG.

Thirty-one of the 224 'positive' clones were sequencedand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designedfor 14 loci. A circular wing clip of 4 mm diameter was obtained from individual bats. Approximately 0.5 mg DNA was isolated after a 3-h incubation with 0.1 mg proteinase K in 500 mL digestion buffer (100 m m Tris-HCl, 100 m m NaCl, 2 m m EDTA, 42 m m dithiotreitol, 2% sodium dodecyl of M\u00fcllenbach et al. (1989). PCR amplications were carried out in a 10- mL volume containing approximately 10 ng DNA, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.5 mm each primer, 0.025 m m each dNTP, 0.25 unit Goldstar Polymerase (Eurogentec) together with thereaction buffer provided by the supplier [nal concentration:75 m m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 4)2SO4, 0.01% (w/v) Tween 20]. PCRs were performed in a Perkin Elmer DNA ThermalCycler TC1 and consisted of 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, the annealing temperature (Table 1) for 20 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. For each microsatellite locus one primer was labelled with afluorescent dye. The PCR products were separated on 6%Sequagel\u00aeXR gels (National Diagnostics) in a LI-COR DNAsequencer genotypes were determinedusing RFLPscan (Scanalytics).Highly specic amplication products were obtained at 13 of the 14 loci. For each animal only one or two major ampli-cation products were detected which were close to the lengthof the cloned allele. Allele sizes varied in multiples of therepeat size only and characteristic slippage bands could bedetected at all loci. At two loci the proportion of homozygoteswas much higher than expected under Hardy-Weinbergequilibrium. At locus P22a only one allele could be amplied inall males. In females no deviation from Hardy-Weinbergexpectation was detected. This strongly suggests that locusP22a is located on the X chromosome. The decit of hetero- zygotes at the other locus was not limited to males. Therefore,the presence of null alleles is a likely explanation. This locuswas not evaluated further. Cross-species amplication was tested in 11 European bat species of the family Vespertilionidae. Nine loci could beamplied in other species and eight in other genera than thesource species. Allelic variation was usually high and only inve cases the loci seemed to be monomorphic in a particularspecies (Table 2). The applicability of primer pairs is highamong species within the family Vespertilionidae but seemsto be low in other families (Burland et al. 1998). Length of amplication products can vary substantially among species. For example the amplication product of locus P217 was about 400 bp longer in the three species of Eptesicus and Plecotus than in all other species.

McCoy, Fax: + 33 1 44 27 35 16; E-mail: kmccoy@snv.jussieu.fr Ixodes uriae is a common parasite of many seabird species in the polar regions. Interest in this tick has risen in the pastdecade as more information is gathered on its potentialimpacts on host ecology and evolution. In particular, I. uriae is thought to affect the reproductive success and habitatchoice of its seabird hosts (Boulinier et al. 2001), and to vector several avian arbo-viruses and disease agents (Chastel1988), including the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi (Olsen et al. 1993). Thus, knowledge of dispersal ability of this ectoparasite within and among host populations is ofvital importance if we are to understand its role in this host-parasite-disease interaction. The independent migratory abilities of hard ticks are con- sidered to be weak, and direct examination of dispersal ofthese parasites at large spatial scales is not possible (McCoyet al. 1999) . Thus, to examine patterns of dispersion, indirect approaches, such as using genetic markers, are more plausible.To address the question of population structure and gene flowof I. uriae within and among its seabird hosts, we rst attemptedto amplify DNA using primers developed for I. ricinus , a common tick species of vertebrates in Europe (Delaye et al. 1998); no successful amplications were achieved. In this note,we characterize nine microsatellite markers developed for I. uriae . DNA was extracted from 42 A genomic library was con- structed following Estoup et al. (1993). Eleven mg of larval DNA was restricted with the enzyme Sau3A. Resulting frag- ments were separated on a 1.5% agarosegel and fragments between 400-800 bp were isolated, puri-ed using a Q1Aquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) andligated into a pBluescript vector II Sk + plasmid products were then transformed into XL1-Blue Hybond-N + membranes which were hybrid-ized with a mixture of two probes (CT) 10 and (GT)10. Two thousand clones from the library gave 65 positively hybrid-ized clones from which 48 were sequenced. Primers weredesigned for 10 loci using Primer 0.5 (Lincoln & Daly 1991).Nine loci were polymorphic and gave clear polymerase chainreaction (PCR) results of expected size (Table 1). Genomic DNA was prepared using a high-salt extraction method. PCR amplications were performed in a 10- mL mixture containing 1 mL of genomic DNA (approximately 50 ng), 75 mm of each of dCTP, dTTP, dGTP, 7.5 mm of dATP , 0.4 mm of each primer, 1 mL of 10\u00b7 Taq buffer (Tris-Cl, KCl (NH 4)2SO4, 15 m m MgCl2, pH 8.7), 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and 0.025 mCi [a33P]-dATP (Amersham).

PCR products were denatured and separated on 6% poly-acrylamide and 8 m urea sequencing gels using a M13 sequence as a size marker. To characterize each locus, we genotyped ticks originating from two Atlantic Canada (48 \u00b008\u00a2 N, 52\u00b048\u00a2 W) and Horn\u00f8ya, Norway (Table 1). Expected heterozygosities were variable, ranging from 0.08-0.94 with an average of 0.61 ( - 0.09). Neither tick population showed any signicant deviation from Hardy-Weinbergequilibrium after correcting for multiple tests (Rice 1989). Cross-species amplication of primers was tested on I. ricinus . amplications were attempted for all nine 10ticks originating from Bern, Switzerland; PCR protocols wereidentical except that the annealing temperature used forall primers was 52 \u00b0C. No successful amplications were achieved for any locus. In conclusion, based on their high polymorphism, the micro- satellite markers developed for I. uriae should enable the examination of a diverse range of questions related to parasitedispersal among hosts over a range of spatial scales, fromwithin colonies to between hemispheres. Likewise, patternsof parasite gene flow may provide insight into the large-scalemovement of their seabird hosts. Such data will provevaluable for examining questions related to the evolution oflocal adaptation in this host-parasite system and for examin-ing the epidemiology of tick-borne disease.

The King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctata , is the most widespread whiting species in southern Australiawhere it forms signicant sheries, which have becomesubject to management controls due to catch declines (Kailolaet al. 1993). If multiple stocks are present, then their identica- tion can allow management to be more efciently focused.In an allozyme study of stocks of Australian whiting, Dixonet al. (1987) identied too few usefully polymorphic loci in King George whiting. DNA markers canprovide sufcient numbers of polymorphic markers inspecies that have low proportions of polymorphic allozymeloci. We describe the isolation and characterization of micro-satellite loci from the King George whiting. We also evaluatethe cross-species amplication of some of these loci on twoother species of whiting of the genus Sillago , from southern Australian waters that also form signicant sheries. Microsatellites were isolated, using (AAAG) 6 probes, with two methods, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based pro-cedure (Cooper et al. 1997) and magnetic bead enrichment (Gardner et al. 1999). A total of 32 clones were isolated by the rst method and sequenced with the Sp6 vector primerusing PE Applied Biosystems PRISM Dye Terminator CycleSequencing Kit with the products run on an ABI 373 instru-ment. Sequencing showed that inserts of 24 clones containedAAAG repeats. Of the 18 clones isolated with the secondprocedure, nine showed tandem repeats following sequencing.Of the 33 primer pairs designed, 19 produced ampliablemicrosatellite loci.

Genotyping of 10 individuals from across the species geographical range,showed that nine loci were variable (Table 1). A single primerfrom each variable pair was re-synthesized and labelled withABI fluorescent dyes (Table 1) for genotyping using the Genescan application (PE AppliedBiosystems). Co-amplication was for 288 indi- viduals in 10 populations from across the species' geographicalrange. Inspection of the genotype arrays showed, for locus number of individuals typed as homozygous for rareputative alleles in four populations that otherwise containedonly the common allele. In view of these potentially anomaloustypings and the high frequency of the common allele, eitherxed or P > 0.99, the locus was omitted from further con- sideration. Tests for conformity to Hardy-Weinberg proportionsin the remaining loci, Locus Sp39 was omitted from further analysisbecause of the possible presence of null alleles. Table 1 showsthe values of F ST, for the remaining individual loci estimated with genepop (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Individual locus FST values are low, the typical picture for subpopulation differentiation seen in many marine shes (Ward et al. 1994). Cross-species amplications, without extra optimization and at an annealing temperature \u00b0C, were successfulfor Sillago successfully amplied. In all cases clean productswere detected in the single individual of each species tested.

Fax: + 31 50 3632348; E-mail: r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl In man-dominated landscapes populations of once common species have become decreased both in range and densityand been restricted to small habitat patches with reduceddispersal possibilities. Such fragmented populations becomeincreasingly affected by stochastic population dynamics dueto demographic, environmental and genetic risks, eventuallyleading to increased extinction probabilities (Bijlsma et al. 2000). The Eurasian badger ( Meles meles L.) is a species that is threatened in many parts of Western Europe because offragmentation and suffers greatly from agricultural activities(Moore et al. 1999). Moreover, increasing density of roads and trafc does not only considerably limit dispersal, but alsohighly increases mortality due to road-kills (Aaris S\u00f8rensen1995). From a conservation perspective insights into the(meta)population structure of the badger is clearly needed.As allozyme variation was found to be low in badgers(Pertoldi et al. 2000), we have developed highly variable microsatellite markers that make noninvasive sampling anduse of dead animals possible. To isolate microsatellite markers, muscle tissue was obtained from 23 badgers, killed by trafc accidents, by samplinga piece of the ear or the tail. DNA extraction and smallinsert libraries were constructed using standard procedures(Ausubel et al. 1987). Overnight incubation in lysis buffer (100 m m NaCl, 10 m m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 m m EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K) at 55 \u00b0C by two phenol extractions and one phenol:chloroform (24:1 v/v)extraction. Ethanol precipitated DNA was dried and dis-solved in TE (10 m m Tris-HCL pH. 7.6, 1 m m EDTA). Total genomic DNA was digested to completion with MboI, size fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and the 200-1000 bp frac-tion was recovered by electroelution. These fragments wereligated into BamHI digested pBluescript and used to trans- form competent XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells to establish a small-insert library. This library was screened with synthetic(CA) 7 and (GA)7 probes, end-labelled with [ g32P]-ATP . using the T7-sequencing kit and[a 35S]-dATP . Out of an initial 2400 clones, 43 positive recom- binants were identied, eventually yielding seven usablemicrosatellite loci. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out in 10 mL volumes, containing 100 ng template DNA, 0.5 mm each primer, 0.2 m m dATP , dGTP and dTTP, 0.02 m m dCTP, polymerase (Pharmacia) and 0.14 mCi [a 32P]-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in buffer (50 m m KCl, 1.5 m m MgCl2 and 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). After an initial 3 min at 94 \u00b0C, 30 cycles were performed with the following prole: 1 minat 94 \u00b0C, 2 min at T a (optimal annealing temperature) and 1.5 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Labelled PCR products were separated on acryla- mide gel (Biozym, Sequagel lm (Fuji) for 5-16 h at -70 \u00b0C, using intensifying screens. A sequence ladder of pBluescript was used as size reference. The level of polymorphism was determined for a total of 105 badger samples collected from different localities inThe Netherlands and Denmark. The characteristics of theseven microsatellite loci are shown in Table 1. All loci werefound to be polymorphic and the mean number of alleleswas 4.3 (range: 2-6) and mean expected heterozygosity(H E) was 0.45 (range: 0.15-0.65). Although this is within the range observed for other mustelid species (O'Connell et al. 1996; Dallas & Piertney 1998; Fleming et al. 1999), mean expected heterozygosity in the badger was lower than inthese other species (means ranging from 0.55 to 0.84). Exceptfor two subsamples of locus Mel 2, mainly due to verylow expected numbers for some genotypes, no signicantdifferences in expected and observed levels of hetero-zygosity were observed for all loci, indicating the absenceof null-alleles. The badger primer sets were also evaluatedfor use in two other mustelid species. In the pine marten(Martes martes , n = 88), two primer sets failed to produce an amplication product, two were found to be polymorphic andthe other three monomorphic (Table 1). In the otter ( Lutra lutra , n = 5), all primer sets yielded an amplication pr oduct (data not shown). However, the sample size was too small toreliably estimate number of alleles and expected heterozygosity. Presently, the primer sets are used to assess the current genetic population structure of badger populations and ofthe pine marten.

L. Brown. Fax: + 804 8280503; BLBROWN@vcu.edu Oysters of the genus Crassostrea are of great ecological and economic value worldwide. Eastern oysters, C. virginica , were once a keystone species of western Atlantic estuaries but noware depleted in many areas due to the combined effectsof overharvesting, habitat alteration, and diseases causedby introduced parasites (Brown & Paynter 1991). Hopes ofrestoring oysters to these regions are tied to development ofdisease tolerant strains of the native C. virginica , and efforts to cultivate this and related species involve the use of marker-assisted selection. The preferred character for such studiescurrently is the microsatellite (Hare & Avise 1997; Magoulas et al. 1998; Huvet et al. 2000). In each published instance to date, dinucleotide repeats were investigated, exhibitingextremely high heterozygosities and therefore reduced powerfor multilocus heterozygosity surveys. We surveyed a C. virginica library for the presence of tri- and tetranucleotide repeats. Genomic DNA was puried fromC. virginica somatic tissue with an STE (10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m m EDTA, 100 m m NaCl, 2% SDS, 0.5 mg/mL proteinase K) extraction ( Hillis et al. 1996), which included treating the rst aqueous phase following organic extractionwith RNase A (nal concen tration 0.03 mg/mL) for Detection of microsatellite sequences in a size-selected (400and 900 bp) partial (pBluescript II SK+) wasperformed as described by Rassmann et al. (1991). Transformant colonies were screened using a cocktail of two digoxygenin-labelled oligonucleotide probes [(ATG) 7 and (AAAC)5] and DNA inserts of 13 positive colonies were sequenced. Primerswere designed with target annealing temperatures of 50-55 \u00b0C and expected amplicon lengths between 80 and 220 bp. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed in reactionscontaining 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 mm unlabelled forward primer, 0.25 mm unlabelled reverse primer, 0.25 mm labelled reverse primer, 0.2 m m each dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Display Systems Biotech), 10 m m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 m m MgCl 2, 50 m m KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.0005% gelatin, and sufcient diH2O for a total volume of 15 mL. Amplication was conducted in PTC-100 thermal cyclers (MJ Research) using an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0 for 30 s, 50-55 \u00b0 for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0 for 15 s.

Mendelian inheritance of alleles was determined by examining the amplied pr oducts in two or more full sib families per locus (both parents and 15-20 offspring in each family). To determine allele range andpopulation-level variability, two wild groups of C. virginica were examined: one from Virginia Beach, Virginia (latitude36\u00b054\u00a2N, longitude 076 \u00b005\u00a2W; n = 40) and one derived from wild spat fall in Long Island Sound, Connecticut (latitude41\u00b006\u00a2N, longitude 73 \u00b025\u00a2W; n = 44). Primers also were tested with C. gigas (n = 5 each from two populations), C. angulata (n = 5), Saccostrea glomerata (formerly S. commercialis ; n = 5) and Tiostrea chilensis (n = 5). Statistical analyses were performed using genepop version 3.1 (Raymond & Rousset 1995). Of the 10 primer sets, all amplied from C. virginica products of the size expected from insert sequences. Three yielded homo-logous products Mendelian segregation. TheVirginia C. virginica population was surveyed for variation at all seven loci and the Connecticut population was surveyedfor Cvi-6, Cvi-8, and Cvi-11. Only three of the approximately to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Cvi-9, Cvi-11, and Cvi-12). For all loci, observed heterozygositywas lower than expected, suggesting the common occurrence ofsegregating null alleles. No evidence for linkage was observedamong these seven loci. Allelic distribution was signicantlydifferent between the two wild C. virginica populations (Fisher exact test P < 0.0001). When tested with C. gigas , C. angulata , and S. glomerata 10 primer sets (Cvi6, Cvi9, Cvi12, Cvi13) yielded various homologous products differingsubstantially the allele sizes observed forC. virginica No amplication was observed for T. chilensis .

School of Tropical Biology, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland 4811, Australia . The ant genus Rhytidoponera (subfamily Ponerinae) contains 104 described species (Bolton 1995) which are remarkablydiverse in their social organization and mating system(Crozier & Pamilo 1996). The greenhead ant Rhytidoponera metallica is among the most common ants in Australia, and it possesses an unusual social structure, as the reproductive roleis almost invariably taken by multiple mated workers in lieuof queens (Haskins & Whelden 1965). This secondary loss ofqueens and partitioning of reproduction between morpho-logically undifferentiated workers offers a good opportunityto study how altruism is maintained in societies with lowrelatedness (Hamilton 1972). Such studies require detailedgenetic data on the social organization and mating system.Recently, microsatellite markers have been described in threespecies of ponerine ants (Doums 1999; Giraud et al. 1999; Tay & Crozier 2000), but only two microsatellites from the mostrelated species proved useful in R. metallica . Therefore, we characterized eight new microsatellite markers for R. metallica , and tested for cross-species amplication in 10 other speciesof ponerine ants. A partial genomic library was constructed from 100 R. metallica workers, with gasters removed. DNA was extracted with a CTAB protocol (Hillis et al. 1990), digested to completion with Sau3A I and RsaI, size-selected for fragments between 300 and 900 bp (Crozier et al. 1999), and ligated into a pUC19 vector. The library was screened with an (AG) 10 oligonucle- otide probe end-labelled with 33P , and 62 positive recombinant clones were isolated. Thirty positive clones were sequenced,and primers were designed for 14 of them. These primers were assayed on a sample of workers collected from the You Yangs Regional Park in Victoria.

Amplication was carried out in 10 mL nal volume with 10 m m Tris-HCl, 50 m m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 m m MgCl2, 1.7 mm each dNTP, 0.03- 0.05 mm for- ward primer end-labelled with 33P , 0.4 mm reverse primer, 5 mg of BSA, 0.4 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 2 mL of template DNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prole consisted of a 3-min initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 92 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Eight primer pairs yielded suitable amplication products. All eight markers were highly polymorphic, with betweennine and 23 alleles detected in the study population (Table 1).Alleles were somewhat difcult to score for Rmet8 andRmet16, because of stutter bands. Additionally, the previouslyunpublished marker Rh12-13525, which was developed byW. Tek Tay for Rhytidoponera sp. 12, (Tay & Crozier 2000) had seven alleles in R. metallica (Table 1). The success of cross-species amplication in other genera was low (Table 2). Scorable amplication products wereobtained in only 12 out of the 45 tests (27% of the ve speciesassayed for nine markers). Polymorphism among three indi-viduals was detected at a single marker in four species, i.e. in9% of the 45 tests. In contrast, the success of cross-species amplication within the genus Rhytidoponera was very high (Table 2). Priming sites were well conserved among the Rhytidoponera species tested, resulting in strong amplication products in 40 outof the 45 tests (89%). Overall, scorable polymorphism amongthree individuals was detected in 23 out of the 45 tests(51%). In each species of Rhytidoponera , between three andeight markers were polymorphic, and this gure should increase when more individuals are analysed. Hence, thispanel of microsatellites will permit detailed studies of kinstructure, breeding system, gene flow and population struc-ture across species of Rhytidoponera with variable social struc- tures. Additionally, these markers might help to distinguishbetween the species yet to be described that are currentlylumped into the metallica species-complex.

Fax: + 64 3479 7584; E-mail: michael.roy@stonebow.otago.ac.nz The New Zealand Fiords are characterized by a seawardly flowing surface low salinity layer (LSL), produced by prodi-gious rainfall. Maintenance of salt balance occurs by a weakoceanic inflow below this LSL. Because the flow of sea wateris inwards, planktonic larvae of the ords are thought tobe retained within natal ords, which could have importantconsequences on gene flow. This hypothesis was supportedby allozyme analyses of Evechinus chloroticus , a sea urchin endemic to New Zealand (Mladenov et al. 1997). Despite high levels of gene flow found amongst all coastal populationsof New Zealand, a population sampled within one ordwas found to be genetically differentiated. Our intention is to address the effects of oceanographic and hydrographicfeatures of all 14 ords on recruitment and population struc-turing of E. chloroticus . In order to do this we are using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. Traditional colony hybridization methods used for micro- satellite cloning are time-consuming and relatively inefcient.Several enrichment techniques have previously been pub-lished (Gardner et al. 1999; Inoue et al. 1999). However, these either use radioactivity or include a number of lengthy steps.We report here on an alternative easy, fast, efcient and non-radioactive method of cloning microsatellite markers fromthe sea urchin E. chloroticus . Size selected fragments (250 - 800 bp) of NdeII-digest genomic DNA from ve individuals of E. chloroticus were pUC18 with Pure PCRproduct purication Kit (Roche). In order to hybridize DNA to probes, 100-500 ng of size selected amplied DNA (250 - 800 bp) was mixed, in separatetubes, with 2 pmol of GA 12 and GT12 5\u00a2-biotinylated repeat probes in 20 mL of extension solution containing: 0.2 m m of each dNTP, 2 m m MgCl2, 10 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 m m KCl, and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Roche). This mixture was subjected to one round of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)(5 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, 10 min at 72 \u00b0C) using a PTC-100 thermal (MJ Paramagnetic Particles (Promega)and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 120 mL of 6\u00b7 SSC/0.1% SDS, mixed continuously. After a series of washes in 150 mL of 6\u00b7 SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min: once at 60 \u00b0C, 65 \u00b0C, 70 \u00b0C, 75 \u00b0C and twice in 150 mL of 6\u00b7 SSC at 80 \u00b0C, DNA was eluted with 100 mL of 0.1 m NaOH at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized with 100 mL TE pH 7.5, puried and amplied as above. A further round of enrichment (hybridiza-tion, elution, PCR) was then undertaken. Size selected fragments (250-800 bp) of NdeII-digest from enriched inserts were ligated into pUC18 vector.

Screening of the same clones was attempted by using both M13 primers andthe complementary probe in the same PCR reaction (as inGardner et al. 1999). However, only 10% of clones for each probe were positive, indicating that this screening methodis unreliable.

Fax: (858) 534-7108; E-mail: leggert@biomail.ucsd.edu Poaching and rapid human population growth have put intense pressure on elephant populations, especially in theforests of west and central Africa. Conversion of rainforest toagriculture has resulted in the fragmentation and isolationof forest elephant populations in small reserves. Effectivemanagement of these populations will require informationabout census size, sex ratio, and the amount and distributionof genetic diversity. Although we can count savannah ele-phants from the ground or air, forest elephants are difcult tosee in the dense vegetation and censusing them requires usingindirect methods (Barnes & Jensen 1987). For our genetic characterization of African forest elephant populations, we developed a panel of microsatellite loci.Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples of fourunrelated African zoo elephants using the QIAamp Bloodand Tissue Kit (Qiagen), then pooled in equal concentrations.We digested 10 mg with MboI and ligated fragments of 200- 500 bp into M13mp18 (Rassmann et al. 1991). Transformation of competent DH5 aF\u00a2 Escherichia coli (GibcoBRL) was per- formed by electroporation. Cells were plated on YT mediaand plaques were replicated on nylon lters (MSI). Theprobes (CA) 15 and (GA)15 were labelled with [ g32P]-dATP and hybridized with the plaque lifts. We selected 40 (1.6%) col-onies that were strongly positive and isolated the DNA usingthe QiaPrep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). We kit (Amersham Life Science), anddetermined that 32 contained microsatellites, 12 of whichwere uninterrupted and had sufcient flanking regions forprimer design. Primer pairs were designed using primer 0.5 (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, USA). We tested our primers on 10 African savannah elephants from the Frozen Zoo\u00ae of the Zoological Society of San Diego.Three primer sets revealed monomorphic loci and three wereMEC1053.fm Page 2223 Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:58 AM2224 PRIMER NOTES \u00a9 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Ecology , 9, 2155-2234unusable. To test our primers on Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ), we used 12 samples from the Frozen Zoo\u00ae. Finally, our primers were screened on dung samples from 86 Africanforest elephants at Kakum National Park, Ghana. DNA fromthese samples was extracted using the protocol of Boomet al. (1990). To minimize the potential for allelic dropout or spurious alleles, genotypes were obtained from two differentextractions of each sample in a 'multiple tubes' approach(Taberlet et al. 1996). Amplications were performed in 10 mL volumes containing 20-50 ng of template DNA, 1 mL reaction buffer (Promega), 0.2 mm radioactively labelled forward primer, 0.2 mm reverse primer, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 1.5 m m MgCl 2 and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Using a Hybaid thermocycler, the proleconsisted of a denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35-40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C denaturation for 30 s, 1 min of primer annealing at the temperatures shown in Table 1, and1 min of primer extension at 72 \u00b0C. Alleles were separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography,and scored by comparison with an M13 length standard. All six loci were highly polymorphic in African elephants with between three and 11 alleles (Table 1). The smaller num-ber of alleles found in our Asian elephant samples is notsurprising, as it is generally assumed that microsatellite lociwill be more polymorphic in the species from which they arecloned than in related species (Ellegren et al. 1995). As the Frozen Zoo\u00ae samples do not represent natural populations,only expected and observed heterozygosity values for theKakum elephants are shown. Previous work has shown that African forest elephants are genetically divergent from the savannah subspecies (Barrielet al. 1999), which may explain why locus LA1 could not be amplied in the Kakum samples. The signicant deviationfrom the expected frequency of heterozygotes for locus LA5 may indicate the presence of one or more null alleles. How-ever, we have no family groups with which to test for these. Although African and Asian elephants diverged from a common ancestor approximately 5 mya (Maglio 1973), veof the six primer pairs amplify in Asian elephants. Whilesome of the loci have less alleles in Asian than in Africanelephants, we believe that these loci will be useful for popu-lation studies in both species.

S. Yap. , is a member of the family Sparidae that is found throughout southern Australia(Kailola et al. 1993). Information on the population genetic structure of this species is of value for two reasons. First,black bream is one of a relatively small number of teleoststhat typically spends its entire life-cycle within estuaries.Thus, studies of this species can be used to test hypothesesabout the role that estuaries play in promoting geneticdifferentiation in those teleosts that breed within thesesystems (e.g. Chaplin et al. 1998). Second, such information has important implications for the management of this spe-cies, which supports signicant commercial and recreationalsheries in three Australian states (Kailola et al. 1993) and is a target of a developing inland aquaculture industry insouth-western Australia. Microsatellite markers are particularly useful for elucidating the details of the population genetic structure of species thatshow low levels of polymorphism in other types of markers,such as allozymes and mitochondrial DNA (e.g. Shaw et al. 1999). The black bream is one such species (Chaplin et al. 1998; E. Yap et al. unpublished data). Here, we describe the isola- tion and characterization of microsatellite loci from blackbream and then assess the levels of polymorphism at ve loci. Genomic DNA was extracted from the muscle tissue of black bream using CTAB buffer and a phenol-chloroformextraction protocol. The DNA was digested to completion withSau3A and size fractionated in an agarose gel. Fragments of 200-600 bp were excised from the gel, puried and ligatedinto the BamHI site of the vector pGEM 3Zf(+) (Promega). The ligation products were transformed into ElectroMAX-DH10Bcells (Life Technologies), which were then plated onto agarcontaining ampicillin (100 mg/mL), IPTG and x-gal. The recombinant colonies ( n = 446) were picked into 96-well microtitre plates, grown at 37 \u00b0C, vacuum blotted . Plasmid DNA was isolated from 12 positive clones and then subjected todye-terminator cycle sequencing. The sequencing productswere electrophoresed and the sequences andinserts were determined using an ABI Sequencer (PerkinElmer). All inserts contained microsatellite loci. Primers, foruse in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were designed forsix of these loci on the basis that they contained 15 or morerepeat units and that the sequencing of their flanking regionswas sufcient to permit primers to be generated. Five of the primer pairs amplied scorable alleles at the microsatellite loci forPCR amplication of these loci were: (i) 15 mL reaction mixture containing 50-100 ng DNA template, 1.5 m m MgCl 2, 0.20 m m of each dNTPs, 20-40 n m of each primer, with 25% of the forward primer end-labelled with [ g33P]-ATP , 0.05 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 10 m m Tris-HCl with 50 m m KCl; and (ii) PCR proles with an initial 5 min denaturation at94 \u00b0C, followed by 26 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at annealing temperature (Table 1) and 90 s extension at72 \u00b0C, and a nal 7 min extension at 72 \u00b0C. Amplied alleles were resolved on a 6% andtheir sizes estimated using pUC18 DNA sequencing standards. The levels of polymorphism at the ve microsatellite loci were assessed using at least 40 black bream fromnine water bodies in Western Australia and 10 individualsfrom Gippsland Lake in south-eastern Australia. One locus(pAb4D5) was monomorphic in all samples, while anotherlocus (pAb2D11) was polymorphic only within the samplesfrom south-eastern Australia (Table 1). Only one (pAb2B7) ofthe remaining three loci, which were polymorphic in all 10populations, was represented by a total of more than sevenalleles and had an expected heterozygosity of greater than 0.56(Table 1). Thus, the black bream appears to contain relativelylow amounts of microsatellite polymorphism, especially inWestern Australia, and particularly in comparison with, forexample, two species of marine sparid (see Takagi et al. 1997; Batargias et al. 1999). Nevertheless, the four polymorphic loci have revealed greater amounts of variation in black breamthan allozyme genes (see Chaplin et al. 1998). In addition, the genotype frequencies at each of the pAb1H1, pAb2B7 andpAb2A5 loci, in each of samples of 38 or more black breamfrom nine water bodies in Western Australia, did not showany statistically signicant departures from those expectedunder Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium conditions. fourpolymorphic microsatellite loci should, therefore, useful foraddressing population-level questions about the black bream.

By 1959, anthropogenic disturbance had pushed this species to the vergeof extinction and only 26 individuals remained, conned tothe island of Cousin. The population has since recovered andhas been the focus of intense study since 1985 (e.g. Komdeur1992; Komdeur et al. 1997). We required a set of microsatellite markers to enable studies of mate choice, reproductive success and tness. Geneticvariability is relatively low within this species, possibly dueto the recent population bottleneck. Consequently, manymicrosatellites had to be isolated and screened to providesufcient polymorphic loci to enable parentage assignmentand 63 microsatelliteloci from the Seychelles warbler and tested for their poly-morphism in this and ve other species of Sylviidae . We also examined the utility of a subset of these loci in 16 otherpasserine birds. DNA was extracted following Bruford et al. (1998). A genomic library enriched for (CA) n, (GA)n and (TTTC)n was prepared as described by Armour et al. (1994) using modications sug- gested by Gibbs et al. (1997).

To optimize the PCR amplication of the loci found to be polymorphic, furtherPCRs consisted of one cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min then 35 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing temperature (Table 1) for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 45 s, followed by 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. For the cross-species amplications, a touchdown cycle was performed as above. PCR products were visualized on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. gels with silver autoradiography(after PCR with one the primers end-labelled with [ g 33P]- dATP; Sambrook et al. 1989). We developed primers for 63 microsatellites, of which 50 were polymorphic in at least one of the tested species ofSylviidae (Table 1). Thirty loci were polymorphic, displaying up to ve alleles, in a test panel of up to 25 unrelatedSeychelles warblers. There was no signicant difference at anylocus between the observed and expected heterozygosity,though these comparisons were of limited power. All 50 loci found to be polymorphic in the Sylviidae were tested for polymorphism in six unrelated individuals of thewinter wren, Troglodytes troglodytes (M. Berg, personal com- munication). Fifteen of the loci that were also found to bepolymorphic in the winter wren were selected and tested forutility in 16 other species, representing 15 passerine families(Table 2; following Sibley & Monroe 1990). The high proportion of loci found to be polymorphic in the other Sylviidae will reduce or eliminate the need to develop new primers for future studies of these species. The cross-species amplication suggests that, after further testing, manyof the primers presented here may also be useful for detectingpolymorphic loci in other passerine families (Table 2).

Its economic importance led to widespreadintroductions on four continents. The species has been usedextensively in laboratory studies, but studies of its populationbiology in the wild have been rare (Huner 1988). Previouspopulation work using allozymes found low levels of geneticvariation in two Procambarus species, including P . clarkii microsatellite libraries (f.

The 18 clearest markers were testedin representative taxa of the other two craysh families(Parastacidae and Astacidae), as one congeneric species; characterizationis reported here. Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen (- 80 \u00b0C) tail muscle of a red swamp craysh (Putah Creek, extraction ( Asahida et al. 1996) with the following modications.

Of the positive clones initially screened, 82% ( n = 11) (CA)n, and 58% ( n = 12) (TAGA)n contained microsatellites. We plated additional clones and amplied approximately 300 recombinant clonesby colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the follow-ing protocol. We added a toothpick stab of each colony to10 mL of 24 m m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 60 m m KCl, 0.075 m m each dNTP, 7.5 m m MgCl 2, and 0.6 m m pUC19 forward and reverse sequencing primers.
