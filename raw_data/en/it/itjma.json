Austin Public Health (APH) recommends adding a [COVID-19 test](https://www.austintexas.gov/covid-testinfo) to your to-do list to protect yourself and loved ones. \"While hospitalizations are at their lowest, we have seen surges after holidays before,\" said Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County Health Authority. \"We've enjoyed a breather and some sense of normalcy lately, but it doesn't mean we can let our guard down completely just yet.\" Snapshot of Travis County: - Daily counts for Travis County aggregated by CDC include some of the metrics used to calculate Community Levels once a week. The APH Epidemiology Unit is monitoring an increase in infections following the April holidays. - 73% of residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated. Only 46% of those who have completed their primary series have received an additional dose. - Children 5-11 have the lowest vaccination rate of any demographic at 35.5%. This is of concern ahead of Mother's Day weekend and the upcoming summer break. - Infections have been--and continue to be--underreported across the board. At-home rapid tests are widely available now, yet there isn't currently a reliable federal/state self-reporting standard. CDC shows a 10% positivity rate for Travis County. Out of the 210 people who tested at APH's Metz site last week, 36 (17%) were positive. Both rates are above the [national](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) [average](http://average/)of 6%. Testing, and isolating if necessary, is just one way to stop the spread of COVID-19. Getting up to date with your vaccines and wearing a well-fitting mask both offer additional levels of protection against severe illness and hospitalizations. \"Young people with healthy immune systems may be spending the weekend with older family members who are at risk,\" said APH Director Adrienne Sturrup, \"We've waited a long time to get to this point, so we hope you'll set aside just a few minutes this week to take a COVID-19 test before getting together for Mother's Day.\" Mothers-to-be are no exception. [Studies show](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm) vaccination among pregnant people is associated with about 60% reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in infants. People who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future should get vaccinated against COVID-19.
