The world of natural skincare can be confusing as hell. Tons of brands label their products \"non-toxic,\" \"green,\" and/or \"clean,\" but in reality, those terms don't mean anything because they're not regulated by the FDA. Yup, shock and awe. That's not to say everything you see on your favorite product label is a lie\u2014it just means that as a consumer, you need to do your own research when it comes to buying natural and organic skincare. But because beauty should be fun, not a thesis-level research project, I did the work for you and rounded up the 25 best natural skincare products below. They're all from trusted brands that work closely with third-party certification agencies (like the USDA, COSMOS, and ECOCERT) to ensure that everything from their packaging to their ingredients are safe for your skin and the planet. Your face (and conscience) are about to feel really, really good. Founded by esthetician and product formulator Lesley Thornton, Klur is known for skincare that's made with clean and sustainably sourced ingredients, like this hydrating face serum. It's full of hyaluronic acid (a humectant that draws moisture from the air to your skin), aloe vera juice, and niacinamide to deeply hydrate and moisturize your skin. This fragrance-free cleansing balmmelts away foundation, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, and more with all-natural sunflower oil and papaya enzymes. The result? Skin that's nice and clean but doesn't feel tight or dried out. Beautycounter is known for their clean, non-toxic formulas that are filled with all-natural and organic ingredients. Even cooler: Gregg Renfrew, the brand founder, and her team have been pushing for stricter, safer regulations in the cosmetics space. One of my favorite products from the line is this nourishing eye cream. I swear it makes me look like I got eight hours of sleep, thanks to moisturizing shea butter and squalane, and it wears really nicely under my concealer. Sometimes I can't be bothered to do a bunch of skincare steps before bed, and that's when I reach for this overnight sleeping mask. It's packed with bakuchiol (a plant-derived ingredient that works similarly to retinol), hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants to visibly hydrate, firm, and smooth your skin. 5 Best Natural Liquid Exfoliator Youth To The People Mandelic Acid + Superfood Unity Exfoliant 5 Best Natural Liquid Exfoliator Youth To The People Mandelic Acid + Superfood Unity Exfoliant Liquid exfoliators (or exfoliating toners) are like the buzziest skincare products right now, and this version from Youth to the People is one of my faves. It uses a combo of AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs to gently exfoliate, unclog pores, smooth rough skin texture, and leave you looking super glowy. 6 Best Natural Acne Spot Treatment Ren Clean Skincare Clear Calm Non-Drying Acne Treatment Gel 6 Best Natural Acne Spot Treatment Ren Clean Skincare Clear Calm Non-Drying Acne Treatment Gel This isn't one of those harsh acne spot treatments that will make your skin all crusty and flaky. The gentle formula uses a naturally-derived salicylic acid to help shrink zits and minimize inflammation without drying out your skin in the process. This natural wrinkle cream from Caudalie is just as effective as conventional creams\u2014trust. It contains vegan collagen to smooth and plump, two kinds of hyaluronic acid to hydrate, and firming resveratrol to reduce the appearance of fine lines. I'm a firm believer that everyone should be using a lip balm with natural and/or organic ingredients. I mean, you put that ish on your mouth multiple times a day, so it's bound to get into your body somehow, right? Luckily, this natural lip balm from Weleda is only $7, so there's really no excuse for not using it instead of a conventional one. The formula will leave your lips feeling like butter, thanks to organic coconut oil and jojoba oil. 9 Best Natural Sunscreen EleVen by Venus Williams Unrivaled Sun Serum SPF 35 9 Best Natural Sunscreen EleVen by Venus Williams Unrivaled Sun Serum SPF 35 Finally, a natural sunscreen that doesn't feel thick, heavy, or chalky on skin. This mineral formula has a lightweight serum-like texture that sinks into skin fast and leaves behind zero greasy residue. Even better? All the ingredients in the formula are from natural origin. Maskne is still very much a thing, and this purifying face mist can help combat it when sprayed on your skin before putting on your mask. It's got a blend of pore-clarifying lemon and aloe extracts that help absorb excess oil, calm inflammation, and balance your skin. This natural body butter is made with just super-nourishing ingredient\u2014organic shea butter. Just warm a little between your fingers and massage it into to your arms and legs. You'll be amazed by how soft and smooth your skin feels. This is the perfect everyday face wash IMO. The soothing gel formula is super gentle (aka it won't irritate or dry out your skin) and lightly foams up to remove makeup, dirt, oil, and buildup in seconds. No joke: This natural vitamin C serum from organic skincare brand Ursa Major is just as potent as the ones you would get in a derm's office. The magic? A stable form of ascorbic acid (a type of vitamin C), organic rosehip seed extract, and edelweiss flower extract\u2014all of which work together to reduce free radical damage and brighten hyperpigmentation, like dark spots and melasma. Indie Lee's all-natural toner has been a bestseller for years, and for good reason: It's made exclusively with clean, plant-based ingredients and it makes skin freaking glow. Apply it to damp skin post-cleanse and let the aloe vera, cucumber, sage, and papaya extracts work their soothing and hydrating magic. If you're into coconut oil, then Kopari is definitely the organic skincare brand you need in your life. Everything in the line is made with pure, organic, 100 percent coconut oil that's sustainably sourced from the Philippines. The product to try first? This natural body lotion\u2014it's infused with coconut to soften and hydrate skin but never feels greasy or sticky. All-natural and organic sheet masks that *actually* work are hard to come by, so when I discovered Orgaid, I was stoked to say the least. The brand makes eco-friendly sheet masks that are soaked in potent organic ingredients, like plant and fruit extracts and probiotics, to do everything from boost your glow to soothe inflammation. This all-natural face oil from skincare brand True Botanicals is made with chia seed, kiwi seed, and passion fruit oils to moisturize skin and smooth fine lines and dry patches. In fact, in clinical trials conducted by the brand (so not exactly unbiased, but still interesting), this little oil out-performed the iconic $490 Creme de La Mer moisturizer when it came to hydration and the reduction of wrinkles and creases. If the thought of using bar soap on your face seems crazy/gross/cave man-ish, then you haven't tried this one from organic skincare brand Osmia. I started using it a few years ago when I was dealing with hormonal acne, and it has been a staple of my skincare routine ever since. It's made with clarifying black clay and dead sea mud\u2014plus organic almond and avocado oils to help moisturize and soothe your skin, while soaking up excess oils. And unlike with traditional bar soaps, it's zero percent drying or irritating. Juice Beauty is one of the OG organic beauty brands in the U.S. and one of my holy-grail products in the line is this oil-free moisturizer. It uses certified-organic grape, pomegranate and aloe vera to hydrate and soothe skin without feeling heavy or clogging your pores.
