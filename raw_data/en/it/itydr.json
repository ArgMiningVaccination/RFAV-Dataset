Koreans are particularly interested in living a healthy lifestyle. Koreans' unique awareness and healthcare practices are closely associated with their sustainable tradition and culture. One of the great desires of Koreans is to live a long and healthy life. In line with this, Koreans have been protecting their health with food and exercise for their health. In the past, Koreans have maintained their health and prevented diseases through consuming folk remedies and herbal medicines, and in recent years, through consuming functional foods such as well-being, superfoods, and organic foods. These efforts have been not only promoted individually, but also by their affiliated organizations, such as the country, schools, and companies. In particular, Koreans are protecting their health with food to the extent that there are idioms such as \"Koreans run on rice\" and \"rice supplements energy\" in Korean. Looking at the video, one study found that Korean cuisine was effective in preventing obesity and lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Healthcare Awareness Korea has always been interested in health. No matter where in the world we go, there seems to be no country that emphasizes health as much as South Korea. \"Mubyeong Jangsu\", which means \"Be healthy without any special disease,\" and \"Mansu Mugang,\" which means \"live long and healthy,\" are essential greetings for adults. According to OECD statistics, South Korea ranked first in the number of hospital treatments. Of course, there is a good insurance system, but I think that Koreans often visit hospitals as they consider their health very important. In addition, many Koreans consider food as a medicine, they try to only eat healthy foods, and change their lifestyles for a healthy body. I could be healthier! The life expectancy of South Koreans has been rapidly increasing due to economic development - the average Korean life expectancy is 2 years higher than the average life expectancy of other OECD member countries. However, according to the above article, Koreans rate their own health to be at the lowest level among the OECD member countries. These results suggest that Koreans perceive their health to be more negative than it actually is Good Meal is the Best Medicine For Koreans, rice is one of the most important foods in our daily lives. In Korean, there is a saying that rice is a medicine. Rejuvenation controls the overall function of the body, and increases resistance. It is a helping medicine. Koreans think that food as well as medicine will produce the same efficacy as medicine, so they find and eat healthy foods to improve their health. Health Is Better Than Money According to the consumption trend announced by the Korean Standards Association, Korean interest in health is 36.6%, which is higher than that of wealth management and other fields. In addition, in a survey it was revealed that Koreans exercised, ate health supplements, and regulated their diet for better health. History of Healthcare Everyone wants to live long and healthy lives. However, Koreans in particular have been sensitive about the preservation of their health since ancient times. Theories and knowledge to protect health have been handed down from ancient ancestors and are still in use today. In the past, in Korea, the knowledge entrusted to medical experts was regarded as a general education that intellectuals should have. Therefore, Koreans took control of their own disease-free longevity through eating, drinking, various medical knowledge, and exercise. Korean Folk Remedies The history of oriental medicine in Korea began with folk remedies. As such, Korean folk remedies are closely related to oriental medicine. Folk remedies are medical remedies that have been handed down from the private sector rather than regular medicine, but many people still use folk remedies because they are inexpensive, easy to use, and readily available in many peoples' vicinity. Postpartum & Seaweed Soup In Korea, there is a custom of eating seaweed soup on birthdays. The reason is that the mother eats seaweed soup after the baby is delivered, so it has the meaning of giving thanks by eating the same food that the mother ate during the postpartum period. Mothers eat seaweed soup in the distant history of the Goryeo Dynasty, because seaweed is rich in iron, calcium and iodine, which is very beneficial to mothers. At that time, there would not have been any equipment capable of analyzing ingredients, but the wisdom of the ancestors who made it custom based on experience can be seen. Energy-Boosting Food In Korea, there are three hottest days between July and August every year. Since the Joseon Dynasty, the custom to overcome this sambok heat has been passed on, and it is to eat healthy food on these three days. Eating also refers to preventing or treating diseases through food. The ancestors overcame the heat by supplementing their stamina by eating rejuvenating meals for the energy lost in the hot heat. Proactive Healthcare Practice Koreans have made strides towards being healthy not only in the past but also currently in various ways. For the sake of their health, they are constantly working on eating healthy foods, getting into the habit of exercising, and improving their eating patterns. Koreans in modern society naturally improve their health in their daily lives, and you can see how much Koreans strive for their health in the areas of outdoor exercise equipment, Korean food service, and health-functional food markets. Free Outdoor Gym In Korea, you can easily see a variety of interesting sporting equipment located in parks. This sporting equipment in the park are designed to promote the health of the people by recognizing exercising as a part of their daily life rather than visiting the gym to have to exercise. This sports equipment can be used by all citizens for free without time limit, therefore anyone can use it without feeling burdened. School Lunch One of Korea's greatest prides is their school lunches. Schools in many countries provide meals, but in Korea, unlike other school meal facilities, a licensed nutritionist must be employed for the health of all students. Nutritionists provide daily nutritional needs for growing adolescents and healthy meals tailored to students' preferences. A Myriads of Healthy Food \"Health-functional\" food refers to a product manufactured using ingredients or ingredients that have useful functions for the human body. Although it is not a medicine to cure diseases, it can be marketed as a health-functional food that must be recognized for its functionality as a food consumed by humans, and must be examined for safety. As Korean interest in health increases, the health functional food markets in Korea are growing day by day. In particular, Koreans are known to purchase health functional foods to improve immunity and recover from fatigue. Dual Effects Koreans are very aware of the importance of their health. It is normal to worry about yourself. Everyone shares the fear of becoming sick. There are positive functions that arise from thinking that health care is important, but there are also negative dysfunctions. Regular health check-up The purpose of a regular health check-up is to detect and treat diseases early. Most Koreans undergo periodic health checkups when they reach their 30s. Even severe diseases such as cancer, which are very dangerous if detected late, can be prevented from becoming a major disease if the disease is treated early while receiving regular medical checkups. I believe that regular health check-ups that prevent major diseases are the pure function of health awareness. Health irritation While Koreans have a pure function that comes from being very interested in their health, there are also dysfunctions. Among them, the biggest dysfunction is 'health anxiety'. Koreans believe that they are not as healthy as they actually are, so even if they are a little sick, they go to the hospital for treatment. The reason why frequent visits to hospitals is a problem is that the number of doctors and nurses in Korea is 2.3 and 6.7 per 1000 population, which is less than the OECD average. However, the number of outpatients per person per year is 17 per 1,000 people, more than twice the OECD average. From these statistics, it is highly likely that patients who really need treatment will not be able to enjoy quality medical care. Illegal health supplement sales In Korea, there is a drugstore called ''. These are scammers who gather people and sell health supplements, medical devices, and household items at ridiculously expensive prices. In particular, adults who are elderly and physically uncomfortable, who pay particular attention to their health, mainly fall victim to this. Medicine dealers use this psychology to unconditionally to cheat. There is an old saying that humans are of no use if they gain the whole world but lose their lives. As such, human life and health are precious things that cannot be exchanged for anything else. However, people who have never harmed their health may not be aware of the importance of their health. In many cases, the importance of health is often realized only after neglecting health management and getting sick. To preserve your health, you should exercise regularly and develop healthy eating habits. I think health is important not only for individuals and families but also for the future of the nation. "}
