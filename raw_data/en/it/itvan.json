Here, weanalyze the impact of helminth infections on the ef-cacy of vaccinations using Litomosoides sigmodon- tis-infected mice. Concurrent helminth infection reduces the quantity and quality of antibody re-sponses to vaccination against seasonal influenza.Vaccination-induced protection against challenge in- fections with the human pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is drastically impaired in hel-minth-infected mice. Impaired responses are alsoobserved if vaccinations are performed after clear-ance of a previous helminth infection, suggestingthat individuals in helminth-endemic areas may notalways benet from vaccinations, diagnosable helminth infec- tion. Mechanistically, the suppression is associated with systemic and sustained expansion of inter-leukin (IL)-10-producing CD4 +CD49+LAG-3+type 1 regulatory T cells and partially abrogated by in vivo blockade of the IL-10 receptor. INTRODUCTION Helminths are large multicellular parasites that infect 2 billion people worldwide ( Hotez et al., 2008 ). Despite the fact that hel- minth parasites can neither hide from their host's immune attack nor multiply within their denitive hosts, many helminths survivefor decades causing chronic infections. To avoid their eliminationand to limit immune pathology and thus restrict damaging their hosts, helminths have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress their host's immune response ( McSorley and Maizels, 2012 ). To this end, helminths exploit the intrinsic regulatory path- ways that usually maintain homeostasis of the mammalian immune system ( Maizels and McSorley, 2016 ). Because this im-mune suppression is not restricted to helminth-specic immune responses, a concurrent helminth infection may also interfere with the immune response to unrelated antigens such as vac- cines. Accordingly, many human studies show a negative corre-lation between a diagnosed helminth infection and the cellular or humoral response to vaccinations (for review, see Borkow and Bentwich, 2008; Elias et al., 2006; Urban et al., 2007 ). On the other hand, several published studies reported diverse resultsor failed to record a signicant correlation between helminth infection status and vaccination response. For instance, no cor- relation between pre-existing Schistosoma mansoni or any intes- tinal helminth infection and the antibody (Ab) response to a vaccination against human papillomavirus was observed ( Brown et al., 2014 ). The Ab response to a malaria vaccine candidate was reduced in children with concurrent Trichuris trichuria infec- tion, whereas Ascaris lumbricoides infection did not ( Esen et al., 2012 ). Drug-induced de- worming, that the Ab response to cholera vaccinationin one study ( Cooper et al., 2000 ), did not elevate responses to cholera, meningococcal, or influenza vaccination in other studies (Br\u20acuckner et al., 2015, 2016 ). To investigate these issues in a controlled setting, we use infection of mice with Litomosoides sigmodontis as a model for human helminth infections ( Allen et al., 2008; Hoffmann et al., 2000 ).L. sigmodontis is a larial parasite that is transmitted as infective third stage larvae (L3) during the blood meal of mites, the intermediate host, to the denitive host, the cotton rat. Lab-oratory mice can be naturally infected by exposure to L3 trans- mitting mites. L3 migrate within 4 days via the lymphatic system to the thoracic cavity (TC) and molt via a L4 to adult worms.Semi-susceptible C57BL/6 mice start to kill the parasites bygranuloma formation after 45 days, whereas fully susceptible BALB/c mice stay infected for more than 90 days ( Graham et al., 2005 ). Using the thymus-dependent (TD) antigen Dinitrophenol coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) as a model ''vaccine,'' we have shown before that L. sigmodontis infection suppressed the IgG response to DNP-KLH al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2011 ). We hypothesized that this helminth Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019 \u00aa2019 The Authors. 2243 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).infection-mediated suppression of Ab responses to model antigens would also apply for the protective Ab responses to vaccinations against actual pathogens such as influenza virus. Seasonal Influenza is predominantly elicited by circulating influ-enza virus A, and according to the World Health Organization (2019) , causes up to half a million casualties each year. Disease can be prevented by a vaccination that elicits a neutralizing IgGresponse to the variable epitopes of the influenza hemagglutinin(HA) head ( Dormitzer et al., 2011 ). Here, we compare the efcacy of vaccinations against sea- sonal influenza that were licensed for humans during the sea-sons 2014/15 to 2016/17 in helminth-infected and non-infected mice. We show that helminth infections reduced the quantity and neutralizing quality of Ab responses to the vaccination andimpaired the protection against a challenge infection with the hu- man pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus (2009 pH1N1) ( Garten et al., 2009 ). Suppression of vaccination efcacy in helminth-infected mice was accompanied by a sustained andsystemic expansion of type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) and depen- dent on interleukin (IL)-10. Importantly, even mice with a history of helminth infections displayed systemic Tr1 expansion andimpaired responses to vaccinations performed after clearance of their acute helminth infection. Thus, our combined results strongly suggest that the population living in helminth endemicareas may not benet from vaccinations even if individuals with previously treated and cleared helminth infections appear nega- tive in helminth diagnosis at the moment of vaccination. RESULTSAcute Helminth Infection Suppresses Antibody Response to Vaccination against Influenza and ImpairsProtection against Homologous Virus Challenge Analyzing helminth-induced immune modulation, we have shown before that a concurrent infection with the helminth parasiteL. sigmodontis suppressed the Ab response to immunization against the TD model antigen DNP-KLH in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice ( Haben et al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2011 ). To test the clinical relevance of these ndings, we compared the efcacy of vaccina-tion against influenza in naive and helminth-infected mice ( Fig- ure 1 ). We used Begripal, a non-adjuvanted trivalent split subunit vaccine that is composed of HA derived from three different influ-enza strains including 2009 pH1N1 as vaccine against seasonal influenza. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice elicited a HA-specic IgG response that was morethan 5-fold suppressed by concurrentL. sigmodontis infection. Helminth infection reduced the quantity of both isotypes in response to vaccination, B). Accordingly, virus neutralizing capacity of the elicited Ab response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), was 10-fold reduced in the sera derived from helminth-in-fected, vaccinated mice compared to non-infected, vaccinatedmice ( Figure 1 C). The human pathogenic Influenza A H1N1 A/ HH/NY/1580/09 strain that replicates in mice Maines et al., 2009; Otte and Gabriel, 2011; Otte et al., 2011 ) was used to perform homologous challenge infections. Intranasal infection with a sub-lethal virus dose induced transient weight loss in non-vaccinated mice, while vaccinated mice were completelyprotected ( Figure 1 D). Mice that were helminth-infected at the moment of vaccination displayed a statistically signicant increased weight loss compared to the protected control group. Analysis of the influenza A viral burdenrevealed similar results ( Fig- ure 1 E). Non-vaccinated mice displayed high viral burden in the lungs 3 days after an influenza challenge infection, regardless of the helminth infection status. Vaccination conferred sterile protec-tion in 11 out of 15 control mice (73%) whereas only 4 out of 13helminth-infected and vaccinated mice (31%) displayed sterile protection. Interestingly, within the non-vaccinated groups, hel- minth-infected mice displayed slightly reduced weight losscompared to non-infected mice although viral burden in the lungs were alike ( Figures 1 D and 1E, open circles to open squares). Finally we conrmed that the vaccination against influenza assuch did not affect helminth parasite burden, as expected (Figure S1 ). Immune competent, semi-susceptible C57BL/6 mice eradi- cate L. sigmodontis parasites between days 45 and 60 post infection (p.i.) ( Graham et al., 2005 ). In our experimental setting, the influenza challenge infection is timed at day 45 of L. sigmodontis infection ( Figure 1 A) and thus may coincide with active helminth infection. Although this setting may well reflect the situation in the human population in helminth-endemic areas, we aimed to specically analyze the protective capacity of thevaccination against influenza in control and helminth-infected mice without overlapping effects induced by an ongoing hel- minth/influenza co-infection. In a rst approach, we transferredthe sera of vaccinated control mice and vaccinated helminth-in- fected mice into ''helminth-free'' recipient mice that were in- fected with influenza subsequently ( Figure S2 A). We conrmed that HA-specic IgG titers were lower (5- to 10-fold) in seraderived from vaccinated L. sigmodontis -infected compared to sera derived from the vaccinated control group as expected ( Fig- ure S2 B). Although this passive immunization did not protect as efciently as the active vaccination against influenza that we per- formed as internal control, the mice that received serum derived from vaccinated control mice lost signicantly less weight thanmice that received either no serum or serum derived from hel- minth-infected, vaccinated mice ( Figure S2 C). In a second approach, we allowed the helminth-infected, vaccinated mice to naturally clear the L. sigmodontis -infection before performing the influenza A virus challenge infection ( Fig- ure 2 ). To this end, non-infected and day 28 helminth-infected mice were vaccinated with Begripal. The reduced Ab responseto vaccination in the helminth-infected group was conrmed at day 14 post vaccination regarding quantity of HA-specic IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c ( Figure 2 B), and HI titer ( Figure 2 c), thus re- producing the results shown in Figure 1 . Instead of an immediate influenza challenge infection, the mice were kept for additional 100 days. This allows eradication of L. sigmodontis in the formerly helminth-infected mice and simulates the elapsed time between seasonal influenza vaccination and ''challenge'' exposure in the human population. Analysis of sera from day114 post vaccination against influenza showed that HA-specicAb were still present at these late time points. Thereby, the quan- tity of HA-specic IgG1 and IgG2b/c ( Figure 2 the neutral- izing quality indicated by HI titer ( Figure 2 E) were reduced 2- to 5-fold in helminth-infected mice compared to non-infected 2244 Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019mice. Vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss induced by a subsequent influenza A virus challenge infection ( Figure 2 F), whereas mice that had been helminth-infected at the moment ofvaccination lost statistically signicant more weight than the vaccinated control group.We used C57BL/6 mice for this study because they are more susceptible to 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus infection than BALB/c mice that do not display a drastic weight loss upon influ-enza challenge infection ( Otte and Gabriel, 2011 ). Nevertheless, we performed a proof of principle experiment to extend our Figure 1.

BALB/c mice, vaccinated at day 150 p.i., displayed the same reduction of HA-specic IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a response that was observed in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 3 B). Challenge infection of BALB/c mice with a 10-fold higher 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus dose compared to the one used for C57BL/6 mice resulted in replicating influenza virus in the lungs of non-vaccinated BALB/c mice ( Figure 3 C). Vaccination of the non-helminth-infected control group reduced viral burden, while vaccinated helminth-infected and non-vaccinated BALB/c mice displayed comparably high viral burden.

The impairedprotection against influenza challengeinfection was predominantly mediated by the reduced neutralizing Ab response to vaccination and not dependent on thepresence of viable helminths during influ- enza challenge infection. Sustained Suppression of Vaccination Response in Previously Helminth-Infected MiceTo analyze the kinetics of this helminth- induced suppression, we performed a pilot study comparing the response to vaccination at different time points post L. sigmodontis infec- tion ( Figure 4 ). Vaccination against day-30 in- fected C57BL/6 mice, containing viable helminths in the TC, resulted in suppressed HI response, re-iterating the resultsshown in Figures 1 Ca n d 2C. The same suppression of HI response to the vaccination against influenza was observed at day 60 post L. sigmodontis- infection (i.e., in mice that contained mostly killed and coated parasites) and at day 90 and 100 post initial L. sigmodontis- infection (i.e., in mice that had terminated their infection by granuloma formationand did not contain viable parasites at the moment of vaccina-tion). The sustained suppression of vaccination response at day 100 post L. sigmodontis- infection was subsequently conrmed in two independent experimental repeats ( Fig- ure 4 B, day 100). Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019 2247We have shown before that concurrent helminth infection impaired the proliferation of adoptively transferred T cells ( Hart- mann et al., 2015 ). Extending the kinetic analysis of helminth- induced suppression to T cell responses, we transferred T cellreceptor transgenic OT-II T cells into day 14 and day 90L. sigmodontis- infected C57BL/6 mice and recorded their anti- gen-specic vivo (Figure S3 ). OT-II T cell prolifer- ation was reduced in mice carrying viable helminths (day 14 p.i.)and in mice that had terminated their infection containing only remnants of killed helminths (day 90 p.i.) to the same extent (Figure S3 C). Taken together, these results show that helminth infection- induced suppression of B and T cell responses to unrelated bystander antigens was maintained in the absence of viableparasites. However, we cannot exclude that the presence of re-sidual helminth-derived material contributed to immunosuppres- sion at late time points such as day 90 or day 100 after initial infection. Prolonged Suppression of Vaccination Efcacy in Helminth-Infected Mice Is Associated with Sustainedand Systemic Expansion of Tr1 Cells We next aimed to identify the cellular mechanism(s) respon- sible for the prolonged suppression of vaccination responses.As our previous research supported an involvement of CD4 +T cells in mediating immunosuppression et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2015 ), we focused on regulatory T cell subsets. To this end, we compared the thoracic CD4+T cell compartment in non-in- fected ( Figure 5 A) and day 30 L. sigmodontis- infected C57BL/6 mice ( Figure 5 B) with regard to described regulatory T cell co-receptors using t-distributed statistic neighborembedding (t-SNE). This analysis visualizes complex data in a 2D plot, thus allowing the identication of cell clusters with a similar expression pattern. We observed a Foxp3 /C0CD4+ T cell population that helminth-infected mice. Thereby PD-1and were expressed a whileall cells co-expressed PD-1 and CD49b mice. Expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) was present inFoxp3 +Treg cells from naive mice and increased in Foxp3+ Treg cells from helminth-infected mice. Interestingly, a secondand distinct CTLA-4-expressing T cell population occurredwithin the CD4 +Foxp3/C0LAG3+CD49b+T cells selectively in helminth-infected mice. Neither B and T lymphocyte attenu- ator (BTLA) nor T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM Figure 4.

Treg numbers and frequencies re- turned to baseline at day 90 postL. sigmodontis infection ( Figures 6 Ba n d 6C). By contrast, we recorded a sus- tained expansion of Tr1 cell numbers and frequencies, locally in the TC ( Fig- ures 6 F and 6G) and systemically in the spleen ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Thereby, numbers and frequencies of Tr1 cellswere still elevated at day 90 post initial L. sigmodontis infection, a time point when no viable worm was present andvaccination responses were still sup- pressed ( Figure 4 ). This expansion of Tr1 cells in the spleens ofL. sigmodontis -infected mice was not associated with changes in spleen cell numbers ( Figure S5 A ) .B yc o n t r a s t ,c e l l numbers in the TC increased more than10-fold throughout infection ( Figure S5 B). Using IL-10/Foxp3 reporter mice, we veried that the CD4 +Foxp3/C0LAG3+ CD49b+Tr1 cells that expanded during L. sigmodontis infection at days 30 and 90 p.i. produce IL-10 ( Figure S6 ).

We recorded a very low fre- quency of IL-10 expressing CD19+B cells that was unchanged in spleens and TC of non-infected and L. sigmodontis -infected Figures S6 E and S6G). Numbers of IL-10+CD19+B cells expanded in the TC of day 30 L.sigmodontis -infected mice, 2250 Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019but we did not record a systemic expansion of IL-10+CD19+ B cell numbers in the spleen using either IL-10 reporter mice ( I). Suppression of Vaccination Efcacy in Helminth- Infected Mice Is Mediated by IL-10 To provide a causal link between the systemic and prolonged Tr1 expansion in helminth-infected mice and the impaired responseto vaccination, we neutralized the dominant Tr1 cell cytokine IL-10 ( Brockmann et al., 2017; Roncarolo et al., yin vivo blockade of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) ( Figure IgG2b, and IgG2c response in helminth-infected mice to the level of the non-helminth-infected control group ( Figures 7 B-7D). The neutralization of IL-10-mediated signaling elevated also the HI titer of helminth-infected and vaccinated mice. However, the HI titers were still more than 2-fold reduced compared to non-in- Figure 7.

To analyze the efcacy of vaccination, we per- formed 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus chal-lenge infections with all groups includingnon-vaccinated control mice. Influenza infection-induced weight loss was amelio- rated in vaccinated, helminth-infected mice under IL-10Rblockade compared to vaccinated, helminth-infected mice with undisturbed IL-10R signaling ( Figure 7 F). However, vaccinated, helminth-infected mice still lost statistically signicant moreweight than vaccinated, non-helminth-infected control mice. By contrast, the neutralization of IL-10R abrogated the statistically signicant differences in viral burden ( Figure 7 G) and IL-6 produc- tion ( Figure 7 H) in the lungs of helminth-infected mice compared to non-infected control mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lungs supported these ndings ( Figure 7 I). Non-vaccinated groups infected with influenza A virus displayed similar viral anti-gen positive cells in bronchial and alveolar epithelium irrespective of prior helminth infection. In contrast, vaccinated and helminth- infected mice showed more viral antigen positive pulmonary cellscompared to the group that was vaccinated in the absence of helminth infection. These differences in viral burden between vaccinated non-infected and helminth-infected groups werelargely abolished upon IL-10R blockade. Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019 2251To additionally control for a contribution of the IL-10-produc- ing Tregs that expanded during L. sigmodontis infection ( Figures S6F and S6H), we used the depletion of regulatory T cell (DEREG) mouse model ( Lahl et al., 2007 ). Injection of DT into DE- REG mice induces a transient depletion of Foxp3+Treg cells for 1-2 weeks, whereas DT-treated ). Transient depletion of Tregs, either at the moment of L. sigmodontis infection or at the moment of vaccination, did not restore the response to vaccination against influenza. The vaccination-induced HI was more than 5-fold reduced in L. sigmodontis -infected mice compared to non-infected mice in the absence or presence of Foxp3+Tregs. In summary, these ndings show that helminth-induced sup- pression of vaccination efcacy was partly dependent on IL-10R-mediated signaling but independent of Tregs and thus supports the notion that the expanding IL-10 producing Tr1 cellscontributed to this suppression. DISCUSSIONHuman studies analyzing the impact of helminth infection on the immune response to vaccinations often lead to inconsistent re- sults that most likely reflect the genetic heterogeneity of the study population, the difculty in exact diagnosis of the helminthinfection status, the presence of putatively undetected co-infec-tions, and the undeterminable infection history of the study sub- jects. In the present study, we use mouse models allowing us to control each of these parameters to test if a concurrent helminthinfection would compromise vaccination efcacy. We report that a concurrent helminth infection caused a drastic reduction in the quantity and the neutralizing quality ofthe Ab response to vaccination against seasonal influenza. Notably, the Ab response to the vaccination was not polarized toward a Th2 phenotype but genuinely suppressed as both,Th1-associated IgG2 and the Th2-associated IgG1 response were reduced in helminth-infected mice. Furthermore, suppres- sion was observed in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice despite thedifferent duration and outcome of the L. sigmodontis infection in both mouse strains. These ndings agree with our previous studies analyzing the Ab response to TD model antigen immuni- zations in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice ( 2014; Hart- mann et al., 2011 ). Likewise, chronic infections with the liver fluke S. mansoni or the intestinal helminth parasite H. polygyrus led to reduced IgG1 and to either or et al., 2010; Su et al., 2006 ) vaccination. A multiple co-infection with a combination of murine viruses (MHV68, MCMV, andmouse Influenza WSN) and H. polygyrus reduced the quantity of Ab response ( Reese et al., 2016 ). Using trivalent non-adjuvanted split subunit vaccines against influenza that were licensed for humans during the seasons2014-2017, we demonstrate the clinical relevance of this bystander suppression during challenge infections with a patient isolate of the 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus ( Garten et al., 2009 ). Mice that were vaccinated while carrying an acute L. sigmodontis infection displayed increased weight loss and increased viral burden in the lung compared to mice vaccinatedin the absence of helminth infection. We differentiate the impact of impaired Ab response to vaccination from the impact of the helminth/influenza co-infection by (1) performing passive immu- nizations and by (2) delaying the moment of influenza challengeinfection of helminth-infected and vaccinated mice to a point in time after termination of the helminth infection. Thereby, we pro- vide evidence that the helminth infection-induced reduction ofthe Ab response to the vaccination against influenza led to amore pronounced pathology during influenza A virus challenge infection. This holds true for both settings, the simultaneous presence of helminths and influenza virus, and the absence ofan active helminth co-infection. We do not exclude, however, that a concurrent helminth infection would modulate the viral burden and/or pathology during an influenza challenge infection.Depending on the context, helminth co-infections were shown to increase the pathology of subsequent virus infections by sup- pressing the protective immune response ( Dietze et al., 2016; Osborne et al., 2014; Reese et al., 2014 ), or to ameliorate pathol- ogy either by improving innate anti-viral immune responses (McFarlane et al., 2017 ) or by down-modulation of Furze et al., 2006; Schuijs et al., 2016 ). Examining the body weight of non-vaccinated mice dur- ing the influenza virus challenge infection, we observed a slightly reduced weight loss in helminth-infected mice compared to non-helminth-infected mice although viral burden in the lung were un- changed ( Figures 1 D and 1E). This observation may reflect an amelioration of influenza infection-induced pathology in helminthco-infected mice. However, the net effect of the underlying hel- minth infection during vaccination clearly results in impaired pro- tection, as we have shown here, employing a vaccinationscheme that is commonly used for the human population. Moreover, our kinetic analyses demonstrate that the suppres- sive status induced by helminths was preserved in the absence of viable parasites until after termination of the acute infection.C57BL/6 mice that were vaccinated 100 days after L. sigmodontis infection and had killed the helminth parasite by granuloma formation still displayed a reduced neutralizing Abresponse to the vaccination against influenza. In addition, we have reported previously that Ab responses to model antigen im- munization in BALB/c mice were still suppressed if immunizationwas performed 4 months after termination of L. sigmodontis infection ( Haben et al., 2014 ). These observations raise the mechanistic question of how the presence of a parasitic worm in the TC is translated to the reduc-tion of B cell responses at a different site (to a vaccination applied i.p.) and at a later point in time (past the acute helminth infection). A recent study reported that intestinal H. polygyrus infection resulted in the atrophy of peripheral lymph nodes causing impaired cellular response to subsequent subcutaneous bacillus Calmette-Gue \u00b4rin (BCG) immunization ( Feng et al., 2018 ). In our study, vaccination was performed i.p. and would target the spleen. Because the number of spleen cells remained un- changed during L. sigmodontis infection, we consider atrophy of lymphoid organs an unlikely explanation of the reduced influ-enza-specic B cell responses observed in L. sigmodontis -in- fected mice. An unbiased t-SNE-based analysis highlighted Foxp3 /C0 CD49b+LAG-3+Tr1 cells as a distinct population that expanded 2252 Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019specically in L. sigmodontis- infected mice. Tr1 cells expanded locally, but also systemically, in the spleen, a pre-requisite for in- flicting systemic suppression to the vaccination applied i.p. Most importantly, kinetic analyses showed that these Foxp3/C0CD49b+ LAG-3+Tr1 cells remained expanded in the absence of viable helminths 90 days after initial infection. Tr1 cells represent a rather heterogeneous cell population ( Roncarolo et al., 2018 ), and IL-10 production by T cells per se is not indicative of a sup-pressive phenotype ( Brockmann et al., 2018 ). However, the combination of the negative regulatory receptors LAG-3 and CD49b has been shown to 2013 ). For these Tr1 cells, the cytokine IL-10 clearly contributed to anti-inflammatory effects in murine models of in-flammatory bowel disease ( Brockmann et al., 2017, 2018 ). Because no murine models for Tr1 cell depletion exist to date, we used neutralization of IL-10 as a rough indicator for amechanistic contribution of the IL-10 +Foxp3/C0CD49b+LAG-3+ Tr1 cells to the suppressed vaccination response in L. sigmodontis- infected mice. Blockade of IL-10 signaling by application of neutralizing mAb to the IL-10 receptor partiallyabrogated the suppressive effect of the helminths. While the quantity of Ab response to vaccination was completely restored, the neutralizing Ab response was clearly elevated although stilllower than in non-helminth-infected and vaccinated mice. The protection from influenza A virus challenge infection indicated by weight loss was also improved, and differences in lung viralburden and virus infection-induced IL-6 were no longer signi- cant in helminth-infected, vaccinated mice under IL-10R blockade. This incomplete restoration of the vaccination efcacycan be explained by the plethora of molecular pathways Tr1 cellsemploy to exert anti-inflammatory effects in addition to IL-10 secretion such as negative regulation via co-inhibitory receptors (Roncarolo et al., 2014 ). It should be pointed out that we performed the neutralization of IL-10R at day 28 of L. sigmodontis infection only. Thus, we have not formally shown that the suppression of vaccination responsethat we observed at later time points (i.e., day 100 of L. sigmodontis was also dependent on functional IL-10R signaling), although it was correlated to sustained and systemicexpansion of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. Moreover, we recognizethat our approach to block IL-10 is not Tr1-specic because many cell types can produce IL-10, most importantly Foxp3 + Treg, and Breg. IL-10+B cells contributed to sion infected mice ( Mangan et al., 2004; Smits et al., 2007 ; for review, see Floudas et al., 2016; Hussaarts et al., 2011 ). We have shown before that L. sigmodontis -infection suppressed OT-II T cell proliferation in vivo only if the host's T cells were able to produce IL-10 ( Hartmann et al., 2015 ). not B sigmodontis infection of C57BL/6 mice ( Haben et al., 2013 ). Thus, the combined evidence of our previous studies suggests that T cell-derived IL-10 mediatessuppression in L. sigmodontis- infected mice. Consenting with these ndings, the frequencies of IL-10 +B cells in either spleen or TC did not change during L. sigmodontis infection. However, because we observed a strong increase in the numbers of IL-10+ B cells in the TC, we cannot formally rule out a contribution ofBreg-derived IL-10 to suppression of vaccination responses against influenza because this was not addressed specically in this study. We also recorded a systemic expansion of IL-10+Foxp3+ Tregs during L. sigmodontis infection that exceeded the IL-10+Tr1 cells in numbers. However, transient depletion of Foxp3+Tregs either at the time point of infection, or at the time point of vaccination, did not restore vaccination efcacy in thisstudy. In line with these ndings, we have shown previously that transient Foxp3 +Treg depletion did neither restore the Ab response to model antigen immunization ( Haben et al., 2014 ) nor the proliferation of adoptively transferred OT-II T cells ( Hart- mann et al., 2011 ). As the DEREG mouse model induces only transient Treg depletion for 1-2 weeks, we cannot formallyexclude that repopulating Tregs would contribute to the sup- pression of the nal Ab response. In summary, our ndings agree with a helminth-mediated in- duction of Foxp3 /C0CD49b+LAG-3+Tr1 cells that partially ex- pressed PD-1 and CTLA-4, produced IL-10, and subsequently contributed to impaired vaccine efcacy due to reduced neutral- izing Ab responses. In line with this reasoning, IL-10+Tr1 cells were shown to suppress the IgG production by human B cells in vitro and in lymphopenic RAG/C0//C0mice relled with oval- bumin-specic T cells and B cells in vivo (Facciotti et al., 2016 ). Human Tr1 cells, derived from PBL of patients infected with the larial parasite Onchocerca volvulus have been shown to skew the humoral response toward the regulatory isotype IgG4(Satoguina et al., 2005, 2008 ). From the translational point of view, our results strongly sug- gest that vaccines that are developed and tested for efcacy inthe western world may by less efcient in helminth endemicareas. This is supported by a study that followed the response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine Begrivac (2004/2005) in Gabonese schoolchildren ( van Riet et al., 2007 ). Children living in rural areas with high incidence of helminth infection displayed reduced H1N1-specic Ab responses to Be- grivac compared to children living in semi-urban areas with lowerincidence. Since the influenza pandemic in 2009 caused the highest mortality in Africa ( Dawood et al., 2012 ), helminth- induced interference with vaccination efcacy and possiblecounter measures are of global relevance and clearly under-studied so far. Therefore, the termination of helminth infection by drug-induced deworming has already been suggested as a strategy to improve vaccination responses. Murine studies re-vealed divergent results regarding the restoration of full respon- siveness to vaccination after drug-induced deworming revealing refractory times in the range from 1 to 8 weeks ( Da'dara and Harn, 2010; Su et al., 2006 ). Even the partial restoration of the cellular response to anti-HIV vaccination in S. mansoni -infected mice by praziquantel treatment did not abrogate the suppressionof Ab response to the HIV gp140 protein ( Dzhivhuho et al., 2018 ). Although some human studies reported the improvement of the humoral response to cholera vaccination upon deworming(Cooper et al., 2000 ), others did not, probably just reflecting inef- cient anti-helminth treatment ( Br\u20acuckner et al., 2015, A comprehensive double-blind and placebo-controlled study re- ported a elevation of pro-inflammatory responses to plas- modium -infected erythrocytes 9 and 21 months after the onset Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256, November 19, 2019 2253of a 3-monthly albendazole treatment scheme, while responses to vaccination were not addressed ( Wammes et al., 2016 ). Agreeing with our ndings, the deworming did not change the frequencies of Foxp3+Tregs in the PBL of the study subjects but reduced the frequency of Foxp3/C0CTLA-4+CD4+T cells that may well represent Tr1-like cells. Hence, the expansion of Tr1 cells rather than diagnosis of acute helminth infection maybe indicative of a suppressed phenotype. Because the collectivedata of our study strongly suggest that (1) an underlying helminth infection would compromise vaccination responses, and (2) even after successful treatment, the formerly helminth-infectedindividuals may not respond efciently to vaccination for some time, the diagnosis of a suppressed phenotype would be impor- tant for the estimation of vaccination success in helminthendemic areas.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSMice All mouse experiments were conducted at the specic pathogen-free animal facility of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Med-icine (BNITM) in agreement with the German Animal Welfare Act and the relevant German authority (Beho \u00a8rde f \u20acur Gesundheit und Ver- braucherschutz, Hamburg, approval numbers 84/15, 103/2018). All mice were kept in individually ventilated cages (maximum of 5 mice per cage). For experiments gender-matched adult (8-12 weeks) male and female mice were used. C57BL/6 and BALB/cmice were either bred in the animal facility of the BNITM or were obtained from Janvier Labs.

C57BL/6 DEREG and C57BL/6 control littermates received 1 mg Diphteriatoxin (DT) i.p. either one day before and two days after L. sigmodontis infection or one day before and one day after vaccination. In two out of three experiments Fir (Foxp3-IRES-mRFP)/TIGER (interleukin-ten-ires gfp-enhanced reporter) mice were used. In Fir mice monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) is knocked in locus Wan and Flavell, 2005 ). TIGER mice are knock-in mice where an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in front of the IL-10 gene ( Kamanaka et al., 2006 ). In another experiment (day 30 p.i.) IL-10-Foxp3 double reporter mice with an additional IL-4 reporter were used. The 10BiT (IL-10 BAC-in trans-gene) mice express control of IL-10 ( Maynard et al., 2007 ) which allows detection of IL-10 competent cells by staining for CD90.1. Foxp3 was detected as mRFP. Cell Culture Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM Glutamin and 1% Pen- icilin/Streptomycin. For the Plaque Assay medium Phenol Red supplemented with 0.5% 2 mM Glu-tamin, 20 mM HEPES and 1% Penicilin/Streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 /C14C in a 5% CO 2incubator. METHOD DETAILS L. sigmodontis and influenza infection The life cycle of L. sigmodontis was maintained in their natural reservoir, the cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ). Therefore cotton rats were anesthetized and blood was collected from the retro-bulbar sinus in order to count L1. Cotton rats, which were used for furtherinfection of blood-sucking mites ( Ornithonyssus bacoti ), had an infection rate of 500 - 2000 L1 per ml blood. Infected cotton rates were exposed to mites that ingested L1 during a blood meal. Infected mites were kept at 29 /C14C and 90% humidity for 14 days to allow matu- ration of L1 to L3. Experimental mice were anesthetized and exposed to these infected mites for 16 hours, i.e., naturally infected. Toverify the worm burden in infected mice, the TC was flushed with 10 mL PBS. For influenza infection mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 and 5 mg/kg) and i.n. infected with 25 mL1310 3 (C57BL/6) or 1 3104(BALB/c) plaque forming units (PFU) 2009 pH1N1 influenza A/Hamburg/05/09 virus. The influenza virus was isolated from pharyngeal swabs of a female patient as described previously ( Otte et al., 2011 ). Health status of the mice was moni- tored daily according to the animal protocols approved by the Hamburg authorities. Body weight was measured at the indicated time points of infection either until non-vaccinated mice regained their original body weight or until day 3 p.i. if mice were sacriced toanalyze viral burden and IL-6 content in the lung. Vaccination and quantication of the vaccine-specic humoral response Mice were vaccinated by i.p. injection of 3.75 mg non-adjuvanted vaccine against influenza season 2014/15 and 2016/17 (Begripal, Seqirus) in 200 mL PBS. In indicated experiments IL-10R signaling was blocked by i.p. application of 200 mg anti-mouse IL-10 recep- tor mAb (Biolegend) one day before vaccination and on days 1, 3, 6, and 9 post vaccination. At indicated time points 2-4 weeks after vaccination blood was collected from the vena fascialis and allowed to coagulate for 1h at RT. After centrifugation (10.000 x g for10 min) serum was transferred into a fresh tube and stored at /C020 /C14C until further analysis. Quantication of HA-specic IgG ELISA High Binding Microlon (Greiner, Cat#655061) plates were coated overnight with 1 mg/mL Begripal. Plates were washed and blocked for 2 h with 100 mL 1% BSA (Serva) in PBS. After 2 h incubation with serially diluted serum in duplicates, plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2c, and IgG2b. After a further washing step, plates were devel- oped with 100 mL tetramethylbenzidine (0.6 mg/mL in DMSO), 0.003% H 2O2in 100mM NaH 2PO4(pH 5.5) for 2.5 min. Reaction was stopped by addition of 25 mL2MH 2SO4per well and OD 450was measured. The titer is dened as the last serum dilution that results in an Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay Murine serum samples were thawed and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56/C14C in a water bath. Serial dilutions of sera in 25 mL PBS were incubated with 25 ml of 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus in duplicates in 96-well-V-plates (Greiner, Cat#651101). The virus solution was standardized to 8 hemagglutination units before. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, 50 mL 1% fresh chicken red blood cell solution in 0.9% NaCl was added to each well. The dilution that still inhibited agglutination was calculated as a titer after a further 1-hour-incubation at 4/C14C. Detection of viral loads and IL-6 in the lungs Viral loads were determined in lung homogenates by MDCK plaque assay. At day 3 post influenza infection, lungs were removed and homogenized in 0.1% BSA in PBS. The supernatatant was collected after centrifugation (10 min, 950 x g, 10 min, 4/C14C) and stored at/C080/C14C. Serial dilutions of lung homogenates (101to confluent cell culture in 6-well-plates (Greiner, Cell Reports 29, 2243-2256.e1-e4, November 19, 2019 e3Cat#657 960). After 30 min at 37/C14C, plates were overlaid with 3 mL 72 h at 37/C14C and 5% CO 2, the overlay was removed and the plates were washed with PBS. The cells were xed with 0.5 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at 4/C14C. PFA was removed and plates were incubated for 10 min with 1 mL/well 1% crystal violet. The staining was stopped by removing crystal violet and washing theplates with tap water. IL-6 in lung homogenates was quantied by LEGENDplex Mouse Th cytokine panel (13-plex, Biolegend) after virus inactivation for 30 min at 56 /C14C according to the manufacturers recommendation. Histology At day 3 post influenza infection, lungs were removed, xed in 4% PFA and stained immunohistochemically against influenza virus antigen using antibody against rabbit anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein (Thermo Fisher Scientic) which were detected by a biotin- conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit, and the ZytoChemPlus-HRP-Broad Spectrum (diamino-benzidine) Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti with an objective 2x 0.10 (NIKON, Tokyo, Japan). Image processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop CS5.1. Histopathological analysis was performed in a blinded manner. Flow cytometry For intracellular IL-10 staining spleen cells were stimulated for Phorbol 12 myristate (1x) and Monensin (1x). Single cells (3 310 6) from the spleen or TC were stained with 1 mL Zombie UV Fixable Viability Kit or Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit in 1 mL PBS for 30 min at 4/C14C. For surface staining, cells were rst stained for 15 min at anti-mouse APC-labeled an additional incubation for 15 min at RT, cells were washed and stained for 30 min on ice with was counterstaining the expression of IL-10 with with Thermosher Scientic Foxp3/Transcription factor staining buffer set according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were analyzed on a LSRII or a LSRFortessa (Becton Dickinson) using FlowJo software(TreeStar). For the cluster analysis data were analyzed using tSNE, a dimensionality reducing plugin for Flow Jo. Data were gated on CD4 +single cells and downsampled to 30,000 events per sample. Heatmaps from the tSNE analysis show the proliferation in vivo OVA-specic T cells were isolated from the spleens of OT-II mice using MojoSort Mouse CD4 T Cell Isolation Kit (Biolegend) or MagniSort Mouse CD4 T cell Enrichment Kit (ThermoFisher Scientic) according to the manufacturers instructions. Isolated OT-IIT stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, ThermoFisher Scientic). 5 310 7cells were in 10 mL sterile PBS and incubated at 37/C14C with 5 mM CFSE. The amount of CFSE was, if required, adjusted to the number of cells. After 10 min the reaction was stopped by addition of 40 mL of 3% FCS in PBS. Cells were washed twice. CSFE-labeled transgenicOT-II T cells (2 310 6) were injected in 200 ml PBS intravenously into non-infected mice or mice that had been infected with L. sigmodontis infection 14 or 90 days earlier. One day after the transfer OT-II T cells were activated by the injection of 30 mg OVA 323-339 (JPT peptides) i.p. Mice were sacriced 72 h after the cell transfer. Spleen cells were isolated and stained with APC- labeled anti-CD4 Ab (Biolegend, clone: RM4-5). Proliferating cells were dened as CFSElowas shown in Figure S3 ). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism, testing for normality distribution and further tested either with Student t test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney-U test (non parametric) comparing two groups to each other. For comparison of more than two groups to eachother either 1-way ANOVA with Bonferron \u00b4smultiple comparison test (parametric) or Kruskall-Wallis with Dunns multiple comparison test (non parametric) were performed. For comparison of body weight changes over time between 2 groups the 2-way ANOVA was performed. Statistical tests are indicated in the Figure legends.
