As a dietitian, I have received numerous queries about recommended foods, supplements and diet patterns to boost immune function. While it is true that nutrition plays a large role in immune function, diet recommendations for the prevention of acute illnesses, like COVID-19 and other viruses, don't look a whole lot different than general guidelines for healthy eating. I'll start by saying that the concept of boosting the immune system through diet is flawed, as boosting refers to something that is stimulated above the normal level. A good diet cannot boost the immune system, but it's important to maintain a functional immune system by avoiding immunodeficiency due to malnutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. It's important to note that no single food or nutrient will prevent illness. Also, the immune system is incredibly complex and influenced by a variety of other factors, including stress level, age, sleep and other medical conditions. A few key micronutrients have been identified as critical for the growth and function of immune cells, including: - Iron Iron is a component of enzymes critical for immune cell function. Sources include red meat, beans, nuts and fortified breakfast cereals. - Vitamin A Vitamin A helps protect against infections by keeping skin and tissues in the mouth, stomach, intestines and respiratory system healthy. Sources include orange and red fruits, and vegetables like carrots, apricots and bell peppers. - Vitamin C Vitamin C stimulates the formation of antibodies, and the production, function and movement of white blood cells. Sources include citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, strawberries and tomatoes. - Vitamin D Vitamin D helps regulate antimicrobial proteins that can directly kill pathogens. Sources include sunlight; fatty fish, like salmon; egg yolks; and fortified dairy. - Vitamin E Vitamin E works as an antioxidant to protect the integrity of cell membranes from damage caused by free radicals. Sources include seeds, nuts, vegetables oils and peanut butter. - Zinc Zinc is needed for wound healing and supports immune response. Sources include meats, whole grains, milk, seeds and nuts. Need a multivitamin or mineral supplement? It's advised that people obtain the nutrients above from food rather than supplements, as foods contain more health-promoting benefits. For most, a balanced diet will supply adequate amounts of nutrition to maintain a strong immune system. However, certain populations, like pregnant people, the elderly and those who are critically ill, cannot eat a variety of nutritious foods or have increased nutrients needs. In these cases, vitamin and mineral supplements can help fill nutritional gaps. A general multivitamin or mineral supplement providing no more than 100% of your recommended daily allowance can be used and is generally safe for many people. Your health care provider may recommend further supplementation based on your lab values or medical status. Consult with your health care provider before beginning any supplement. Avoid \"mega doses\" or supplements that supply greater than 100% of your recommended daily allowance, as they often offer no additional benefit and can be harmful in some cases. Remember that supplements are not a substitute for a healthy diet, as they do not contain all the benefits in food. If you're looking to try a new recipe that supplies nutrients needed for good immune function, consider one of these recipes: GRILLED COD WITH CRISPY CITRUS SALAD Serving: 2 8 ounces cod 1 teaspoon olive oil 1\u00bd cups chopped spinach 1\u00bd cups shredded kohlrabi 1 cup diced celery 1\u00bd cups shredded carrot 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley \u00be cup chopped red bell pepper 1 tablespoon minced garlic Zest and juice of 1 lemon Zest and juice of 1 lime Zest and juice of 1 orange 1 large grapefruit cut into segments 1 medium orange cut into segments Black pepper to taste Spray a grill or broiler pan with cooking spray.
