Using a data set from a health insurer, thi s paper documents that patients whose GP has additional training in anthroposophic medici ne, homeopathy, or acupuncture have substantially lower health care costs and lower mor tality rates. The lower costs result from fewer hospital stays and fewer prescription dr ugs. Since the differences remain once we control for neighborhood specific fixed effects at a highly detailed level, the lower costs and longer lives are unlikely to be related t o differences in socio-economic status. Possible explanations are selection (e.g. people wi th a low taste for medical interventions might be more likely to choose CAM) and better prac tices (e.g. less overtreatment, more focus on preventive and curative health promotion) by GPs with knowledge of complementary medicine.

Introduction Health economists have largely ignored complementar y and alternative medicine (CAM) as an area of research, a fact possibly relat ed to the low esteem of CAM in the medical profession. At the same time, however, pati ents around the globe are increasingly embracing CAM as a contributor to health. A recent study by the US National Institute of Health shows that 4 out of 10 Americans used some f orm of CAM in 2007 1. In a referendum in Switzerland in 2009, two thirds of th e voters were in favor of a wider coverage of CAM by public health insurance. By definition, the effectiveness of complementary a nd alternative medicine has not been proven in clinical trials (e.g., Sing and Ernst, 2008). 2 However, lack of proof of effectiveness is obviously not the same as proof of ineffectiveness. Clearly, the status of a treatment can change from CAM into conventional med icine once scientific evidence on effectiveness becomes available. Two examples of CA M treatments that have become (more) accepted by conventional medicine are Sint J ohn\u00b4s wort and acupuncture for specific indications. Sint John\u00b4s wort has become p art of the conventional guidelines for the treatment of depression, based on scientific ev idence from randomized controlled trials (Linde et al, 2009). Hopton and McPherson (2 010) conclude on the basis of a systematic review of pooled data from meta-analyses that acupuncture is more than a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditi ons. Also Servan Schreiber (2005) presents a series of recent examples of the transit ion from CAM to conventional medicine in depression treatment. Some of the methods descri bed by Servan Schreiber have been practiced for centuries, cannot be patented, and ar e available at low costs. These findings underscore the fact that methods that are considere d CAM today could be effective and have a large cost-savings potential. In this paper, we compare the performance of genera l practitioners who have completed certified additional training in compleme ntary medicine after obtaining their conventional medical degree (GPCs) with general pra ctitioners who have not (GPs). 1 nccam.nih.gov/news/camstats/2007 2 The US National Institute of Health uses the alter native definition \"CAM is a group of diverse medica l and health care systems, practices, and products th at are not generally considered part of conventiona l medicine\". 3More specifically, we consider GPCs with additional training in anthroposophic medicine (about 2 percent of general practitioners), homeopa thy (about 1 percent), or acupuncture (about 1 percent). Using a large data set from a health insurer we fin d substantial and significant differences between the health care costs and morta lity rates of patients who have a conventional GP and patients who have a GPC. Costs are lower because of both lower pharmaceutical and lower hospital costs. In some ca ses the cost difference is as large as 30 percent. Since the differences remain once we co ntrol for neighborhood specific fixed effects at highly detailed level, the lower costs a nd longer lives are unlikely to be related to differences in socio-economic status. We argue t hat the differences are likely to be due to both selection on unobservables (healthier patie nts or patients with a low taste for medical interventions might be more likely to prefe r a GPC) and better practice on the part of the GPCs (more focus on preventative and cu rative health promotion, less overtreatment). 2. The institutional setting Anthroposophic medicine, acupuncture and homeopathy are three main streams of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). One o f the core features of CAM is its orientation on preventative and curative health pro motion as an additional approach to a more conventional fighting disease approach. Anthro posophic medicine is an integrative diagnosis and therapy concept, developed from 1921 onwards and practiced today in over 60 countries. It combines mainstream scientific med icine with Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy. Anthroposophic medicine considers a human being as a whole entity - body, mind, soul and individuality. It aims to stim ulate the self-healing forces of the body, restoring the balance of bodily functions and strengthening the immune system, rather than primarily relieve the symptoms of disea se. Specific anthroposophic approaches include anthroposophic medicinal product s, massage therapy, art and music therapy, and speech and movement therapies (e.g., w ww.ivaa.info). Acupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment i n traditional Chinese medicine. It involves the use of sharp, thin needle s that are inserted in the body at very 4specific points. This process is believed to adjust and alter the body's energy flow into healthier patterns, and is used to treat a wide var iety of illnesses and health conditions (e.g., http://nccam.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/intr oduction.htm). Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine, first proposed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, that attempts t o treat patients with heavily diluted substances. These substances which cause certain sy mptoms in healthy individuals are given as the treatment for patients exhibiting simi lar symptoms. The appropriate homeopathic medicinal product aims to stimulate the body's inherent forces of self- recovery (see e.g., www.echamp.be). In their review, Herman et al. (2005) report that s ome studies indicate that CAM therapies may be considered cost-effective compared to usual care for various conditions: acupuncture for migraine, manual therapy for neck p ain, spa therapy for Parkinson's, self- administered stress management for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pre- and post-operative oral nutritional supplementation for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery, biofeedback for patients with 'functional' disorder s (eg, irritable bowel syndrome), and guided imagery, relaxation therapy, and potassium r ich diet for cardiac patients. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials on the use of so-called Natural Health Products shows evidence of cost effectiveness in re lation to postoperative surgery but not with respect to the other conditions assessed (Kennedy et al., 2009). GP care varies between European countries in terms of structure, working methods, and responsibilities. In the Netherlands G Ps are the central gatekeepers for reference to the rest of healthcare, like specialis ts and paramedics. Dutch general practitioners generally receive a quarterly fixed f ee per patient plus a fee-for-service per consultation and per drug prescription. There is no difference between the financial incentives faced by GPs and GPCs. In the Netherland s purchasing basic health insurance is mandatory for all citizens. In addition, citizen s are free to purchase supplementary insurance. 53. Empirical analysis The empirical analysis is based on data from health insurer Azivo, active primarily in the city of Hague and its wider vicini ty. 3 Azivo's share in the market for basic and supplementary health insurance in this re gion is about one quarter. The data set contains quarterly information on the health care c osts of all approximately 150,000 Azivo insurees for the years 2006 up to 2009. In ad dition, it contains the date of birth of the insuree, date of death (if applicable), gender, and 6-digit postcode of the insuree's residence. For each insuree-quarter combination, in formation on the costs of four different types of care are available: care by GP, hospital care, pharmaceutical care, and paramedic care (like physical therapy). While the d ata set does not contain information on the supplementary insurance status of insurees, the cost information is the sum of expenses covered by both the basic and (if applicab le) supplementary health insurance. The data set also contains the names and addresses of the about 2000 GPs who have patients who are insured by Azivo, which allow s us to distinguish between conventional GPs and GPCs. We define a general prac titioner as anthroposophic GPC if his or her name appears in the list of general prac titioners with additional training in anthroposophic medicine as provided by their profes sional (www.acupunctuur.com ) are defined similarly. Table 1 summarizes the data. The first row contains the key comparison, and shows that the costs of patients with a GPC are 7 p ercent lower compared to conventional GPs. On annual basis, this amounts to 170 Euros per patient. This difference results from lower hospital and pharmaceutical costs. Patients w ith a GPC have slightly higher costs for paramedic care, but this difference is small. T able 2 compares the costs by age group. In absolute terms, the differences are particularly large for patients aged 75 and above with an anthroposophic GPC (more than 1000 Euros on an annual basis). Table 1 also shows that large demographic differenc es between patients with a conventional GP versus patients with GPCs. GPCs hav e a larger fraction of female 3 Azivo is a former Ziekenfonds (sick fund) founded in 1895.

(2005) for the US and Esch et al. (2008) for Switzerland. Clearly, the costs differences reporte d in tables 1 and 2 are likely to be partly due to differences in the demographic compos ition of the various groups of patients. To control for these effects, table 3 reports regre ssions results. Each row is based on two regressions with either costs (left panel) o r the natural logarithm of costs (right panel) as the dependent variable. In all regression s, the explanatory variables are: gender, age (linear, within each age category), dummies for each quarter, dummies for anthroposophy, homeopathy, and acupuncture, and 6-d igit postal code fixed effects. The table reports the coefficients on the dummies for a nthroposophy, homeopathy, and acupuncture. Standard errors clustered at the insur ee level. The left panel of table 3 shows that for patients in the age group 25 to 49 with a GPC with acupuncture total costs are 66 euro lower per quarter. Secondly, for patients aged 75 and above with an anthroposophic GP total c osts are about 400 Euros lower per quarter. The magnitude of this difference is large, about one third lower. The separate regressions for the costs components show that thes e lower costs come from lower hospital and lower pharmaceutical costs. The result s for the loglinear specification show a somewhat different pattern. Homeopathic GPCs have a bout 15 percent lower costs in all three age categories below age 75. The lower costs for patients aged 25-49 who have a GPC with acupuncture is found again for the logline ar specification. The differences between the linear and loglinear results are relate d to the fact the two specifications focus on different aspects of the cost distributions. The linear specification measures differences in the means of the costs distributions , while the loglinear specification is informative about the difference in medians. 5 Overall, the results provide strong evidence of su bstantially lower costs for general practitioners who have additional training in complementary medicine. It is important to note that 6-digit postal codes in the Netherlands are highly detailed, representing on 16 households on average. Within su ch a code households are highly 4 We follow a government list of most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the Netherlands (\"Vogelaar- wijken\"). These neighborhoods are uniquely identifi ed by their 4-digit postal code. 5 If ln( y)=X'+ with following a normal distribution with zero mean, th en med (y)= X' . 7homogeneous in terms of socio-economic status. Give n that we have controlled for 6- digit postal codes in the regressions, the results are unlikely to be due to differences in socio-economic status. Note that insurees interested in complementary medi cine are more likely to buy supplementary insurance since CAM is not covered by basic health insurance. This would imply that the marginal out-of-pocket expenses for these insurees are lower than for insurees with a conventional GP, leading to more co nsumption of health care. Yet, we find that the costs of patients with a GPC are lowe r. This suggests that if we could control for the endogeneity of the supplementary insurance decision (with additional data), the estimated cost differences might be even larger. Finally, several studies that compare the health st atus of patients treated in CAM and in conventional medicine in primary care settin gs find that patients treated in CAM practices suffer more often from severe and chronic illnesses (e.g., Esch et al, 2008; Florica et al, 2009). This suggests that if we coul d control for severity and chronicity of illnesses (with additional data), the estimated cos t differences might be even larger. 4. Discussion There are three types of explanations for the diffe rences reported in the previous section. First, the differences could be due to sel ection on unobservables in patients' GP choice. For example, patients who are healthier and more health-conscious, or patients with a strong preference to minimize exposure to me dical interventions might be more likely to choose a GPC. In both cases costs will be lower due to lower demand for health care. A standard approach to control for selection on unobservables is to use instrumental variables. A potential instrumental variable (IV) i n this case is the distance between a patient's home and the various GPs. However, the di stance measures would be perfectly correlated with the 6-digit postal code dummies. As a consequence, this IV would only work if we would control for less detailed neighbor hood information, like 4-digit postal codes. However, since socio-economic differences wi thin a 4-digit postal code are typically large, this would not be a credible appro ach for identifying a causal effect of CAM on costs. 8Second, the results could be due to undertreatment by GPCs. Investigating this explanation requires data on outcomes. In the prese nt data set the only outcome information available is mortality in the years 200 6 up to and including 2009. For the population of insurees in our data, the mortality r ate was approximately 4 percent. Table 4 reports the results of an analysis of mortality r ates. The table shows that - controlling for demographics (including age) and postal codes p atients with a GPC have lower mortality rates. (Note that lower mortality rates a t all ages implies a higher life expectancy.) A number of studies have reported that patients seeking anthroposofic or homeopathic care have longer lasting and more sever e health problems than patients in conventional care. At the same time, these patients report fewer adverse side effects of treatments and higher patient satisfaction; see, fo r example, Esch et al. (2008) and Florica et al. (2008). These findings combined with the res ults in table 4 suggest that undertreatment by GPCs is unlikely. Thirdly, the results could be due to better practic es of CAM due to a stronger focus on preventive and curative health promotion a nd less overtreatment. For example, a GPC might try a low cost CAM treatment first. As me ntioned, the primary professional orientation of CAM doctors is to strengthen the sel f-healing capacity of the body. This approach is associated with prescribing fewer conve ntional pharmaceuticals, tests, and operations. A large number of issues remain for future research . We mention three of them. First of all, replication studies based on similar data sets are needed to confirm the present results. Secondly, further research based o n more comprehensive data is needed to determine to what extent selection on unobservab les and causal effects explain the lower costs and lower mortality rates of patients w ith a GPC. Thirdly, more research is needed with regard to the cost-effectiveness of CAM for specific diagnostic categories. 9References Esch, Barbara M., Marian Florica, Andr\u00e9 Busato, and Peter Heusser (2008), \"Patient satisfaction with primary care: an observational st udy comparing anthroposofic and conventional care\", Health and Quality of Life Outcomes vol.
