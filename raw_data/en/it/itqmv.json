Although specific vaccines are available and natural drugs are being researched, supportive care and specific treatments to alleviate symptoms and improve patient quality of life remain critical. Chinese medicine (CM) has been employed in China due to the similarities between the epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, the integration of other traditional oriental medical systems into the broader framework of integrative medicine can offer a powerful approach to managing the disease. Additionally, it has been reported that integrated medicine has better effects and does not increase adverse drug reactions in the context of COVID-19. This article examines preventive measures, potential infection mechanisms, and immune responses in Western medicine (WM), as well as the pathophysiology based on principles of complementary medicine (CM). The convergence between WM and CM approaches, such as the importance of maintaining a strong immune system and promoting preventive care measures, is also addressed. Current treatment options, traditional therapies, and classical prescriptions based on empirical knowledge are also explored, with individual patient circumstances taken into account. An analysis of the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of complementary and Western medicine (WM) in the treatment of COVID-19 can provide valuable guidance, enrichment, and empowerment for future research endeavors.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-06", "cleaned_text": "Converging Paths: A Comprehensive Review of the Synergistic Approach between Complementary Medicines and Western Medicine in Addressing COVID-19 in 2020 [https://doi.org/10.3390/biomed3020025](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomed3020025) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-biomed-03-00025)] that gained the ability to infect humans and subsequently spread from human to human, leading to a global pandemic. The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the viral disease COVID-19 [ [2](#B2-biomed-03-00025)]. The scientific name of the virus is SARS-CoV-2 [ [3](#B3-biomed-03-00025)], which shares a sequence homology with SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including the recently identified RmYN02, which shares a 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 and a 97.2% identity with the 1ab gene. However, RmYN02 exhibits specific differences in the spike protein and receptor-binding domain [ [4](#B4-biomed-03-00025)]. In humans, all of these viruses can cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to severe lung infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 [ [5](#B5-biomed-03-00025)]. [6](#B6-biomed-03-00025), [7](#B7-biomed-03-00025)]. For more than two thousand years, CM, Ayurvedic medicine, and Unani Shidda (AYUSH) [ [8](#B8-biomed-03-00025)] have focused on developing methodologies to preserve and maintain health, giving importance to the balance among the organs. Whereas CM regulates the body in a very early phase, keeping the person harmonized, WM acts when the patient is already showing signs of an illness that is in advanced stages [ [9](#B9-biomed-03-00025)]. We now know that for the treatment of mild and moderate syndromes, multidisciplinary intervention reduces typical respiratory symptoms as well as lung exudation and prevents further development of the disease. Thus, an integrative approach could be the most effective strategy. This work aims to evaluate the differences in approaches to the treatment of COVID-19 between WM and complementary medical systems, as a guide to enrich and empower future health system research. 2. The Outbreak of COVID-19: Perspectives from Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine 2.1. Western Medicine Perspective [10](#B10-biomed-03-00025)]. Distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viral infections is difficult due to the absence of specific symptoms and overlapping clinical features, including febrile illness with a cough that lasts for several days before potentially progressing to acute pneumonia. Additionally, patients may exhibit atypical or minimal symptoms, and co-infections with bacteria or other viruses in upper respiratory tract tissues have been identified, further complicating the diagnosis of COVID-19. As the viral load in the respiratory tract increases, SARS-CoV-2 produces the enzyme 3CL protease, which inhibits the host's innate immune response and enables the virus to spread to surrounding cells, forming lesions. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells is similar to SARS-CoV, although with increased virulence, an accelerated spreading rate, and higher contagiousness [ [11](#B11-biomed-03-00025), [12](#B12-biomed-03-00025)]. Three evolutionary stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, including early infection, the pulmonary phase, and systemic hyperinflammation, each characterized by specific clinical signs and symptoms [ [13](#B13-biomed-03-00025)]. [13](#B13-biomed-03-00025), [14](#B14-biomed-03-00025)]. Other works have suggested that an increase in serum 25-Hydroxy-VitaminD level could improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients [ [15](#B15-biomed-03-00025)]. Men seem to be more prone to infection than women [ [15](#B15-biomed-03-00025)], and obesity, especially in men, as well as higher levels of smoking and alcohol intake seem to significantly increase the risk of developing severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, women have proven to be more responsible concerning the measures of preventive care such as frequent handwashing, wearing a face mask, and staying at home [ [15](#B15-biomed-03-00025)]. [16](#B16-biomed-03-00025)]. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and acute respiratory distress syndrome seem to be at higher risk of death [ [17](#B17-biomed-03-00025)]. Alterations in the microbiome are associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and also with the severity of the COVID-19 disease [ [18](#B18-biomed-03-00025), [19](#B19-biomed-03-00025)]. 2.2. Chinese Medicine Perspective [20](#B20-biomed-03-00025)]. The immune system becomes weaker and more susceptible to a similar epidemic miasma, which, following the classic book of CM, Huangdi Neijing, occurs mainly during the winter-spring period, being highly infectious. In this scenario, a clear recommendation from ancient Chinese medical doctors was to avoid staying in crowded places to prevent infection. The Huangdi Neijing book explains that normal lung functions can be drastically affected by any epidemic disease through the nose from contaminated air, causing coughs, wheezing, and fever. At the time of its publication, Huangdi Neijing did not propose any specific diagnosis or adequate treatment. Only later, in the Ming (1360-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, medical specialists in febrile diseases found many ways to diagnose and treat epidemics, which are still relevant nowadays. They mainly proposed reinforcing the internal Qi (or immunity) and preventive care. For example, Wu Youke, a specialist in epidemics in the Ming dynasty, advised people to wear face masks and to quarantine patients suffering from febrile diseases [ [21](#B21-biomed-03-00025)]. [22](#B22-biomed-03-00025)]. [21](#B21-biomed-03-00025)]. The fullness of the Earth element may lead to heat in the stomach and spleen, which, combined with dampness, generate blockages (stasis) [ [23](#B23-biomed-03-00025)]. A blocked stomach, in terms of WM, can be comparable to blocked vagal functions. In airway diseases, a lack of control of the surfaces is also involved, e.g., the mucous membranes. The pulmonary orb, along with the large intestine and stomach, collectively governs these surfaces. When dampness moves into the lungs, phlegm comes up, triggering a cough. Treating dampness involves removing the blockages and dissipating the pathological substances. 3. Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 3.1. Prevention and Conventional Treatment of COVID-19 in Western Medicine [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025)]. [Table 1](#biomed-03-00025-t001)presents preventive measures for COVID-19 mentioned in the literature. [Table 2](#biomed-03-00025-t002). We will discuss some of them below. [27](#B27-biomed-03-00025), [29](#B29-biomed-03-00025)]. Hypoxemia is common in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 disease, and oxygen therapy is the preferred treatment for these patients. Convalescent plasma therapy has been applied in the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for a long time and was successfully and safely used in the treatment of MERS, SARS, and the H1N1 pandemic [ [3](#B3-biomed-03-00025), [20](#B20-biomed-03-00025), [27](#B27-biomed-03-00025)]. [30](#B30-biomed-03-00025)]. Therefore, it is not surprising that IFN1 and interferon IFN-2b are used to treat COVID-19 disease in the early stages of infection. These reduce the levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 in the blood produced by the nuclear factor B (NF-KB). In this sense, it is important to point out that Artemisinin (Artemisia annua) and artesunate are considered effective treatments for COVID-19 because of their anti-NF-B effect and chloroquine-like endocytosis inhibition mechanism [ [31](#B31-biomed-03-00025)]. a central role in mediating and amplifying cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is associated with acute viral infections including coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and high levels of IL-6 are observed. The use of IL-6 blockers seems promising for managing the cytokine storm occurring in the most aggressive patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibody drugs such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab are IL-6 receptor antagonists, so it is easy to understand their use in patients with COVID-19 [ [32](#B32-biomed-03-00025)]. [25](#B25-biomed-03-00025), [33](#B33-biomed-03-00025)] by intervening in the effective adhesion of the spike protein to the host cell, reducing the glycosylation of ACE2. Thus, they were considered an effective treatment for COVID-19 infection [ [34](#B34-biomed-03-00025)]. Gautret et al. evaluated nasal swabs from patients who received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and, depending on the clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. In some cases, a significant reduction in viral transport was also shown. When added to hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin seemed to be significantly more efficient for SARS-CoV-2 elimination [ [35](#B35-biomed-03-00025)]. However, on July 4, the WHO, based on the recommendation from the Solidarity Trial's International Steering Committee, advised discontinuing the hydroxychloroquine as well as the lopinavir/ritonavir trials, once the results showed that they produced little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard care [ [33](#B33-biomed-03-00025), [36](#B36-biomed-03-00025)]. [37](#B37-biomed-03-00025)], antiretroviral drugs have been shown to be effective against several enveloped () ssRNA viruses, such as remdesivir against the Ebola virus and Marburg virus, oseltamivir against influenza A and B viruses, and lopinavir and ritonavir against HIV1 and HIV-2. Therefore, it has been suggested that anti-HCV drugs may also be useful in combating SARS-CoV-2. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been found to prevent the formation of viral proteins by disrupting the proteolytic processing that mimics the structure of the peptide cleaved by HIV protease [ [37](#B37-biomed-03-00025)]. In fact, lopinavir/ritonavir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 disease by the National Health Commission of China [ [38](#B38-biomed-03-00025)]. Another study has shown that early triple antiviral therapy with IFN1, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin is more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir alone in relieving symptoms, reducing the duration of viral spread as well as hospitalization in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease [ [37](#B37-biomed-03-00025)]. However, it is not recommended to use three or more antivirals at the same time [ [39](#B39-biomed-03-00025)]. Ribavirin in combination with vitamin C has been shown to improve therapeutic efficacy during viral upper respiratory infection [ [40](#B40-biomed-03-00025)]. These findings suggest that antiretroviral drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin, may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 disease. [41](#B41-biomed-03-00025)]. [42](#B42-biomed-03-00025)]. [43](#B43-biomed-03-00025)]. It is worth noting that the intestinal epithelial cells, particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine, also express ACE2 receptors, which may explain the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stools of some infected patients. Several studies have demonstrated that probiotics can improve or alleviate lung disease conditions by modulating the immune system [ [18](#B18-biomed-03-00025), [43](#B43-biomed-03-00025), [44](#B44-biomed-03-00025)]. The use of prebiotics and probiotics to regulate the balance of the microbiome has been shown to be an effective tool to reduce the risk of bacterial and viral infections. Thus, a probiotic cocktail tailored to each patient may reduce the inflammatory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviate its severity [ [44](#B44-biomed-03-00025), [45](#B45-biomed-03-00025)]. In a study conducted by Zuo et al., alterations in the fecal microbiome were associated with the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in stools and COVID-19 disease severity in 15 antibiotics-naive patients, suggesting that gut dysbiosis may worsen the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 [ [46](#B46-biomed-03-00025)]. [47](#B47-biomed-03-00025)]. This therapy could inhibit virus replication due to the property of ethanol on RNA polymerase and, at the same time, its direct interaction with the bilayer lipid capsule of the coronavirus. Another effect of ethanol is to facilitate the breathing of the patient due to its bronchodilation properties, anti-cough effect, mucolytic potent anti-inflammatory properties consistent with the CRS, which increases activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Many patients have severe respiratory disease due and Treatment with CM [58](#B58-biomed-03-00025)] within the framework of CM. [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025)]. Some of these recommendations cited in the literature include: - Wear Chinese herb bags or sachets containing herbs and spices such cardamomum, 2 g each. Crush these into powder and put them into bags for external use, changing them every 10 days [ [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025), [38](#B38-biomed-03-00025)]; - Take a foot bath using Chinese herbs, including Artimisia vulgaris 10 g, flos Carthamus 10 g, and dried Zingiber officinale (ginger) 6 g. Soak the herbs in boiling water and bathe the feet in the medical liquid when the temperature is suitable, as hot as possible, for about 20 min [ [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025)]; - Take a preventive formula prescription of Chinese herbs, including Astragalus mongholicus 12 g, roasted rhizoma Lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) 10 g, dried citrus reticulata peel or orange peel 6 g, eupatorium 10 g, and Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) 10 g. Take the decoction once a day for adults for 5 days [ [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025), [38](#B38-biomed-03-00025)]; - Drink medical tea made of Perilla frutescens leaf 6 g, Schizonepeta leaf (agastache) 6 g, dried Citrus reticulata peel or orange peel 9 g, stewed Amomum subulatum (amomum tsao-ko) 6 g, and three slices of Zingiber officinale (ginger). Soak the herbs in hot water and drink the water just like enjoying tea [ [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025)]. [59](#B59-biomed-03-00025)]. Several treatment proposals were published from the beginning of the pandemic situation, mainly based on Chinese phytopharmacology. For example, CM doctors used a heavy dose of bitter and cold herbs to clear heat and detoxify, purging the viral infection in the early stage, as well as to cool blood and remove blood stasis promptly in the middle and late stages [ [51](#B51-biomed-03-00025)]. [20](#B20-biomed-03-00025)] compiled and translated the Chinese guidelines used for preventing and treating COVID-19 disease in China. These guidelines incorporate the foundational principles of Chinese medicine (CM) known as the Six Stages of Cold Invasion, as described in Zhang Zhong-Jing's \"Treatment of Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases from the Shang Han Za Bin Lin\" diagnosis. According to this theory, the virus can rapidly progress through all three Yang stages, followed by all three Yin stages, and even engage in \"stage hopping,\" meaning the infection can rapidly and deeply penetrate the body. [Table 3](#biomed-03-00025-t003)) [ [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025)]. The Office of the State Administration of Chinese medicine recommends the use of Qingfei Paidu decoction, a general prescription for patients with mild or severe symptoms, as well as those in convalescence. This decoction is based Zhengqi capsule, a classic prescription used for dispelling dampness, regulating spleen and stomach function, and inducing diaphoresis, is recommended as Chinese patent medicine [ [19](#B19-biomed-03-00025), [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025), [59](#B59-biomed-03-00025)]. - To counter direct and daily contact, medical staff are recommended to use additional herbsto strengthen and protect themselves. Some examples are Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang (licorice and ginger decoction), Gui Zhi Tang (cinnamon twig decoction), Fu Ling (Poria), and Bai Zhu (Rhizoma Attractylodis macrocephalae). The balance between Yin and Yang and the draining of dampness excess from the body can be accomplished by successfully applying the abovementioned formulas to improve the Zong Qi (Chest Qi) [ [19](#B19-biomed-03-00025), [24](#B24-biomed-03-00025), [59](#B59-biomed-03-00025)]; - In the case of extensive contact with patients for longer periods, clinic practitioners need additional and stronger herbs to decrease water retention and clear the lungs, such as She Gan Ma Huang Tang (Belamcanda and Ephedra decoction). At the same time, the room's air temperature and humidity need to be controlled to avoid the retention of fluids in the lungs [ [20](#B20-biomed-03-00025)]; - When staff statistics indicate the risk of overworking and exhaustion, it is necessary to enhance their Yang energy using Fu Ling Si Ni Tang (Frigid Extremities decoction with Poria) [ [20](#B20-biomed-03-00025)]; - Most patients with mild COVID-19 perform Qigong exercises under the guidance of medical practitioners to improve the pain and fatigue associated with COVID-19 disease [ [6](#B6-biomed-03-00025)]; [6](#B6-biomed-03-00025), [61](#B61-biomed-03-00025)]. Acupuncture intervention for COVID-19 infection is recommended in three phases ( [Table 3](#biomed-03-00025-t003)), i.e., (1) the medical observation phase, (2) the clinical treatment phase, and 3) the convalescence phase, depending on the pathogenic stage [ [61](#B61-biomed-03-00025)]. The acupuncture technique is applied with a gentle reinforcing and reducing method, and needles are retained at each acupoint for 20-30 min, followed by moxibustion for 10-15 min. Treatment frequency should be once daily. Although the risk of infection associated with needle acupuncture treatment is minimal, this may pose a potential limitation to its use. 3.3. Other Complementary Approaches for COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment 3.3.1. AYUSH [63](#B63-biomed-03-00025)], using natural substances [ [64](#B64-biomed-03-00025)]. These traditional systems of medicine employ processes such as sweating, Turkish bath, massage, purging, vomiting, exercise, leeching, etc. to eliminate toxic agents. [65](#B65-biomed-03-00025)]. Ashwagandha also has potential mechanisms of action in vascular integrity and the management of pyrexia-related targets of COVID-19. [66](#B66-biomed-03-00025)]. Unani medicine takes special care of the elderly as a population that may be more susceptible to acquiring different diseases once they have weaker bodies, i.e., Abdan-i Zaifa. Some preventive measures are provided to maintain health: i) the diet should follow the Mizaj (temperament); ii) a nutritive and easily digestible diet should be eaten; iii) frequent meals should be eaten in small quantities; iv) drinking cold water should be avoided; v) good bowel habits should be maintained; vi) adequate sleep should be maintained; vii) moderate exercises should be performed. Stress-relieving measures are equally important to follow. Certain Unani drugs as be beneficial. [Table 4](#biomed-03-00025-t004)shows shows some of the recommendations published in 2020 following AYUSH principles. 3.3.2. Functional Food [44](#B44-biomed-03-00025)]. [70](#B70-biomed-03-00025)]. [Table 4](#biomed-03-00025-t004)presents some of the published nutritional care recommendations for COVID-19. 3.3.3. Homeopathy [Table 4](#biomed-03-00025-t004)) [ [71](#B71-biomed-03-00025)]. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, India's Ministry of 'AYUSH' has recommended the use of the homeopathic remedy 'Arsenicum album 30' as a prophylactic measure to prevent infection. This recommendation is supported by the Prime General Secretary of Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis (LMHI). Additionally, the UK Department of Health and Social Care has recommended the use of Gelsemium 30c and Bryonia 30c for COVID-19 treatment [ [68](#B68-biomed-03-00025)]. Homeopathy has been a subject of debate in the scientific community, with some studies showing promising results, whereas others question its effectiveness. Nonetheless, it remains a popular complementary therapy in many parts of the world. 3.3.4. Aromatherapy [72](#B72-biomed-03-00025)]. However, there is one study that found the essential oil of Eucalyptus to be beneficial in improving the innate cell-mediated immune response and acting as an immunoregulatory agent against infectious diseases. This study is reported in [Table 4](#biomed-03-00025-t004)[ [18](#B18-biomed-03-00025)]. 3.3.5. Halotherapy [69](#B69-biomed-03-00025)]. Though the literature is limited, a study reported in [Table 4](#biomed-03-00025-t004)suggests that it can be effective in reducing inflammation and the risk of infection. Halotherapy is a non-invasive, drug-free therapy that shows great promise in treating respiratory illnesses, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy and safety. 3.3.6. Ozone Therapy [29](#B29-biomed-03-00025)]. Ozone possesses unique biological properties that allow for its potential use in various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus is rich in cysteine residues, which must remain intact for viral activity. Since sulfhydryl groups are susceptible to oxidation, ozone could inactivate the virus through direct (O3) or indirect oxidation (ROS and LOPs), making it useful in the early stages of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, ozone therapy appears to improve gas exchange, reduce inflammation, and modulate the antioxidant system, which could be beneficial in the cytokine storm phase and the hypoxemia and/or multi-organ failure phase. However, more experimental studies need to be conducted to confirm the biological properties of ozone as a safe complementary therapy for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Such research is crucial for understanding the full potential of ozone therapy and its potential use as a complementary therapy for COVID-19. 4. Discussion [73](#B73-biomed-03-00025)]. To ensure the right to health for all people, four minimum conditions must be met by the state: financial availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of public health services in the country. In countries where access to pharmaceuticals is limited due to cost, herbal medicine may offer a potential solution when used individually or in combination with traditional medication. In this regard, the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2014-2023 [ [74](#B74-biomed-03-00025)] advocates for the formulation of proactive policies aimed at facilitating the integration, regulation, and supervision of traditional medicines. It also emphasizes the implementation of action plans to enhance the role of traditional medicines in maintaining the health of the population. This strategic approach will prove instrumental in fostering innovative solutions that align with a broader vision of improved healthcare and patient autonomy. 5.
