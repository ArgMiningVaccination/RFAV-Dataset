Nwanodi 1Homeopathy: Curative, DHSc, ACOG, ABoIM, ABHIM, FAARFM Homeopathy: Curative, Concurrent, and Supportive Cancer Therapy - Objectives Ascertain the current extent of available homeopathic treatments for curative, concurrent, and supportive cancer care. Present homeopathic treatment development in progress and potential directions for homeopathic treatment. Review adverse effects of homeopathy in particular, and those that apply to medical practice in general. Homeopathy: Cancer Therapy - Background 12 to 24% of European oncology patients use homeopathy (Gaertneret al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2015). 40.4% of European integrative oncology center patients (Gaertneret al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2015). In 2011 a Swiss review of the literature on homeopathy led to homeopathic treatment coverage in the Swiss national health insurance program (Frenkel, 2015). Pediatric oncology drives integrative oncology treatment use. 76.5% of German parents to use homeopathic cancer treatments for their children (Arora, Aggarwal, Singla, Jyoti, & Tandon, 2013). 72.2% of Dutch parents of pediatric cancer patients choose integrative treatments for their children to promote health and wellbeing (Singendonket al., 2013). 49% of the Swiss parents who use integrative treatments for their children's cancer, do so to increase the likelihood of curative treatment (Magi et al., 2015). 7.4% of Dutch parents choose integrative treatments to cure their children's cancer 6% of Australian parents used homeopathy for their children who have terminal cancer(Heath, Oh, Clarke, & Wolfe, 2012; Singendonket al., 2013). Homeopathy: Cancer Therapy - Background Personal homeopathy use varies over time: Disease course, personal resilience, and prior personal integrative medicine use affect current use (Bonacchiet al., 2014). In Italy, 22.8% of cancer patients have used homeopathy, but 6.4% currently use homeopathy (Bonacchiet al., 2014). Sense of coherence, an indicator of psychological resilience is associated with current and past use of integrative cancer treatment ( p= .050 and p= .023) (Bonacchiet al., 2014). Pre-cancer diagnosis integrative medicine use, and phase of the care process also predicted integrative cancer treatment use ( p< .001 and p= .012) (Bonacchiet al., 2014). Late onset of homeopathic cancer treatment is beneficial Initiation on average 18-to 19-months post cancer diagnosis, may significantly extend survival in glioblastoma grade IV, inoperable cholangiocellularcancer, and metastasized sarcoma, overall p= .001 (Gaertneret al., 2014) Homeopathic Terminology X -a substance diluted in the ratio 1:10. 6x or 6D -A decimal series dilution C -a substance diluted in the ratio 1:100. 200C -a substance that has undergone 200 cycles of dilution and sucussion (agitation).

PubMed, January 2017, search terms \"adverse effects, homeopathy, breast cancer, cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prevention, treatment.\" Curative, concurrent, and supportive homeopathic cancer treatments material was taken from these searches. Adverse effects of homeopathic cancer treatments were also taken from included articles. Thirty-three of 41 articles were included in the initial PubMed search. Supplemental specific hand searches were performed as needed, yielding 10 articles for a total of 45 included articles. Figure 1.

Nwanodi 2Homeopathic Curative Cancer Therapy From 1990 to 2005, by prescribing specific homeopathic treatments for specific cancers, the Prasanta Banerji Homeopathic Research Foundation (PBHRF), Kolkata, India, from a base of 17,324 cancer patients, achieved 19% complete regression and 21% stabilization or partial regression rates (Frenkel, 2015). The PBHRF's curative outcomes have not been replicated in other trials. Differences in homeopathic treatments' production (Frenkel, 2015; Pal, 2013). The American National Cancer Institute's Indian Best Case Series found supportive cases of successful homeopathic treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma, gastric, gallbladder, lung, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and malignant epithelial tumors (Olaku, Zia, Santana, & White, 2013). The actual treatments used are not provided (Olaku et al., 2013). Homeopathic Curative Cancer Therapy A murine trial of (primarily derived from cancerous breast tissue) 200CH, daily at .1 mL/10g body weight, found that Carcinosin200CH resulted in the longest survival and the least adverse effects (Amaral et al., 2014) Conium formulations Avogadro's limit, 6c Calcerea phosphorica (lime 3X protocol have achieved 85.7% complete remission in glioma patients, without adjuvant chemoradiation mice (Frenkel, 2015).

Rutagraveolens , by Kurt MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines apoptotic and cell cycle delay effects akin to Paclitaxel. Unlike Paclitaxel, Carcinosin and Phytospare normal breast female mice showed greater cancer inhibition, reduced metastasis and angiogenesis and tumor weight, than Phyto cycle delay against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (Arora et al., 2013). Conium is often used for breast and cervical cancer treatment (Mondal, Panigrahi, & Khuda-Bukhsh, 2014). Homeopathic Curative lesions . Thujauses bi-phasic reactive and caspase-driven mitochondrial apoptosis in MCF-7 cells of 30C Thujaachieves time-dependent maximal MCF-7 cell death but spares normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for 24 hours (Sahaet al., 2014).

Homeopathic Curative Cancer Therapy Homeopathic Curative Cancer Therapy The fluid from blisters formed in response to scabies infestation is the active ingredient of Psorinum . In vitro, with WRL-68 normal hepatocyte cells as a control, Psorinum-6x , has dependent, greater cytotoxicity against A549 NSCLC than HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma lines (Mondal, Samadder, & Khuda-Bukhsh, 2016). Psorinum-6x inhibits cell proliferation, arrests cell cycle at sub-G, induces morphological changes (chromatin condensation and nucleosomal fragmentation), DNA mediated apoptosis, ratio), thereby increasing apoptosis (Mondal et al., 2016). Homeopathic Curative Cancer Therapy The Critical Cancer Management Research Centre & Clinic (CCMRCC) of Kolkata, India formulation of Psorinum-6x , is dosed at .02 mL/kg body weight/day on an empty stomach for 2 years, as the sole anti-cancer treatment in a hybrid conventional and integrative treatment protocol (Chatterjee & Biswas, 2012; Pal, 2013). This regime achieved complete response in metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, and partial response in metastatic periampullary and liver adenocarcinoma, all without adverse effects. A retrospective study of 246 gallbladder, liver, lung, oral, pancreatic, and stomach cancer patients also supports Psorinum use. Scabies blisters from webmd.com Homeopathy: Curative, APHA 2018; B.

In vitro, isatinsand isatinanalogues are anti-proliferative by micro-tubular lymphoma cell line apoptosis. Therefore, it is biologically plausible that an appropriately concentrated 6-bromoisatin containing treatment would have anti-cancer activity.

Homeopathic Supportive Cancer Therapy: Chemotherapy Adverse Effect Resolution Supportive care includes treatment of the adverse effects from usual disease treatments, as well as the treatment of psychological, social, and spiritual problems due to a disease or its usual treatment (United States Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). Conventional cancer treatments' adverse effects are treated with Nuxvomica (from Strychnosnux-vomica L.), bromatum, Belladonna, Lachesis (from Sepia. These remedies improve nausea ( p= .039), insomnia (p = 008), depression ( p= .004), anxiety (p= .007), asthenia ( Cancer Therapy: Chemotherapy Adverse Effect Resolution Homeopathy is effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis and radiation-induced Acid 30C 5 pellets every 4- hours or Calendula ointment twice daily prevent grade 2 or worse dermatitis in breast cancer patients, p< .001.

Combination remedy: Hyland's Menopause (Standard Homeopathic Company, Los 12X (1:1,000,000,000,000 dilution), taken as 1 tablet trice Single remedy: selected per the patient's presentation. Sanguinariacanadensis Homeopathic Supportive Cancer Therapy: Chemotherapy Adverse Effect Resolution A Phase III RCT, Jadad/Oxford score 3/5, of Cocculine , treatment was performed with 431 non-metastatic breast cancer patients before starting six cycles of chemotherapy beginning with three or more cycles of 5-Flurouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC 50), 5-Flurouracil, 100), or Taxotere, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) did not find an effect on nausea, vomiting, global emesis, or QOL (P\u00e9rol et al., 2012). Cocculine , a complex homeopathic remedy registered in France for nausea and travel sickness, is comprised of Cocculusindicus4 CH, Nuxvomica 4 . Homeopathic Supportive Cancer Therapy: Chemotherapy Adverse Effect Resolution An Austrian, 410-patient RCT compared conventional cancer treatment to conventional cancer treatment with homeopathy that could be changed at each of three visits (Frasset al., 2015). At least 20 different homeopathic treatments were used by 10 or more patients in the adjunctive homeopathy group. Significantly improved cognitive, emotional, physical, role, and social functioning, global health status, and subjective wellbeing, as well as, reduced fatigue, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, and appetite loss, p< .05 in all cases, were achieved by the homeopathy group. Only constipation, diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting were not significantly improved in the homeopathy group. Lacked intent to treat analysis: Only treatment responders are analyzed, leading to selection and positive responder biases. Access to other integrative treatments, and the flexible homeopathic treatment selection, preclude facile study replication and transfer protocolized clinical practice. Homeopathic Supportive Cancer Therapy: Chemotherapy Adverse Effect Resolution Hetero-isotherapyuses the substance that caused an adverse reaction in a homeopathic dilution (Bagot, 2016). Recognized in France in 1965, hetero-isotherapyis accepted by the French health insurance system as homeopathic medicine. Hetero-isotherapysolutions gradually changed from 5C to 15C, are taken the day following chemotherapy. Rhus toxicodendron associated hetero-isotherapyresolves epithelial growth factor inhibitor caused folliculitis, permitting treatment continuance. Hetero-isotherapyhas facilitated completion of hormone protocols. Sorafenib 7c produces the toxin cantharidin) combination hetero-isotherapyresolves sorafenibinduced hand and foot syndrome within two months.

If Sorafenib 7c and sorafenibare begun simultaneously, Cantharis , by Franco christophe Hycleus lugens, one of the 7,500 species comprising the family Meloidae, by Muhammad Mahdi Karim Homeopathy's Adverse Effects Nonuse of conventional treatment due to homeopathy use can contribute to disease progression, which is considered an adverse effect of homeopathy use, and an indication of unprofessional conduct (Posadzkiet al., 2012). Acute lymphatic leukemia is a malignant condition for which this has occurred. There is a blurred distinction between an adverse effect and anticipated homeopathic aggravation from like treating like chronic malady. Professionalism is necessary in the identification and reporting of homeopathic aggravations and genuine adverse effects (Stub, Salamonsen, & Alraek, 2012). A systematic review of eight controlled homeopathic cancer treatment trials encompassing 664 participants did not find serious adverse effects (Frenkel, 2015). In another study, more than 74 integrative medicine preparations contained toxic organic substances, excessive heavy metals, or had microbial contaminants (Ben- Arye et al., 2012). Homeopathy's Adverse Effects Some homeopathic treatments use known poisonous plant and animal sources (Posadzki, Alotaibi, & Ernst, 2012). Ultramolecular preparations are necessary for safety (Chirumbolo, 2014; Posadzkiet 2012). Nanoparticles and affect a solution's biochemical and biological activity (Chirumbolo, 2014). It is biologically plausible that ultramolecular, non-sucussedpreparations are sufficient to produce cellular response, as indicated from in vitro studies of Arsenicumalbum 6CH, 30Ch, and 200CH on the MT4 continuous cell line (Ive, Couchman, & Reddy, 2012).

MT exhibits dose-dependent DNA synthesis inhibition in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, leading S-phase (Nitzsche, 2013). carcinogenicity in some nations (Nitzscheet al., 2013). Nutraceuticals containing Piper methysticum (kava; used for mood disorders including anxiety and premenstrual syndromes) or Symphytum officinale (comfrey; used for halving bone healing time) should also be avoided due to potential hepatotoxicity (Singendonket al., 2013). Kava has been banned in several nations due to potential hepatotoxicity. Kava consumed at 100-fold the recommended therapeutic dose, may result in extrapyramidal adverse effects and reversible, yellow, ichthyosiformkava dermopathy occur. Comfrey is associated with pulmonary toxicity and cancer. Piper methysticum leaves, by Forest & Kim Starr Symphytumuplandicum(Russian comfrey) leaves, by Finchj Homeopathy's Adverse Effects Homeopathic treatments containing allergenic conventional medications without disclosure to the consumer have been voluntarily withdrawn from the United States market (Van Dusen& Pray, 2014). Active ingredient substitution or toxic overconcentration, especially without proof of efficacy and safety, are forms of health fraud in the United States of America . Since October 3, 2010 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pursued Hyland's Teething Tablets, purportedly comprised of calcium phosphate, chamomile, crude coffee, and belladonna 12X or .0000000000003% alkaloids, which is not Dentokind\u00ae . Hyland's Teething Tablets had belladonna toxicity and injured babies without proof of efficacy: Agitation, constipation, respiratory and voiding difficulty, lethargy, muscle weakness, seizures, skin flushing, and somnolence occurred following purchase in non-tamper proof containers. Pharmacies stopped selling Hyland's teething tablets, proving more responsible than the manufacturer (Voelker, 2016). Homeopathy's Adverse Effects Over the counter sale of homeopathic treatments such as Hyland's teething tablets is an example of lack of supervision of homeopathy. Although only 62% of integrative cancer treatment was under direction of an integrative practitioner, only six adverse effects from homeopathy and phytotherapywere reported by a group of 457 German pediatric cancer patients (Gottschlinget al., 2014). Adverse effects ranged from nausea and vomiting, to skin rash and primary aggravation of symptoms, none of which required medical intervention. In another study, homeopathic combination remedies that included mistletoe were associated with increased headaches at 6 and 12 months (p= .04 and p= .03, respectively) (Shneersonet al., 2013). Localized injection site reactions occurred in a study of subcutaneous mistletoe therapy. Future Research Fixed integrative medicine protocols, used by 70.2% of European integrative oncology centers should pave the way for reproducible clinical trial protocols (Rossi et al., 2015). Allow execution of corroborating RCT, and appropriate transference to clinical use. Corroborating RCT are needed for the PrasantaBanerji Homeopathic Research glioma treatment protocol, Rutagraveolens 6c and Calcereaphosphorica3X . Standardized formulations with identical amounts of active ingredients should be used in trials. Formulations containing differing levels of main ingredients, for instance 6- bromoisatin in Murex purpurea , preclude reproducibility, and should be avoided (Edwards et al., 2012). Increased homeopathic treatment potentization procedure standardization is necessary for realistic attempts at reproducibility trials (Majewskyet al., 2014). Future Research Identical cell lines and animal models use in homeopathic, nutraceutical, or phytochemical trials would facilitate direct comparison across studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Trials should be designed to prevent delayed entry time bias (the delay in first treatment from the point of first diagnosis) and immortal time bias (Aust, 2016). Adherence to intent to treat analysis increases RCT validity. Homeopathy: Curative, Concurrent, and Supportive Cancer Therapy8/10/2017 APHA 2018; Oroma B. Nwanodi 7Conclusion Patients benefit from indicated homeopathy use, but uptake varies globally. Current global homeopathy use has laid a foundation to be built upon. If the RCTs suggested above, are accomplished with positive outcomes homeopathy may secure a position in curative cancer treatment. Access to reputable homeopathic practitioners who practice professionally will improve the public's perception of homeopathy's appropriateness. Properly manufactured homeopathic treatments -free from active ingredient substitution, active ingredient overconcentration, contaminants, and prohibited substances -are crucial for patient safety and homeopathy's professional reputation. Moving forward the goal should be to globally increase patients' homeopathy use, lessening geographical variances. References: A - G Ahn, K. H., Yi, K. W., Park, H. T., Shin, J. H., Hur, J.
