To have the best protection against serious illness from COVID-19, you should get all the recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses for your age and individual health needs. If you're an adult (aged 18 years and over) and it's been 6 months or more since your last COVID-19 vaccination or infection, you can now get a booster. This is particularly recommended for people at higher risk of severe illness. A GP or treating health professional can provide COVID-19 booster advice based on your individual situation, including if you should get a booster and when. Booster doses are free for everyone. COVID-19 booster dose recommendations are made by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) regarding COVID-19. All COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia are assessed by the Therapeutics Goods Administration for safety, quality and effectiveness.
