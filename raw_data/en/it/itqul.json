All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS ix Foreword The founding documents of the Institute of Me dicine (IOM) call for experts to discuss, debate, and examine possible solutions for the multit ude of complex health concerns that face the United States and the world. Equall y important is the timely implem entation of those solutions in a way that improves health. The Un ited States is at an important crossroads as health care reforms are being carried out and the system begi ns to change. The possibility of strengthening the largest component of the health care workforce\u2014nurses\u2014to become partners and leaders in improving the delivery of care and the health care system as a whole inspired the IOM to partner with The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in creating the RWJF Initiative on the Future of Nursing at the IOM. In this partnership, the IOM and RWJF were in agreement that accessible, high-quality care cannot be achieved w ithout exceptional nursing care and leadership. By working together, the two organizations sought to bring more credibility and visibility to the topic than either could by working alone. The or ganizations merged staff and resources in an unprecedented partnership to explore challenges cen tral to the future of the nursing profession. To support this collaborative effort, the IO M welcomed staff from RWJF, as loaned employees, to provide specific content exper tise in nursing, research, and communications. Combining staff from two differe nt organizations was an experi ment that integrated best practices from both organizations and inspired us to think in fresh ways about how we conduct our work. We are indebted to RWJF for the lead ership, support, and partnership that made this endeavor possible. I am deeply grateful to the committee, chaire d by former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and to the st aff, especially Susan Hassmiller, Adrienne Stith Butler, Andrea Schultz, and Katharine Bothner, w ho produced this report. Their work will serve as a blueprint for how the nursing profession can transform itself into an ever more potent and relevant force for lasting solutions to enhance th e quality and value of U.S. health care in ways that will meet the future hea lth needs of diverse populati ons. The report calls on nurses, individually and as a profession, to embrace change s needed to promote health, prevent illness, and care for people in all settings across the li fespan. The nursing profession cannot make these changes on its own, however. The report calls for multisector support and interprofessional collaboration. In this sense, it calls on all health professionals and health care decision makers to work with nurses to make the changes needed for a more accessible, cost-effective, and high-quality health care system. Since its foundation 40 years ago, the IOM has produced many reports echoing the theme of high-quality, safe, effective, evidence-based, and patient-centered care. The present report expands on this theme by addressing the critical role of nursing. It demonstr ates that achieving a successful health care system in the future rests on the future of nursing.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html Preface This report is being published at a time of great opportunity in health care. Legislation passed in March 2010 will provide access to health care for 32 million more Americans. The implications of this new demand on the nation's health care system are significant. How can the system accommodate the increased demand while improving the quality of health care services provided to the American public? Nursing represents the largest sector of the health professions, with more than 3 million registered nurses in the United States. The que stion presented to the committee that produced this report was: What roles can nursing assume to address the increasing demand for safe, high- quality, and effective health care services? In the near term, the new health care laws identify great challenges in the manage ment of chronic conditions, primary care (including care coordination and transitional care), prevention and wellness, and the prevention of adverse events (such as hospital-acquired infections). The demand for better provision of mental health services, school health services, long-term care, and palliative care (including end-of-life care) is increasing as well. Whether improvements in all th ese areas of care will slow the rate of growth in health care expenditures remains to be seen; ho wever, experts believe they will result in better health outcomes. What nursing brings to the future is a steadfast commitment to patient care, improved safety and quality, and better outcomes. Most of the ne ar-term challenges identified in the health care reform legislation speak to traditional and curr ent strengths of the nursing profession in such areas as care coordi nation, health promotion, and quality improvement. How well nurses are trained and do their jobs is inextricably tied to every health care quality measure that has been targeted for improvement over the past few year s. Thus for nursing, hea lth care reform provides an opportunity for the profession to meet the de mand for safe, high-qualit y, patient-centered, and equitable health care services. We believe nurses have key roles to play as team members and leaders for a reformed and better-integrat ed, patient-centered health care system. This report begins with the assumption that nu rsing can fill such new and expanded roles in a redesigned health care system. To take advantage of these opportunities, however, nurses must be allowed to practice in accordance with their professional training, a nd the education they receive must better prepare them to deliver pati ent-centered, equitable, sa fe, high-quality health care services; engage with physicians and other h ealth care professionals to deliver efficient and effective care; and assume leadership roles in the redesign of the health care system. In particular, we believe the search for an expa nded workforce to serve the millions who will now have access to health insurance for the first tim e will require changes in nursing scopes of practice, advances in the educat ion of nurses across a ll levels, improvements in the practice of nursing across the con tinuum of care, transformation in the ut ilization of nurses across settings, and leadership at all levels so nurses can be deployed effectively and appropriately as partners in the health care team.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlxii THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH In 2008, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (R WJF) approached the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to propose a partnership betwee n the two organizations to assess and respond to the need to transform the nursing profession to meet these challenges. The resulting collaborative partnership created a unique blend of organizatio nal expertise and content expertise, drawing on the IOM's mission to serve as advi ser to the nation to improve h ealth and RWJF's long-standing commitment to ensuring that the nursing workfo rce has the necessary capacity, in terms of numbers, skills, and competence, to meet the pres ent and future health care needs of the public. Recognizing that the nursing prof ession faces the challenges outlined above, RWJF and the IOM established a 2-year Initiative on the Future of Nu rsing. The cornerstone of the initiative is the work of this IOM committee. The Co mmittee on The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing, at the Inst itute of Medicine was tasked with producing a report containing recommendations for an action-or iented blueprint for the future of nursing, including changes in public and institutional policies at the na tional, state, and local levels. The specific charge to the committee is presented in Box P-1. BOX P-1 Committee Charge An ad hoc committee will examine the capacity of the nursing workfo rce to meet the demands of a reformed health care and public health system. It will develop a set of bold national recommendations, including ones that address the delivery of nursing se rvices in a shortage environment and the capacity of the nursing education system. In it s report, the committee will define a clear agenda and blueprint for action including changes in public and institutional policies at the national, state and local levels. Its recommendations would address a range of system changes, including innovative ways to solve the nursing shortage in the United States. The committee may examine and produce recommendations related to the following issues, with the goal of identifying vital roles for nurses in designing and implementing a more effective and efficient health care system: Reconceptualizing the role of nurses within the context of the entire wo rkforce, the shortage, societal issues, and current and future technology; Expanding nursing faculty, increasing the capaci ty of nursing schools, and redesigning nursing education to assure that it can produce an adequat e number of well prepared nurses able to meet current and future health care demands; Examining innovative solutions related to ca re delivery and health professional education by focusing on nursing and the delivery of nursing services; and Attracting and retaining well prepared nurses in multiple care settings, including acute, ambulatory, primary care, long term care, community and public health.

In addition to these meetings, the committee hosted three public forums on the future of nur sing that focused on acute care; care in the community, with emphasis on community health, public health, primary care, and long-term care; and nursing education. Summaries of thes e forums have been published separately, are available at www.iom.edu/nursing , and are included on the CD-ROM in the back of this report. The committee also conducted a series of site vi sits in conjunction with each public forum to learn how nurses function in various health car e and educational settings. In addition to the workshops, forums, and site visits, the committee collected testimony and welcomed public input throughout the study process, conducte d a literature review, and comm issioned a series of papers from a research network of esteemed colleagues. For this committee, the IOM assembled an extr aordinary group of pr ofessionals, including health experts from business, universities, a nd nonprofits and health care organizations. The team brought diverse perspectives to the table that went well outside the nursing profession. Most of the members did not have a degree in nursing and were not involved in nursing education, practice, research, or governance. We are grateful to these committee members and to the exceptionally talented staff of the IOM and RWJF, all of whom worked hard with enthusiasm, great skill, flex ibility, clarity, and drive.

Achieving this transformation will require remodeling many aspects of the health care sy stem. This is especially true for the nursing profession, the largest segment of the hea lth care workforce. This report offers recommendations that collectively serve as a blueprint to (1) ensure that nurses can practice to the full extent of their education and training, (2) improve nursing education, (3) provide opportunities for nurses to assume leadership positions and to serve as full partners in health care redesign and im provement efforts, and (4) improve data collection for workforce planning and policy making. A VISION FOR HEALTH CARE In 2010, Congress passed and the President si gned into law comprehensive health care legislation. With the enactment of these laws, co llectively referred to in this report as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the United States ha s an opportunity to tran sform its health care system to provide higher-quality, safer, more affordable, and more accessible care. During the course of its work, the Committee on The R obert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing, at the Institute of Medicine developed a vision for a tr ansformed health care system. The committee envisions a future system that makes quality care accessible to the diverse populations of the United States, inten tionally promotes wellness and disease prevention, reliably improves health outcomes, and provides co mpassionate care across the lifespan. In this envisioned future, primary care and prevention ar e central drivers of the health care system. Interprofessional collaboration a nd coordination are the norm. Paym ent for health care services rewards value, not volume of services, and quality care is provided at a price that is affordable for both individuals and society. Th e rate of growth of health care expenditures slows. In all these areas, the health care system consistently demonstrates that it is responsive to individuals' needs and desires through the delivery of truly patient-centered care. The ACA represents the broadest changes to the health care system since the 1965 creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and is expected to provide insurance coverage for an additional 32 million previously uninsured Ameri cans. Although passage of the ACA is historic, realizing the vision outlined above will require a transformation of many aspects of the health care system. This is especially true for the nur sing profession, which, with more than 3 million members, represents the largest segmen t of the health care workforce. 1 This summary does not incl ude references.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlS-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH STUDY CHARGE In 2008, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (R WJF) approached the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to propose a partnership to asse ss and respond to the need to transform the nursing profession. Recognizing that the nursing profession faces several challenges in fulfilling the promise of a reformed health care system a nd meeting the nation's health needs, RWJF and the IOM established a 2-year Init iative on the Future of Nursing. Th e cornerstone of the initiative is this committee, which was tasked with pr oducing a report containing recommendations for an action-oriented blueprint for the future of nursi ng, including changes in public and institutional policies at the national, state, and local levels (Box S-1). Following the report's release, the IOM and RWJF will host a national conference on November 30 and December 1, 2010, to begin a dialogue on how the report's recommendations can be translated into action. The report will also serve as the basis for an extensive implem entation phase to be facilitated by RWJF. BOX S-1 Committee Charge An ad hoc committee will examine the capacity of the nursing wo rkforce to meet the demands of a reformed health care and public health system. It will develop a set of bold national recommendations, including ones that address the delivery of nursing services in a shortage environment and the capacity of the nursing education system. In its report, the committee will define a clear agenda and blueprint for action includi ng changes in public and institutional policies at the national, state and local levels. Its re commendations would address a range of system changes, including innovative ways to solve the nursing shortage in the United States. The committee may examine and produce recommendations related to the following issues, with the goal of identifying vital roles for nurses in designing and implementing a more effective and efficient health care system: Reconceptualizing the role of nurses within the context of the entire workforce, the shortage, societal issues, and current and future technology; Expanding nursing faculty, increasing the c apacity of nursing schools, and redesigning nursing education to assure that it can pr oduce an adequate number of well prepared nurses able to meet current and future health care demands; Examining innovative solutions related to care delivery and health professional education by focusing on nursing and the delivery of nursing services; and Attracting and retaining well prepared nurses in multiple care settings, including acute, ambulatory, primary care, long term care, community and public health.

Nurses' regular, close proximity to patients and scientific understand ing of care processes across the continuum of care give them a unique ability to act as partners with other health professionals and to lead in the improvement and redesign of the health care system and its many practice environmen ts, including hospitals, schools, homes, retail health clin ics, long-term care facilities, battlefields, and community and public health centers. Nurses thus are poised to he lp bridge the gap between coverage and access, to coordinate increasingly complex care for a wide range of patients, to fulfill their potential as primary care providers to the full extent of thei r education and training, and to enable the full economic value of their contribu tions across practice settings to be realized. In addition, a promising field of evidence links nursing care to high quality of care for patients, including protecting their safety. Nurses are crucial in preventing medica tion errors, reducing rates of infection, and even facilitating patients ' transition from hospital to home. Nursing practice covers a broad continuum from health promotion, to disease prevention, to coordination of care, to cure\u2014when possible\u2014and to palliative care when cure is not possible. While this continuum of practice is well matche d to the needs of the American population, the nursing profession has its challenges. It is not as diverse as it needs to be\u2014with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, and age\u2014to provide culturally relevant care to all populations. Many members of the profession require more e ducation and preparation to adopt new roles quickly in response to rapidly changing health care settings and an evolving health care system. Restrictions on scope of practice, policy- and reimbursement-related limitations, and professional tensions have undermined the nursing profession's ability to provide and improve both general and advanced care. Producing a health care system that deliver s the right care\u2014quality care that is patient centered, accessible, evidence based, and sustaina ble\u2014at the right time will require transforming the work environment, scope of practice, education, and numbers of America's nurses. KEY MESSAGES As a result of its deliberations, the committee fo rmulated four key messages that structure the discussion and recommendations presented in this report: 1. Nurses should practice to the full ex tent of their education and training. 2. Nurses should achieve higher levels of education and traini ng through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression. 3. Nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health professionals, in redesigning health care in the United States. 4. Effective workforce planning and policy maki ng require better data collection and an improved information infrastructure. The recommendations offered in this report focus on the critical in tersection between the health needs of diverse populations across the lifespan and the actions of the nursing workforce. They are intended to support efforts to improve the health of the U.S. population through the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlS-4 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH contributions nurses can make to the delivery of care. But they are not necessarily about achieving what is most comf ortable, convenient, or eas y for the nursing profession. Key Message #1: Nurses Should Prac tice to the Full Extent of Their Education and Training (Chapter 3) Nurses have great potential to lead innovative strategies to im prove the health care system. However, a variety of historical , regulatory, and policy barriers have limited nurses' ability to generate widespread transformation. Other barr iers include fragmentation of the health care system, high rates of turnover am ong nurses, difficulties for nurses transitioning from school to practice, and an aging workforce and other demogr aphic challenges. Many of these barriers have developed as a result of structural flaws in the U. S. health care system; others reflect limitations in the present work environment or the cap acity and demographic makeup of the nursing workforce itself. Regulatory barrie rs are particularly problematic. Regulations defining scope-of-practice limitations vary widely by state. Some are highly detailed, while others contain va gue provisions that are open to in terpretation. Some states have kept pace with the evolution of the health care system by changing their scope-of-practice regulations to allow nurse practitioners to see patients and prescribe medications without a physician's supervision or collabor ation. However, the majority of state laws lag behind in this regard. As a result, what nurse pr actitioners are able to do once they graduate varies widely for reasons that are related not to their ability, educat ion or training, or safe ty concerns, but to the political decisions of the state in which they work. Depending on the state, restrictions on the scope of practice of an advanced practice regi stered nurse may limit or deny altogether the authority to prescribe medications , admit patients to the hospital, assess patient conditions, and order and evaluate tests. Because many of the problems related to vari ed scopes of practice are the result of a patchwork of state regulatory regimes, the fede ral government is especi ally well situated to promote effective reforms by collecting and dissem inating best practices from across the country and incentivizing their adoption. Specifically, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a long history of targeting anticompe titive conduct in the health care ma rket, including restrictions on the business practices of health care providers, as we ll as policies that could act as a barrier to the entry of new competitors in the market. As a payer and administrator of health insurance coverage for federal employees, the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program have a responsibil ity to promote and en sure the access of employees/subscribers to the widest choice of co mpetent, cost-effective health care providers. Principles of equity would suggest that this subscriber choice should be promoted by policies ensuring that full, evidence-based practice is permitted to all provi ders regardless of geographic location. Finally, the Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid Servi ces has the responsibility to promulgate rules and policies that promote Medicar e and Medicaid beneficiaries' access to appropriate care, and therefore can ensure that its rules and polic es reflect the evolving practice abilities of licensed providers. In addition to barriers related to scope of practice, high turnover rates among newly graduated nurses highlight the need for a greater focus on managing the transition from school to practice. In 2002, the Joint Commission recomme nded the development of nurse residency programs\u2014planned, comprehensive periods of tim e during which nursing graduates can acquire the knowledge and skills to deliver safe, quality care that meets defined (organization or professional society) standards of practice. Re sidency programs are supported predominantly in PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSUMMARY S-5 hospitals and larger health systems, with a focu s on acute care. This has been the area of greatest need since most new graduates ga in employment in acute care settings, and the proportion of new hires (and nursing staff) that are new graduates is ra pidly increasing. It is essential, however, that residency programs outside of acute care settings be devel oped and evaluated. Much of the evidence supporting the success of residencies has been produced through self-evaluations by the residency programs themselves. For example, one organization, Versant,2 has demonstrated a profound reduction in turnover rates for new graduate registered nur ses\u2014from 35 to 6 percent at 12 months and from 55 to 11 percent at 24 mont hs\u2014compared with new graduate registered nurse control groups hired at a facility prior to implementa tion of the residency program. Key Message #2: Nurses Should Achiev e Higher Levels of Education and Training Through an Improved Education System That Promotes Seamless Academic Progression (Chapter 4) Major changes in the U.S. health care system and practice environment will require equally profound changes in the education of nurses both before and after th ey receive their license. An improved education system is necessary to ensure that the current and future generations of nurses can deliver safe, quality, pa tient-centered care across all setti ngs, especially in such areas as primary care and community and public health. Nursing is unique among the health professions in the United States in that it has multiple educational pathways leading to an entry-level license to practice. The qualifications and level of education required for entry into the nursing pr ofession have been widely debated by nurses, nursing organizations, academics, and a host of other stakeholders for more than 40 years. During that time, competencies needed to practi ce have expanded, especially in the domains of community and public health, geriatrics, leader ship, health policy, system improvement and change, research and evidence-based practice, and teamwork and collaboration. These new competencies have placed increased pressures on the education system and its curricula. Care within hospital and community settings also has become more complex. In hospitals, nurses must make critical decisions associated with care for sicker, frailer patients and work with sophisticated, life-saving technology. Nurses are being called upon to fill primary care roles and to help patients manage chroni c illnesses, thereby preventing acute care episodes and disease progression. They are expected to use a variety of technological tools and complex information management systems that require skills in an alysis and synthesis to improve the quality and effectiveness of care. Across settings, nurses are being called upon to coordinate care and collaborate with a variety of health professionals, including phys icians, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, and pharmacists, most of whom hold master's or doctoral degrees. Shortages of nurses in the positions of primary care providers, faculty, an d researchers continue to be a barrier to advancing the profession and improving the delivery of care to patients. To respond to these demands of an evolving health care system and meet the changing needs of patients, nurses must achieve hi gher levels of education and trai ning. One step in realizing this goal is for a greater number of nurses to enter the workforce with a baccalaureate degree or progress to this degree early in their career. Moreover, to alle viate shortages of nurse faculty, primary care providers, and researchers, a cadre of qualified nurses needs to be ready to advance 2 Versant is a nonprofit organization that provides, supervises, and evaluates nurse transition-to-practice residency programs for children's and general acute care hospitals.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlS-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH to the master's and doctoral levels. Nursing ed ucation should therefore include opportunities for seamless transition to higher degree programs\u2014 from licensed practical nurse (LPN)/licensed vocational nurse (LVN) degrees, to the associate' s degree in nursing (ADN) and bachelor's of science in nursing (BSN), to master's of scien ce in nursing (MSN), and to the PhD and doctor of nursing practice (DNP). Further, nursing education should serve as a platform for continued lifelong learning. Nurses also shoul d be educated with physicians and other health professionals as students and throughout their ca reers. Finally, as efforts are made to improve the education system, greater emphasis must be placed on incr easing the diversity of the workforce, including in the areas of gender and race/ethnicity, as we ll as ensuring that nurses are able to provide culturally relevant care. While the capacity of the education system will need to expand, and the focus of curricula will need to be updated to ensure that nurses have the right competencies, a variety of traditional and innovative strategies alrea dy are being used across the co untry to achieve these aims. Examples include the use of technologies such as online education and simulation, consortium programs that create a seamless pathway from the ADN to the BSN, and ADN-to-MSN programs that provide a direct link to graduate education. Collect ively, these strategies can be scaled up and refined to e ffect the needed transforma tion of nursing education. Key Message #3: Nurses Should Be Full Partners, with Physicians and Other Health Professionals, in Redesigning Health Care in the United States (Chapter 5) Strong leadership is critical if the vision of a tr ansformed health care system is to be realized. To play an active role in achieving this vi sion, the nursing profession must produce leaders throughout the system, from the bedside to the boardroom. These leaders must act as full partners with physicians and other health profes sionals, and must be accountable for their own contributions to delivering high-quality care while working collaboratively with leaders from other health professions. Being a full partner transcends all levels of the nursing profession and requires leadership skills and competencies that must be applied within the profession a nd in collaboration with other health professionals. In care environments, being a full partner involves taking responsibility for identifying problems and areas of waste, devising and implementing a plan for improvement, tracking improvement over time, a nd making necessary adjustments to realize established goals. Moreover, bei ng a full partner translates more broadly to the health policy arena. To be effective in recon ceptualized roles, nurses must see policy as something they can shape rather than something that happens to them . Nurses should have a voice in health policy decision making and be engaged in implementation efforts related to health care reform. Nurses also should serve actively on advisory comm ittees, commissions, and boards where policy decisions are made to advance health systems to improve patient care. Strong leadership on the part of nurses, physicia ns, and others will be required to devise and implement the changes necessary to increase quality, access, and value and deliver patient- centered care. While not all nu rses begin their career with thoughts of becoming a leader, leadership is fundamental to advancing the profe ssion. To ensure that nurses are ready to assume leadership roles, leadership-related compet encies need to be embedded throughout nursing education, leadership development and mentoring programs need to be made available for nurses at all levels, and a culture that promotes and va lues leadership needs to be fostered. Equally important, all nurses\u2014from students, to bedside a nd community nurses, to chief nursing officers and members of nursing organizations, to res earchers\u2014must take responsibility for their PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSUMMARY S-7 personal and professional growth by developing leadership compet encies. They must exercise these competencies in a collaborative envir onment in all settings , including hospitals, communities, schools, boards, and political and business arenas, both within nursing and across the health professions. And in doing so, they must not only mentor others along the way, but develop partnerships and gain allies both w ithin and beyond the health care environment. Key Message #4: Effective Workforce Planning and Policy Making Require Better Data Collection and an Improved Informat ion Infrastructure (Chapter 6) Achieving a transformation of the health ca re system and the practice environment will require a balance of skills and perspectives among physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. However, strategic health care workforce planning to achieve this balance is hampered by the lack of sufficiently reliable a nd granular data on, for example, the numbers and types of health professionals currently employed, where they are employed and in what roles, and what types of activities they perform. These data are required to determine regional health care workforce needs and to establish regional ta rgets and plans for appr opriately increasing the supply of health professionals. Additionally, under standing of the impact of innovations such as bundled payments, medical homes, accountable care organizations, health information technology, and comparative effectiveness will be incomplete without information on and analysis of the necessary contributions of the various types of health professionals. Data collection and analysis across the health professions will also be essential because of the overlap in scopes of practice for primar y care providers such as physic ians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners and the increasing shift toward team-based care. In the specific context of this study, planning for fundamental, wide-ranging change s in the education a nd deployment of the nursing workforce will require comprehensive data on the numbers and types of nurses currently available and required to meet future needs. Once an infrastructure for collecting and analyzing workforce data is in place, systematic assessment and projection of nursing workforce requirements by role, skill mix, region, and demogr aphics will be needed to inform necessary changes in nursing practice and education. The ACA mandates the creation of a Nationa l Health Care Workforce Commission whose mission is, among other things, to \"[develop] a nd [commission] evaluatio ns of education and training activities to determine whether the dema nd for health care workers is being met,\" and to \"[identify] barriers to improved coordination at the Federal, State, and local levels and recommend ways to address such barriers.\" 3 The ACA also authorizes a National Center for Workforce Analysis, as well as state and region al workforce centers, and provides funding for workforce data collection and st udies. A priority for these new structures and resources should be systematic monitoring of the supply of hea lth care workers across profession, review of the data and methods needed to develop accurate predictions of future workforce needs, and coordination of the collection of data on the he alth care workforce at the state and regional levels. To be most useful, the data and info rmation gathered must be timely and publicly accessible. 3 Patient Protection and A ffordable Care Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlS-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1: Remove scope-of-practice barriers. Advanced practice registered nurses should be able to practice to the full extent of their education and training. To achieve this goal, the committee recommends the following actions. For the Congress: Expand the Medicare program to include covera ge of advanced prac tice registered nurse services that are within the scope of practice under appl icable state law, just as physician services are now covered. Amend the Medicare program to authorize advanced practice registered nurses to perform admission assessments, as well as certif ication of patients for home health care services and for admission to hospice and skilled nursing facilities. Extend the increase in Medi caid reimbursement rates for primary care physicians included in the ACA to advanced practice registered nurses providing similar primary care services. Limit federal funding for nursing education pr ograms to programs in states that have adopted the National Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice registered nurse model rules and regulations (Article XVIII, Chapter 18). For state legislatures: Reform scope-of-practice regulations to conf orm to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice registered nurse model rules and regulations (Article XVIII, Chapter 18). Require third-party payers th at participate in fee-for-service payment arrangements to provide direct reimbursement to advanced pr actice registered nurses who are practicing within their scope of practice under state law. For the Centers for Medicar e and Medicaid Services: Amend or clarify the requirements for hospita l participation in the Medicare program to ensure that advanced practice registered nurses are eligible for clinical privileges, admitting privileges, and membership on medical staff. For the Office of Personnel Management: Require insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to include coverage of those services of advan ced practice registered nurses that are within their scope of practice unde r applicable state law. For the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrus t Division of the Department of Justice: Review existing and proposed state regulati ons concerning advanced practice registered nurses to identify those that have anticomp etitive effects without contributing to the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSUMMARY S-9 health and safety of the public. States with unduly restrictive regula tions should be urged to amend them to allow advanced practice registered nurses to provide care to patients in all circumstances in which th ey are qualified to do so. Recommendation 2: Expand opportunities for nurses to lead and diffuse collaborative improvement efforts. Private and public funders, health ca re organizations, nursing education programs, and nursing associations should expan d opportunities for nurses to lead and manage collaborative efforts with physicians and other me mbers of the health care team to conduct research and to redesign and improve practice en vironments and health sy stems. These entities should also provide opportunities for nu rses to diffuse successful practices. To this end: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid I nnovation should support the development and evaluation of models of payment and care de livery that use nurses in an expanded and leadership capacity to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. Performance measures should be developed and implemented expediti ously where best prac tices are evident to reflect the contributions of nurses and ensure bette r-quality care. Private and public funders should collaborate, and when possible pool funds, to advance research on models of care and innovative solutions, including technology, that will enable nurses to contribute to im proved health and health care. Health care organizations should support and help nurses in taking the lead in developing and adopting innovative, patie nt-centered care models. Health care organizations should engage nurse s and other front-line staff to work with developers and manufacturers in the design, development, purchase, implementation, and evaluation of medical and health devices a nd health information technology products. Nursing education programs and nursing asso ciations should provi de entrepreneurial professional development that will enable nurses to initiate programs and businesses that will contribute to improved health and health care. Recommendation 3: Implement nurse residency programs. State boards of nursing, accrediting bodies, the federal gov ernment, and health care organiza tions should take actions to support nurses' completion of a transition-to-prac tice program (nurse residency) after they have completed a prelicensure or advanced practice degree program or when they are transitioning into new clinical practice areas. The following actions should be taken to impl ement and support nurse residency programs: State boards of nursing, in collaboration w ith accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission and the Community Health Accr editation Program, should support nurses' completion of a residency program after they have completed a prelicensure or advanced practice degree program or when they are tr ansitioning into new clinical practice areas.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlS-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The Secretary of Health and Human Services should redirect all graduate medical education funding from diploma nursing progr ams to support the implementation of nurse residency programs in rural and critical access areas. Health care organizations, the Health Resources and Servi ces Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and philanthropic organizations should fund the development and implementation of nurse resi dency programs across all practice settings. Health care organizations that offer nu rse residency programs and foundations should evaluate the effectiveness of the residency programs in impr oving the retention of nurses, expanding competencies, and improving patient outcomes. Recommendation 4: Increase the proportion of nurses with a baccalaureate degree to 80 percent by 2020. Academic nurse leaders across all school s of nursing should work together to increase the proportion of nurses with a bacca laureate degree from 50 to 80 percent by 2020. These leaders should partner with education accrediting bodies , private and public funders, and employers to ensure funding, monitor progress, and increase the diversity of students to create a workforce prepared to meet the demands of diverse populations across the lifespan. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, working in collaboration with the National League for Nursing Accrediting Co mmission, should require all nursing schools to offer defined academic pathways, beyond articulation agreements, that promote seamless access for nurses to higher levels of education. Health care organizations should encourage nurses with associate's and diploma degrees to enter baccalaureate nursi ng programs within 5 years of graduation by offering tuition reimbursement, creating a culture that fosters continuing education, and providing a salary differential and promotion. Private and public funders should collaborate, and when possible pool funds, to expand baccalaureate programs to enroll more students by offering scholarships and loan forgiveness, hiring more faculty, expanding clinical instruction through new clinical partnerships, and using technology to augment instruction. These efforts should take into consideration strategies to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, a nd geographic distribution. The U.S. Secretary of Education, other fede ral agencies including the Health Resources and Services Administration, and state and private funders shoul d expand loans and grants for second-degree nursing students. Schools of nursing, in collaboration with other health prof essional schools, should design and implement early and c ontinuous interprofessional collaboration through joint classroom and clinical training opportunities. Academic nurse leaders should partner with health care organizations, leaders from primary and secondary school systems, and ot her community organizations to recruit and advance diverse nursing students.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSUMMARY S-11 Recommendation 5: Double the number of nurses with a doctorate by 2020. Schools of nursing, with support from private and public funders, academic adminis trators and university trustees, and accrediting bodies, should double the number of nurse s with a doctorate by 2020 to add to the cadre of nurse faculty and research ers, with attention to increasing diversity. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Educat ion and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission shoul d monitor the progress of each accredited nursing school to ensure that at least 10 per cent of all baccalaureate graduate s matriculate into a master's or doctoral program within 5 years of graduation. Private and public funders, incl uding the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Department of Labor, should expand funding for programs offering accelerated graduate degrees for nurses to increase the production of master's and doctoral nurse graduates and to increase the diversity of nur se faculty, scientists, and researchers. Academic administrators and university tr ustees should create salary and benefit packages that are market competitive to recr uit and retain highly qualified academic and clinical nurse faculty. Recommendation 6: Ensure that nurses engage in lifelong learning. Accrediting bodies, schools of nursing, health care organizations, and continuing competency educators from multiple health professions should collaborate to ensure that nurses and nursing students and faculty continue their education and engage in li felong learning to gain the competencies needed to provide care for diverse populations across the lifespan. Faculty should partner with health care organizations to de velop and prioritize competencies so curricula can be updated regular ly to ensure that graduates at all levels are prepared to meet the current and future health needs of the population. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Educat ion and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission shoul d require that all nursi ng students demonstrate a comprehensive set of clinical performance competencies that encompass the knowledge and skills needed to provide care across settings and the lifespan. Academic administrators should require a ll faculty to participate in continuing professional development and to perform with cutting-edge competence in practice, teaching, and research. All health care organizations and schools of nursing should foster a culture of lifelong learning and provide resources for interprofessional continuing competency programs. Health care organizations and other organi zations that offer continuing competency programs should regularly evaluate their programs for adapta bility, flexibility, accessibility, and impact on clinical outcomes and update the programs accordingly.

Nurses, nursing education programs, and nursing associati ons should prepare the nursing workforce to assume leadership positions across all levels, while public, private, and governmental health care decision makers should ensure that leade rship positions are avai lable to and filled by nurses. Nurses should take responsibility for their personal and professional growth by continuing their education and seeking opportunities to develop and exercise their leadership skills. Nursing associations should provide leadersh ip development, mentoring programs, and opportunities to lead for all their members. Nursing education programs should integrate leadership theory and business practices across the curriculum, including clinical practice. Public, private, and governmental health care decision makers at every level should include representation from nursing on boards, on executive management teams, and in other key leadership positions. Recommendation 8: Build an infrastructure for the collection and analysis of interprofessional health care workforce data. The National Health Care Workforce Commission, with oversight from the Governm ent Accountability Office and the Health Resources and Services Administ ration, should lead a collaborative effort to improve research and the collection and analysis of data on health care workforce require ments. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should collaborate with state licensing boards, state nursing work force centers, and the Department of Labor in this effort to ensure that the data are timely and publicly accessible. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should coordinate with state licensing boa rds, including those fo r nursing, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, to develop and prom ulgate a standardized minimum data set across states and professions that can be us ed to assess health care workforce needs by demographics, numbers, skill mix, and geographic distribution. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should set standards for the co llection of the minimum data set by state licensing boards; oversee, coordinate, and house the data; a nd make the data publicly accessible. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should retain, but bolster, the Health Resources and Services Admini stration's registered nurse sample survey by increasing the sample size, fielding the survey every other year, expanding the data collected on advanced practic e registered nurses, and releasing survey results more quickly. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should establish a monitoring system that uses the most current anal ytic approaches and data from the minimum data set to systema tically measure and project nursing workforce requirements by role, skill mix, region, and demographics. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should coordinate workforce research effort s with the Department of Labor, state and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

CONCLUSIONS Nurses are already committed to delivering hi gh-quality care under current regulatory, business, and organizational conditions. But the power to change those conditions to deliver better care does not rest primarily with nurses, regardless of how ably led or educated they are; it also lies with governments, businesses, health ca re institutions, professi onal organizations and other health professionals, and the insurance industry. The reco mmendations presented in this report are directed to individual policy makers; national, state, and local government leaders; payers; health executives; a nd professionals\u2014includi ng nurses and others\u2014as well as to larger groups such as licensing bodies, educational in stitutions, and philanthropic and advocacy organizations, especially those advocating for consumers. Together, these groups have the power to transform the health care system to provide seamless, affordable, quality care that is accessible to all, patient centered, and evidence based and leads to improved health outcomes.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlOverview of the Report This report is organized into three parts. Pa rt I presents the report's key messages and important contextual information for the study. Chapter 1 offers the committee's vision for health care in the United States, explains why nur ses have an essential role in realizing this vision and why a fundamental transformation of th e nursing profession is n eeded if they are to fulfill this role, and details four key messages that structure the discussion and recommendations in Parts II and III. As context for the remainder of the report, Chapter 2 describes how the U.S. health care system is evolving a nd sets forth principles the co mmittee believes should guide that evolution. Part II details the fundamental transformation of the nursing profession that is needed to achieve the improved health care system descri bed in Chapter 1. This transformation needs to occur in three broad areas: pr actice (Chapter 3), education (Chapter 4), and leadership (Chapter 5). This part of the re port also addresses the crucial n eed for better data on the health care workforce to inform this transformation a nd that of the overall health care system (Chapter 6). Chapters 2 through 6 include a series of case st udies and profiles illu strating the work of nurses and innovative models that either were developed by nurses or feature nurses in a leadership role. These case studies and profiles not only provide texture to the report, but also offer real-life examples of nurses working in reconceptualized roles and directly affecting the quality, accessibility, and value of health care. Cumulatively, these case studies and profiles offer a glimpse into what the future of nursing could be. Finally, Part III offers the committee's blueprint for action in the form of recommendations and related research priorities (Chapter 7). In addition, the report include s ten appendixes. Appendix A de scribes the study methods and information sources used to inform the co mmittee's deliberations; Appendix B contains biographical sketches of the committee members; Appendix C offers highlights from the three public forums held by the committee on the future of nursing in the areas of acute care, care in the community, and education; Appendix D contai ns the consensus model for advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) regulati on that is referenced in Chapter 3 and in recommendation 1 in Chapter 7; and Appendix E provi des a brief description of unde rgraduate nursing education in the United States. Appendixes F J are not printed in this repo rt but can be found on the CD- ROM in the back of this book and contain papers commissioned by the committee on the following topics: matching nursing practice and skills to future needs; transformational models of nursing across different care settings; federal options for maximizing the value of APRNs in providing quality, cost-effective health care; the future of nursing education; and international models of nursing.

In part, the fragmentation in the sy stem comes from disconnects between public and private services, between providers and patients, between what patients need and how providers are trained, between the health needs of the natio n and the services that are offered, and between those with insurance and thos e without (Stevens, 1999). Communi cation between providers is difficult, and much care is redundant because there is no way of sharing results. This report is being published at an oppor tune time. In 2010, Congress passed and the President signed into law comprehensive hea lth care legislation. These laws, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (Public Law 111-152), are collectivel y referred to throughout this report as the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA represents the broadest changes to the health care system since the 1965 creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and is expected to provide insurance coverage for an additional 32 million previously uninsured Americans. The need to improve the health car e system is becoming increasingly evident as challenges related to both the quality and costs of care persist. As discussed in the preface, this study was undertaken to explore how the nursing profession can be transformed to help exploit these opportu nities and contribute to building a health care system that will meet the demand for safe, quality, patient-centered, accessible, and affordable care. This chapter presents the key messages that emerged from the study committee's deliberations. It begins by descri bing a vision for a transformed system that can meet the health needs of the U.S. population in th e 21st century. The chapter then delineates the roles of nurses in realizing this vision. The third section expl ains why a fundamental transformation of the nursing profession will be required if nurses are to assume these roles. The final section presents conclusions. A VISION FOR HEALTH CARE During the course of its work, the Comm ittee on The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing, at the In stitute of Medicine de veloped a vision for a transformed health care system, while recognizi ng the demands and limitations of the current health care system outlined above. The committee envisions a future system that makes quality care accessible to the diverse popul ations of the United States, in tentionally promotes wellness and disease prevention, reliably improves health outcomes, and provides compassionate care across the lifespan. In this envi sioned future, primary care and prevention are central drivers of the health care system. Interprofessional coll aboration and coordinati on are the norm. Payment for health care services rewards value, not volume of services, and quality care is provided at a price that is affordable for both individuals and society. The ra te of growth of health care expenditures slows. In all these areas, the health ca re system consistently demonstrates that it is PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Annex 1-1 lists the committee's definitions for th ree core terms related to its vision: health, health care, and the health care system. THE ROLE OF NURSES IN REALIZING THIS VISION The ACA provides a call to action for nurses, and several sections of the legislation are directly relevant to their work.1 For example, sections 5501 through 5509 are aimed at substantially strengtheni ng the provision of primary care\u2014a n eed generally recognized by health professionals and policy expert s; section 2717 calls for \"ensuri ng the quality of care\"; and section 2718 emphasizes \"bringing down the cost of health care coverage.\" Enactment of the ACA offers a myriad of opportuni ties for the nursing profession to facilitate improvements to the health care system and the mechanisms by whic h care is delivered across various settings. Systemwide changes are needed that capture th e full economic value of nurses and take into account the growing body of evidence that links nursing practice to improvements in the safety and quality of care. Advanced practice register ed nurses (APRNs) should be called upon to fulfill and expand their potential as primary care provi ders across practice settings based on their education and competency. Nursing initiatives and programs should be scaled up to help bridge the gap between insurance c overage and access to care. The nursing profession has the po tential capacity to implement wide-reaching changes in the health care system. With more than 3 million me mbers, the profession has nearly doubled since 1980 and represents the largest segment of the U. S. health care workforce (HRSA, 2010; U.S. Census Bureau, 2009). By virtue of their regular, close proximity to patients and their scientific understanding of care processes across the con tinuum of care, nurses have a considerable opportunity to act as full partners with other health professionals and to lead in the improvement and redesign of the health care syst em and its practice environment. Nurses practice in many settings, including hospita ls, schools, homes, reta il health clinics, long-term care facilities, battle fields, and community and public health centers. They have varying levels of education and competencies\u2014f rom licensed practical nurses, who now provide the majority of direct patient care in nursi ng homes, to nurse scientists, who research and evaluate more effective ways of caring for pa tients and promoting health. As described in Annex 1-1 at the end of this chapter, most nur ses are registered nurses (RNs), who \"complete a program of study at a community college, diplom a school of nursing, or a four-year college or university and are required to pass a nationally standardized licensi ng exam in the state in which they begin practice\" (AARP, 2010). Figure 1-1 shows that of the many settings where RNs practice, the majority practice in hospitals; Fi gure 1-2 shows the employment settings of nurses by highest nursing or nursing-related educati on. More than a quarter of a million nurses are APRNs (HRSA, 2010), who hold master's or doct oral degrees and pass national certification exams. APRNs deliver primary and other types of health care services. For example, they teach and counsel patients to understand their health problems and what they can do to get better, they coordinate care and advocate for patients in the complex health care system, and they refer patients to physicians and other health care providers. APRNs include nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nur se anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (see 1 For a list of nursing-related pr ovisions included in the COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 Academy of Sciences.

Nursing practice covers a broad continuum from health promotion, to disease prevention, to coordination of care, to cure\u2014when possible\u2014and to palliative care when cure is not possible. This continuum of practice is well matched to the current and future needs of the American population (see Chapter 2). Nurses ha ve a direct effect on patient ca re. They provide the majority of patient assessments, evaluations, and care in hospitals, nursing homes , clinics, schools, workplaces, and ambulatory settings. Th ey are at the front lines in ensuring that care is delivered safely, effectively, and compassionately. Additionally, nurses attend to patients and their families in a holistic way that often goes beyond physical h ealth needs to recognize and respond to social, mental, and spiritual needs. Given their education, experience, and unique perspectives and the centrality of their role in provi ding care, nurses will play a signif icant role in the transformation of the health care system. Likewise, while change s in the health care system will have profound effects on all providers, this will be undoubtedly true for nurses. Traditional nursing competencies such as care management and coordination, patient education, public health intervention, and transitional care ar e likely to dominate in a reformed health care system as it inevitably moves toward an emphasis on prevention and management rather than acute care (O'Neil, 2009). Nurses ha ve also begun developing new competencies for the future to help bridge th e gap between coverage and access, to coordinate increasingly complex care for a wide range of patients, to fulf ill their potential as pr imary care providers to the full extent of their education and training, to implement sy stemwide changes that take into Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

At the same time, the nursing profession has its challenges. While there are concerns regarding the number of nurses avai lable to meet the demands of the health care system and the needs of patients, and there is reason to view as a priority replaci ng at least 900,000 nurses over the age of 50 (BLS, 2009), the composition of the wo rkforce is turning out to be an even greater challenge for the future of the profession. The work force is generally not as diverse as it needs to be\u2014with respect to race and ethnicity (just 16.8 percent of the workforce is non-white), gender (approximately 7 percent of employed nurses are ma le), or age (the median age of nurses is 46, compared to 38 in 1988)\u2014to provide culturally relevant care to all populations (HRSA, 2010). Many members of the profession lack the educati on and preparation necessary to adapt to new roles quickly in response to rapi dly changing health care settings and an evolving health care system. Restrictions on scope of practice and pr ofessional tensions have undermined the nursing profession's ability to provide and improve both general and advanced care. Producing a health care system that delivers the right care\u2014quality care that is patient centered, accessible, evidence-based, and sustainable\u2014at the right time will require transforming the work environment, scope of practice, education, a nd numbers and composition of America's nurses. The remainder of this section examines the role of the nursing profession in health care reform according to the same three parameters by which all other health care reform initiatives are evaluated\u2014quality, access, and value. Nurses and Quality Although it is difficult to prove causation, an emerging body of literature suggests that quality of care depends to a large degree on nurses (Kane et al., 2007; Lacey and Cox, 2009; Landon et al., 2006; Sales et al., 2008). The Joint Commission, the leading independent accrediting body for health care or ganizations, believes that \"the future state of nursing is inextricably linked to the strides in patient care qu ality and safety that are critical to the success of America's health care system, today and to morrow\" (Joint Commi ssion, 2010). While quality measures have historically focused on conditions or diseases, many of the quality measures used over the past few years address how well nurses are able to do their jobs (Kurtzman and Buerhaus, 2008). In 2004, the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorse d the first set of nationally standardized performance measures, the National Voluntary C onsensus Standards for Nursing-Sensitive Care, initially designed to assess the quality of car e provided by nurses who work in hospitals (National Quality Forum, 2004). The NQF measures include prevalence of pressure ulcers and falls; nursing-centered interventi ons, such as smoking cessation counseling; and system-centered measures, such as voluntary turnover and nursi ng care hours per patient day. These measures have helped nurses and the organi zations where they work identify targets for improvements in care delivery. Another important vehicle for tracking and im proving quality is the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators, the nation's largest nursing registry. This database, which meets the new reporting requirement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlKEY MESSAGES OF THE REPORT 1-7 nursing-sensitive care, is supported by the American Nurses Association.2 More than 25 percent of hospitals participate in the database, which documents more than 21 measures of hospital performance linked to the availability and quality of nursing services in acute care settings. Participating facilities are able to obtain unit-level comparativ e data, including patient and staffing outcomes, to use for quality improve ment purposes. Comparison data are publicly reported, which provides an incentive to improve th e quality of care on a continuous basis. This database is now maintained at the University of Kansas School of Nursing and is available to researchers interested in im proving health care quality. Nurses and Access Evidence suggests that access to quality care can be greatly expanded by increasing the use of RNs and APRNs in primary, chronic, and tran sitional care (Bodenheimer et al., 2005; Craven and Ober, 2009; Naylor et al., 2004 ; Rendell, 2007). For example, nur ses serving in special roles created to increase access to care, such as care coordinators and primary care clinicians, have led to significant reductions in hospi talization and rehospitalization ra tes for elderly patients (Kane et al., 2003; Naylor et al ., 2004). It stands to reason that one way to improve access to patient- centered care would be to allow nurses to make mo re care decisions at the point of care. Yet in many cases, outdated regulations, biases, and policie s prevent nurses, partic ularly APRNs, from practicing to the full exte nt of their education, sk ills, and competencies (Hansen-Turton et al., 2008; Ritter and Hansen-Turton, 2008; Safriet, 2010). Chapter 3 examines these barriers in greater depth. Nurses also make significant contributions to access by delivering care where people live, work, and play. Examples include school nurses, occupational health nurses, public health nurses, and those working at so-c alled retail clin ics in busy shopping centers. Nurses also work in migrant health clinics and nurse-managed he alth centers, organizati ons known for serving the most underserved populations. Additi onally, nurses are often at the fr ont lines serving as primary providers for individuals and families affected by natural or man-made disasters, delivering care in homes and designated community shelters. Nurses and Value \"Value in health care is expressed as the phys ical health and sense of well-being achieved relative to the cost\" (IOM R oundtable on Evidence-Based Medicine, 2008). Compared with support for the role of nurses in improving quality and access, there is somewhat less evidence that expanding the care provided by nurses will result in cost savi ngs to society at large while also improving outcomes and ensuring quality. Howe ver, the evidence base in favor of such a conclusion is growing. Compared with other models of prenatal care, for example, pregnant women who receive care led by certified nurse mi dwives are less likely to experience antenatal hospitalization, and their babies are more likely to have a shorter hospital stay (Hatem et al., 2008) (see Chapter 2 for a case study of care provide d by certified nurse midwives at the Family Health and Birth Center in Washington, DC). Another study examining the impact of nurse staffing on value suggests that increasing the proportion of nursing hours provided by RNs without increasing total nursing hours was associated with 1. 5 million fewer hospital days, 2 For more information, see http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCatego ries/ThePracticeofProfessionalNursing/ PatientSafetyQuality/ Research-Measurement/The-National-Database.aspx .

Chapter 2 include s a case study of the Nurse Family Partnership Program, in which front-line RNs make home visits to high-ri sk young mothers over a 2.5-year period. This program has demonstrated significant value, resulting in a net savings of $34,148 per family served. The program has also reduced pregnanc y-induced hypertension by 32 percent, child abuse and neglect by 50 percen t, emergency room visits by 35 percent, and language-related delays by 50 percent (AAN, 2010). THE NEED FOR A FUNDAMENTAL TR ANSFORMATION OF THE NURSING PROFESSION Given the crucial role of nurses with respect to the quality, accessibil ity, and value of care, the nursing profession itself must undergo a fundamental transformation if the committee's vision for health care is to be realized. As th is report argues, the ways in which nurses were educated and practiced during the 20th century are no longer adequate for dealing with the realities of health care in the 21st century. Outdated regulations, attitudes, policie s, and habits continue to restrict the innovati ons the nursing profession can bring to health care at a time of tremendous complexity and change. In the course of its deliberations, the committ ee formulated four key messages that inform the discussion in Chapters 3 6 and structure its recommendati ons for transforming the nursing profession: 1. Nurses should practice to the full ex tent of their education and training. 2. Nurses should achieve higher levels of education and traini ng through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression. 3. Nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health professionals, in redesigning health care in the United States. 4. Effective workforce planning and policy maki ng require better data collection and an improved information infrastructure. These key messages speak to the need to transf orm the nursing profession in three crucial areas\u2014practice, education, and leadership\u2014as well as to collect better data on the health care workforce to inform planning for the necessary changes to the nursing profession and the overall health care system. The Need to Transform Practice Key Message #1: Nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training. To ensure that all Americans have access to needed health care services and that nurses' unique contributions to the health care team are maximized, federal and state actions are required to update and standard ize scope-of-practice regulations to take advantage of the full capacity and education of APRNs. States and insurance companies must follow through with speci fic regulatory, policy, and fina ncial changes that give patients the freedom to choose from a range of providers, including APRNs, to best meet PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Removing re gulatory, policy, and financial barriers to promote patient choice and patient-centered care should be foundational in the build ing of a reformed health care system. Additionally, to the extent that the nursing profession envisions its future as confined to acute care settings, such as inpatient hospitals, its ability to help shape the future U.S. health care system will be greatly limited. As noted earlier, car e in the future is likely to shift from the hospital to the community setti ng (O'Neil, 2009). Yet the majority of nurses still work in acute care settings; according to recent findings from the 2008 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, just over 62 percent of working RN s were employed in hospitals in 2008\u2014up from approximately 57 percent in 2004 (HRSA, 2010). Nurs es must create, serve in, and disseminate reconceptualized roles to bridge whatever ga ps remain between coverage and access to care. More must become health coaches, care coordinators, informaticians, primary care providers, and health team leaders in a greater variety of settings, including primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations . In some respects, such a tr ansformation would return the nursing profession to its roots in the public health movement of the early 20th century. At the same time, new systems and technologies appear to be pushing nurses ever farther away from patients. This appears to be especially true in the acute care se tting. Studies show that nurses on medical surgical units spend only 31 to 44 percent of their time in direct patient activities (Tucker and Spear, 2006). A separate study of medical surgical nurses found they walked nearly a mile longer while on than off duty in obtaining the supplies and equipment needed to perform their tasks. In general, less than 20 percent of nursing practice time was devoted specifically to patient care activities , the majority being consumed by documentation, medication administration, and communication rega rding the patient (Hendrich et al., 2008). Several health care organizati ons, professional organizations , and consumer groups have endorsed a Proclamation for Change aimed at redressing inefficienci es in hospital design, organization, and technology infrastructure th rough a focus on patient-centered design; the implementation of systemwide, integrated t echnology; the creation of seamless workplace environments; and the promotion of vendor part nerships (Hendrich et al., 2009). Realizing the vision presented earlier in this chapter will require a practice environment that is fundamentally transformed so that nurses are efficiently employed\u2014whether in th e hospital or in the community\u2014to the full extent of their education, skills, and competencies. Chapter 3 examines these issues in greater depth. The Need to Transform Education Key Message #2: Nurses should achiev e higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression. Major changes in the U.S. health care system and practice environment will require equally profound changes in the education of nurses both before and after th ey receive their licenses. An improved education system is necessary to ensure that the current and future generations of nurses can deliver safe, quality, pa tient-centered care across all setti ngs, especially in such areas as primary care and community and public health. Interest in the nursing profession has grown rapidly in recent years, in part as a result of the economic downturn and the relative stability th e health care sector offers. The number of applications to entry-level bacca laureate programs increased by more than 70 percent in just 5 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While nursing schools across the country ha ve responded to this influx of in terest, there are constraints, such as insufficient numbers of nurse faculty and clinical placements, that limit the capacity of nursing schools to accommodate all the qualified applicants. Thus, thousands of qualified students are turned away each year (Kovner and Djukic, 2009) A variety of challenges limit the ability to ensu re a well-educated nurse workforce. As noted, there is a shortage of faculty to teach nurses at all levels (Allan a nd Aldebron, 2008). Also, the ways in which nurses during the 20th century taught each other to care for people and learned to practice and make clinical decisions are no longe r adequate for delivering care in the 21st century. Many nursing schools have dealt with the explosion of research and knowledge needed to provide health care in an increasingly comp lex system by adding layers of content that requires more instruction (Ironside, 2004). A fundam ental rethinking of this approach is needed (Benner et al., 2009; Erickson, 2002; IOM, 2003, 2009; Lasater and Nielsen, 2009; Mitchell et al., 2006; Orsolini-Hain and Waters, 2009; Tanner et al., 2008). Additionally, nurses at all levels have few incentives to pursue further educat ion, and face active disincentives to advanced education. Nurses and physicians\u2014not to menti on pharmacists and social workers\u2014typically are not educated together, yet they are increasingl y required to cooperate and collaborate more closely in the delivery of care. The education system should provide nurses with the tools needed to evaluate and improve standards of patient care and the quality and safety of care while preserving fundamental elements of nursing education, such as ethics and integrity and ho listic, compassionate approaches to care. The system should ensure nurse s' ability to adapt and be flexible in response to changes in science, technol ogy, and population demographics that shape the delivery of care. Nursing education at all levels needs to impart a better understanding of ways to work in the context of and lead change within health care delivery systems, methods for quality improvement and system redesign, methods for designing effect ive care delivery models and reducing patient risk, and care management and other roles i nvolving expanded authority and responsibility. The nursing profession must adopt a framework of continuous, lifelong learning that includes basic education, residency programs, and continuing co mpetence. More nurses must receive a solid education in how to manage complex conditions and coordinate care with multiple health professionals. They must demonstrate new competencies in systems thinking, quality improvement, and care management and a basic understanding of health policy and research. Graduate-level nurses must deve lop even greater competencies and deeper understanding in all of these areas. Innovative new programs to attract nurse faculty and prov ide a wider range of clinical education placements must clear long-standing bottl enecks in nursing education. Accrediting and certifying organizations must mandate demonstrated mastery of clinical skills, managerial competencies, and professional deve lopment at all levels to complement the completion of degree programs and written board ex aminations. Milestones for mandated skills, competencies, and professional development must be updated more frequently to keep pace with the rapidly changing demands of health care. And all health professionals should receive more of their education in concert with students from ot her disciplines. Interpro fessional team training of nurses, physicians, and other health care provid ers should begin when they are students and proceed throughout their careers. Successful interprofessional education can be achieved only through committed partnerships across professions. Nurses should move seamlessly through the education system to higher levels of education, including graduate degrees. Nurses with gradua te degrees will be able to replenish the nurse PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Need to Transform Leadership Key Message #3: Nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health professionals, in redesigning health care in the United States. Not all nurses begin their car eer with thoughts of becoming a leader. Yet strong leadership will be required to transform the U.S. health care system. A transformed system will need nurses with the adaptive capacity to take on reconcep tualized roles in new settings, educating and reeducating themselves along the way\u2014indispensibl e characteristics of effective leadership. Whether on the front lines, in education, or in administrative positions and health policy roles, nurses have the well- grounded knowledge base, experience, and perspective needed to serve as full partners in hea lth care redesign. Nurses' unique perspectives are derived from their experiences in providing direct , hands-on patient care; communica ting with patients and their families about health status, medications, and care plans; and ensuring the linkage between a prescribed course of treatment and the desi red outcome. In care environments, being a full partner involves taking responsibility for identifying problems and areas of waste, devising and implementing a plan for improvement, tracking improvement over time, and making necessary adjustments to realize established goals. Being a full partner translates mo re broadly to the health polic y arena. To be effective in reconceptualized roles, nurses must see policy as something they can shape rather than something that happens to them. Nurses should ha ve a voice in health policy decision making, as well as being engaged in implementation efforts rela ted to health care reform. Nurses also should serve actively on advisory committees, commi ssions, and boards where policy decisions are made to advance health systems to improve pati ent care. Yet a number of barriers prevent nurses from serving as full partners. Examples that are discussed later in the re port include laws and regulations (Chapter 3), profe ssional resistance and bias (Cha pter 3), a lack of foundational competence (Chapter 5), and exclusion from deci sion-making bodies and boar ds (Chapter 5). If nurses are to serve as full partners, a culture change will be needed whereby health professionals hold each other accountable for improving care and se tting health policy in a context of mutual respect and collaboration. Finally, the health care system is widely unde rstood to be a complex system, one in which responses to internal and external actions are sometimes predictable and sometimes not. Health care experts repeatedly encourage health profe ssionals to understand the system's dynamics so they can be more effective in their individual jobs and help shape the larger system's ability to adapt successfully to changes a nd improve outcomes. In a field as intensively knowledge driven as health care, however, no one individual, group, or discipline can have all the answers. A growing body of research has begun to highlight the potential for colla boration among teams of diverse individuals to genera te successful solutions in complex, knowledge-driven systems (Paulus and Nijstad, 2003; Pisa no and Verganti, 2008; Singh and Fleming, 2010; Wuchty et al., 2007). Nurses must cultivate new allies in he alth care, government, a nd business and develop new partnerships with other clinicians, business owners, and philanthropists to help realize the vision of a transformed health care system. Many nurses have he ard this call to develop new Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, the committee found no evidence that these initiatives ha ve achieved the scale necessary to have an impact throughout the health care system. More intentional, large- scale initiatives of this sort are needed. These efforts must be supported by research that addr esses such questions as what new models of leadership are needed for the increasingly know ledge-intensive health care environment and when collaboration is most appr opriate (Singh and Fleming, 2010). Chapter 5 further examines the need for expa nded leadership opport unities in th e nursing workforce. The Need for Better Data on the Health Care Workforce Key Message #4: Effective workforce planning and policy making require better data collection and an impr oved information infrastructure. Key messages 1, 2, and 3 speak to the need to transform the nursing profession to achieve the vision of health care set forth at the beginning of this chapter. At the same time, nurses do not function in a vacuum, but in the context of the skills and perspectives of physicians and other health professionals. Planning for the fundamental changes required to achieve a reformed health care system cannot be accomplished without a cl ear understanding of the n ecessary contributions of these various professionals and the numbers and composition of the health care workforce. That understanding in turn cannot be obtained without reliable, su fficiently granular data on the current workforce and projections of future wo rkforce needs. Yet major gaps exist in the currently available workforce data. These gaps ha mper the ability to iden tify and implement the necessary changes to the prepara tion and practice of nur ses and to the overall health care system. Chapter 6 explores these issues in greater detail. CONCLUSIONS Most of the near-term challenges identified in the ACA speak to traditional and current strengths of the nursing profession in care coordination, health promotion, and quality improvement, among other things. Nurses are committed to improving the care they deliver by responding to health care challenges. If their full potenti al is to be realized, however, the nursing profession itself will have to undergo a fundament al transformation in th e areas of practice, education, and leadership. During the course of this study, the committee formulated four key messages it believes must guide that transformation: (1) nurses should pract ice to the full extent of their education and training; (2) nurses should achieve higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that prom otes seamless academic progression; (3) nurses should be full partners, with physic ians and other health professiona ls, in redesigning health care in the United States; and (4) effective workfo rce planning and policy making require better data collection and an improved information infrastructure. At the same time, the power to deliver bett er care\u2014quality care that is accessible and sustainable\u2014does not rest solely wi th nurses, regardless of how ably led or educated they are; it also lies with other health professionals, consumers, governments, businesses, health care institutions, professional orga nizations, and the insurance industry. The recommendations presented in Chapter 7 target individual policy makers; nation al, state, and local government leaders; payers; and health care researchers, executives, and professionals\u2014including nurses and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlAnnex 1-1 Key Terms and Facts about the Nursing Workforce DEFINITIONS FOR CORE TERMS Throughout the report, the committee uses three terms\u2014health, health care, and health care system\u2014that are used routinely by policy makers, legislators, health car e organizations, health professionals, the media, and the public. While these terms are commonly used, the definitions can vary and are often nuanced. In this secti on, the committee offers its definitions for these three core terms. In addition to the terms discussed below, other important terms are defined throughout the report in conjunction with relevant discussion. Fo r example, value and primary care are defined and discussed in Chapter 2. Health In a previous Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, \"health\" is defined as \"a state of well-being and the capability to function in the face of ch anging circumstances.\" It is \"a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capabilities\" (IOM, 1997). Improving health is a shared responsibility of society, communities, health care providers, family, and individuals. Certain social determinants of health\u2014such as income, education, family, and community\u2014play a greater role than mere access to biomedical care in improving health outcomes for large populations (Commi ssion on Social Determinants of Health, 2008; IOM, 1997). However, access to primary care, in contrast to specialty care, is associated with better population health outcomes (Starfield et al., 2005). Health Care \"Health care\" can be defined as the preven tion, diagnosis, treatment, and management of disease and illness through a wi de range of services provided by health professionals. These services are supplemented by the efforts of priv ate individuals (patients), their families, and communities to achieve optimal mental and phy sical health and wellness throughout life. The committee considers the full range of services to be encompassed by the term \"health care,\" including prevention and health promotion, mental and behavioral health, and primary care services; public health; acute care; COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-17 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH 1-18 Health Care System The term \"health care system\" refers to the or ganization, financing, payment, and delivery of health care. As described in gr eater detail in the IOM report Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2001), the U.S. health care system is a complex, adaptive system (as opposed to a simple mechan ical system). As a result, its many parts (including human beings and organi zations) have the \"freedom and ability to respond to stimuli in many different and fundamentally unpredicta ble ways.\" In addition, the system has many linkages so that changes in one part of the syst em often change the context for other parts (IOM, 2001). Throughout this report, the committee high lights what it believes to be one of the strongest linkages that has emerged within the U.S. health care system: that between health reform and the future of nursing. As the repo rt emphasizes, the future of nursing\u2014how it is shaped and the directions it takes\u2014will have a ma jor impact on the future of health care reform in the United States. PREPARATION AND ROLES OF NURSI NG CARE PROVIDERS IN AMERICA1 The range of nursing care provide rs described below work in a variety of settings including ambulatory care, hospitals, community health cen ters, public health agen cies, long-term care facilities, mental health facilities, war zones, prisons, and schools of nur sing, as well as patients' homes, schools, places of worship, and workplac es. Basically anywhere there are health care needs, nurses can usually be found. Type s of nursing care providers include: Nursing Assistants/Certified Nursing Assistants (NA/CNAs) provide basic patient care under the direction of licensed nurses: they f eed, bathe, dress, groom, and move patients, change linens and may assume other delegated responsibilities. The gr eatest prevalence of these providers is in home car e and in long-term care faciliti es. Training time varies from on- the-job training to 75 hours of state approved training for certification (CNA). Licensed Practical /Licensed Vo cational Nurses (LPN/LVNs) provide basic nursing care including monitoring vital signs, performing dr essing changes and other ordered treatments, and dispense medications in most states. LPNs work under the supervision of a physician or registered nurse. While there is declining de mand for LPNs in hospitals, demand is high in long-term care facilities and to a lesser degree in out-patient settings, such as physicians' offices. They complete a 12 18 month education program at a vocational/technical school or community college and are required to pass a na tionally standardized licensing exam in the state in which they begin practice. LPNs ma y become RNs by bridgi ng into an Associate Degree or in some cases, Baccalaureate Nursing Program. Registered Nurses (RNs) typically complete a program of study at a community college, diploma school of nursing or a four-year colle ge or university and are required to pass a nationally standardized licensing exam in the stat e in which they begin practice.

Nurses care for individuals and families in all phases of the health and wellness continuum as well as provide leadership in health care delivery systems and in academic settings. There are over 57 RN specialty associations in nursing and others newly emerging. Many RNs practice in medical- surgical areas; some other common specialties among registered nurses, many of which offer specialty certificati on options, include: Critical Care Nurses provide care to patients with serious, complex, and acute illnesses or injuries that require very close monitoring a nd extensive medication protocols and therapies. Critical care nurses most often work in intensiv e care units of hospitals; however, nurses also provide highly acute and complex care in emergency rooms. Public Health Nurses work to promote and protect the health of populations based on knowledge from nursing, social, and public health sciences. Public Health Nurses most often work in municipal and State Health Departments. Home Health/Hospice Nurses provide a variety of nursing services for both acute, but stable and chronically ill patients and their caregivers in the ho me, including end-of-life care. Occupational/Employee Health Nurses provide health screening, wellness programs and other health teaching, minor treatments, and disease/medication management services to people in the workplace. The focus is on promo tion and restoration of health, prevention of illness and injury, and protection from work related and environmental hazards. Oncology Nurses care for patients with various types of cancer, administering chemotherapy, and providing follow-up care, teaching and monitoring. Oncology nurses work in hospitals, out-patient clinics and patients' homes. Perioperative/Operating Room Nurses provide preoperative and postoperative care to patients undergoing anesthesia, or assist with surgical proced ures by selecting and handling instruments, controlling bleedi ng, and suturing incisions. These nurses work in hospitals and out-patient surgical centers. Rehabilitation Nurses care for patients with temporary and permanent disabilities within institutions and out-patient settings su ch as clinics and home health care. Psychiatric/Mental Health Nurses specialize in the prevention of mental and behavioral health problems and the nursing care of persons with psychiatric disord ers. Psychiatric nurses work in hospitals, out-patient clinics, and private offices. School Nurses provide health assessment, interven tion, and follow-up to maintain school compliance with healthcare policies and ensure the health and safety of staff and students. They refer students for additional services wh en hearing, vision, obesity, and other issues become inhibitors to successful learning.

There are several entry points as well as progression points for registered nurses: Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) or Diploma in Nursing prepared RNs provide direct patient care in various health care settings. The two to three years of education required is received primarily in community colleges a nd hospital-based nursing schools and graduates may bridge into a baccalaure ate or higher degree program. Baccalaureate Degree in Nursing (BSN) prepared RNs provide an additional focus on leadership, translating research for nursing practice, and population health; they practice across all healthcare settings. A BSN is often required for military nursing, case management, public health nursing, and school -based nursing serv ices. Four-year BSN programs are offered primarily in a university setting. The BSN is the most common entry point into graduate education. Master's Degrees in Nursing (MSN/Other) prepare RNs primarily for roles in nursing administration and clinical leadership, facu lty, and for advanced practice in a nursing specialty area. The up to two years of educat ion typically occurs in a university setting. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs ) receive advanced clinical preparation, (generally a Master's degree and/or post Master's Certificate, although the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is increasingly being granted). Specific titles and credentials vary by state approval processes, formal recognition a nd scope of practice as well as by board certification. APRNs fall into four broad categories: Nurse Practitioner, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nurse Anesthetist, and Nurse Midwife: Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are Advanced Practice RNs who provide a wide range of healthcare services across heal thcare settings. NPs take he alth histories and provide complete physical examinations; diagnose and treat many common acute and chronic problems; interpret laboratory results and X-rays; prescribe and manage medications and other therapies; provide health teaching and supportive counseling with an emphasis on prevention of illness and health maintenance; and refer patients to other health professionals as needed. Broad NP specialty areas include: Acute Care, Adult Health, Family Health, Geriatrics, Neona tal, Pediatric, Psychiatric/ Mental Health, School Health, and Women's Health. Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS) practice in a variety of health care environments and participate in mentoring other nurses, case management, research, designing and conducting quality improvement programs, and serving as educators and consultants. Specialty areas include but are not limite d to: Adult Health, Community Health, Geriatrics, Home Health, Pe diatrics, Psychiatric/Mental Health, School Health and Women's Health. There are also many sub-specialties. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) administer anesthesia and related care before and after surgical, therapeutic, di agnostic and obstetrica l procedures, as well PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Practice settings include operating rooms, dental offi ces and outpatient surg ical centers. CRNAs deliver more than 65% of all anesthetics to patients in the United States. Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) provide primary care to women, including gynecological exams, family planning advice, prenatal care, management of low risk labor and delivery, and neonatal care. Practice se ttings include hospitals, birthing centers, community clinics and patient homes. Doctoral Degrees in Nursing include the Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing (PhD) 2 and the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). PhD-prepared nurses typically teach in a university setting and conduct res earch, but are also employed increasingly in clinical settings. DNP programs prepare graduates for advanced practice and clinical leadership roles. A number of DNPs are employed in academic settings as well. 2 There are also a very small number of Doctor of Nursin g Science (DNS, DNSc) programs still in existence today.

The final section summarizes the committee's conclusions about the implications of this disc ussion for the role of nur ses in transforming the health care system. EVOLVING HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES For decades, the major focus of the U.S. h ealth care system has been on treating acute illnesses and injuries, the predominant health ch allenges of the early 20th century. In the 21st century, the health challenges facing th e nation have shifted dramatically: Chronic conditions\u2014While acute injuries and illnesses will never disappear, most health care today relates to chronic conditions , such as diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and me ntal health conditions, which in 2005 affected nearly one of every two Americans (CDC, 2010a). This shift can be traced in part to the increased capabilities of the hea lth care system to treat these condi tions and in part to the health challenges of an aging population, as the prevalence1 of chronic conditions increases with age. Dramatic increases in the prevalence of many of these co nditions since 1970 are expected to continue (DeVol et al., 2007). Increasing obesity levels in the United States have compounded the problem, as obesity is related to many chronic conditions. An aging population\u2014According to the most recent census projections, the proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 or older is expected to rise from 12.7 percent in 2008 to 19.3 percent in 2030 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008), in part as a result of increases in life expectancy and the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As the population continues to age, a dramatic growth in demand for hea lth care services will be seen (IOM, 2008). A more diverse population \u2014Minority groups, which currently make up about a third of the U.S. population, are projected to become the majority by 2042 and 54 percent of the total population by 2050 (U.S. Census Burea u, 2008). Diversity ex ists not only among but also within various ethnic and racial groups with respect to country of origin, primary language, immigrant status and generation, so cioeconomic status, history, and other cultural features. 1 Prevalence defines the total number of individuals with a condition, and incidence refers to the number of new cases reported in a given year.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html2-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Health disparities \u2014Health disparities are inequities in the burden of disease, injury, or death experienced by socially disadvantaged groups relative to either whites or the general population. Such groups may be categorized by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and/or income. Health disparit ies among these groups are driven in part by deleterious socioenvironmental conditions and behavioral risk factors, and in part by systematic biases that often result in unequal, inferior treatment (IOM, 2003b). Limited English proficiency \u2014The number of people living in the United States with limited English proficiency is increasing (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). To be effective, care and health information must be acce ssible and offered in a manner that is understandable, as well as culturally relevant (IOM, 2004a; Joint Commission, 2007). While there are national standards for linguisti cally and culturally relevant health care services, the rapid growth of diverse populat ions with limited English proficiency and varying cultural and health practices is emerging as an increasingly complex challenge that few health care providers and organiza tions are currently prepared to handle (HHS Office of Minority Health, 2007). PRIMARY CONCERNS IN HE ALTH CARE REFORM: QUALITY, ACCESS, AND VALUE In the search for solutions to improve the hea lth care system, experts target three primary concerns: quality, access, and cost or value (Goldman and McGlynn, 2005). Substantial reforms designed to reshape and realign the major features of the entire health care system are needed to redress deficiencies in these three areas. Quality Despite unsustainable growth in health care spending in the United States (discussed below), the care received by individuals can often be too much, too lit tle, too late, or too haphazard. Moreover, substantial geographic variations exist in the intens ity of care provided across the nation, with attendant differences in quality, as well as cost (Fisher et al., 2009). The quality improvement movement in health care has grow n significantly since the publication of two IOM reports: To Err Is Human: Buildi ng a Safer Health System and Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2000, 2001). These reports helped shift discussions about quality away fr om assigning all responsibility a nd accountability to individual health professionals. They showed that improving quality requires an unde rstanding of how such elements as systems and processes of care, eq uipment design, and organizational structure can fundamentally enhance or detract from the quality of care. Researchers also have emphasized the importance of building interprofessional teams and establishing collaborative cultures to identify and sustain continuous improvements in the quality of care (Kim et al., 2010; Knaus et al., 1986; Pronovost et al., 2008). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSTUDY CONTEXT 2-3 Access Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provi des insurance coverage for an additional 32 million Americans, millions of Americans will still lack coverage in 2019 (CBO, 2010). Even for those with insurance, out-of-pocket expenses , such as deductibles and copays, as well as limited coverage for necessary services and medicat ions, create financial burdens that can limit access to care (Doty et al., 2005; Himmelstein et al., 2009). Other significant barriers to access include a lack of providers who are accepting new patients, especially those covered by Medicaid; a lack of providers who offer appointments outside of typical business hours; and for some a lack of transportation to and from a ppointments. Also hindering access is the above- discussed rapid growth of populations with lim ited English proficiency (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010), as well as limited health literacy among fluent English speakers. Value The term \"value\" has different meanings in diffe rent contexts. For the purposes of this report, the committee uses the following definition: \"value in health care is expr essed as the physical health and sense of well-being achieved rela tive to the cost \" (IOM Roundtable on Evidence- Based Medicine, 2008). As one of the major co mponents of value\u2014quality\u2014is discussed above, this section focuses on cost. The United States spends more than a ny other nation\u201416.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2008\u2014on health care (CMS, 2010a). Yet this investment is not matched by superlative health care outcomes (OECD, 2010), indicating deficien cies in the value of some aspects of the health care system. Moreover, while the United States spends too much on certain aspects of health care, such as hospital services and diagnostic te sts, spending on other aspects is disproportionately low. For exampl e, public health repres ents less than 3 per cent of health care spending (CMS, 2010b). Health care spending is responsible for large, an d ultimately unsustainable, structural deficits in the federal budget (Dodaro, 2008), and many economi sts believe that risi ng health care costs are a principal reason why wages have increased so little in recent years (Emanuel and Fuchs, 2008). However, establishing and sustaining legislat ed cost controls and health care savings has proven elusive. Challenges with regard to co sts and spending make achieving value within the health care system difficult. Throughout its deliberations, the committee found it useful to focus on ensuring that the health care system delivers good va lue rather than focusing sole ly on cost. Accordingly, the committee paid particular attention to high-va lue innovations in nursing care that provide quality, patient-centered care at a lower price. Three specific examples are featured as case studies later in this chapter. PRINCIPLES FOR CHANGE The challenges faced by the U.S. health care system have been described and documented in recent years by many government agencies, res earchers, policy analysts, and health professionals. From this work, a consensus has begun to emerge regarding some of the fundamental principles that should guide cha nges to meet these challenges. Broadly, the consensus is that care in the United States must become more patient centered; primary care and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html2-4 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH prevention must play a greater ro le relative to specialty care; care must be delivered more often within the community setting and even in peopl e's homes; and care needs to be coordinated and provided seamlessly across health co nditions, settings, and providers. It is also important that all providers practice to the fullest extent allowed by their education, training, and competencies and collaborate so that improvements can be achieved in both their own and each other's performance. This section provides an overview of these shifts in thinking and practice that a growing number of health care expe rts believe should be at the core of any proposed health care solutions. The Need for Patient-Centered Care Health care research is demonstrating the benefi ts of reorganizing the delivery of health care services around what makes the most sense fo r patients (Delbanco et al., 2001; Hibbard, 2004; Sepucha et al., 2004). As outlined in Crossing the Quality Chasm , patient-centered care is built on the principle that individuals should be the fi nal arbiters in deciding what type of treatment and care they receive (IOM, 2001). Yet practice still is usually organized around what is most convenient for the provider, the payer, or the he alth care organization and not for the patient. Patients are repeatedly asked, for example, to cha nge their expectations a nd schedules to fit the needs of the system. They are required to provide the same information to multiple caregivers or in sequential visits to the same provider. Primary care appointments typically are not available outside of work hours. The counseling, education, and coaching needed to help patients make informed decisions have historically been given insufficient a ttention (Hibbard, 2004). Additionally, patients' insu rance policies often limit their choice of provider, especially if the provider is not a physician (Craven and Ober, 2009) . Box 2-1 presents an example of how one health system, the University of Pittsburgh Me dical Center, has implemented a truly patient- centered program. How Patient-Centered Care Improves Quality, Access, and Value A number of studies have linke d patient-centered and quality care (Sepucha et al., 2004). For example, studies that compared surgery with watchful waiting for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia showed how strong a role patient pr eference played in determining quality of life (Barry et al., 1988; Fowler et al., 1988; Wennberg et al., 198 8). Likewise, involving patients more directly in the management of their own condition was found to result in significant improvements in health outcomes for individua ls with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Re search Group, 1993). By 2001, so many different studies had found similar results that Crossing the Quality Chasm identified patient-centered care as one of six pillars on which a 21st-century heal th care system should be built (the others being safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity) (IOM, 2001). One of the hallmarks of patient-centered care is improving access to care, a key component of which is access to information. For example, a growing number of patients have greater access to their own laboratory results and dia gnostic writeups about their procedures through such electronic forums as personal health reco rds and patient portals. Many people participate in online communities to learn more about or even how to manage their own conditions. Improving access also requires delivering care in a cultura lly relevant and appropriate manner so that patients can contribute positively to their own care.

Josie responded well to treatment at first, but her condition quickly deteriorated. When her mother, Sorrel King, ex pressed concern, the staff nurses and physicians repeatedly dismissed them, and 2 days before her sc heduled discharge Josie died. The cause was dehydration and a wrongly administered opioid\u2014the re sult of a series of errors the hospital acknowledged. Ms. King has since devoted herself to the eliminat ion of medical errors, founding the Josie King Foundation (www.josieking.org) and addressing clinicians, policy makers, and consumers on the importance of creating a \"culture of safety.\" And the need is pressing. According to a 2000 Institute of Medicine report, up to 98,000 people die from medical erro rs each year (IOM, 2000); nearly 10 years after that report's publication, despite improved patient-safety systems, a 2009 report gave a grade of C+ to efforts to empower patients to prevent errors (Wachter, 2009). Tami Minnier, MSN, RN, FACHE, heard Ms. King spea k in 2005, and the message was clear: if the staff had listened to her mother's concerns, Josie would have lived. \"When I came back to work the following Monday,\" said Ms. Minnier, at the time chief nursing officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) at Shadyside, \"I told my ch ief medical officer, 'We're going to let patients and families call a rapid-response team'\u2014a group of staff who are designated by the hospital to respond immediately to other staff's requests for help with crit ical or emergency patient situations. He thought I was insane.\" Shadyside had been one of the first three hospitals to participate in Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB), an initiative of the Institute for Heal thcare Improvement (IHI) and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, enabling front-line nurses to test their ideas for improving the safety and quality of care. Ms. Minnier called on Sorrel King to work with the nu rses in Shadyside's TCAB unit in creating what they called Condition H (or Condition Help). They inte rviewed patients and families about when and why they might call for a rapid-response team, consisting of a nurse administrator, a physician, a staff nurse, and a patient advocate who would convene immediately in response to a patient's or visitor's call. They held drills with staff, and within 6 months, Condition H went live in the hospital's TCAB unit. While some staff feared that pati ents would abuse the hotline, that concern was not borne out. Today, patients and families throughout UPMC's 13 acute ca re hospitals can use Condition H. They receive information on how to make the call (dial 3131 and say, \"Condition H\") during admission and through posters, a video, and stickers placed on patients' phones. Ms. Minnier is now chief quality officer at UPMC a nd monitors the use of Condition H. At Shadyside, a 500-bed hospital, two or three calls are made each month, and only a few patients have called twice during the same admission. An analysis of the 45 calls made in the first 17 months showed that inadequately managed pain was the most frequent impet us for calls, and more than 60 percent of the calls led to interventions that were deemed in strumental in preventing a patient-safety event. Condition H is spreading and serves as one exam ple of the changes hospitals have adopted using TCAB methods. Reports on TCAB have shown that it generates improved outcomes, greater patient and family satisfaction, and reduced tur nover of nurses (Hassmiller, 2009). Sorrel King addressed medical and nursing students at an IHI-sponsored event in 2009 and spoke strongly in favor of Condition H. \"Had I been able to push a button for a rapid-response team, that team would have come, they would have assessed Josie and... said one thing: the child is thirsty,\" Ms. King said. \"They would have given her a drink, and she never would have died\" (King, 2009).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html2-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Fewer studies have examined the economic va lue of patient-centere d care. One such study found that offering a nurse advice phone number and a pediatric af ter-hours clinic resulted in a 17 percent decrease in emergency department visits (Wilson, 2005). Yet there is no reason to believe that enhancing patient-centered care will or even should al ways lead to lower costs. For example, truly patient-centered approaches to care may require new programs or additional services that go beyond current standards of practice. Nurses and Patient-Centered Care Nurses have long emphasized patient-centered care. The case study in Box 2-2 provides but one example\u2014the patient-centered approach of mi dwifery care at the Family Health and Birth Center (FHBC) in Washington, DC. Through the FHBC, mothers-to-be w ho often have little control over their own lives develop a sense of control over on e very important part of their lives. From such modest beginnings, many more hopeful futures have been launched. BOX 2-2 Nurse Midwives and Birth Centers THE MIDWIFERY MODEL OF MATERNITY CARE GIVES MOTHERS CONTROL AND IMPROVES OUTCOMES Midwifery teaches you that the woman is the most im portant person in the relationship and that's why you should listen to her and try to give her what she wants and what she needs. \u2014Ruth Watson Lubic, EdD, CNM, FAAN, founde r, Family Health and Birth Center When Wendy Pugh delivered her first child at age 30 in a Washington, DC, hospital in 1999, her labor was induced\u2014not out of medical necessity, she said, but because \"there was a scheduling issue with the doctor.\" She didn't question the obstetrician's decision at the time, but when she got pregnant again, she polled her friends and discovered that many had ha d cesarean sections. When she asked why, few gave medical reasons. She decided she wanted \"a more organic process.\" Seven months into her second pregnancy, Ms. Pugh arrived at the Family Health and Birth Center (FHBC) in northeast Washington, DC (www.yourfhbc.org), where certified nurse midwives provide pre- and postnatal care and assist with labor and delivery wi th little technological intervention. Delivery takes place at a homelike freestanding bi rth center or at a nearby hospita l, depending on the woman's choice, her health, and such factors as whether she is homeless. The FHBC accepts Medicaid and private insurance and offers a sliding-scale fee for those ineligible for Medicaid. No one is turned away. Ruth Watson Lubic, EdD, CNM, opened the FHBC in 2000 in response to the disproportionately high rates of infant and maternal death, cesarean sect ion, and premature birth among poor and minority women in Washington, DC. In 2009 the infant mortality rate in the city was 12.22 per 1,000 live births, far exceeding that of any state in the nation (Heron et al., 2007). Nationwide, nearly four times as many black as white infants die as a result of premature birth or low birth weight (HRSA, 2006). Dr. Lubic had already founded the first freestanding birth center in the co untry (in 1975 in New York City) and has dedicated her career to reducing disparities in birth outcomes. \"We' re hoping to serve as a model for the whole country,\" Dr. Lubic said. There are now 195 such centers in the United States. Ms. Pugh's case highlights the differences between the midwifery model of care, which promotes maternal and infant health, and the obstetrics model, which anticipates complications. During the hospital delivery of her first child, Ms. Pugh received pitoci n to induce labor, saw her newborn for just a few moments before the child was taken away, and did not breastfeed until the second day. In contrast, during the delivery of her third child\u2014her second de livery at the FHBC\u2014she received assistance during labor from a doula, a trained volunteer who provided coaching and massage; her newborn was placed on her chest immediately after the birth; mother and ch ild went home within hours of delivery; and when the infant showed difficulties with breastfeeding, a peer lactation counselor went to their home.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSTUDY CONTEXT 2-7 Two systematic reviews have found that women give n midwifery care are more likely to have shorter labors, spontaneous vaginal births without hospitali zation, less perineal trauma, higher breastfeeding rates, and greater satisfaction with their bi rths (Hatem et al., 2008; Hodnett et al., 2007). Unpublished FHBC data show that, compared with all African Am erican women giving birth in Washington, DC, women giving birth at the center have almost half the rate of cesarean sections, one-third the rate of births at less than 37 weeks' gestation, and half the rate of low-birth-weight newborns. The lower rates of complications added up to an estimated $1,231,000 in savings in 2005\u2014 more than the cost of operating the center that year. The FHBC reports a 100 percent breastfeeding rate among women giving birth at the center. Obstacles to widespread use of the FHBC model incl ude the fact that Medicaid does not always pay midwives at birth centers at the rate paid to obstetricians for vaginal deliveries. Also, the high cost of malpractice insurance has forced some such center s to close, although nurse midwives have shown a lower risk of malpractice suits than that among obstetricians (Xu et al., 2008a, 2008b). At age 83 Dr. Lubic has faced opposition to the mi dwifery model for decades. \"There's this hangover from the days when midwives functioned on their own in communities,\" she said. Even so, the enthusiasm of the FHBC's midwives is unflagging. Among the benefits of midwifery care, Lisa Betina Uncles, MSN, CNM, who attended Ms. Pugh's two births at the FHBC, highlighted one that cannot be easily measured. \"A lot of our moms in the neighbo rhood don't have much control over their lives,\" she said. \"This is something they have control over.\" Ms. Pugh agreed. \"It was kind of a partnership,\" she said of her two FHBC births, \"but they also let me guide the ship.\" The Need for Stronger Primary Care Services Consensus is also strong on the need to make primary (rather than specialty) care a greater part of the health car e system. Despite steps taken by th e ACA to support the provision of primary care, however, the shortage of primary care providers is projected to worsen in the United States in the coming years (Bode nheimer and Pham, 2010; Doherty, 2010). Primary care has been described in many ways . The IOM has defined it as \"the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a su stained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community\" (IOM, 1996). Starfield and colleagues identify the functions of primary care as \"f irst-contact access for each new need; long-term person- (not disease) focused car e; comprehensive care for most health needs; and coordinated care when it must be sought elsewhere\" (Starfield et al., 2005). Similarly, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has cited the followi ng hallmarks of primary care: preventive care, care coordination for chronic illnesses, and cont inuity of care (Steinwa ld, 2008). Thus primary care is closely tied to two of the principles for change discussed below\u2014the need to deliver more care in the community and the need for seamless, coordinated care. How Primary Care Improves Quality, Access, and Value Countries that build their hea lth care systems on the cornerston e of primary care have better health outcomes and more equitable access to care than those that do not (Starfield et al., 2005). However, primary care plays a less central role in the U.S. health care system than many health policy experts believe it should (Bodenheimer , 2006; 2005; Steinw ald, 2008). Geographic variations nationwide illustrate the importance of primary care. Regions of the United States with a higher ratio of generalists to specialists provide more effective care at lowe r cost (Baicker and Ch andra, 2004), and studies have shown that those states with a greater ratio of primary care providers to the general population experience lower mort ality rates for all causes of death (Shi, 1992, 1994).

Yet primary care services have been so difficult to access in parts of the United States that one in five adults has sought no nurgent care at an emergency department (IOM, 2009). Nurses and Primary Care Nurses with varying levels of education and pr eparation play important roles in primary care. Health promotion, education, and assessment are essential components of primary care that are also traditional strengths of the nursing profession; these serv ices may be provided by either registered nurses (RNs) or advanced practice re gistered nurses (APRNs). RNs provide primary care services across the spectrum of health care settings\u2014from acute care to home care to public health and community care. As visiting or home health nurses, RNs are positioned to identify new health problems or needs, such as medication education, prevention services, or nutrition counseling. In public health clin ics, they may provide community assessments, developmental screenings, or disease surveilla nce. RNs in acute care settings may identify new health care problems and needs as they care for patients and their families. The range of possibilities for RNs providing primary care is signif icant, and their capacity for filling these roles is not always recognized. APRNs, especially nurse practitioners (NPs), also provide pr imary care services across all levels of the health care system. In many situations , NPs provide care that is comparable in scope to that provided by primary care physicians. As discussed in Chapter 3, in many situations, APRNs are qualified to diagnose po tential and actual health problems, develop treatment plans, in some case prescribe medication, and create team s of providers to help manage the needs and care of patients and their families. APRNs are educated to refer patients to physicians or other providers when necessary. Box 2-3 illustrates how one NP provides primary care both in a school, where she is required by the school district regulations to do less than she is trained to do, and in a low-cost clinic, where she may practice to the full extent of her training and licensure. Chapter 3 examines in detail why NPs, and more broadly APRNs, are of ten limited by regulations in the extent of the health services they may provide. The Need to Deliver More Care in the Community Care in the community\u2014defined as those plac es where individuals live, work, play, and study\u2014encompasses care that is provided in such settings as community and public health centers, long-term care and assi sted-living facilities, retail clinics, homes, schools, and community centers. While acute care medical fac ilities will always be needed, the delivery of primary care and other health services in the community must grow significantly if the U.S. health care system is to be both widely acces sible and sustainable Copyright \u00a9 Academy of Sciences.

The school nurse is the only person they may see who ca n guide them and tell them where to go for resources for their health needs. So we are a good inve stment for the school district and community. \u2014Carolina Sandoval, PNP, RN, sc hool nurse, Chino Hills, California \"Did you eat breakfast?\" This is often the first question school nurse Carolina Sandoval, MSN, PNP, RN, asks a student who comes to her office complaining of a stomachache. Usually, the child says no, and Ms. Sandoval takes the opportunity to discuss the value of a nutritious breakfast. \"I give them a little speech,\" she said, \"and then I give them a little snack.\" What might sound like a simple interaction is anythin g but simplistic. Ms. Sandoval's work at a junior high school and an elementary school in Chino H ills, California, draws on her graduate education and incorporates many aspects of nursi ng: patient and community education, child advocacy, public health, infectious disease monitoring, trauma care, chr onic illness management, nutritional counseling, reproductive health, and medication management, among others. School nurses may be among the unsung heroes of health care, but occasionally they take the spotlight. \"Hero,\" in fact, was how many described Mary P appas, BSN, RN, the school nurse who first alerted infectious disease authorities to the outbreak of in fluenza A (H1N1)\u2014swine flu\u2014at her New York City high school in April 2009 (Jacobson, 2009). Not only did Ms . Pappas's decisive action protect the thousands of children in her charge, but within days she had prompt ed a worldwide alert for what would soon be declared a pandemic. Yet even the smallest gesture, such as giving \"a littl e snack,\" corresponds to the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) definition of school nursing: \"nursing that advances the well-being, academic success and life-long achievement and health of student s.\" At the same time, Ms. Sandoval does not sugar coat the fact that most school di stricts, including her own, fail to meet the NASN and Healthy People 2010 recommendation of one nurse for every 750 healthy children. She is responsible for 2,000 children and works part time at each of the two schools. Indeed, California is 42nd on NASN's list of states ranked by student-to-registered nurse (RN) ratios, with 2,187 students for every school nurse (Vermont is first and Michigan is last, with 311 and 4,836 students per RN, respectively) (NASN, 2010). To fill the gap, some school districts hire non-nurse technicians, a move Ms. Sandoval said does not benef it students. She pointed out that nurses' skills in assessment and critical thinking come into play constantly in handling the conditions that affect students' ability to learn: obesity and chronic illness, vision defic its, behavioral problems, allergies, and asthma, to name the most common. Having moved to Southern California at age 15 from Mexico, where, she said, a school nurse would have been an unthinkable luxury, Ms. Sandoval has a parti cular appreciation of the school nurse's role as child advocate. She now acts as a spokespers on for NASN's Voices of Meningitis Campaign (www.voicesofmeningitis.org), sponsored by Sanofi Pa steur, a vaccine manufacturer. Preteens and teens are at the greatest risk for meningococcal meningitis, a preventable infection that can rapidly be fatal and is spread through utensil sharing or kissing. Through radio, television, and other venues, Ms. Sandoval teaches parents and children, in Spanish, about prevention, symptoms, and treatment. School district regulations do not permit Ms. Sandoval to use all of her skills as a nurse practitioner. She cannot diagnose or prescribe in the school, fo r example, even when children have symptoms of conjunctivitis or otitis media; she must refer them to other providers outside of the school. And because many of the children she sees come from uninsured families that may not have access to affordable care, she often refers families to a low-cost clinic wher e she works one evening a week as a nurse practitioner and can practice to the full extent of her training and licensure. Ms. Sandoval tells the story of another routine intervention, involvi ng a seventh-grader who was falling behind in his classes. She met with the boy and chec ked his vision; it was quite poor, and she gave his parents a certificate for a discounted eye exam and glasses. \"We cannot change t he whole world,\" she said. \"But maybe we can change one student. And someday that student is going to go to college, and he'll remember the school nurse who took the time to look at his eyes.\" PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html2-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Along with an emphasis on primary care, a key component of providing care in the community is a strong public health infrastructure to ensure the avai lability of a range of services that includes prevention, edu cation, communication, and surveillance. The public health infrastructure and workforce are vulnerable and perp etually face fiscal and political barriers. As a 2002 IOM report notes, \"public health infrastructure has suffered from political neglect and from the pressure of political agendas and public opini on that frequently override empirical evidence\" (IOM, 2002). The public health workforce, incl uding public health nurses, is aging rapidly. Between 20 and 50 percent of public health workers at the local, state, and national levels are eligible to retire in the next few years (ASPH, 2008; ASTHO, 2004; Perlino, 2006). Between 2008 and 2009, health departments at the local level lost 23,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 15 percent of their total workfo rce\u2014to recession-related layo ffs and attrition in 2008 and 2009 (NACCHO, 2010). The number of nurses employed in pub lic and community health settings underwent a marked decline from 18.3 percent of the RN workforce in 2000 to 15.2 percent in 2004 to 14.2 percent in 2008 (HRSA, 2010). The case study in Box 2-4 illustrates the value of nurses working in the public health sector, where ma ny more nurses are needed. BOX 2-4 Nurse Profile: Lisa Ayers A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE IN SCHENECTADY , NEW YORK, MAKING NEIGHBORHOODS HEALTHIER When I make home visits, I offer information on br eastfeeding, nutrition, and lead poisoning, and I do environmental assessments. It's definitely public health and nursing combined. \u2014Lisa Ayers, BSN, RN, public health nurse, Sc henectady County Public Health Services, Schenectady, New York Lisa Ayers, BSN, RN, could tell from her initial in spection of the apartment, with its chipped paint, exposed electrical wires, and mice , that the situation was serious. As a public health nurse with Schenectady County Public Health Services near Alb any, New York, she also quickly discerned that the deteriorating structure was not the onl y issue in need of her attention. Ms. Ayers' patient, a pregnant woman whose toddlers had high blood lead levels, learned about the link between asthma and cigarette smoke, the dangers of a broken electrical plate, and the importance of testing her smoke detectors. Ms. Ayers also talked with the woman about prenatal care, scheduled a lead inspection of the home, reported the mice and electr ical hazards to the city, and mailed a notice of the lead inspection to the landlord. \"It was a wonderful visit,\" Ms. Ayers said. \"Ver y productive.\" A lifelong Sc henectady native, she and her husband have reared three children there, and she has worked for 22 years as a public health nurse for the city and county health departments. She started out, as most nurses do, as a medical-surgical nurse, but after switching to home health care, she fo und it difficult to balance work and family demands and applied for a public health nursing position with the city. \"It was the best decision I ever made,\" she said. When she started in 1988, she and her 20 regi stered nurse (RN) coworkers cared for homebound older adults, pregnant women and infants, and patient s with infectious diseases. In 1991 the health department expanded to cover the county, and her work in the years since has encompassed well-infant care, primary care pediatrics, and environmental heal th. For seven years, she investigated communicable diseases in the community. Now, as one of the first nurses in the state to be certified as a lead risk inspector, she weaves environmental health into her practice. She assesses homes for sources of lead; works with landlords to fix problems; and supplies families with carbon monoxi de detectors, cabinet locks, nightlights, buckets, mops\u2014in short, anything they need to minimize hazards in their homes. At the same time, she is assessing the psychosocial aspects of families' heal th and helping them reduce tobacco use and prevent or control asthma. Ms. Ayers said, \"Being a nurse, I can answer a lot more questions about asthma, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSTUDY CONTEXT 2-11 medications, and inhalers than somebody who may not be a nurse.\" And she continues to take her turn as a home visitation nurse on weekends, seeing a child with leukemia, helping a new mother with breastfeeding, or checking on a newborn who is losing instead of gaining weight. Usually, the health department will ask a landlord for permission to inspect a home only if a child has a blood lead level of at least 15 mcg/dL. But that r equirement is waived for Healthy Neighborhoods, an initiative aimed at reducing environmental hazar ds in two zip codes\u201412307 and 12304\u2014that have had high lead-poisoning rates. Anyone living in these zip codes can request a free home assessment of air quality, asthma triggers, fire safety, and other heal th issues, and the assessment can be done without the landlord's permission. Ms. Ayers spends about 40 percent of her time on Healthy Neighborhoods and 60 percent on lead- poisoning prevention, and she finds ways to combine the work of the two programs. \"When I'm out there doing prevention for air quality with Healthy Neighborhoods, I also do a visual lead inspection in the home,\" she said. And she teaches families measures such as handwashi ng; letting water run from lead- soldered pipes before drinking; and eating foods high in iron and calcium and low in fat, which prevents lead absorption. The county has tracked cases of elevated blood lead levels in zip code 12307 for more than two decades. Since a peak of 34 cases in 1992, the number dropped to five or fewer annually from 2006 to 2009, according to unpublished data. Nurses' contributions to these outcomes are not lost on Richard Daines, MD, New York State's health commissioner, who shadowed Ms. Ayers shortly after he took office. \"He was very excited [by what he saw],\" said Ms. Ayers. \"I think they have recognized\u2014all the way up to the commissioner level\u2014what a nurse can bring to this position.\" Providing effective care in the community will require improvements in community infrastructures, resources, and the workforce. Hea lth care providers, including nurses, will need to form new partnerships with community l eaders and have strong community care-oriented competencies, such as the ability to devel op, implement, and assess culturally relevant interventions. How Care in the Community Impr oves Quality, Access, and Value In the 1990s, the state of New York pioneered quality assessment and improvement in the management of HIV/AIDS in community health clinics, drug treatment centers, and hospitals (New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, 2003). Th e program proved so successful that it soon became the model for a national effort at assessing and improving treatment and care for people with HIV (IOM, 2004b). Similarly, studies have found that improving nurse-to- student ratios in public schools re sults in higher immunization rates, increased vision screenings and more effective follow-up, and significant gain s in identifying asthma and life-threatening conditions. As more care moves from the acute to the community setting, quality measurement must expand to ensure that quality care is maintained throughout the transition. Investments in community care can improve access and value as well. In the 1990s, the Department of Veterans Affair s (VA) began shifting its programs from the acute care to the community setting, dramatically increasing the numb er of veterans who were able to access care (CBO, 2009; VA, 2003) while improving health out comes and lowering costs per patient (Asch et al., 2004; CBO, 2009; Jha et al., 2003; Kerr et al., 2004). Likewise, community health centers and nurse-managed health centers have provide d quality, high-value care in many socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Box 2-4 illustrates how one public health nurse provides infant care, primary care, environmental health services, and care to individuals with infectious diseases in the community. In another example, Lilian Wa ld founded the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY) in 1893 to help improve the hea lth and social outcomes of those with lesser means. Today, VNSNY is the largest nonprofit home health care agency in the United States (IOM, 2010). A growing number of nurses are embracing technology to ex pand care in the community. A study conducted in Florida showed that telehealth services brought directly to patients' communities and provided by nurses may increase access to care for children with special health care needs in rural, medically underserved parts of the state at no additional cost (Hooshmand, 2010). The alternative for these patients was to tr avel many miles, usually to an academic health center, to the site of a doctor's office. The Need for Seamless, Coordinated Care One of the major challenges facing the U.S. h ealth care system is its high degree of fragmentation. Nowhere is this fragmentation more evident than in the transitions patients must undergo among multiple providers or different servi ces for a single health problem. When care is seamless, these multiple aspects of care are coordinated to enhance the quality of care and the patient's experience of care. The ACA contains pr ovisions that address c oordination of care, but these initiatives are just the be ginning of what is needed. How Seamless, Coordinated Care Improves Quality, Access, and Value In 2003, the IOM singled out coordination of car e as indispensible to improving the quality of health care in the United States (IOM, 2003a). Likewise, the ACA highlights coordination of services as one of the required measures fo r reporting on the quality of care. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) also concluded that better coordination clearly improved the quality of beneficiaries' care. Pr oof that care coordination saves money was less apparent in part because measur ing cost savings is so difficult . Investments in care coordination for a group of people with diabetes, for exampl e, may take a long time to demonstrate cost savings because it can take years for poor glucose c ontrol to manifest itself as stroke, myocardial infarction, and other severe complications. However, the value of prev enting these outcomes, from both a quality-of-life and fina ncial perspective, is clear. One particularly compelling example of the multiple benefits of seamless care is the On Lok program\u2014an initiative that be gan in California in the 1970s (On Lok PACEpartners, 2006). Its successes inspired a new model of care\u2014the Prog ram of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), which now serves 19,000 frail older individuals in 31 states. 2 On Lok and the PACE programs that it inspired demonstrate that i nnovative programs that in tegrate care across the continuum can lead to synergistic improvements in quality, access, and value. The creativity and willingness to look beyond traditional solutions that animate these programs need to be adapted to other health care settings. 2 Personal communication, Shawn Bloom, President and CEO, National PACE Association, February 3, 2010.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSTUDY CONTEXT 2-13 Nurses and Seamless, Coordinated Care Coordinating care is one of th e traditional strengths of the nursing profession, whether in the community or the acute care setting. For example, an interprofessional research team funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, called the In terprofessional Nursing Quality Research Initiative (INQRI), developed a Staff Nurse Care Coordination model that f eatures six nurse care coordination activities regularly performed by staff nurses in hospital setti ngs as part of their daily activities\u2014mobilizing, exchanging, checkin g, organizing, assisting, and backfilling. Box 2-5 describes a program in the community setting called Living Independently for Life (LIFE), a PACE program in Pennsylvania that is led by nurse practitioners and provides interprofessional health services to low-income, fra il, chronically ill older adults who are eligible for nursing home care (LIFE, 2010). BOX 2-5 Living Independently for Elders (LIFE) NURSES SUPPORTING OLDER ADULTS TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY The nurses are picking up subtle signs that could le ad to deteriorating health\u2014a slight fever or fluid retention\u2014and because they're seeing the patient two or three times a week, they act on it quickly and prevent a further problem. \u2014Eileen M. Sullivan-Marx, PhD, FAAN, RN, associate dean for practice and community affairs, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing In 2002, when Lillie Mashore was in her late 50s, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Just a year later her diabetes was so severe she had to be placed in intensive care. Too ill in December 2003 to return to the West Philadelphia home she shared with her husband, who had cancer, she entered a nursing home. She was greeted there with the word s, \"You're going to leave here in a body bag.\" But Ms. Mashore defied that prediction. In April 2005 she went home and spent the last year of her husband's life with him. With the support of the Livi ng Independently for Elders (LIFE) program, she is still at home, receiving help twice a day from visiting nurses and aides and attending LIFE's adult day care center 3 days a week. \"I'm limited to certain things,\" Ms. Mashore, no w age 66, said of her recovered independence. \"But I can wash dishes. I didn't think I could do that. I was so proud when I washed those dishes.\" Ms. Mashore is one of the nearly 700 elderly Philadelphians eligible for nursing home admission who have stayed in their homes with the help of LIFE\u2014a program that provides all primary and specialty care services to low-income, frail, chronically ill older adults (age 55 or older). A bout 95 percent of members are African American. Nurse practitioner-led teams include nurses, physicians, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, nurses' aides, and drivers. Although home care is available for LIFE members like Ms. Mashore who need help managing household tasks or medications, it is not the primary focus. Many services are provided at the LIFE adult day care center, and groups take outings, such as to Phillies baseball games or a nearby Dave and Buster's restaurant. (Roughly 20 bed-bound members re ceive all LIFE services at home.) Also available are respite care for family caregivers, transportation to the center, and a \"circle of care\" for people with dementia. About 185 members are at the center each day. As for outcomes, LIFE keeps nearly 90 percent of its members out of nursing homes, according to unpublished data. LIFE also reports reduced rates of falls, pressure ulcers, pr eventable hospitalizations, and emergency room visits among members (LIFE, 2010). LIFE is one of 72 programs in 31 states that are part of the Program for All-Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE)\u2014a model of care begun in San Francisco in the 1970s that is now a national network offering services to elderly Medicare and Medicaid beneficiari es\u2014and it is the only PACE program to be affiliated with a school of nursing, the University of Pennsyl vania's. (See the websites of LIFE [www.lifeupenn.org] PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The team makes all care decisions, including some that might seem unconventional, such as buying an air conditioner for a member with asthma. Despite potential financial barriers\u2014some might deem the $2 million required to start a PACE program prohibitive, and some private insurers do no t cover PACE services\u2014LIFE is fiscally sound. \"We operate on a shoestring, to a degree. But we operate re sponsibly, and we get the money we need to run the program,\" said Eileen M. Sullivan-Marx, PhD, RN , FAAN, associate dean for practice and community affairs at the University of Pennsyl vania School of Nursing. She also said that the state saves 15 cents on every dollar spent on LIFE members who would other wise be in nursing homes. The program makes up about 41 percent of the nursi ng school's operating budget (Sullivan-Marx et al., 2009). Ms. Mashore is quite clear that the program has st rengthened her ability to care for herself. When a nurse suggested that she not use her electric wh eelchair because using a manual one would strengthen her arms, Ms. Mashore was angry at first. \"But I see what she's saying,\" Ms. Mashore said. \"My arms are very strong. I pull my own self up in the bed. I can do things that I couldn't do when I was in the nursing home.\" In acute care settings, care coordination is showing particular promise in efforts to reduce rehospitalizations. All 15 demons tration program sites under th e Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration program, for example, adopted in terventions that relied on nurses as care coordinators (Peikes et al., 2009) . Box 2-6 provides an in-depth look at the Transitional Care Model, developed by nursing researcher Mary Na ylor. This model was designed to facilitate patients' transitions within and across settings and to break the cycle of acute flare-ups of chronic illness. The protocol goes beyond usual case management and home care by employing an APRN who is proficient in comprehensive in -hospital assessment, evaluation of medications, coordination of complex care, and in-home follow- up. By collaborating with the patient, family caregivers, specialists, primary care providers, and others, this nurse works to improve the management of multiple complex chronic conditions and thus reduce readmissions. The Need for Reconceptualized Roles for Health Professionals Many of the roles health professionals are being called upon to fill in the evolving U.S. health care system are not tech nically new. Nurses, physicians, and pharmacists, for example, have educated patients, helped coordinate care, and collaborated with other clinicians for decades. What is new is the extent and the centrality of these roles. Previous IOM studies have found that systemwide changes are necessary to meet higher standards for quality care, the growing requirements of an aging population, and the need to deliver more care in the community setting. Crossing the Quality Chasm introduced the idea of the advisability of expanding the scope of practice for many health workers (IOM, 2001). Retooling for an Aging America advised that meeting the needs of the growing geriatric population would require expanding the roles of health professionals \"beyond the traditional scope of practice\" (IOM, 2008).

The Transitional Care Model is one approach to change the system to be more responsive to their needs. \u2014Mary D. Naylor, PhD, RN, FAAN, developer of the TCM Mary Manley was accustomed to her independence. Having lived for many year s on her own in North Philadelphia, worked until age 74, and cared for her infant great-granddaughter in her early 80s, she was undaunted by a diagnosis of diabetes in late 2007. \"I di dn't have to go to doctors too much,\" she said. \"I was perfectly healthy, doing anything I wanted to do \u2014\"until 2009, that is, when 'the sickness' came.\" \"The sickness\" was, in fact, many chronic conditions (among them hypertension, mild cognitive impairment, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and two life-threatening acute conditions. The latter conditions\u2014pneumonia and pancolitis, an intestinal inflammation caused by Clostridium difficile , a \"superbug\" that is often resistant to treatment\u2014required hospitalization. Ms. Manley received vancomycin intravenously for the C. difficile for two weeks as an inpatient. She was discharged on a Thursday afternoon with a prescr iption for oral vancomycin that her niece dropped off at a neighborhood pharmacy. But on Friday the phar macy claimed not to have received the order and refused to dispense the drug. While hospitalized, Ms. Manley had met a transitio nal care nurse, Ellen McPartland, MSN, APRN, BC, who made a home visit on Friday. When she hear d about the potentially grave delay in antibiotic therapy, she called the pharmacy immediately, demanding to speak with a supervisor. The pharmacy dispensed enough medication to get Ms. Manley through the weekend at home until the full amount could be obtained on Monday\u2014an outcome that prevented immediate rehospitalization and may have saved Ms. Manley's life. According to a recent study, 20 percent of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days of discharge and 34 percent within 90 days, at an estimated cost in 2004 of \"$17.4 billion of the $102.6 billion in hospital payments from Medicare\" (J encks et al., 2009). Among innovations aimed at reducing rehospitalization rates, the Transitional Care Model (TCM) relies on an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN), like Ms. McPartland, who meet s with the patient and family caregivers during a hospitalization to devise a plan for managing chroni c illnesses (see www.transitionalcare.info). But the model involves more than discharge planning and home care, said TCM developer Mary D. Naylor, PhD, RN, FAAN, a professor of gerontology and director of the NewCourtland Center for Transitions and Health at the University of Pennsylva nia. The first step is for the APRN to help the patient and family set goals during hospitalization. The nurse identifies the reasons for the patient's instability, designs a plan of care that addresses them, and co ordinates various care providers and services. The APRN then visits the home within 48 hours of discharge and provides telephone and in-person support as often as needed for up to 3 months . Assessing and counseling patients and accompanying them to medical appointments are aimed at helping pati ents and caregivers to learn the early signs of an acute problem that might require immediate help and to better manage patients' health care. Also essential is ensuring the presence of a primary ca re provider. \"Patients might have six or seven specialists, but nobody who's taking care of the big picture,\" Dr. Naylor said. In three randomized controlled trials of Medicare ben eficiaries with multiple chronic illnesse s, use of the TCM lengthened the period between hospital discharge and readmission or death and resulted in a reduction in the number of rehospitalizations (N aylor, 1994; Naylor et al., 1999, 2004). The average annual savings was $5,000 per patient. Until now, transitional care has not been covered by Medicare and private insurers. But the Affordable Care Act sets aside $500 million to fund pilot projects on transitional care services for \"high-risk\" Medicare beneficiaries (such as those with multiple chronic conditions and hospital readmissions) at certain hospitals and community organizations over a 5-year per iod.

Now age 85, Ms. Manley takes eight medications regularly, and with the help of Ms. McPartland and a new primary care team is spending more time with family and attending church again. Said Ms. McPartland, \"Of all the roles I have had in nursing, this brings it all together. To see them going from so sick to back home and stable\u2014the Transitional Ca re Model speaks to what nurses really do.\" In light of these considerations, the committee concludes that nurses, in concert with other health professionals, need to adopt reconceptualiz ed roles as care coordinators, health coaches, and system innovators. This chapter has alrea dy provided examples of nurses working as care coordinators; the following s ubsections elaborate on what the committee means by health coaches and system innovators. Fill ing these roles, whether in entry-level nursing or advanced practice, will require that nurses receive greater education and preparation in leadership, care management, quality improvement processes, and systems thinking\u2014a subject discussed in Chapter 4. Nurses as Health Coaches The committee envisions a health care system in which all individuals have a health coach who helps stay them healthy. The coach ensure s that they understand why their primary care provider\u2014whether a physician, physician assist ant, or NP\u2014has recommended a particular course of treatment. He/she coordinates pati ents' care with multiple providers so that, for example, an elderly grandfather with diabetes, arth ritis, and heart disease can continue to live at home and avoid costly hospitaliza tions. The role of health coach has much in common with case management services, but it goes even further. The coach educates family, friends, and other informal caregivers about how they can help, addr essing not just physical needs but also social, environmental, mental, and emotional factors that may promote or interfer e with the maintenance of health. The coach helps overcome features in the health care system that may lead to inequities in care delivery. He/she also stays involv ed with patients if they enter the hospital and coordinates transitional services with APRNs and other care providers after discharge. Given all these job requirements, the health coach most of ten will be an RN. Box 2-7 presents a case study in which baccalaureate-trained RNs serve as health coaches for women who are first-time mothers and may be at risk of a busing or neglecting their children. Nurses as System Innovators 3 One of the fundamental insights of the quality improvement movement is that all health professionals should both perform their current work well and continuously look for ways to make their performance and that of the larger sy stem better. Or as one nurse told a physician 20 years ago in a course on health care improvement , \"I see. You're saying that I have two jobs: doing my job and making my job better\" (Berwick, 2010). 3 This section draws on a paper commissioned by the co mmittee on \"Preparing Nurses for Participation in and Leadership of Continual Improvement,\" by Donald M. Berwick, Institute for Healthcare Improvement (see Appendix I on CD-ROM). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

I wouldn't get out of the house at all. She's helped me to be strong, to know that I can actually make it by myself and be a very good mom. \u2014Crystalon Rodrigue, 21-year-old Louisiana client of the Nurse-Family Partnership In 2007 Crystalon Rodrigue, a recent high school graduate living in St. James, Louisiana, had an adverse reaction to an injectable contraceptive. She discontinued it and soon got pregnant. She was 19 years old and unemployed and living with her moth er, and her relationship with her boyfriend was faltering. She turned to the state department of heal th; was referred to the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP); and met \"Miss Tina,\" a nurse who visited her at home. \"In the beginning of my pregnancy, and maybe all thr oughout, I was a little stressed out,\" the 21-year- old Ms. Rodrigue said recently. \"I was depressed be cause I was having relationship problems with my child's father. Miss Tina helped me....\" Ms. Rodrigue was interrupted by the chatter of her 19-month-old daughter, Nalayia, who was learning to read, her mother said with pride. Then she continued, \"Miss Tina helped me to think about myself.\" It was a quiet, almost offhand remark, but it represent s the kind of shift in attitude that the NFP has helped foster among young women for more than 30 year s. Now active in 375 counties in 29 states, the NFP sends registered nurses (RNs), usually with ba ccalaureate degrees, into the homes of at-risk, low- income, first-time mothers for 64 planned visits over the course of a pregnancy and the child's first 2 years. Improving the lives of children is the chief aim of the NFP, yet the interventions target mothers. The nurse discusses options for the mother's continued edu cation and economic self-sufficiency; supports her in reducing or quitting smoking or drinking; teaches her about child development, nonviolent discipline, and breastfeeding; and helps her make decisions about family planning. The nurse does this by engaging the mother in a relationship that provides a model fo r interactions with others. The child's father and other family members are encouraged to participate. \"We don't look for the great big change,\" said Luwana Marts, BSN, RN, regional nurse consultant for the NFP in Louisiana. \"A part of the model is that only a small change is necessary. So if a client never quits smoking but she doesn't smoke in the presence of her child, that's a plus.\" In case-controlled, longitudinal trials conducted am ong racially and ethnically diverse populations\u2014 beginning in 1977 in Elmira, New York, and continuing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Denver, Colorado\u2014 the NFP has shown reductions in unintended second pregnancies and increases in mothers' employment. Children of mothers visited by nurse s are less likely to be abused and by age 15 to be arrested. (For links to these and other studies of t he NFP, visit www.nursefam ilypartnership.org/proven- results/published-research.) The per-child cost is $9,118; for the highest-risk children, a return of $5.70 per dollar spent is realized (Karoly et al., 2005). Several models of home visitation are in use, but the NFP relies on trained RNs for its interventions. A 2002 study compared home visits by untrained \"paraprofessionals\" and nurses. On almost all measures, the nurses produced far stronger outcome s (Olds et al., 2002). \"People trust nurses,\" said Ruth A. O'Brien, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor of nurs ing at the University of Colorado in Denver and an author of the study. \"Low-income, minority people who have not had a lot of trust in the health care system might be willing to let a nurse in the door.\" Barriers to implementation include the fact that states use various sources to fund the NFP, and in some the funding is limited. The Affordable Care Act mandates that $1.5 billion be spent over 5 years on home visitation programs for at-risk mothers and infants*\u2014substantially less than the $8.5 billion over 10 years that President Obama requested in his 201 0 budget (OMB, 2010). While the act establishes a federal agency to oversee such home visitation prog rams, it does not specify that nurses provide the care. Also, some municipalities increase the nurse's caseload beyond the recommended 25, diminishing the intensity and effectiveness of the interventions.

She had completed a certified nursing assistant program while pregnant and will soon start nursing school, in which she had enrolled but quit shortly after high school. \"I wasn't ready for it,\" she said. \"But now I have a child and I know what to expect. I feel like I'm ready. I want to better myself.\" ___________________ *Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , HR 3590 \u00a7 2951, 111th Congress. The nursing profession is well pos itioned to produce system innovators. A few years ago, the Institute for Healthcare Improveme nt (IHI) launched a national proj ect to reduce patient injuries, called the \"100,000 Lives Campaign.\" The project translated the aims of safety and effectiveness into operational form as \"bundles\" of care pro cedures (Berwick et al ., 2006; McCannon et al., 2006), such as the Central Line Bundle to pr event catheter-associated bloodstream infections. Hundreds of hospitals reported success in te rms of improved patient outcomes. Recurrent patterns of success included act ively engaged nurses supported in standardizing their own processes of care according to the IHI bundles and empowered and supported in monitoring and enforcing those standards across disciplines, including with thei r physician colleagues (Berwick et al., 2006). Encouraged to i nnovate locally to adap t changes to local contexts, nurses proved the ideal leaders for changing care syst ems and raising the bar on results. One new role for nurses that ta ps their potential as innovators is the clinical nurse leader (CNL), an advanced generalist c linician role designed to improve clinical and cost outcomes for specific groups of patients. Responsible for coordinating care and in some cases actively providing direct care in complex situations, the CNL has the responsibility for translating and pplying research findings to design, implement, and evaluate car e plans for patients (AACN, 2007). This new role has been adopted by the VA system. The Need for Interprofessional Collaboration The need for greater interprofessional collabo ration has been emphasized since the 1970s. Studies have documented, for example, the extent to which poor communication and lack of respect between physicians and nur ses lead to harmful outcomes for patients (Rosenstein and O'Daniel, 2005; Zwarenstein et al., 2009). Conversely, a growing body of evidence links effective teams to better patient outcomes and mo re efficient use of resources (Bosch et al., 2009; Lemieux-Charles and McGuire, 2006; Zw arenstein et al., 2009), while good working relationships between physicians and nurses ha ve been cited as a factor in improving the retention of nurses in hospitals (Kovner et al ., 2007). As the delivery of care becomes more complex across a wide range of settings, a nd the need to coordinate care among multiple providers becomes ever more important, deve loping well-functioning teams becomes a crucial objective throughout the health care system. Differing professional perspectives\u2014with atte ndant differences in training and philosophy\u2014 can be beneficial. Nurses are taught to treat the patient not only from a disease management perspective but also from psychosocial, spir itual, and family and community perspectives. Physicians are experts in physiol ogy, disease pathways, and treatmen t. Social workers are trained in family dynamics. Occupational and physical therapists focus on improving the patient's functional capacity. Licensed practical nurses provide a deeply ground-level perspective, given their routine of measuring vita l signs and assisting patients in feeding, bathing, and movement. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlSTUDY CONTEXT 2-19 All these perspectives can enhance patients' well-being\u2014provided the various professionals keep the patient and family at the center of their attention. Finding the right balance of skills and profession al expertise is important under the best of circumstances; in a time of increasing financial constraints, personnel shor tages, and the growing need to provide care across multiple settings, it is crucial. Care teams need to make the best use of each member's education, skill, and expertise, and all health pr ofessionals need to practice to the full extent of thei r license and education. Where the co mpetency and skills of doctors and nurses safely overlap, it makes sense to rely on nurses to provide many of those services. Similarly, where the competency and skills of RNs and licensed practical or vocational nurses safely overlap, it makes sense to rely on the la tter\u2014or as the case may be, nurses' aides\u2014to provide many of those services. In this way, more specialized skills and competencies are appropriately reserved for the most complex needs. This type of skill balancing should not, however, be used as a means of cutting costs by i ndiscriminately replacing more skilled with less skilled clinicians. CONCLUSIONS Nurses are well positioned to help meet the e volving needs of the health care system. They have vital roles to play in achieving patient-c entered care; strengthening primary care services; delivering more care in the community; and provi ding seamless, coordinated care. They also can take on reconceptualized roles as health care coaches and system innovators. In all of these ways, nurses can contribute to a reformed health car e system that provides safe, patient-centered, accessible, affordable care. Their ability to ma ke these contributions, however, will depend on a transformation of nursing practice, education, and leadership, as discussed in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Nurses must remodel the way they practice and make clinical decisions. They must rethink the ways in which they teach nurses how to care for people. They must rise to the challenge of providing leadership in rapidly changing care settings and in an evolving health care system. In short, nurses must expand their visi on of what it means to be a nursing professional. At the same time, society must amend outdated re gulations, attitudes, policies, and habits that unnecessarily restrict the innovative contributions the nursing profe ssion can bring to health care.

Patients, in all settings, deserve care that is cente red on their unique needs and not what is most convenient for the hea lth professionals involved in their care. A transformed health care system is requi red to achieve this goal. Transforming the health care system will in turn require a fundamental rethinking of the roles of many health professionals, including nurses. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 outlines some new health care structures, and with these structures will come new opportunities for new roles. A number of programs and initiatives have already been developed to target necessary impr ovements in quality, access, and value, and many more are yet to be conceived. Nurses have the opportunity to play a central role in transforming the health care system to create a more accessible, high-quality, and value-driven environment for patients. If the system is to capitalize on this opportunity, however, the constraints of outdated policies, regulations, and cultural barriers, including those related to scope of practice, will have to be lifted, most notably for advanced practice registered nurses. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) will place many demands on health professionals and offer them many opportunities to create a system that is more patient centered. The legislation has begun the long process of shifting the focus of the U.S. health care system away from acute and specialty care. Th e need for this shift in focus has become particularly urgent with respect to chronic conditions; primary care, including care coordination and transitional care; prevention and wellness; a nd the prevention of adverse even ts, such as hospital-acquired infections. Given the aging population, moreover, the need for long-term and palliative care will continue to grow in the coming years (see Chapte r 2). The increase in th e insured population and the rapid increase in racial and ethnic minority groups who have tr aditionally face d obstacles in accessing health care will also demand that care be designed for a more socioeconomically and culturally diverse population. This chapter examines how enabling nurses to pr actice to the full extent of their education and training (key message #1 in Chapter 1) can be a major step forward in meeting these challenges. The first section explains why tran sforming nursing practice to improve care is so important, offering three examples of how utilizing the full potential of nurses has increased the quality of care while achieving greater value. The chapter then examines in detail the barriers that constrain this transformation, including regula tory barriers to expanding nurses' scope of PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The third section describes the new structures and opportunities made possible by the ACA, as well as through technology. The final section summarizes the co mmittee's conclusions regarding the vital contributions of the nursing profession to the suc cess of these initiatives as well as the overall transformation of the health care system, and wh at needs to be done to transform practice to ensure that this contribution is realized. Pa rticular emphasis is placed on advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), including their role s in chronic disease management and increased access to primary care, and the regulatory barriers preventing them from taking on these roles. This is not to say that general registered nurses (RNs) should not have the opportunity to improve their practice and take on new roles; the chapter also provides such examples. THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSFOR MING NURSING PRACTICE TO IMPROVE CARE As discussed in Chapter 2, the changing landscape of the health care system and the changing profile of the population require th at the system undergo a fundame ntal shift to provide patient- centered care; deliver more primary as opposed to specialty care; deliv er more care in the community rather than the acute care setting; provide seamless care; enable all health professionals to practice to th e full extent of their educati on, training, and competencies; and foster interprofessional collaboration. Achieving su ch a shift will enable the health care system to provide higher-quality care, re duce errors, and increase safety. Providing care in this way and in these areas taps traditional st rengths of the nursing profession. This chapter argues that nurses are so well poised to address these needs by virtue of their numbers, scientific knowledge, and adaptive capacity that the health care system should take advant age of the contributions they can make by assuming enhanced and reconceptualized roles. Nursing is one of the most versatile occ upations within the health care workforce.1 In the 150 years since Florence Nightingale developed and promoted the concept of an educated workforce of caregivers for the sick, modern nursing has reinvented itself a num ber of times as health care has advanced and changed (Lynaugh, 2008). As a result of nursing's versatility and adaptive capacity, new career pathways for nurses have evolved, attracting a larger and more broadly talented applicant pool and leadi ng to expanded scopes of practice and responsibilities for nurses. Nurses have been an enabling force for change in health care along many dimensions (Aiken et al., 2009). Among the many innovations that a vers atile, adaptive, and well-educated nursing profession have helped make possible are: the evolution of the hi gh-technology hospital, the possibility for physicians to co mbine office and hospital practice, lengths of hospital stay that are among the shortest in the world, reductions in the work hours of resident physicians to improve patient safety, expansion of national primary care capacity, improved access to care for the poor and for rural residents, 1 This discussion draws on a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Nursing Education Policy Priorities,\" prepared by Linda H. Aiken, University of Pennsylvania (see Appendix I on CD-ROM). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-3 respite and palliative ca re, including hospice, care coordination for chronically ill and elderly people, and greater access to specialty care and focused consultation (e.g., incontinence consultation, home parenteral nutrition services, and sleep apnea evaluations) that complement the care of physicians and other providers. With every passing decade, nursing has become an increasingly integral part of health care services, so that a future without large numbers of nurses is impossible to envision. Nurses and Access to Primary Care Given current concerns about a shortage of pr imary care health professionals, the committee paid particular attention to the role of nurses, especially APRNs,2 in this area. Today, nurse practitioners (NPs), together with physicians and physician assistants, provide most of the primary care in the United States. Physicia ns account for 287,000 primary care providers, NPs for 83,000, and physician assistants for 23,000 (H RSA, 2008; Steinwald, 2008). While the numbers of NPs and physician assistants are steadily increasing, the numbers of medical students and residents entering primary care have declined in recent years (Nay lor and Kurtzman, 2010). The demand to build the primary care workfor ce, including APRNs, will grow as access to coverage, service settings, and services increases under the ACA. While NPs make up slightly less than a quarter of the country's primary care professionals (Bodenheimer and Pham, 2010), it is a group that has grown in recent years and has the potential to gr ow further at a relatively rapid pace. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Nursing Research Network commissioned Kevin Stange, University of Michigan, and Deborah Sampson, Boston College, to provide information on the variation in numbers of NP s across the United States. Figures 3-1 and 3-2, respectively, plot the provider-to-primary care physician ratio for NPs and physician assistants by county for 2009. 3 The total is calculated as the populat ion-weighted average for states with available data. Between 1995 and 2009, the number of NPs per primary care MD more than doubled, from 0.23 to 0.48, as did the number of phys ician assistants per primary care MD (0.12 to 0.28) (RWJF, 2010c). These figures suggest that it is possible increase the supply of both NPs and PAs in a relatively short amount of time, he lping to meet the increased demand for care. 2 APRNs include nurse practitioners (NPs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). When the committee refers to NPs, the term denotes only NPs. 3 To get a sense of the size and proportion of the NP wo rkforce across the country, St ange and Sampson computed the ratio between the total number of licensed nurse practiti oner and the total number of primary care MDs, Pas, and NPs in a given area. PA share is defined similarly. This co mputation is for proportion and growth analysis only; it is not to suggest that all NPs or PAs are providing primary care.

According to the co mplexity-of-care data s hown in Table 3-1, the degree of variation among primary car e providers is relatively small. Much of the practice of primary care\u2014whether provided by physicians, NP s, physician assistants, or certified nurse midwives (CNMs)\u2014is of low to moderate complexity.

Nurses and Quality of Care Beyond the issue of pure number s of practitioners, a promis ing field of evidence links nursing care to a higher qua lity of care for patients, including protecting their safety. According to Mary Naylor, director of The Robert W ood Johnson Foundation's Interdisciplinary Nursing Quality Research Initiative (INQRI), \"Several INQRI-funded research teams have provided examples of this link. Nurses are crucial in preventing medication erro rs, reducing rates of infection and even facilitating patients ' transition from hospital to home.\"4 INQRI researchers at The Johns Hopkins University have found that subs tantial reductions in central line associated blood stream infections can be achieved with nurses leading the infection control effort. Hospitals that adopted INQRI's intensive care unit (ICU) safety program as well as an environment that supported nurse's involvement in quality improvement efforts reduced or eliminated bloodstream infections (INQR I, 2010b; Marsteller et al., 2010). Other INQRI researcher linked a core cluster of nurse safety processe s to fewer medication errors. These safety processes include asking phy sicians to clarify or rewrite unclear orders, independently reconciling patient medications, and providing patient education. A positive work environment was also important. This include d having more RNs per patient, a supportive management structure, and colla borative relationships between nurses and physicians (Flynn et al., 2010; INQRI, 2010a). 4 Personal communication, Mary Naylor, Marian S.

As Ma rilyn Chow, Vice President of the Patient Services Program Office at Kaiser Permanente, declared at a public forum hosted by the committee, \"The future is here, it is just not everywhere\" (IOM, 2010b). For example, over the past 20 years, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has e xpanded and reconceived the roles played by its nurses as part of a major restructuring of its health care system. The results with respect to quality, access, and value have been impressive. In addition, Pres ident Obama has lauded the Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania, which provides compre hensive care to 2.6 million people at a greater value than is achieved by most other organizations (White House, 2009). Part of the reason Geisinger is so effective is that it has aligned the roles played by nurses to accord more closely with patients' needs, starting with its primary care sites and ambulatory areas. The following subsections summarize the experience of the VA and Geisinger, as well as Kaiser Permanente, in expanding and reconceptualizing the roles of nurse s. Because these institu tions also measured outcomes as part of their initiatives, they provide real-world evidence that such an approach is both possible and necessary. Of note in these exam ples is not only how nur ses are collaborating with physicians, but also how nurses are collaborating wi th other nurses. Department of Veterans Affairs 5 In 1996, Congress greatly expanded the number of veterans eligible to receive VA services, which created a need for the system to operate more efficiently and effectively (VHA, 2003). Caring for the wounded from the wars in Afghani stan and Iraq has greatly increased demand on the VA system, particularly with respect to br ain injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder. Moreover, the large cohort of World War II vetera ns means that almost 40 percent of veterans are aged 65 or older, compared with 13 percent of the genera l population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010; VA, 2010). Anticipating the challenges it would face, the VA began transforming itself in the 1990s from a hospital-based system into a health care system that is focused on primary care and it aims to provide more services, as appropriate, closer to the veteran's home or community (VHA, 2003, 2009). This strategy required be tter coordination of care and ch ronic disease management\u2014a role that was filled by experienced front-line RNs. More NPs were hired as primary care providers, and the VA actively promoted a more collaborative professional culture by organizing primary care providers into health teams. It also developed a well-integrated information technology system to link its health professionals and its services. The VA uses NPs as primary care providers to care for patients across all setting including inpatient and outpatient settings. In addition to their ro le as primary care providers, NPs serve as health care researchers who apply their findings to the variety of settings in which they practice. NPs serve as educators, some as university facu lty, providing clinical ex periences for 25 percent of all nursing students in the country. As health care leaders, VA NPs shape policy, facilitate access to VA health care, and impact resource management (VA, 2007). 5 See http://www1.va.gov/health/. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-7 The results of the VA's initiatives using bot h front-line RNs and APRNs are impressive. Quality and outcome data consistently demonstrat e superior results for the VA's approach (Asch et al., 2004; Jha et al., 2003; Kerr et al., 2004). One study found that VA patients received significantly better health care\u2014based on various quality-o f-care indicators6\u2014than patients enrolled in Medicare's fee-for-service progr am. In some cases, the study showed, between 93 and 98 percent of VA patients received appropriate care in 2000; the highest score for comparable Medicare patients was 84 percent (J ha et al., 2003). In addition, the VA's spending per enrollee rose much more sl owly than Medicare's, despite the 1996 expansion of the number of veterans who could access VA se rvices. After adjusting for different mixes of population and demographics, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) determined that the VA's spending per enrollee grew by 30 percent from 1999 to 2007, compared with 80 percent for Medicare over the same period. Geisinger Health System 7 The Geisinger Health System employs 800 physicians, 1,900 nurses, and more than 1,000 NPs, physician assistants, and pharmacists. Over the past 18 years, Geisinger has transformed itself from a high-cost medical facility to one that provides high value\u2014all while improving quality. It has borrowed several restructuring conc epts from the manufacturing world with an eye to redesigning care by focusing on what it sees as the most critical determinant of quality and cost\u2014actual caregiving. \"What we're trying to do is to have [our staff] work up to the limit of their license and...see if redi stributing caregiving work can increase quality and decrease cost,\" Glenn Steele, Geisinger's president and CEO, said in a June 2010 interview (Dentzer, 2010). Numerous improvements in the quality of care, as well as effective innovations proposed by employees, have resulted. For exam ple, the nurses who used to coordinate care and provide advice through the telep hone center under Geisinger's health pl an suspected that they would be more effective if they could build relationships with patients and meet them at least a few times face to face. Accordingly, some highly experien ced general-practice nurse s moved from the call centers to primary care sites to meet with patients and their families. The nurses used a predictive model to identify who might need to go to th e hospital and worked with patients and their families on creating a care plan. Later, when patients or families received a call from a nurse, they knew who that person was. The program has worked so well that nurse coordinators are now being used in both Geisinger's Me dicare plan and its commercial plan. 8 Some of the nation's largest for-profit insurance companies, including WellPoint and Cigna, are now trying out the approach of employing more nurses to be tter coordinate their patients' care (Abelson, 2010). As a result, an innovation that emerged when a few nurses at Geisi nger took the initiative and changed an already well-esta blished program to deliver more truly patient-centered care may now spread well beyond Pennsylvania. Geisinger was also one of the very first health systems in 6 Quality-of-care indicators included those in preventive care (mammography, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screenin g), outpatient care (care fo r diabetes [e.g., lipid screening], hypertension [e.g., aspirin 24 hr of myocardial infarction], congestive heart failure [e.g., ejection fraction checked]). 7 See http://www.geisinger.org/about/index.html . 8 Personal communication, Bruce H.

Kaiser Permanente10,11 As one of the largest not-for-profit health pl ans, Kaiser Permanente provides health care services for more than 8.6 million members, with an employee base of approximately 165,000. Kaiser Permanente has facilities in nine states and the District of Columbia, and has 35 medical centers and 454 medical offices. The system provide s prepaid health plans that have an emphasis on prevention and consolidated services that keep as many services as po ssible in one location (KP, 2010). Kaiser is also at the forefront of experimenting with reconceptualized roles for nurses that are improving quality, satisfying patients, and making a difference to the organization's bottom line. Nurses in San Diego have taken the lead in overseeing the process for patient discharge, making it more streamlined and efficient and much more effective. Discharge nurses now have full authority over the entire discharge proce ss until home health nurses, including those in hospice and palliative care, step in to take over the patient's care. They have created efficiencies relative to previous processes by us ing time-sensitive, prioritized lists of only those patients who are being discharged over the next 48 hours (inste ad of patients who are being discharged weeks into the future). Home health care nurses and di scharge planners stay in close contact with one another on a daily basis to make quick decisions about patient needs, including the need for home health care visitation. In ju st 3 months, the number of patients who saw a home health care provider within 24 hours increased from 44 to 77 percent (Labor Management Partnership, 2010). In 2003, Riverside Medical Center implemented the Riverside Proactive Health Management Program (RiPHM), an integrated, systematic approach to health care management that promotes prevention and wellness and coordina tes interventions for patients with chronic conditions. The model strengthens the patient- centered medical home concept and identifies members of the health care team (HCT)\u2014a multidisciplinary group whose staff is centrally directed and physically located in small units with in the medical office building. The team serves panel management and comprehensive outreach and inreach functions to support primary care physicians and proactively manage the care of members with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, oste oporosis, and depression. The expanded role of nurses as key members of th e HCT is a major factor in RiPHM's success. Primary care management nurse clinic RNs and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) provide health care coaching and education for patients to prom ote self-management of their chronic conditions through face-to-face education visits and telephone follow-up. Using evidence-based clinical guidelines, such as diabetes and hypertension treat-to-target algorithms, nurses play important roles in the promotion of changes in chronic conditions and lifestyles , coaching and counseling, self-monitoring and goal setting, depression screen ing, and the use of advanced technology such as interactive voice recogn ition for patient outreach. 9 Personal communication, Tine Hansen-Turton, CEO, National Nursing Centers Consortium, and Vice President, Public Health Management Corporation, August 11, 2010. 10 See https://members.kaiserpermanente.org/kpweb/aboutus.do . 11 Personal communication, Marilyn Ch ow, Vice President, Patient Care Services, Program Office, Kaiser Permanente, August 23, 2010.

Nurses use disease management registries to work with assigned primary care physicians, and review clinical information that addresses care gaps and evaluate treatment plans. RiPHM has provided a strong foundation for the patient-cen tered medical home. By implementing this program and expanding the role of nurses, Riverside has sustained continuous improvement in key quality indicators for patient care. Guided care is a new model for chronic care th at was recently introduced within the Kaiser system. Guided care is intended to provide, within a primary care setting, quality care to patients with complex needs and multiple chronic condi tions. An RN, who assi sts three to four physicians, receives training in areas such as the use of an electronic health record (EHR), interviewing, and the particulars of health insurance coverage. RNs are also provided skills in managing chronic conditions, providing transitional care, and working with families and community organizations (Boult et al., 2008). The nurse providing guided care nurse offers eight services: assessment; planning care; monitoring; coaching; chronic disease self-management; educa ting and supporting caregivers; coordinating transitions between providers and site s of care; and facilitating access to community services, such as Meals-on-Wheels, transportation services, and senior cent ers. Results of a pilot study comparing surveys of patients who received guided care and those who received usual care revealed improved quality of care and lower health care costs (according to insurance claims) for guided care patients (Boult et al., 2008). Summary The VA, Geisinger, and Kaiser Permanente ar e large integrated care systems that may be better positioned than others to invest in the coordination, education, and assessment provided by their nurses, but their results speak for themse lves. If the United States is to achieve the necessary transformation of its health care system, the evidence points to the importance of relying on nurses in enhanced and reconceptualiz ed roles. This does not necessarily mean that large regional corporations or ve rtically integrated care systems are the answer. It does mean that innovative, high-value solutions must be developed that are sustai nable, easily adopted in other locations, and rapidly adaptable to different circumstances. A website on \"Innovative Care Models\" illustrates that many other solutions ha ve been identified in other types of systems. 12 As patients, employers, insurers, and governments b ecome more aware of the benefits offered by nurses, they may also begin demanding that heal th care providers restructure their services around the contributions that a tr ansformed nursing workforce can make. As discussed later in the chapter, the committee believes there will be numerous opportunitie s for nurses to help develop and implement care innovations and assu me leadership roles in accountable care organizations and medical homes as a way of pr oviding access to care for more Americans. As the next section describes, howev er, it will first be necessary to acknowledge the barriers that prevent nurses from practicing to the full extent of their educa tion and training, as well as to generate the political will on the part of policy makers to remove these barriers. 12 See http://www.innovativecaremodels.com/ and http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/057241.htm .

As discussed in this section, however, a variety of historical, regulatory, and policy barriers have limited nurses' ability to cont ribute to widespread transformation (Kimball and O'Neil, 2002). This is true of all RNs, including those practic ing in acute care and public and community health settings, but is most notable for APRNs in pr imary care. Other barriers include professional resistance to expanded roles for nurses, frag mentation of the health care system, outdated insurance policies, high rates of nurse turnover, difficulties for nurses transitioning from school into practice, and an aging workforce and other demographic challenges. Many of these barriers have developed as a result of structural flaws in the U.S. health care system; others reflect limitations of the present work environment or the capacity and demographic makeup of the nursing workforce itself. Regulatory Barriers As the committee considered how the additional 32 million people covered by health insurance under the ACA would receive care in the coming years, it identified as a serious barrier overly restrictiv e scope-of-practice regulations for AP RNs that vary by state. Scope-of- practice issues are of concern fo r CNMs, certified registered nurs e anesthetists (CRNAs), NPs, and clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). The co mmittee understands that physicians are highly trained and skilled providers and believes strongly that there clearly are se rvices that should be provided by these health profe ssionals, who have received more extensive and specialized education and training than APRN s. However, regulations in many states result in APRNs not being able to give care they were trained to provide. The committee believes all health professionals should practice to the full extent of their education and training so that more patients may benefit. History of the Regulation of the Health Professions A paper commissioned by the committee13 points out that the United States was one of the first countries to regulate health care providers and that this regulation occurred at the state\u2014not the federal\u2014level. Legislatively, physician pr actice was recognized before any other health profession (Rostant and Cady, 2009). Legislators in Washingt on, for example, defined the practice of medicine broadly as, for example, any action to \"diagnose, cure, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmit y, deformity, pain or othe r condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any m eans or instrumentality\" or to administer or prescribe \"drugs or medicinal preparations to be used by any other person\" or to \"[ sever or penetrat e] the tissues of human beings.\"14 Even more important were corres ponding provisions making it illegal for anyone not licensed as a physician to undertake any of the acts incl uded in this definition. These provisions thereby rendered not only univers al but (in medicine's own view) exclusive,15 a 13 This and the following paragraph draw on a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Federal Options for Maximizing the Value of Advanced Practice Registered Nurs es in Providing Quality, Cost-Effective Health Care,\" prepared by Barbara J. Safreit, Lewis & Clark Law School (see Appendix H on CD-ROM). 14 Washington Rev. Code \u00a718.71.011 (1)-(3) (1993). 15 Sociologist Eliot Freidson has aptly characterized this statutory preemption as right to practice\" (Freidson, 1970).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-11 preemption of the field that was further codified when physicians obtained statutory authority to control the activities of othe r health care providers. Most APRNs are in the opposite situation. Becau se virtually all stat es still base their licensure frameworks on the persistent underlyi ng principle that the practice of medicine encompasses both the ability and the legal author ity to treat all possible human conditions, the scopes of practice for APRNs (and other health professionals) are exercises in legislative exception making, a \"carving out\" of small, politically achievable spheres of practice authority from the universal domain of medicine. As a result, APRNs' scopes of practice are so circumscribed that their competence extends fa r beyond their authority. At any point in their career, APRNs can do much more than they may legally do. As APRNs acquire new skills, they must seek administrative or stat utory revision of their defined sc opes of practice (a costly and often difficult enterprise). As the health care system has grown over the past 40 years, the e ducation and roles of APRNs have continually evolved so that nurses now enter the workplace willing and qualified to provide more services than they previously did. As the services supporte d by evolving education programs expanded, so did the overlap of prac tice boundaries of APRNs and physicians. APRNs are more than physician extenders or substitute s. They cover the care continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to early diagnosis to prevent or limit disability. These services are grounded in and shaped by their nursing ed ucation, with its part icular ideology and professional identity. NPs also learn how to work with teams of providers, which is perhaps one of the most important factors in the successful ca re of chronically ill patients. Although they use skills traditionally residing in the realm of medicine, APRNs integrate a range of skills from several disciplines, including social work, nutrition, and physical therapy. Almost 25 years ago, an analysis by the O ffice of Technology Assessment (OTA) indicated that NPs could safely and effectively provide more than 90 percent of pediatric primary care services and 75 percent of gene ral primary care services, while CRNAs could provide 65 percent of anesthesia services. OTA concluded further that CNMs could be 98 percent as productive as obstetricians in providing maternity services (Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). APRNs also have competencies that include the knowledge to refer patients with complex problems to physicians, just as physicians refer patients who n eed services they are not trained to provide, such as medication counseling, developmental sc reening, or case management, to APRNs. As discussed in Chapter 1 and reviewed in Anne x 1-1, APRNs provide services, in addition to primary care, in a wide range of areas, includi ng neonatal care, acute care , geriatrics, community health, and psychiatric/mental health. Most NPs train in primary care; however, increasing numbers are being trained in acute care medici ne and other specialty disciplines (Cooper, 1998). The growing use of APRNs and physician assi stants has helped ease access bottlenecks, reduce waiting times, increase patient satisfactio n, and free physicians to handle more complex cases (Canadian Pediatric Society, 2000; Cunnin gham, 2010). This is true of APRNs in both primary and specialty care. In orthopedics, the use of physician assistants and APRNs is a long- standing practice. NPs and physic ian assistants in gastroente rology help meet the growing demand for colon cancer screenings in either outpatient suites or hospi tal endoscopy centers. Because physician assistants and APRNs in specia lty practice typically collaborate closely with physicians, legal scope-of-practice issues pose limited obstacles in these settings.

In some states, they are very detailed, while in others, th ey contain vague provisi ons that are open to interpretation (Cunningham, 2010). Some states have kept pace with the evolution of the health care system by changing their scope-of-practice regulations to allow NPs to see patients and prescribe medications without a phy sician's supervision or collaboration. However, the majority of state laws lag behind in this regard. As a resu lt, what NPs are able to do once they graduate varies widely across the country for reasons that ar e related not to their ab ility, their education or training, or safety concerns (Lugo et al., 2007), but to the political decisions of the state in which they work. For example, one group of researcher s found that 14 states plus the District of Columbia have regulations that allow NPs to see primary care patients without supervision by or required collaboration with a physician (see Figure 3-3). As with any other primary care providers, these NPs refer patients to a specia lty provider if the care required extends beyond the scope of their education, training, and skills.

See Safriet (2010, Appendix H on CD-ROM) for further discussion of inconsistencies in the regulation of NP practice at the state level. There are fundamental contradictions in this situation. Educational stan dards\u2014which the states recognize\u2014support broader practi ce by all types of APRNs. National certification standards\u2014 which most states also recognize\u2014likewise support broader pr actice by APRNs. Moreover, the contention that APRNs are less able than physicians to deliver care that is safe, effective, and efficient is not supported by the decades of resear ch that has examined this question (Brown and Grimes, 1995; Fairman, 2008; Grot h et al., Hogan et al., 2010; Horrocks et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2010; Laurant et al., 2004; Mundinger et al., 2 000; Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). No studies suggest that care is be tter in states that have more restrictive scope- of-practice regulations for APRNs than in those that do not. Yet most states continue to restrict the practice of APRNs beyond what is warranted by either thei r education or their training. Depending on the state, restricti ons on an APRN's scope of pr actice may limit or prohibit the authority to prescribe medications , admit patients to hospitals, a ssess patient conditions, and order and evaluate tests. Box 3-1 provi des an example of the variation in state licensure regulations, detailing examples of the services an APRN would not be permitted to provide if she practiced in a more restrictive state (Safriet, 2010). In addition to variations am ong states, the scope of practice for APRNs in some cases varies within a state by geographic location of the practice within the state or nature of the practice setting. BOX 3-1* Variation in State Licensure Regulations There are several states that permit APRNs to provide a wide list of services, such as independently examining patients, ordering and interp reting laboratory and other tests, diagnosing and treating illness and injury, prescribing indicated drugs, ordering or referring for additional services, admitting and attending patients in a hospital or ot her facility, and directly receiving payment for services. However, in other states, those same APRNs would be prohibited from providing many of these services. The following list provides examples of restrict ions that APRNs face in states that have adopted more restrictive scope of practice regulations. The lis t is a compilation of restrictions found in these states and could greatly limit the ability of an APRN to use his or her preparation. Examination and Certification A nurse may not examine and certify for: worker's compensation; Department of motor vehicles (DMV) disab ility placards and license plates and other DMV testing; excusal from jury service; mass transit accommodation (reduced fa res, access to special features); sports physicals (she may perform them, but cannot sign the forms); declaration of death; school physicals and forms, including the need for home-bound schooling; clinician order for life sustaining treatment (C UNCORRECTED Academy of Sciences.

A nurse may: indirectly affect the eligibility of other providers for payment because pharmacies cannot obtain payment from some private insurers unless the supervising or collaborating physician's name is on the script, and hospitals cannot bill for APRNs' teaching or supervising of medical students and residents and advanced practice nursing students (as they can for physicians who provide those same services). ______________________________________ *This box draws on Safriet, 2010 (see CD-ROM).

Some NPs, for example, have left primary care to work as specialists in hospital settings (Cooper, 2007), although demand in those settings has also played a role in their movement. Others have left NP pr actice altogether to work as sta ff RNs. For example, restrictive state scope-of-practice regulations concerning NPs have limited expansion of retail clinics, where NPs provide a limited set of primary care services directly to patients (Rudavsky et al., 2009). Similarly, the roles of NPs in nurse-managed hea lth centers and patient-centered medical homes can be hindered by dated state practice acts. Credentialing and payment policies often are link ed to state practice laws. A 2007 survey of the credentialing and reimbursement po licies of 222 managed care organi zations revealed that that 53 percent credentialed NPs as primary care providers ; of these, 56 percent reimbursed primary care NPs at the same rate as primary care providers , and 38 percent reimbursed NPs at a lower rate (Hansen-Turton et al., 2008). Rationa les stated by managed care sta ff for not credentialing NPs as primary care providers included the fact that NPs have to bill under a physician's provider number, NPs do not practice in physician sh ortage areas, NPs do not meet co mpany criteria for primary care providers, state law does not require them to credential NPs, and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditation process prevents them from recognizing NPs as primary care provider leads in medical homes. As discussed a bove, some states require NPs to be supervised by physicians in order to prescribe medications, while others do not. In this survey, 71 percent of responding insurers credentialed NPs as primary care providers in stat es where there was no requirement for physicians to supervise NPs in pres cribing medications. In st ates that required more physician involvement in NP prescribing, insurers we re less likely to credential NPs. Of interest, this was the case even though the ac tual level of involvement by the physician may be the same in states where supervision is required as in states where it is not. Also of note is that Medicaid plans were more likely than any other cate gory of insurer to credential NPs. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The federal governmen t has a compelling interest in the regulatory environment for health care professions because of its responsibility to patients covered by federal programs such as Medica re, Medicaid, the VA, and the Bur eau of Indian Affairs. Equally important, however, is the federal government's responsibility to all Am erican taxpayers who fund the care provided under these a nd other programs to ensure that their tax dollars are spent efficiently and effectively. Federal actors already play a central role in a number of areas that would be essential to effective reform of nursing practice, especially that of AP RNs. They pay for the majority of health care services delivere d today, they pay for research on the safety and effectiveness of existing and innovative practice models and encourage th eir adoption, and they have a compelling interest in achi eving more efficient and value-dr iven health care services. The federal government also appropriates substantial funds for the education and training of health care providers, and it has an understandable intere st in ensuring that th e ever-expanding skills and abilities acquired by graduates of these programs are fully u tilized for the benefit of the American public. Specifically, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a long history of targeting anticompetitive conduct in health ca re markets, including restrictio ns on the business practices of health care providers, as well as policies that coul d act as a barrier to entry for new competitors in the market. The FTC has responded specifically to potential policies that might be viewed predominantly as guild protection rather than co nsumer protection, for example, taking antitrust actions against the American Medical Association (AMA) for policies restricting access to clinical psychologists to cases referred by a physician and for ethical prohibitions on collaborating with chiropract ors, podiatrists, and osteopathic physicians. In 2008, the FTC evaluated proposed laws in Massa chusetts, Illinois, and Kentucky, finding that several provisions could be considered anticompetitive, including limits on advertising, diffe rential cost sharing, more stringent physician supervis ion requirements, restrictions on clinic locations and physical configurations or proximity to other commercial vent ures, and limits on the scope of professional services that can be provided th at are not applicable to professionals with similar credentials who practice in similar \"limited care se ttings\" (for example, urgent care centers) (DeS anti et al., 2010; Ohlhausen et al., 2007, 2008). The FTC initiated an administrative complaint against the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners in June 2010 (FTC, 2010). The Board had prohibited nondentis ts from providing teeth-whitening services. The FTC alleged that by doing this the Board had hindered competition and made it more difficult and costly for consum ers in the state to obtain this service. As a payer and administrator of health insura nce coverage for federal employees, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program have a responsibility to promote and ensure em ployee/subscriber access to the widest choice of competent, cost-effective health care providers. Pr inciples of equity w ould suggest that this subscriber choice would be promoted by policies ensuring that full, evidence-based practice is permitted for all providers regardless of geographic location. 16 This section is based on a September 11, 2010 personal communication with Barbara J. Safriet, Lewis & Clark Law School. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-19 Finally, the Centers for Medica re and Medicaid Services (C MS) has the responsibility to promulgate rules and policies that promote acces s of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to appropriate care. CMS therefore should ensure that its rules and polic es reflect the evolving practice abilities of licensed provi ders, rather than relying on date d definitions drafted at a time when physicians were the only authorized providers of a wide array of health care services. Expanding Scopes of Practice for Nurses For several decades, the trend in the United St ates has been toward expansion of scope-of- practice regulations for APRNs, but this shift has been incrementa l and variable. Most recently, the move to expand the legal authority of all AP RNs to provide health care that accords with their education, training, and competencies appear s to be gathering momentum. In 2008, after 5 years of study, debate, and ne gotiation, a group of nursing accr editation, certification, and licensing organizations, along with several APRN groups, develope d a consensus model for the education, training, and regulation of APRNs (NCSBN, 2008a) (Appendix D). The stated goals of the APRN consensus process are to: \"strive for harmony and common understanding in the APRN regulatory community that would continue to promote quality APRN education and practice; develop a vision for APRN regulation, includ ing education, accred itation, certification, and licensure; establish a set of standards that protect the public, improve mobili ty, and improve access to safe, quality APRN care; and produce a written statement that reflects consensus on APRN regulatory issues\" (NCSBN, 2008a). The consensus document will help schools and pr ograms across the United States standardize the education and preparation of APRNs. It will also help state regulators establish consistent practice acts because of education and certificat ion standardization. And of importance, this document reflects the consensus of nursing or ganizations and leaders and accreditation and certification boards regarding the need to elimin ate variations in scope-of-practice regulations across states and to adopt regulations that more fully recognize the competence of APRNs. In March 2010, the board of directors of AA RP concluded that st atutory and regulatory barriers at the state and fede ral levels \"are short-changing consumers.\" Acknowledging that nurses, particularly APRNs, can provide much of the care that Americans need and that barriers to their doing so must be lifted, the organization updated its policy on scope of practice. AARP states that \"the policy change allows us to wo rk together to ensure that our members and all health care consumers, especially in underserved settings such as urban and rural communities, have increased access to high quality care. \" The amended policy reads as follows: Current state nurse practice acts and acco mpanying rules should be interpreted and/or amended where necessary to a llow APRNs to fully and independently practice as defined by their educatio n and certification (AARP, 2010a).

E xpanding the scope of practice for NPs is particularly important for the ru ral and frontier areas of the count ry. Twenty five percent of the U.S. population lives in these areas, however, only 10 percent of physicians pr actice in rural areas (NRHA, 2010). People who live in rural areas are generally poorer and have higher morbidity and mortality rates than their counterpa rts in suburban and urban settings and are in need of a reliable source of primary care providers (NRHA, 2010). The case study in Box 3-2, describing an NP in rural Iowa, demonstrates the benefits of a broad sc ope of practice with respect to the quality of and access to care. BOX 3-2 Advanced Practice Registered Nurses PROMOTING ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL IOWA A qualified health care professional is a terrible thing to waste. \u2014Cheryll Jones, BSN, ARNP, BC, CPNP, pediatric NP, Ottumwa, Iowa The passage of the Affordable Care Act will give millio ns of Americans better access to primary care\u2014if there are enough providers. The United States has a shor tage of primary care physicians, especially in rural areas, but Alison Mitchell, president of Texas Nurse Practitioners, told the Dallas Morning News in April 2010 that nurse practitioners (NPs) ar e ready to step in: \"We would be happy to help in the trenches and be primary care providers.\" Many states are considering wa ys to permit NPs to function in this capacity with fewer restrictions (AP, 2010). In 2001, 23 percent of NPs in the United States work ed in rural areas and almost 41 percent in urban communities, where most provided primary care services to underserved populations (Hooker and Berlin, 2002). The NP's scope of practice is governed by state la ws and regulations that differ in their requirements for physician supervision and prescriptive authority\u2014 the ability to prescribe medications. In rural communities, NPs may be the only available primary care providers, and it is important that they be able to practice independently, if need be, although they value collaboration with physicians and other providers regardless of state authorization. Iowa is one of 22 states where advanced practice registered nurse (APRNs)\u2014NPs, certified nurse midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRN As), and clinical nurse specialists\u2014practice without physician oversight and one of 12 states that permit them to prescribe without restriction (Phillips, 2010). Iowa's APRNs must be nationally certified in their specia lty; meet state requirement s for continuing education; provide evidence of their education; and collaborate with a physician on \"medically delegated tasks,\" such as circumcision and hospital admission. Several studies have shown that APRNs pr oduce outcomes comparable to those of physicians and that the care they provide encompasses 80 to 90 percent of the services provided by physicians (Mundinger et al., 2000; Offi ce of Technology Assessment, 1986). One pediatric NP in Ottumwa, Iowa, has worked to remove barriers faced by APRNs for more than three decades. Cheryll Jones, BSN, ARNP, BC, CPNP, said t hat permitting all nurses to practice to the fullest extent of their education ha s been essential to improving access to care for rural Iowans. Iowa's gains have been realized largely through regulations rather than through incremental changes to the state's nurse practice act, as has been the case in other states. Ms. Jones attributes those successes to the diligence of Iowa nurses and others interested in promoting access to care, who: emphasized the issue of access to care for rural and disadvantaged populations; ensured that policy makers knew what APRNs do (Ms. Jones invited legisl ators to her clinic); promoted unity among Iowa nursing groups and with organizations such as the Iowa Hospital Association; and partnered with leaders, such as former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack (now U.S. secretary of agriculture), the first governor to opt out of M edicare's requirement t hat the state's CRNAs be supervised by physicians.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-21 Evidence that it is safe to remove restrictions on APRNs comes from an annual review of state laws and regulations governing APRNs that now includes malpractice claims in its analysis. The 2010 Pearson Report documents no increase in claims registered in t he Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank in states where APRNs have full authority to practice and prescribe independently (Lenz et al., 2004). The report also notes that the overall ratio of clai ms against NPs is 1 for every 166 NPs in the nation, compared with 1 for every 4 physicians (Pearson, 2010). In June 2010 President Barack Obama addressed t he House of Delegates of the American Nurses Association to announce \"a number of investment s to expand the primary care workforce.\" These included increased funding for NP students and for nu rse- and NP-run clinics\u2014two important steps, the President said, in \"a larger effort to make our sy stem work better for nurses and for doctors, and to improve the quality of care for patients\" (White House, 2010). Scope of Practice for non-APRN Nurses Generalist nurses are expanding their practices across all settings to meet the needs of patients. Expansions include procedure-based skills (involving, for ex ample, IVs and cardiac outputs), as well as clinical judgm ent skills (e.g., taking health histories and performing physical examinations to develop a plan of nursing car e). According to Djukic and Kovner (2010), there has been \"no formal examination of the impact of RN role expansion on care cost or on or physician and RN workload.\" The authors describe the expansion as a sh ifting of skills and activities, which in the long run, given the physic ian shortage, could free up physician resources, especially in long-term care, community hea lth, and school-based health. On the other hand, given the projected nursing shortage, task shif ting to overworked nurses could create unsafe patient care environments, especial ly in acute care hospitals. To av ert this situation, nurses need to delegate to others, such as LPNs, nursing assistants, and community health workers, among others. A transformed nursing education system that is able to respond to changes in science and contextual factors, such as popul ation demographics, will be ab le to incorporate needed new skills and support full scopes of practice for non -APRNs to meet the needs of patients (see Chapter 4). Professional Resistance Increasing access to care by expanding state scop e-of-practice regulations so they accord with the education and competency of APRNs is a critical and contr oversial topic. Practice boundaries are constantly changing with the emergence of new technologies, evolving patient expectations, and workforce issues. Yet the m ovement to expand scopes of practice is not supported by some professional medical orga nizations. Professional tensions surrounding practice boundaries are not limited to nurses and physicians, but show a certain continuity across many disciplines. Psychiatrists and psychologists have been di sagreeing about prescriptive privileges for more than two decades (Daly, 2007). In the dental field, one new role, the advanced dental hygiene practiti oner, functions under a broadened scope similar to that of an APRN. The American Dental Association does not r ecognize this new type of practitioner as an independent clinician, but mandates that all dent al teams be headed by a professional dentist (Fox, 2010). Likewise, physical therapists are challenging traditional scope-of-practice boundaries established by chir opractors (Huijbregts, 2007).

The SOPP in particular, an alliance of the AMA and six medical specialty organizations, was an effort on the part of organized medicine to oppose boundary expa nsion and to defeat pr oposed legislation in several states to expand scope of practice for allied health care provi ders, including nurses (Croasdale, 2006; Cys, 2000). The SOPP, with the assistance of a special full-time legislative attorney hired for the purpose, spearheaded several projects designed to obstruct expansion of scopes of practice for nurses and others. These projects included comparisons between the medical profession and specific allied health professions on education st andards, certification programs, and disciplinary processes; development of evidence to discredit access-to-care arguments made by various allied health professionals, particularly in ru ral areas of a state; and iden tification of the locations of physicians by specialty to counter claims of a lack of physicia ns in certain areas (Cady, 2006). One of the policies pursued by the SOPP is the AMA's 2006 resolution H-35.988, 18 Independent Practice of Medicine by \"Nurse Practitioners.\" This resolution opposes any legislation allowing the independent practice of me dicine by individuals who have not completed state requirements to practice medicine. The AMA has released a set of 10 documents fo r members of state medical associations to help them explain \"to regulators and legislators the limitations in the education and training of non-physician providers\" (AMA, 2009). One of these, The AMA Scope of Practice Data Series : Nurse Practitioners, uses the term \"limited licensure he alth care providers.\" The document argues that these providers\u2014NPs\u2014seek scope-of pract ice expansions that may be harmful to the public (AMA, 2009). Other organizations, such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Association of Family Physicians (AAFP), have also issued statements that do not support nurses practicing to their fullest ability (ASA, 2004), al though the AAFP supports nurses and physicians working together in collaborative teams (Phillip s et al., 2001). The AAFP recently released a press packet\u2014a \" nurse practitioner information kit.\"19 The kit includes a set of five papers and a new piece of legislati on \"clarifying\" why NPs cannot substitute for physicians in primary care, although as Medicare and Medicaid data show, they already are doing so. There are also new guidelines on how to supervise CNMs, NPs, and physician assistants. The AAFP notes that its new proposed legislation, the H ealth Care Truth and Transparency Act of 2010, \"ensures that patients receive accurate health care information by prohibiting misleading and deceptive advertising or representation of health care professionals' credentials and training .\" The legislation is also endorse d by 13 other physician groups. 17 See for example, AMA. 2000. Res. H-360.988. \"Nur se Practitioner Reimbursement Under Medicare\"; AMA. 2000. H.D. Res. H-160.947, Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners.\" 18 AMA. 2006. Res.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-23 Action has been taken at the state level as well. For example, in 2010, the California Medical Association (CMA) and the Califor nia Society of Anesthesiologi sts (CSA) sued the state of California after Governor Schwarzenegger decide d to opt out of a Me dicare provision requiring physician supervision of CRNAs (Sorbel, 2010). At the time of release of the committee's report, the case had not yet been heard. Reasons for Physician Resistance The CMA and CSA both cited patient safety as the reason for protesting the governor's decision\u2014although evidence shows that CRNAs provide high-quality care to California citizens, there is no evidence of patient harm from their pr actice, and 14 other states have taken similar opt out actions (Sorbel, 2010). A study by Du lisse and Cromwell (2010), found no increase in inpatient mortality or complications in states that opted out of the CMS requirement that an anethsesiologist or surgeon overs ee the administration of anesthes ia by a CRNA. As noted earlier in this chapter, the contention that APRNs are le ss able than physicians to deliver care that is safe, effective, and efficient is not supported by re search that has examined this question (Brown and Grimes, 1995; Fairman, 2008; Groth et al., et al., 2010; al., 2002; al et al., 2004; Mundinger et al., 2000; Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). Some physician organizations argue that nurses should not be allowed to expand their scope of practice, citing medicine's unique educati on, clinical knowledge, and cognitive and technical skills. Opposition to this expansi on is particularly strong with re gard to prescriptive practice. However, evidence does not support an associa tion between a physician' s type and length of preparation and the ability to pr escribe correctly and accurately or the quality of care (Fairman, 2008). Similar questions have been raised a bout the content of nur sing education (see the discussion of nursing curricula in Chapter 4). Support for Expanded Scope of Prac tice for Nurse Practitioners Some individual physicians support expanded sc ope of practice for NPs. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nursing Research Network (des cribed in Appendix A) conducted a survey of 100 physician members of the online physician site Sermo.com20 and found that more than 50 percent of respondents agreed either somewhat or strongly th at \"allowing Nurse Practitioners to practice independently would increase access to primary care in the US\" (RWJF, 2010e). As Figure 3-4 shows, however, physicians were more skeptical that expanding NPs' scope of practice in this way would decreas e costs, and they feared a decrease in average quality of care provided to patients. 20 Sermo.com respondents are all members of the on line community sermo.com. Sermo.com members are distributed across age, gender, geography, and specialty groups in patterns that mimic those of the U.S. population. For this study, respondents were randomly recruited to par ticipate in the IOM survey activity via e-mail; others were allowed to join the survey by volunteering when they visite d the site. The majority of respondents have specialties in cardiology (6 percent), family medicine (35 percent), internal medicine (26 percent), and oncology (4 percent). The remaining physicians surveyed are distributed across a wide range of specialties. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In addition to support for expanded scope of practice for NPs among some physicians, public support for NP practice is indicat ed by satisfaction ratings for retail-based health clinics. Approximately 95 percent of providers in these clinics are NPs, with the remaining 5 percent comprising physician assistants and some physicians.21 According to a survey of U.S. adults by the Wall Street Journal.com/Harris Interactive (H arris Interactive, 2008), almost all respondents who had used a retail-based health clinic (313 to tal) were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of care, cost, and staff qualifications (see Figure 3-5). Su ch public support can be backed up with high-quality clinical outcomes (M ehrotra et al., 2008). 21 Personal communication, Tine Hansen-Turton, CEO, National Nursing Centers Consortium, and Vice President, Public Health Management Corporation, August 6, 2010.

Percentages may not add up to 100 because of the small percentage not included here that chose \"not sure.\" Despite opposition by some physicians and specialty societies, the str ong trend over the past 20 years has been a growing receptivity on the part of state legislatures to expanded scopes of practice for nurses. There simply are not enough primary care physicians to care for an aging population now, and their patient load will drama tically increase as mo re people gain access to care. For example, in 2007 Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell announced a blueprint for reform, known as Rx for PA, to promote access to care for the state's resi dents and reduce health care expenses (see the case study in Chapter 5) . One initiative under Rx for PA was expanding the legal scope of practice for physician assistan ts, APRNs, CNSs, CNMs, and dental hygienists. This initiative has had an important impact on acce ss to care. Outcome data after the first year of Rx for PA show an increase in the number of people with diabetes receiving eye and foot examinations and a doubling of the number of child ren with asthma who have a plan in place for controlling exacerbations (Pennsyl vania Governor's Office, 2009). The experience of states that have led thes e changes offers impor tant reassurance to physicians who continue to believ e that patient care may be advers ely affected, or that expanded nursing practice autonomy threat ens the professional and economi c roles of physicians. States with broader nursing scopes of practice have experi enced no deterioration of patient care. In fact, patient satisfaction with the role of APRNs is very high. Nor has expansion of nursing scopes of practice diminished the critical role of physicians in patient car e or physician income (Darves, 2007). With regard to the quality of care and the role of physicians, it is difficult to distinguish states with restrictive and more expanded scopes of practice. Fi nally, the committee believes that the new medical home concept, based on profe ssional collaboration, represents a perfect opportunity for nurses and physicians to work to gether for the good of patient care in their community.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-26 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Fragmentation of the Health Care System The U.S. health care system is characterized by a high degree of fr agmentation across many sectors, which raises substantial barriers to build ing value. A fragmented health care system is characterized by weak connections among multip le component parts. Fragmentation makes simple tasks\u2014such as assigning responsibility fo r payment\u2014much more difficult than they need to be, while more complex tasks\u2014such as coor dination of home health care, family support, transportation, and social services after a hos pital stay\u2014become more difficult because they require following many separate sets of often contradictory rules. As a result, people may simply give up trying rather than take advantage of the services to which they are entitled. An examination of fragmentation in hospital services explores its or igins in American pluralism, historical accident, and the hybr idization of business and charity (Stevens, 1999). A review by Cebul and colleagues identifies thre e broad areas of fragmentation: (1) the U.S. health insurance system; (2) the provision of care; and (3) the inab ility of health information systems to allow a \"seamless flow of information between hospitals, providers and insurers\" (Cebul et al., 2008). In the United States, there is a disconnect between public and private services, between providers and patients, between what patients ne ed and how providers are trained, between the health needs of the nation and the services that are offered, and between those with insurance and those without (Stevens, 1999). Co mmunication between providers is difficult, and care is redundant because there is no means of sharing results. For example, a patient with diabetes covered by Medicaid may have di fficulty finding a physician to help him control his blood sugar. If he is able to find a physician, that individua l may not have admitting privileges at the hospital to which the patient is transported after a hypoglycemic reaction. After the patient has been admitted to the emergency room, a new cadre of physicians is responsible for him but has no information about previous blood sugar determina tions, other medications he is taking, or other health problems. The patient is stabilized and a discharge is arranged, but he is ineligible under his insurance plan for reimbursement for the fu rther education in diet and glucose control, materials (such as a glucometer), and referral to an ophthalmologist th at are indicated. Home follow-up is needed, but the visiti ng nurse agency is certified to pr ovide only two visits when the patient could use five. No one calls the initial primary care physician to share discharge planning or information, and no one gives the patient a summary of the visit to take to that physician. The ophthalmologist will not accept the patient because of his status as a Medicaid recipient. A major challenge to repairing this frag mentation lies in the fee-for-s ervice structure of the payment system, which indiscriminately rewards increasing volume of services regardless of whether it improves health outcomes or prov ides greater value (MedPAC, 2006). Effect of Fragmentation on Realizing the Value of Nurses Within this system, the contributions of nursing are doubly hidden. Accounting systems of most hospitals and health care organizations are not designed to capture or differentiate the economic value provided by nurses. Thus, all nursing care is treat ed equally in its effect on revenue. A 2007 review of 100 demonstration proj ects that provided incentives for high-value care to hospitals and physicians found no examples that specifi cally delineated or rewarded nurses' contributions (Kurtzman et al., 2008). Yet nurses' work is estimated to vary by 15 to 40 percent for any given diagnosis-related group (DRG) (Laport et al., 2008). The effect on the provision of health care is difficult to document, but a closer look at staffing ratios suggests some of the consequences. Generally speaking, as an analysis by the Lewin Group concludes, because PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-27 health care facilities cannot capture the full eco nomic value of the services nurses provide, they have an economic incentive\u2014whether they decide to heed it or not\u2014to st aff their organizations \"at levels below where the benefit to society equa ls the cost to employ an additional nurse\" (Dall et al., 2009). Barriers to measuring and realizing the economic value generated by nurs es exist outside the hospital setting as well. In many states, APRNs ar e not paid directly but must be reimbursed through the physician with whom they have a co llaboration agreement. Payments are funneled through the physician provider number, and the nurse is salaried. For years, professional nursing organizations ha ve sought to counter th e inequitable aspects of the fee-for-service payment system by lobbying to increase the types of services for which NPs can independently bill Medicare, Medicaid, and other providers. They have had some success in that regard in the past (Sullivan-Marx, 2008). However, according to Mark McClellan and Gail Wilensky, both former directors of CMS, this approach has become a losing proposition. As McClellan and Wilensky testifie d to the committee in September 2009, while fee-for-service is not going to di sappear any time soon, its future is severely limited in any sustainable health care system. Proposals to Address Fragmentation Alternative proposals for financ ing the health care system have coalesced around the idea of providing \"global payments\" that are shared am ong a predetermined group of providers, such as hospitals, physicians, nurses, social workers, nu tritionists, and other pr ofessionals, and \"bundled payments\" that are linked to a sing le episode of care, such as tr eatment of and recovery from a heart attack. A full exploration of all the benefits and caveats of such alternative payment proposals is beyond the scope of this report. However, as th e Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) noted in its June 2008 re port to Congress, \"Bundling payment raises a range of implementation issues because unde r bundled payment the entity accepting the payment\u2014rather than Medicare\u2014has discreti on in the amount it pays providers for care provided, whether to pay for services not now covered by Medicare, and how it rewards providers for reducing costs and improving qua lity\" (MedPAC, 2008). It will be up to the entity accepting payment to determine how and indeed wh ether to valuate nurses' contributions. Yet the tendency of human nature is to follow the practices and behaviors with which one is most familiar. Without the presence of nurses in deci sion-making positions in these new entities, the legacy of undervaluing nurses, characteristic of the fee-for-service system, will carry over into whatever new payment schemes are adopted. Th e services of nurses must be properly and transparently valued so that their contribu tions can fully benefit the entire system. Outdated Policies of Insurance Companies As noted in Chapter 2, many NPs and CNMs have cared for unders erved populations that are either uninsured or rely on Medi caid. Expanding their serv ices to the private insurance market is another matter altogether. The h ealth care reform experience of Massachusetts shows the extent to which corporate policy can negate governme nt regulation. An estimated 5,600 NPs work in Massachusetts (Pearson, 2010), falling under the au thority of the Commonwealth's Board of Nursing as well as its Board of Medicine. NPs are required to co llaborate with a physician and may prescribe drugs only under a written collaborative agreement with a physician (Christian et PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-28 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH al., 2007). The law allows them to act as primar y care providers (PCPs), and the Massachusetts Medicaid program formally named NPs as PCPs. Despite the shortage of PCPs th at occurred after the Massachuse tts legislature enacted health care reform in 2006, no private insurance companies listed NPs as PCPs in Massachusetts. As a matter of policy, one major New England carrier stat ed that it would not list NPs as PCPs unless required to do so by the legislature. This same carrier, however, listed NPs as PCPs in its service directories for the neighboring states of New Hampshire and Ma ine. Eventually, Massachusetts passed a second health care reform law in 2008 that amended the state's insurance regulations to recognize NPs as PCPs in the private as well as the public market. Massachusetts was thereby able to expand the supply of its PCPs without changing its scope-of-practice laws (Craven and Ober, 2009). The policy differences among states may have to do with different scope-of- practice regulations or differences in the states' in surance industries. There is some evidence that insurers are more likely to rec ognize NPs as PCPs in states wher e NPs have independent practice authority (Hansen-Turton et al., 2008). The actions of private insurance companie s toward APRNs are having an effect on government-funded programs as well. Nurse-ma naged health centers (NMHCs) have long provided care for populations se rved by Medicare, Me dicaid, and children' s health insurance programs. However, federal and state governments are increasingly turning to the private sector to manage these programs (Hansen-Turton et al ., 2006). The insurance companies' continued policy of not credentia ling and/or recognizing NPs as PC Ps\u2014and the federal government's refusal to mandate that they do so\u2014creates a barr ier for NMHCs as they seek to continue serving these populations (Hansen-Turton et al., 2006). One specific model of the medical/health home\u2014the Patient-Centered Medical HomeTM (PCMH)\u2014does not permit management by nurses. In other words, a nurse may manage an organization that in every way adheres to the principles of PCMHs, but the practice will not be recognized as a PCMH by NCQA, a \"not-for-profit or ganization dedicated to improving health care quality\" (NCQA, 2010). Without public rec ognition, nurse-led medical/health homes cannot qualify for insurance reimbursement, which in turn leaves substantial po pulations underserved. NCQA, which administers the recognition for the medical homes, is a physician-dominated organization receiving its member dues from physicians. Its board, although currently reconsidering its stance on whether NPs can lead me dical homes, has decided that physicians are more able to serve in PCMH leadership positions. The original concept for the medical home came from physicians, and NCQA adopt ed their principles of operation. 22 Several state agencies have contacted NCQA to request that it recognize NPs' ability to lead PCMHs. NCQA has appointed an advisory committee to review the policy that medica l homes must be physician led. Meanwhile, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizat ions is developing a competitive certification program that will allow for leadership by NPs.23 22 Personal communication, Greg Pawlson, Executive Vice President, NCQA, January 5, 2010. 23 Personal communication, Greg Pawlson, Executive Vice President, NCQA, January 5, 2010.

It will be just as important that the system have enough nurses at any given time. Both having enough nurses and having the right kind of highly skil led nurses will contribute to the ove rall safety and quality of a transformed system. Although the committee did not focus solely on the upcoming shortage of nurses, it did devote time to considering how to retain experienced nurses and faculty. Some solutions have been researched, proposed, and reproposed for so long that it is difficult to understand why they have not yet been implemented more widely. High turnover rates continue to destabilize the nurse wo rkforce in the United States and other countries (Hayes et al., 2006). Figure 3-6 indicates some of the reasons th at have been cited for not working in the nursing profession. For nurses under 50, personal or fa mily reasons were most frequently cited.

The litera ture shows that the workplace environment plays a major role in nurse turnover rates (Hay es et al., 2006; Tai et al., 1998; Yin and Yang, 2002). Staff shortages, increasing workloads, ine fficient work and technology processes, and the absence of effective pathways for nurses to pr opose and implement improvements all have a negative impact on job satisfacti on and contribute to the decision to leave. Tables 3-3 and 3-4, respectively, show the intentions of nurses with regard to thei r employment situation (e.g., plan to leave current job) and the percentage of nurses who left their job in 2007 2008, by setting. New research has also highlighted the contribution to the problem of disruptive behavior\u2014 ranging from verbal abuse to physical assault or sexual harassment of nurses, often by physicians but also by other nurses (Rosen stein and O'Daniel, 2005, 2008). For more than a quarter century, blue ribbon commissions and polic y experts have concluded that wide-reaching changes in nurses' practice environments would significantly reduce their high turnover rates and improve productivity (Aiken and Cheung, 2008).

Much of the data showing the impact of reducing tur nover by focusing on workplace environment comes from the acute care setting. Nonetheless, these da ta are instructive in their demonstration of a triple win: improving the workplace environment reduces nurse turnover, lowers costs, and improves health outcomes of patients. For ex ample, the Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) initiative is a national program that engages nurses to lead process improvement efforts so as to improve health outcomes for patients, reduce costs, and improve nurse retention (Bolton and Aronow, 2009). TCAB relies on nurses deve loping small tests of change that are continuously planned, assessed, and rapidly adop ted or dropped, with each round building on previous successes. According to Bolton and Ar onow (2009), as the TCAB principles and locally proposed and tested interventions spread throughout Cedars-Sinai Hospital, administrators noted the emergence of \"a culture that emphasizes performance improvement and value-adding activities on nursing units.\" Physician nurse rounding, physician nurse education teams, recognition programs, and collaborative effort s of nursing staff with other, non-nursing departments were the major reason, the authors be lieve, behind a decrease in nurse turnover rates from 7 percent in 2004 to 3 percent in 2008. Some employers have also discovered that making it easier for nurses to obtain advanced degrees while continuing to work has increased retention rates. Chapter 4 includes an example of this phenomenon from the Carondelet Health Ne twork in Tucson, Arizona. Based on workforce data Carondelet regularly colle cts for use in its strategic pl anning, the network has concluded that its educational efforts have had a positive effect on recruiting and retention. Its percentage of staff (as opposed to contract) nurses has increas ed from 81.7 to 89.2 percent. Because so many newly graduated nurses have begun seeking work at Carondelet, the average age of its staff nurses fell from 50 years in 2004 to 4 5.2 years in 2007 (The Lewin Group, 2009). Difficulties of Transition to Practice High turnover rates among newly graduated nurses highlight th e need for a greater focus on managing the transition from school to practice (Kovner et al., 2007). Some turnover is to be expected\u2014and is even appropriate if new nurses discover they are not really suited to the care setting or employer they have chosen. However, some entry-level nurses who leave first-time hospital jobs leave the pr ofession entirely, a situation that need s to be avoided when possible. In a 2007 survey of entry-level nurses, those who had already left their first job cited reasons such as poor management, stress, and a desire for experi ence in a different clin ical area (Kovner et al., 2007). In 2002, the Joint Commission recommended th e development of nurse residency programs\u2014planned, comprehensive periods of tim e during which nursing graduates can acquire the knowledge and skills to deliver safe, quality care that meets defined (organization or professional society) standards of practice. This recommendation was most recently endorsed by the 2009 Carnegie study on the nursing prof ession (Benner et al., 2009). Versant 24 and other organizations have launched successful transitio n-to-practice residency programs for nurses in recent years, while the University Health System Consortium (UHC) and the American Association of Colleges of Nurs ing (AACN) have developed a m odel for postbaccalaureate nurse residencies (Goode and Williams, 2004; Krugman et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2007). The 24 Versant is a nonprofit organization that provides, supervises, and evaluates nurse transition-to-practice residency programs for children's and general acute care hospitals.

Thes e needs included developing skills in ways to organize work and establish priorities; communicate with physicians, other professionals as well as patients and their families. In addition, nurse s and employers indicated the need for nurses to develop leadership and te chnical skills in order to provide quality care. (B eecroft et al., 2001, 2004; Halfer and Graf, 2006). As an example, in one hospital, the total cost for a residency program is $93,100, with a cost per resident of $2,023.91. Given that th e average cost of replacing just one new graduate RN is $45,000, a return on investment can be significantly dependent on a reduction in RN turnover (AAN, 2010a). The AACN has also adopted accreditation st andards for these programs (AACN, 2008). Meanwhile, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, after reviewing the evidence in favor of nursing residencies, has developed a regulatory model for transition-to-practice programs, recommending that state boards of nursing enforce a transition program through licensure (NCSBN, 2008b). Residencies Outside of Acute Care Residency programs are supported predominantly in hospitals and larger health systems, with a focus on acute care. This has been the area of greatest need since most new graduates gain employment in acute care settings, and the propor tion of new hires (and nu rsing staff) that are new graduates is rapidly increasi ng (Kovner et al., 2007). It is essent ial, however, that residency programs outside of acute care se ttings be developed and evaluated. Chapter 2 documents the demographic changes on the horizon; the shif t of care from hospital to community-based settings; and the need for nursing expertise in chr onic illness management, care of older adults in home settings, and transitional services. In this context, nurses need to be prepared for new roles outside of the acute care setting. It follows that new types of residency programs appropriate for these types of roles need to be developed.25 Several community care organizations are alre ady acting on their own perceived need for a residency-type program lasting 3 months or l onger for new employees. At the Visiting Nurse Services of New York, nurses receive a great deal of education and training on the job. New nurses with a bachelor's degree pa rticipate in an internship th at provides hands-on experience and mentoring from experienced staff that prep ares them for home-based nursing. \"We really have to do a lot of our own education and training to compensate for the fact that most of the nurses don't come with the experience, the comp etencies, or the comfort and confidence with technology that we think they need,\" said Caro l Raphael, the organization's president and CEO (IOM, 2010a). There are a few successful transition-to-practi ce initiatives in the fi eld of public health, although they are commonly called internships, orientations, or mentoring programs. For example, the North Carolina State Health Department has begun a pilot effort with four public health departments in an effort to educat e new nurses about populat ion-based health. The 6-month mentoring program is being used as a recruitment and retenti on tool and has very explicit objectives, including an increase in retention and under standing of population health and 25 This paragraph draws on a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Transforming Pre-licensure Nursing Education: Preparing the New Nurse to Meet Emerging H ealth Care Needs,\" prepared by Christine A. Tanner, Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing (see Appendix I on CD-ROM). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Two public health departments and three community health centers not only collaborated to diversify the nurses entering public and community health settings, but also offered them paid traineeships to transition into their settings. Th e public health departme nts partnered with the Wisconsin Center for Nursing and a collaborative of five baccalaureate schools of nursing to first boost the community health curriculum in those schools and then help with the development of the internship upon graduation for 17 nurses. The program has been successful in recruiting more minorities into community and public health settin gs with the knowledge they need to practice successfully outside of the acute care setting. Financia l support was secured from a variety of sources, including foundations, corp orations, and partnership members themselves. The program is new and is currently undergoing an evaluatio n to determine its financial sustainability.27 Such programs are not widespread, however, and need to be. Evidence in Support of Residencies Much of the evidence supporting the success of residencies ha s been produced through self- evaluations by the residency programs themselves . For example, Versant has demonstrated a profound reduction in turnover rates for new graduate RNs\u2014from 35 to 6 percent at 12 months and from 55 to 11 percent at 24 months\u2014compared with new graduate RN control groups hired at a facility prior to implemen tation of the residency program (Versant, 2010). Other research suggests residencies may be useful to help new graduates transition into practice settings (Goode et al., 2009; Krozek, 2008). The UHC/AACN nurse residency program describ ed above also reports reduced rates of turnover and cites cost savings to its participants. According to the UHC (2009) and AACN,28 since 2002 the program: saved participating organizations over $6 milli on per year on the costs of turnover for a first-year nurse (the cost to recruit and retain a replacement nurse was estimated at $88,000); increased its retention rate from 87 percent in 2004 to 94 percent in 2009; increased stability in staffing levels, thereby reducing stress, improving morale, increasing efficiency, and promoting safety; achieved a return on investme nt of up to 14:1; and helped first-year nurses in the program achieve the following: develop their ability in clinical decision-making, develop clinical autonomy in providing patient care, incorporate research-based evid ence into their practices, and increase commitment to nursing as a career. 26 Personal communication, Joy Reed, Head, Public Health Nursing for the NC Division of Public Health, August 24, 2010. 27 See http://pindev.forumone.com/faye-mcbeath-founda tion-with-greater-milwaukee-foundation-northwestern- mutual-foundation-wisconsin-2/. 28 This section also draws on a June 2010 personal communication with Geraldine Bednash, CEO, AACN.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-34 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The committee focused its attention on reside ncies for newly licensed RNs because these residencies have been most studied. Looking forward, however, the committee acknowledges the need for RNs with more experience to take part in residency programs as well. Such programs may be necessary to help nurses transition from, for example, the acute care to the community setting. As a growing number of nurses pursue advanced practice degr ees immediately after receiving a bachelor's degree\u2014wi th no break between for employme nt in a clinical setting\u2014the benefit to APRNs of completing a residency is likely to grow as well. The committee believes that regardless of where the re sidency takes place\u2014whether in the acute care setting or the community\u2014nurses should be paid a salary, a lthough the committee does not take a position on whether this should be a full or reduced salary. Loan repayment and educational debt should be postponed during residency, especially if a reduced salary is offered. At the committee's December 2009 Forum on th e Future of Nursing: Care in the Community, Margaret Flinter, vice president and clinical director, Community Health Center, Inc., spoke about her organization's decision to develop nurse residenc y programs for APRNs. The intensity and demands of providing service in the complex setting of a federally qualified health center (FQHC), Flinter testified, often di scourage newly graduated NPs from joining an FQHC and the clinics from hiring newly graduate d NPs. In 2006, she continued, her organization started the country's firs t formal NP residency training program . The goal was to ensure that new NPs would find the training and tr ansition support they needed to be successful as PCPs. The program is a 12-month, full-time, intensive residency that provides extensive precepting, specialty rotations, and additional didactic education in the high-risk/high-burden problems commonly seen in FQHCs. The NP residents are trained in a chronic care/planned care approach that features both prevention a nd chronic disease management, a dvance access to eliminate waits and delays, integrated behavioral health and primary care, and expe rt use of the el ectronic health record. In Flinter's view and that of her organi zation, the initial year of residency training is essential to transitioning a new NP into a fully accountable PCP (Flinter, 2009). And indeed, the ACA allocates $200 million from 2012 to 2015 as part of a demonstration project that will pay hospitals for the costs of clinical training to pr epare APRNs with the skil ls necessary to provide primary and preventive care, transitional care, chronic care management, and other nursing services appropriate for the Medicare population. Residency provides a continuing opportunity to apply importa nt knowledge for the purpose of remaining a safe and competent provider in a continuous learning environment. Paying for residencies is a challenge, but the committee believes that funds received from Medicare can be used to help with these costs. In 2006, about ha lf of all Medicare nursing funding went to five states that have the most hospital-based diploma nursing programs (Aiken et al., 2009). The diploma programs in these states directly bene fit from receiving these funds. Most states, however, and most hospitals do not receive Medicare funding for nursing education. The committee believes it would be more equitable to spread these funds more widely and use it for residency programs that would be valu able for all nurses across the country. Demographic Challenges As discussed in Chapter 2, the population of the United States is growing older and is becoming increasingly diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and language. To achieve the goal of increasing access to high-quality, culturally rele vant care among the diverse populations in the United States, the nursing prof ession must increase its appeal to young people, men, and nonwhite racial/ethnic groups.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-35 An Aging Workforce Like the U.S. population, the nurse workforce co ntinues to grow older. Over the past three decades, there has been a profound shift in the age composition of nurses. In 1983, approximately 50 percent (596,000 full-time equivale nts [FTEs]) of the workforce was between the ages of 20 and 34, while only 17 percent (202,000 FTEs) was over the age of 50. Since the 1980s, the number of FTEs in the nursing workforce has doubled, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of middle-aged and older RNs. From 1983 to 2009, the number of nurses over age 50 more than quadrupled, and th e number of middle-aged nurses (aged 35 49) doubled to approximately 39 percent (977,000). These older and middle-aged nurses now represent almost three-quarters of the nursing workforce, while nurses younger than 34 now make up only 26 percent (Buerhaus et al., 2009a). Figure 3-7 shows the age shift in the nursing workforce that has occurred over the past two decades. FIGURE 3-7 Age distribution of registered nurses, 1980 2008. SOURCE: HRSA, 2010. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-36 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The figure shows that since 1980, the nursing wo rkforce has grown older, as reflected by more RNs reporting that they fall within the older age categories with each successive survey. At the same time, the figure indicates that in both 2004 and especia lly 2008, the number of young RNs in the workforce was growing relative to earlie r years. This increase may reflect, in part, the impact of the Johnson & Johnson Campaign for Nursing's Future, which launched a large national media initiative in 2002 aimed at attracting people in to nursing. As other similar recruitment initiatives followed, more, younger pe ople chose to become nurses, reversing a 20-year trend of declining entr y into nursing by young people. The shift in the age composition of the nursing wo rkforce can be attributed in part to the large number of baby boomers who became RNs in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by much smaller cohorts in the later decad es (Buerhaus et al., 2009a). These smaller cohorts were a result of not only the decrease in births, but also a de crease in interest in the profession during the 1980s and 1990s when women began entering other professions that had typically been dominated by men (Staiger et al., 2000). The phys ician workforce has also been aging, but in much smaller numbers. Figure 3-8 compares the av erage age of nurses with varying levels of education with that of physicians and physic ian faculty. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of physicians aged 50 64 grew by 77,000 FTEs, while the number of RNs in that same age group grew by almost five times as many (368,000 FTEs) (S taiger et al., 2009). Comp ared with the size of the nursing workforce, however, the size of the physician workforce is less dependent on interest in profession. The supply of physicians is influenced more by institutional factors that govern the number of available slots in medical schools and residency programs. For example, the supply of physicians was deliberately expande d in the 1960s with the introduction of the Medicare and Medicaid programs but has remained fairly constant since then. This pattern has resulted in large successive cohorts of physic ians who are replacing smaller groups of retiring physicians (Staiger et al., 2009). As the coming decades unfold, nurses and physicians will continue to age. Many of the large numbers of older RNs will retire, and increasi ng numbers of middle-aged RNs will enter their 50s. Although the number of younger RNs has recen tly begun to grow, the increase is not expected to be large enough to offset the numbe r of RNs anticipated to retire over the next 15 years (Buerhaus et al., 2009b). To fill gaps created by retirement and the increasing demand for nursing services, resulting in part from an aging population and increased rates of insurance coverage, the nursing workforce will need to expand by attracting younger individuals into the profession\u2014a challenge that has been more diff icult for the nursing profession than it has been for medicine (Kimball and O'Neil, 2002). Gender Diversity Throughout much of the 20th century, the nursi ng profession was composed mainly of women. While the absolute numbe r of men who become nurses ha s grown dramatically in the last two decades, from 45,060 in 1980 to 168,181 in 2004 (HRSA, 2006), men still make up just over 7 percent of all RNs (HRSA, 2010). Overal l, male RNs tend to be younger than female RNs, with an average age of 44.6 years. Men are also more likely to begin their careers with slightly more advanced nursing degrees (HRSA, 2006).

NOTE: MD = doctor of medicine; LPN = licensed practical nurse; NP = nurse practitioner; RN = registered nurse. SOURCE: Based on for MD faculty, (AAMC, 2009). Efforts to recruit more men into the civilia n nursing profession have had minimal success, and a body of research indicates gender-based reasons for entering the nursing profession. The evidence is generally thin, but me n tend to list factors associated with security and professional growth that led them to the nursing profession: salary, ease of obtaining work, job security, and opportunities for leadership. By contrast, women tend to list factors th at represent social encouragement from family or friends (Zysbe rg and Berry, 2005). While more men are being drawn to nursing, especially as a second career, the profe ssion needs to continue efforts to recruit men; their unique perspectives and skills are im portant to the profession and will help contribute additional diversity to the workforce. Racial and Ethnic Diversity To better meet the current a nd future health needs of the public and to provide more culturally relevant care, the current nursing workfo rce will need to grow more diverse. Previous IOM reports have found that greater racial and et hnic diversity among prov iders leads to stronger relationships with patients in nonwhite communiti es. These reports argue that the benefits of such diversity are likely to be felt across health professions and to grow as the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse (IOM, 2004, 2006). The IOM's report Unequal Treatment: Addressing Racial and Ethnic Di sparities in Health Care identifies the diversification of the health care workforce as an important step toward responding to racial a nd ethnic disparities in the health care system (IOM, 2003). Because nurses make up the largest proportion of the health care workforce and work across virtually ev ery health care and community-based setting, changing the demographic composition of nurses has the potential to effect changes in the face of health care in America.

The 2008 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) documented the lack of diversity in the nursing workforce, with 5.4 percent of nurses describing themselves as Black/African American, 3.6 percent as Hispan ic/Latino, 5.8 percent as Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.3 pe rcent as American Indian/Ala ska Native, and 1.7 percent as multiracial (HRSA, 2010).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-39 Numerous programs nationwide are aimed at incr easing the number of health professionals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups. One program that seeks to increase diversity while also responding to the he alth needs of underserved populations is the Harambee Nursing Center (HNC) in Louisville, Kentucky (AAN, 2010c). The name refers to an African tribal word that means \"let's pull together.\" HNC was founded in 2003 by the University of Louisville School of Nursing, in partnership with the University of Louisville hospital and several religious groups, \"to improve the health of the appr oximately 11,000 low-income, primarily African- American, urban, underserved Smoketown-Shel by Park-Phoenix Hill neighborhood\" (Roberts and Hayes, 2005). It is managed by nurses with the help of a vol unteer family practice physician. Since its inception, a goal of the program has included attracting greate r numbers of minority persons into nursing and other health professions a nd providing opportuniti es to enhance the cultural competence of nursing students and faculty.29 Strategies to increas e diversity in nursing include: providing supervised clinical experiences for nursing and other health professional students at HNC; offering group educational programs to comm unity members and persons working in community agencies and one-to-one ment oring of community residents who are interested in a nursing career (which include s providing clinical experiences, taking participants to planning meetings, having them talk directly to student advisers at the School of Nursing, arranging experiences at the hospital or nursing home, and holding conversations with interested persons); creating structured opportunities for nursing students and faculty to be engaged in service to the community so they can begin to comp rehend the life experiences of the residents and be more sensitive to their needs when advising and creating recruitment programs; distributing literature an d pictures related to the history of African Americans in nursing; and collaborating with other community agenci es to include nursing education and career options in their educatio nal and jobs programs. Outcomes cited by Dr. Roberts include the following: Nursing careers and educational pathways ar e now formally included in job-related programs implemented by the Presbyterian Community Center (PCC). For example, over the past 2 years, PCC has selected 50 community residents into the Changemaker program, which targets 19- to 25-year-olds to engage them in self-discovery, goal setting, and progress toward career goals, with the condition of giving back to the community. Each year about four to six Changemake rs examine health careers in depth. HNC included nursing and health careers in the pr oposal that funded this pathway and provides supervised clinical experiences, mentoring, part-time job opportuni ties where possible, and education about nursing. Arrangements have been made to connect interested residents with entry into a medical assistant program that provides articulation to associate's degree education and then 29 This section draws on a September 8, 2010 personal communication with Kay T.

The University of Louisville School of Nurs ing hosts a recruitment booth at the Annual Health Fair at HNC. Community health students and faculty now pr ovide education at the community middle school regarding careers in nursing. Based on HNC's feedback to the School of Nurs ing, criteria for selec tion of students into the RNBSN program are under scrutiny. Last y ear no African American student was accepted. One of HNC's mentorees missed sele ction by only a few poi nts. Dialogue with faculty led to an examination of policies that resulted in the omission of minority students. Literally hundreds of undergraduate and gr aduate nursing students (from several academic institutions) have supervised lear ning experiences in the community. These include at least 10 undergraduate community health nursing students each semester, a class of 30 graduate nursing stude nts enrolled in a health pr omotion class each year, and 2 or more NP students based in the clinic each semester. About 5 NP and 10 undergraduate students particip ate in a Back to School ev ent each fall where Harambee offers school physicals and immunizations fo r underserved middle sc hool students. Each year 2 to 4 graduate nursing students serve as research or progra m assistants and/or researchers, and nursing students in the PhD program engage in research-related projects. Conclusion: Demographic Challenges The nurse workforce is slowly becoming more diverse, and the proporti on of racially and ethnically diverse nursing graduates has increased by 10 percent in the last two decades, growing from 12.3 to 22.5 percent (HRSA, 2010). Nonethel ess, additional commitments are needed to further increase the diversity of the nurse workfor ce. Steps should be taken to recruit, retain, and foster the success of diverse individuals. One way to accomplish this is to increase the diversity of the nursing student body, an issue addressed in Chapter 4. The combin ation of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and life experien ces provides individuals with unique perspectives that can contribute to advancing the nursing profession and providing better care to patients. NEW STRUCTURES, NEW OPPORTUNITIES The ACA will bring new opportunities to overcome some of the barriers discussed above and use nurses in new and expanded capaci ties. This section offers a brie f look at four of the current initiatives\u2014the accountable care organization (ACO), the medi cal/health home, the community health center (CHC), and the NMHC\u2014that are designed to imple ment these changes at an affordable price regardless of whet her the providers involved are part of a large, integrated health care organization like the VA, Geisi nger, or Kaiser Permanente. All four initiatives have shown enough promise that they were selected to receive additional financial support under the ACA. Depending on their outcomes, these exemplars ma y lead the way to broader changes in the health care system. Given this possibility, the creation of the new Cent er for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Department of He alth and Human Services may prove to be one of the most important provisions of the AC A (Whelan and Russell, 2010). The Center is designed \"to test innova tive payment and service delivery models to reduce program PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They can also terminate or m odify programs that are not working well. These types of decisions had previously been allowed only after congressional action. The committee offers no predictions as to which combination, if any, of these four exemplars\u2014ACOs, medical/health homes, CHCs , and NMHCs\u2014will best succeed at meeting patients' needs. However, it wishes to emphasi ze to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that each of these four initiatives depends on high-functioning, interprofessional teams in which the competencies and skills of a ll nurses, including APRNs, can be more fully utilized. New models of care, st ill to be developed, ma y deliver care that is better and more efficient than that provided by these four ini tiatives. Nursing, in collaboration with other professions, should be a part of the design of these initiatives by shaping and leading solutions. Innovative solutions are most lik ely to emerge if researchers from the nursing field work in partnership with other professiona ls in medicine, business, tec hnology, and law to create them. Accountable Care Organizations The ACO is a legally defined entity consis ting of a group of primary care providers, a hospital, and perhaps some specialists who share in the risk as well as the rewards of providing quality care at a fixed reimbursement rate (Fisher et al., 2009; MedPAC, 2009). (The use of the phrase \"primary care ACO professionals\" in th e ACA is inclusive of APRNs as well as physicians.) Payment for this set of services, as provided for in the ACA, will move beyond the traditional fee-for-service system and may include shared savings payments or capitated payments for all services. The goal of this paymen t structure is to encourage the ACO to improve the quality of the care it provide s and increase care coordinati on while containing growth. ACOs that use APRNs and other nurses to the full extent of their educati on and training in such roles as health coaching, chronic disease management, tran sitional care, prevention activities, and quality improvement will most likely benefit from provi ding high-value and more accessible care that patients will find to be in their best interest. Medical/Health Homes The concept of a medical home was first develo ped by pediatricians in the late 1960s (AAP, 1967). The original impetus was to create a sing le place to house all of individual children's medical records\u2014particularly children with special health needs who often must see multiple clinicians (Sia et al., 2004). Over the years, however, the term \"medical home\" has evolved to refer to a specific type of primary care practi ce that coordinates and provides comprehensive care; promotes a strong relationship between patient and provider; measures, monitors, and improves the quality of care; and is not necessarily limited to children. Medical homes play a prominent role in the ACA, but the law is not consistent in its terminology for them. In various places, the ACA refers to \"medical homes,\" \"health homes,\" and even PCMH recognized by NCQA. The ACA indicates that medical/health homes should be supported by community-based interprofessional teams or \"health teams\" that include physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. 31 30 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , HR 3590 \u00a7 3021, 111th Congress. 31 Patient 3590 Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-42 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The medical/health home concept has been adopted and adapted in several ways. The latest phase of the broader nursing stra tegy at the VA, for example, consists of the implementation of a medical home model with expanded roles fo r RNs. Previously, primary care providers (physicians and NPs) at the VA felt that they were not receiving enough professional support to do their jobs effectively. The new strategy calls for including staff nurses on the primary care teams. \"This is not your typical staff nurse role in primary care settings,\" said Catherine Rick, chief nursing officer of the VA.32 What the staff nurse brings to primary care that has not been there before is the provision of chronic care management, care coordination, health risk appraisal, health promotion, and disease prev ention. Work on rolling out the VA's medical home model began in August 2009, and th e program was officially la unched in April 2010. The case study in Box 3-3 illustrates how the medical home concept is being applied in the VA health system. BOX 3-3 The Patient-Centered Medical Home A TEAM APPROACH TO PRIMARY CARE FOR VETERANS We realized that we needed to dedicate additional serv ices to being patient-centered, or what I prefer to call patient-driven\u2014really engaging patients in shared decision-making, developing a plan of care that is based on their informed decisions and their individual preferences. \u2014Catherine Rick, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, FACHE, chief nursing officer, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs When a veteran with diabetes who was experienc ing hyperglycemia visited the Overton Brooks VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, a nurse prac titioner (NP) made adjustments to his medications. But that visit was different from others he had ma de: he also talked with a team of providers about exercise, diet, and blood glucose self-monitoring, and they discussed what support he would need to make changes in these areas as well. After 2 weeks, Helen Rasmussen, BSN, RN, CDE, a care manager in primary care at the facility, called the patient, who reported his daily blood glucose levels. An NP made further medication adjustments, and Ms. Rasmussen called again in 2 weeks. \"The results were much improved, and he was very happy that he didn't have to come in to see a provider each time for these changes,\" she said. Ms. Rasmussen has been a primary care nurse with t he U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for more than 12 years, and until recently, she said, s he would not have had the time to make those follow- up calls; her caseload would have been too high. But in 2009 VA secretary Eric Shinseki announced a major push toward more \"veteran-centered care\" for the 6 million veterans using the system (VA, 2009). One element of that new initiative is the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH). The PCMH is not a new concept. Four decades after the American Academy of Pediatrics developed the concept of a medical home, however, its meaning has evolved. Many now think of the PCMH as a \"health home\"\u2014a team approach to primary care that involves better care coordination and information systems (including the electronic health record) and gi ves patients greater access to care and to their providers (including e-mail exchanges). The patient is necessarily at the center of decision making. The VA's nearly 65,000 licensed nurses are fundamental to this approach at the VA. \"We decided to have a full-time RN [registered nurse] care manager fo r every full-time care provider,\" said Catherine Rick, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, FACHE, the VA's chief nursing services officer.

At t he VA, the clinical nurse leader over sees the care provided by more than one team, while the RN care manager focuses on the care provided by just his or her team. The VA intends to employ clinical nurse leaders in all of its medical centers by 2016 (ONS, 2009). Too few support staff may prevent some facilitie s from implementing the PCMH, said Colette S. Torres, MSN, RN, CCM, associate director of primary care, Robert J. Dole VA Medical Center, Wichita, Kansas, until savings from reduced rates of hospita lization are realized. Also, the VA is measuring outcomes of the PCMH, but data have not yet been released. Ms. Torres said that what she particularly apprecia tes about this model \"is that we carry our patients through acute and chronic issues.\" Under the old mo del, when a veteran was hospitalized, the primary care providers would wait to see the patient. Now, sh e said, they visit a veteran in the hospital. \"We go up and say, 'How are you doing? We're not here to provi de your care; we're here because we're a part of your team.' And they absolutely love it.\" Community Health Centers CHCs have a long track records of providing high-value, quality primary and preventive care in poor and underserved parts of the United States. Many also offe r dental, mental health, and substance abuse and pharmacy services as well. CHCs generally are very team oriented and depend on nurses to deliver services. Nurses prov ide primary care, preventive services, and home visits, and many serve in administrative and leadership positions. At present, 20 million Americans receive care at CHCs in 7,500 communities (NACHC, 2009). CHC patients are less likely to have unmet medical needs, visit the em ergency department for nonurgent care, or need hospitalization relative to the general population. A 2007 repor t by the National Association of Community Health Centers found th at medical expenses for patient s who receive the majority of their care at a CHC are 41 percen t lower ($1,810 per person) than t hose for comparable patients who receive most of their care elsewhere (NACHC et al., 2007). As a result, the organization estimates that CHCs save the health care system $9.9 17.6 billion a year (NACHC, 2009). In 2002, the Bush Administration began a signif icant expansion of th e CHC program, which began in the 1960s as part of the \"war on pove rty.\" The program received another big boost in 2009 with a $2 billion investment as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act . And in 2010, as part of the ACA, Congress allocated an additional $11 billion in funds to further expand the program (Whelan, 2010). Nurse-Managed Health Centers NMHCs have provided care for populations se rved by Medicare, Medicaid, and children's health insurance programs, as well as the uninsured, since the 1960s. There are 250 NMHCs across the United States serving 1.5 million medical ly underserved people, nearly half of whom are uninsured (NNCC, 2005). As the name implies, they are run by nurses\u2014although many employ physicians, social workers, health educators, and outreach workers as members of a collaborative health team. Services generally include comprehensive primary care, family planning, prenatal services, mental/behavioral he alth care, and health promotion and disease prevention. The majority of NMHCs are affiliated with a nursing school and about half with a PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

NMHCs report that their clients make 15 percent fewer emergency de partment visits than the general population, have 35 40 percent fewer nonmaternity hospital days, and spend 25 percent less on prescriptions (NNCC, 2005). The ACA authorizes an additi onal $50 million in 2010 and \"such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2011 through 2014\" 33 to NMHCs that offer primary care to low-income and medically underserved patie nts, although as of this writing, this fund specifically for NMHCs has not been allocated. The case study presented in Box 3-4 shows how an NMHC worked with community leaders to re duce health disparities in an underserved poor neighborhood in Philadelphia. ing BOX 3-4 11th Street Family Health Services of Drexel University A NURSE -MANAGED HEALTH CENTER REDUCES HEALTH DISPARITIES IN PHILADELPHIA I describe the center as a healthy-livi ng center. And that is what the resi dents wanted. It's not just access to clinical services. It's providing opportunity for a neighborhood that doesn't have a lot of opportunity for people to get healthier. \u2014Patricia Gerrity, PhD, RN, FAAN, director, Eleventh Str eet Family Health Services of Drexel University, Philadelphia Lisa Scardigli, age 44, has suffered periodically from spasticity, a symptom of the multiple sclerosis she has lived with for more than 20 years. She had been receiving physical therapy at 11th Street Family Health Services in Philadelphia when she had a pump implanted for spinal infusion of a drug that reduces spasticity. But the pump's catheter punctured in late 2009, and she was hospitalized for several weeks. When she returned to 11th Street, she said, she got \"holy heck\" from the staff there; they had been worried about her. \"Even the people at the front desk were up in arms over the fact that I didn't call,\" Ms. Scardigli said. \"It went from the physical therapist to the primary care person to the security guard. I was actually missed.\" This is a small story, but it illustrates a big reason for this health center's success: it not only serves its community (there were 26,000 clinical visits in 2009); it also creates community. And that may have something to do with the fact that it is run by nurses. This nurse-managed health center provides primar y care and other services in a neighborhood in North Philadelphia where most of the 6,000 residents are African Am erican, have low incomes, and are medically underserved. Nurse practitioners (NPs) and social workers make up teams that are augmented as needed by physicians, nutritionists, and others. Having been launched in 1998 in a recreation center, 11th Street is now a federally qualified health center housed in a $3.3 million, 17,000-square-foot facility, with a staff of 53. The center's work began gradually, as a joint projec t of the Philadelphia Housing Authority and Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions. In 1996 director Patricia Gerrity, PhD, RN, FAAN, placed a public health nurse at each of four hous ing developments in the neighborhood. The nurses responded to residents' immediate concerns: the need for stop signs, animal control, food assistance, and training in CPR. \"Over that first year or two we gained the trust of the residents because we weren't defining the issues; they were,\" Dr. Gerrity said . \"And it showed that we were making a long-term commitment.\" From there, she met with area representatives to discover their visions for the community. They wanted a health care center, they said, one they could access rega rdless of their ability to pay. A community advisory board was formed, and the search for funding began. (Over the years the center has received funding from federal, state, and private sources.) 33 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Academy of Sciences.

Each person learns something a bout the other person's discipline, and it enriches their own practice,\" Dr. Gerrity said. For example, behavioral health care has been incorporated into every primary care visit, with NPs and social workers closely collaborating. The range of services provided is remarkably dive rse. Patients like Ms. Scardigli undergo physical therapy. Patients with diabetes join cooking classes that make use of locally grown produce. First-time mothers receive home visits through the Nurse-Family Partnership. Six to eight mother-infant pairs meet through the Centering Parenting program. A fitness cent er with a full-time personal trainer is on site, full dental care is available, and chronic illn ess management groups provide peer support. Unpublished outcome data for patients with diabetes show that in an 18-month period, the proportion who had glycosylated hemoglobin levels below 7 percent doubled and that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure levels fell as well. Also seen were reductions in depression and low-birth- weight infants and increases in immunization and breast cancer screening. Access to payment for care coordination through medical home designation is important to the center's sustainability. Despite meet ing the criteria set by the National Committee for Quality Assurance for qualifying as a Patient-Centered Medical Home, 11th Street was denied the designation because it is led by nurses rather than physicians\u2014an issue for the 250 nurse-managed heal th centers across the nation. Lisa Scardigli is so impressed by all the center does that she now sits on the community advisory board. Recently, she brought in a neighbor of hers who needed new dentures. \"She loves it,\" Ms Scardigli said. \"She's 90, and she's from down south, so it re minds her of when the doctor used to come to your house and knew the family and sat down and broke bread.\" Opportunities through Technology There is perhaps no greater opportunity to transform practice than through technology. Information technology has long been used to support billing and payments but has become increasingly important in the pr ovision of care as an aid to do cumentation and decision making. Diagnostic and monitoring machines have proven invaluable in th e treatment of cancer, heart disease, and many other ailments. Examples cited by the IOM in Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century include \"growing evidence that automated order entry systems can reduce errors in drug prescribing and dosing\" and \"improvements in timeliness through the use of Internet-bas ed communication (i.e., e-visits , telemedicine) and immediate access to automated clinical information, diagnostic test s, and treatment results\" (IOM, 2001). Since that report was published, the expanded us e of online communication has resulted in so- called telehealth services that are not limited to diagnosis or tr eatment but also include health promotion, follow-up, and coordinati on of care. Delivery of telehealth services has, however, like that of APRN services, been complicated by variability in state re gulations, particularly whenever online communications cross state lines. Impact of Technology on the De sign of Health Care Delivery In 2009, the American Recovery and Rei nvestment Act (ARRA) (Public Law 111-5) included provisions to create incentives for the adoption and meani ngful use of health information technology (HIT). ARRA strengthene d standards for maintaining the privacy and security of health information. ARRA provided grants to help state and local governments as well as health care providers in their efforts to adopt and use HI T. CMS also provided incentives, under ARRA to encourage eligible hospitals and health professi onals to become \"meaningful PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-46 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH users\" of certified electronic health record s (EHRs). A definition of \"meaningful use\" was developed by the Secretary of HHS by official rulemaking procedures, providing opportunity for public and professional input (HHS, 2009). The mean ingful use objectives w ill likely continue to be refined but outline core requirements that should be included in every EHR. By adopting these recommendations, users will be eligible for federal incentive payments and will be able to report information on the clinical quality of care. States can add or modi fy additional objectives to this definition for their Medicaid programs (CMS, 2010). A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine summarizes the meaningful use criterion as follows: \"use by providers to achie ve significant improvements in care\" (Blumenthal and Tavenner, 2010). Given the nature of patient da ta collection, nurses will be integral to proper collection of meaningful use data. For example, among the first set of criteria to be measured include patient demographics, vital signs, and list s of patient's diagnoses , allergies, and active medications. As EHRs become more refined and in tegrated, nurses will have the opportunity to help define additional m eaningful use objectives. Implications for Time and Place of Care Care supported by interoperable digital networ ks will shift in the importance of time and place. The patient/consumer will not always have to be in the same location as the provider, and the provider will not always have to interact with the patient in real time. As EHRs, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) syst ems, laboratory results, imaging systems, and pharmacies are all linked into the same network, many types of care can be provided without regard to location, as the \"care grid \" is available anywhere, anytime. Remote patient monitoring is expanding expone ntially. An ever-growi ng array of biometric devices (e.g., indwelling heart or blood sugar monitors) can collect, monitor, and report information from the patient in real time, in either an institution or the home. Some of these devices can also provide dire ct digitally mediated care; the automated insulin pump and implantable defibrillato rs are two examples. The implications of these developments for nur sing will be considerable and as yet are not fully understood (Abbott and Coenen, 2008). It is not clear how much of nursing care might be independent of physical location when HIT is fully implemented, but it will likely be a significant subset of care, possibly in the range of 15 35 percent of what nurses do today. That is, for this proportion of care, nurs es need not be in the same local e (or even the same nation) as their patients. As new technologies impact the hospital and other settings for nursing services, this phenomenon may increase. Implications for Nursing Practice HIT will fundamentally change the ways in which RNs plan, deliver, document, and review clinical care. The process of obtaining and reviewing diagnostic information, making clinical decisions, communicating with patie nts and families, and carrying out clinical interventions will depart radically from the way these activities occur today. Moreover, the relative proportion of time RNs spend on various tasks is likely to chan ge appreciably over the coming decades. While HIT arguably will have its greatest influence on how RNs plan and document their care, all facets of care will be mediated increasingly by digital work flow, computerized knowledge management, and decision support. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING PRACTICE 3-47 In the future, virtually every facet of nursing pr actice in each setting wh ere it is rendered will have a significant digital dimension around a core EHR. Biometric data collection will increasingly be automated, and diagnostic test s, medications, and some therapies will be computer generated and managed and delivered with computer support. Patient histories and examination data will increasingly be collected by devices that interface directly with the patient and automatically stream into the EHR. Examples include automated blood pressure cuffs, personal digital assistant (PDA) based functional status, and patient history surveys. In HIT-supported organizations, a broader array and higher proportion of services of all types will be provided within the context of comput er templates and workflows. Care and its documentation will less frequently be \"free-hand.\" As routine aspects of care become digitally mediated and increasingly rote, RNs and other cl inicians can be expected to shift and expand their focus to more complex and nuanced \"hig h-touch\" tasks that these technologies cannot readily or appropriately accomplish, such as communication with and guidance and support for patients and their families. There will likely be greater opportunities for such interventions as counseling, behavior change, and social and emotional support\u2014interventions that lie squarely within the province of nursing practice. Impact of Technology on Quality, Efficiency, and Outcomes Adoption of HIT is expected to increase th e efficiency and effectiveness of clinician interactions with each patient and the target population. EHRs and other HIT should lower the cost per unit of service delivered and/or improve the quality of care as measured by outcomes or achievement of other end points, such as increased adherence to optimal guidelines. HIT will lead to greater efficiency if it takes less time for a clinician to provide the same unit of service or if a lower-cost clinician practici ng with extensive HIT support can deliver the same type of care as a higher-cost non-HIT-supported provider. Cont rolled time and moti on studies that have compared clinicians performing the same task with and without HIT support have produced mixed findings on time efficiencies gained acro ss clinicians and settings. One area with emerging evidence is hospital nursing time spen t in documentation, with studies showing a 2324 percent reduction (Poissant et al., 2005). On the other hand, th ese efficiency gains may be partially offset by the information demands of quality improvement initiatives and similar programs undertaken by a growing number of institutions (DesRoches et al., 2008). 34 According to a review of the literature conducted for the committee, although research on the impact of HIT on the quality of nursing care is limited, documentation quality and accessibility generally improve after the implementation of HI T. Medication errors almost always decrease after the implementation of bar code medica tion administration (Waneka and Spetz, 2009). DeRoches and colleagues (2008) conducted a national survey of more than 3,436 RNs (1,392 responses) and found that hospitals with basic EH R systems were more likely to be recognized for nursing excellence (magnets/magnet-like) and to have quality improvement programs. No differences were found in time spent on patient ca re activities for nurses in hospitals with and without minimally functioning systems. 34 This paragraph draws on a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Health Care System Reform and the Nursing Workforce: Matching Nursing Practice and Skills to Future Needs, Note Past Demands,\" prepared by Julie Sochalski, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, and Jonathan Weiner, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (see Appendix F on CD-ROM).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html3-48 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Technology is also used to measure patient outco mes, with varying results. While measuring outcomes is critical to the provi sion of 21st-century health care, complications have developed in ensuring that outcome measures from different institutions and organizations are, in fact, comparable. Even ensuring that outcome measures from different parts of the same organization are comparable can be problematic. Researcher s in Colorado conducted a comprehensive review of the use of rescue ag ents\u2014a Joint Commission approved quality measure\u2014based on the EHRs at the Children's Hospital in Aurora. They found that variations in the way information was entered in the EHRs accounted for significant variations within the institution and could be responsible for as much as a 40-fold difference in outcome measures am ong hospitals (Kahn and Ranade, 2010). The researchers concluded that \"more detailed clinical information may result in quality measures that are not comparable ac ross institutions due [to] institution-specific workflow.\" A longitudinal study of 326 hospitals found that those that had implemented more advanced EHR systems over the time period had higher costs and increased nurse staffing levels (Furukawa et al., 2010). Patient complications increased in these hospitals, while mortality for some conditions declined. It should be noted, howe ver, that these results may be difficult to interpret because of the implementation of minimu m nurse staffing regulations at the same time that the implementation of EHRs ramped up. During that time, nurse staffing rose, and thus costs per patient rose, and if there is any correlati on between implementation of EHRs and increased nurse staffing due to the ratios, the results ma y confound the two. In addition, the study did not control for hospital ownership (e.g., nonprofit, for-profit) or system affiliation, both of which might be important. Finally, a systematic review of the literature (fewer than 25 articles) showed that the time spent on documentation of care may increase or decrease with EHRs (T hompson et al., 2009). The increases in time however, may be compensate d for by the use of EHRs in other activities, such as giving/receiving reports, reconc iling medications, and planning care. Technology Transforming Roles for Nurses The new practice milieu\u2014where much of nursing and medical care is mediated and supported within an interoperable \"digital comm ons\"\u2014will support and potentially even require much more effective integration of multiple disc iplines into a collaborative team focused on the patient's unique set of needs. Furthermore, interoperable EH Rs linked with personal health records and shared support systems will influence how these teams work and share clinical activities. It will increasingly be possible for prov iders to work on digitally linked teams that will collaborate with patients and their fam ilies no longer limited by real-time contact. 35 As the knowledge base and decision pathways that previously resided primarily in clinicians' brains are transferred to clini cal decision support and CPOE modul es of advanced HIT systems, some types of care most commonly provided by nur ses can readily shift to personnel with less training or to patients and their families. Sim ilarly, many types of care previously provided by physicians and other highly trained personnel can be provided effectively by APRNs and other specialty trained RNs. Furthermore, the performa nce of these fundamenta lly restructured teams 35 This and the next paragraph draw on a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Health Care System Reform and the Nursing Workforce: Matching Nursing Practice and Skills to Future Needs, Note Past Demands,\" prepared by Julie Sochalski, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, and Jonathan Weiner, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (see Appendix F).

Increasingly, technology is allo wing nurses and other health ca re providers to offer their services in a wider range of se ttings. For example, the ability of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York to tap into mobile technology, as desc ribed in Chapter 2, allowed that organization to provide ever more complex care in the home setting (IOM, 2010a). Involving Nurses in Technology Design and Implementation As the largest segment of the health care workfo rce with some of the closest, most sustained interactions with patients, nurses are often the greatest users of technol ogy. In many instances, they may know what will work best with regard to technological solutions, but they are asked for their opinions infrequently. According to a survey of nurses at 25 leading acute care facilities across the United States, nurses find \"that exis ting systems are often splintered, unable to interface and require multiple log-on to access or en ter data. They call repeatedly for integrated systems to ease their workload and help them reac h clinical transformation\" (Bolton et al., 2008). Studies show that involving nurses in th e design, planning, and implementation of technology systems leads to fewer problems dur ing implementation (Hunt et al., 2004). The TIGER Initiative (for Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform) is a collaborative effort of 1,400 nurses from vari ous organizations, government ag encies, and vendors whose goal is \"to interweave informatics a nd enabling technologies transp arently into nursing practice\" (TIGER, 2009). As leaders from the TIGER Initia tive told the committee, \"Regardless of the setting or environment of care, the best, most up to date information is required to support safe, effective care and promote optimal outcomes.\" And yet, they pointed out, \"Today, health information is not shared across the various pr oviders and stakeholder groups who provide, fund and research care.\" The members of the TIGER In itiative hope to help change that situation by developing the capacity of nursing students and members of the nursing workforce \"to use electronic health records to impr ove the delivery of health care\" and \"engage more nurses in leading both the development of a national health care information technology (NHIT) infrastructure and health care reform.\" They also see the need to \"acceler ate adoption of smart, standards based, interoperable t echnology that will make health care delivery safer, more efficient, timely, accessible, and patient-centere d, while also reducing the burden of nurses\" (TIGER, 2009). Nurses have also invented new technology to he lp them care for their patients. For instance, Barbara Medoff Cooper, professor in pediatric nursing and di rector of the Center for Biobehavioral Research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, developed a microchip device that is situated between the nipple and the rest of the baby bottle. It measures the sucking ability of premature neonatal babi es, which has been shown to be an accurate indication of the infant's ability to feed successf ully and thus survive discharge. The information thus gathered has helped guide pa rents and providers in better pl anning for the care of high-risk neonates at home (Bakewell-Sachs et al., 2009; Medoff-Cooper et al., 2009). Another effort, called TelEmergency, brings a certified emergency room physician to 12 rural hospitals in Mississippi from the Univers ity of Mississipp i via a T-1 line, but only when needed. The system is managed by a group of 35 APRNs who provide care in these rural communities, including management of the technology as a referral system. The nurses are able to handle 60 percent of all emergency care, saving the hospital consortium $72,000 per month (AAN, 2010b).

BOX 3-5 Technology at Cedars-Sinai Hospital SENDING ALERTS VIA TEXT MESSAGE SHORTENS NURSES ' RESPONSE TIMES TO CRITICAL ALARMS We're responding a lot faster, which hopefully translates into intervening to prevent harm and saving someone's life. \u2014Ray Hancock, MSN, RN, director of critical care and telemetry services, Cedars-Sinai Health System, Los Angeles In January 2010 a California hospital was fined for the death of a man whose cardiac alarm had been set to an inaudible level; when his heart stopped, the emergency room nurses were unaware of it and failed to intervene (California Department of Public Health, 2009). That same month a man died in a Massachusetts hospital after his heart rate declined over a 20-minute period; nurses did not hear his cardiac alarm, investigators found, and a second alarm had been turned off (McKinney, 2010). Nurses attend to a variety of alar ms and alerts during a shift, and ther e is often no system in place for prioritizing urgency. Confusion and \"alarm fatigue\" ca n result, with potentially lethal consequences: the ECRI Institute lists alarm hazards as the second most serious of the top 10 technology hazards in health care for 2010 (ECRI Institute, 2010). The problem has been shown to pose a danger to patient safety (Graham and Cvach, 2010), as have problems with clinical alarms in general (ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation, 2006). Unfortunately, nurse s are rarely involved in decisions about new technologies in health care, although the patient's bedside has been identified as the area most in need of technological innovation (Bolton et al., 2008). At a combined telemetry and medical-surgical unit at Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, nurses are taking the lead in testing ways to aggregat e and prioritize the alarms to which they must respond, most recently via text messages sent to nurses' and nursing assistant s' BlackBerry devices. This system has replaced pagers and many bedside alarms, with promising results. Timely, Accurate Messaging. In a unit where routine alerts might range in importance from an out- of-reach water pitcher to cardiac arrest, getting \"the righ t message to the right person at the right time\" is critical, said Joanne Pileggi, MSN, RN, the uni t's nurse manager. Working with Emergin, a communications software company, the unit's nurses and nur sing assistants categorized the alarms they receive\u2014from cardiac monitors, patients' call butt ons, bed alarms, code blues, and the laboratory\u2014 according to their urgency, classifying them as red (most critical), blue (moderately critical), or yellow (least critical). For example, if a patient's cardiac monitor detects a dangerous arrhythmia, that information is sent to the unit's \"command center,\" where a cardiac nurse sends out a red alert via text message to that patient's nurse and the charge nurse. A beep or vibrati on from the nurse's BlackBerry indicates that a new text message has arrived. The nurse can glance at the device, see that the alert is red, and reply immediately, eliminating several problems with overhead paging systems: the need for repeated pages, the inability of the nurse to respond, excess ive noise on the unit, and delays in response. The 30-bed unit employs nine registered nurses (R Ns) on the day shift and nine on the night shift and has been testing a variety of devices for more than 2 years. Staff were involved from the beginning, Ms. Pileggi said, and everyone, including aides, received training from Emergin. An Investment in Safety. Use of the BlackBerry devices has cut the number of overhead pages on the unit by more than half. Nurses report less alarm fatigue and faster response times to alarms, and they receive critical laboratory values 10 minutes sooner under the new system than under the old one. They also save time by not handling alarms that do not require a nurse's attention. Darren Dworkin, chief information officer for Cedar s-Sinai, said the initial costs of purchasing the devices and training the staff have paid off in more efficient and safer care. \"Enabling nurses to spend PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Few manufacturers are designing technologies with nurses in mind, and limitations of the available technology have meant that not all ideas for improv ing processes can be tested. For example, the unit could not incorporate IV pump alarms into the most recent test. Still, bedside nurses and patients are quite pleased. The nurses are looking forward to a test of iPhones, which will display cardiac rhythms on screen. Said Ms. Pileggi, \"We're anticipating patients' needs, so there hasn't been the need for patients to call as often.\" CONCLUSIONS The nursing profession has evolved more rapidly than the public policies that affect it. The ability of nurses to better serve the public is hampered by the constraints of outdated policies, particularly those involving nur ses' scopes of practice. Eviden ce does not support the conclusion that APRNs are less able than physicians to prov ide safe, effective, and efficient care (Brown and Grimes, 1995; Fairman, 2008; Groth et al., et al., 2010; al., 2002; al et al., 2004; Mundinger et al., 2000; Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). The roles of APRNs\u2014and the roles of all nurses\u2014are undergoing changes that will help make the tr ansformative practice models outlined at the beginning of this chapter a more common realit y. Such changes must be supported by a number of policy decisions, including efforts to remove the existing regulatory barriers to nursing practice. If the curren t conflicts between what nurses can do based on thei r education and training and what they may do according to stat e and federal policies and regulations are not addressed, patients will continue to expe rience limited access to high-quality care. Despite the evidence demonstrating that APRN s are educated, trained, and competent to provide safe, high-quality care without the need for physician supervision, states' legislative decisions regarding legal scopes of practice range from restrictive to permissive. While medicine and a number of other professions enjoy practice regula tions that are comparable across states, this goal has been elusive for nurses, particularly those working in advanced practice. With the availability now of a consen sus document that offers ag reed-upon standards for APRN education, training, and regulation, states that have been reluctant in the past may move toward broader scopes of practice. Such a move, however, considered by the committee to be a critical one, is not guaranteed. And while the committee defe rs to the rights of stat es to continue their regulation of health professiona ls, it also wishes to note w hy and how the federal government can play an important role in this arena. The primary reason the federal government has a compelling interest in state regulation of health professionals is the responsibility to pa tients covered by federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If access to care is hindered, if costs are unduly high, if quality of care could be improved for these millions of patients through evidence-based changes to the ways in which professionals may practice, the federal gove rnment has a right to explore the options and encourage change. An additional reason is the federal government's unique perspective\u2014somewhat removed from that of the individual states\u2014enabling it to shed light on the value and benefit to all Americans of harmonizing practice regulations among the states. Certain federal entities may both defer to the st ates in adopting their own practice regulations and encourage the adoption of regulations that ar e consistent with curren t clinical evidence and comparable across the country. Congress, CMS, OP M, and the FTC each have specific authority PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While no single actor or agency can inde pendently make a sweeping change to eliminate current barriers, the various state and federal en tities can each make relevant decisions that together can lead to much-needed improvements. In addition to regulatory barriers, cultural and organizational barriers constrain nurses' ability to identify solutions and implement them quickl y, knowing that patients' lives and well-being are at stake. Moreover, an important priority in national health care reform is achieving better value for the expenditures made on health care services . Since health care is labor-intensive, getting more value from the health care system will depend in large part on enhancing the productivity and effectiveness of the workforce. Nurses therefore represent a large and unexploited opportunity to achieve greater value in health care. The committee believes that any proposed ch anges in the responsib ilities of the nursing workforce should be evaluated against their ab ility to support the pr ovision of seamless, affordable, quality care that is accessible to all. In particular, the committee argues that now is the time to finally eliminate th e outdated regulations and organizat ional and cultural barriers that limit the ability of nurses, includ ing APRNs, to practice to the full extent of their education, training, and competence. The committee also believes that nurses must be allowed to lead improvement and redesign efforts (see Chapter 5). Specifically, in order that all Americans may have access to high quality, safe health care, federal and state actions are re quired to update and standardize scope-of-practice regulations to take advantage of the full capacity and education of nurses. Cultural and organizational barriers should also be eliminated. States and insura nce companies must follow through with specific regulatory, policy, and financial changes that uph old patient-centered care as the organizing principle for a reformed health care system. Th e education and training of nurses support their ability to offer a wider range of services sa fely and effectively\u2014as documented by numerous studies. And nurses must respond to the challenge, re inventing themselves as needed in a rapidly evolving health care system. Nursing is, of course, not the only profession to confront the need to transform itself in response to new realities; si milarly disruptive challe nges have been faced in other fields, such as medicine, health care, publishing, education, business, manufacturing, and the military. In the field of health care, expansion of scopes of practice to reflect the full extent of one's education and training should occur for all health professionals to maximize the contributions of each to patient care. For exam ple, one impact of enhancing nursing scopes of practice may be to allow the curr ently inadequate numbers of physic ians to better use their time and skills on the most complex and challenging cases and tasks, as well as broaden the array of services they can offer as part of a collaborati ve team of providers (e .g., within new models of care\u2014ACOs, medical homes, transiti onal care\u2014that are part of the ACA, as well as in groups of specialty providers). To facilitate the most eff ective transition to team practice, as well as practice that encompasses full exte nt of their scope, all providers will require continual teaching and learning to facilitate the highest level of team functioning (see Chapter 4). Key factors that contribute to the success of managing such a transition include technological literacy, good communication skills, adaptability to organizational changes, and a willingness to evaluate and reinvent how work is organized and accomplished (Kimball and O'Neil, 2002). Going forward under the ACA and whatever reforms may follow, the health care system is likely to change so rapidly that build ing the adaptive capacity of the nursing workforce to work across PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finally, the committee believes that if practice is to be transformed, nurses graduating with a bachelor's degree must be better prepared to enter the practice envir onment and confront the challenges they will encounter. Therefore, th e committee concludes that nurse residency programs should be instituted to provide nurses with an appropriate transition to practice and develop a more competent nursing workforce.

Major changes in the U.S. health care system and practice environments will require equally profound changes in th e education of nurses both before and after they receive their licenses. Nursing e ducation at all levels needs to provide a better understanding of and experie nce in care management, quality improvement methods, systems-level change management, and the reconceptualized roles of nurses in a reformed health care system. Nursing education should serve as a platform for continued lifelong learning and include opportunities for seamless transition to higher degree programs. Accrediting, licensing, and certifyi ng organizations need to mandat e demonstrated mastery of core skills and competencies to comple ment the completion of degree programs and written board examinations. To respond to the underrepr esentation of racial and ethnic minority groups and men in the nursing workforce, the nursing student body must become more diverse. Finally, nurses should be educated with physicians and other health professi onals as students and throughout their careers. Major changes in the U.S. health care system and practice environments will require equally profound changes in the education of nurses both before and after they receive their licenses. In Chapter 1, the committee set forth a vision of health care that depends on a transformation of the roles and responsibilities of nurses. This chap ter outlines the fundamental transformation of nurse education that must occur if this vision is to be realized. The primary goals of nursing education remain the same: nurses must be prepared to meet diverse patients' needs; function as leaders; and advance science that benefits patients and the capacity of health professionals to deliver safe , quality patient care. At the same time, nursing education needs to be transformed in a number of ways to prepare nur sing graduates to work collaboratively and effectively w ith other health professionals in a complex and evolving health care system in a variety of settings (see Chapter 3) . Entry-level nurses, for example, need to be able to transition smoothly from their academic pr eparation to a range of practice environments, with an increased emphasis on community and pub lic health settings. And advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) need graduate programs that can prepare them to assume their roles in primary care, acute care, long-term care, and other settings, as well as specialty practices.

The chapter begins by focusing on nurses' undergraduate education, emphasizing the need for a greater number of nurse s to enter the workforce with a baccalaureate degree or to progress to this degree early in their career. This section also outlines some of the challenges to meeting undergradu ate educational needs. The chap ter then turns to graduate nursing education, stressing the need to increas e significantly the numbers and preparation of nurse faculty and researchers at the doctoral level. The third section explores the need to establish, maintain, and expand new competenci es throughout a nurse's education and career. The chapter next addresses the challenge of underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority groups and men in the nursing profession and argue s that meeting this challenge will require increasing the diversity of the nursing student body. The fifth section describes some creative solutions that have been devise d for addressing concerns about e ducational capacity and the need to transform nursing curricula. The final section presents the committee's conclusions regarding the improvements needed to transform nursing education. The committee could have devoted this entire report to the topic of nursing education\u2014the subject is rich and widely debated. However, th e committee's statement of task required that it examine a range of issues in the field, rather than delving deeply into the many challenges involved in and solutions re quired to advance the nursing education system. Several comprehensive reports and analyses addressing nursing education have recently been published. They include a 2009 report from the Carneg ie Foundation that calls for a \"radical transformation\" of nursing e ducation (Benner et al., 2009); a 2010 report from a conference sponsored by the Macy Foundation that charts a c ourse for \"life-long learning\" that is assessed by the \"demonstration of competency [as opposed to written assessment] in both academic programs and in continuing education\" (AACN and AAMC, 2010); two consensus reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) that call for greater interprofe ssional education of physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as new methods of impr oving and demonstrating competency throughout one's career (IOM, 2003 b, 2009); and other articles and reports on necessary curriculum changes, faculty devel opment, and new partnerships in education (Erickson, 2002; Lasater and Nielsen, 2009; Mitc hell et al., 2006; Orsolini-Hain and Waters, 2009; Tanner C. A et al., 2008). Additionally, in February 2009, the committee hosted a forum on the future of nursing in Houston, Texas, that focused on nursing education. Discussion during that forum informed the committee's deliberations and this chapter; a summary of that forum is included on the CD-ROM in the back of this report. 1 Finally, Appendix A highlights other recent reports relevant to the nursing profession. The committee refers readers wishing to explore the subject of nursing education in grea ter depth to these publications. UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION This section begins with an overview of cu rrent undergraduate nursing education, including educational pathways, the distri bution of undergraduate degrees, the licensing exam, and costs (see Appendix E for additional background in formation on undergraduate education). The discussion then focuses on the need for more nurses prepared at the baccalaureate level. Finally, ate educational needs are reviewed. barriers to meeting undergradu 1 The summary also can be downloaded at http://www.iom.edu.

For the past four deca des, nursing students have been able to pursue three different educational pathways to become registered nurses (RNs): the bachelor's of science in nursing (BSN), the associate's degr ee in nursing (ADN), and the diploma in nursing. More recently, an accelerated, second-degree bachelor's program for students who possess a baccalaureate degree in another field has become a popular option. This multiplicity of options has fragmented the nursing community and ha s created confusion am ong the public and other health professionals about the expectations for these educational opt ions. However, these pathways also provide numerous opportunities fo r women and men of modest means and diverse backgrounds to access careers in an economically stable field. In addition to the BSN, ADN, or diploma r eceived by RNs, another undergraduate-level program available is the licensed practica l/vocational diploma in nursing. Licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs) are especi ally important because of their contributions to care in long-term care facilities and nursing homes.2 LPNs/LVNs receive a diploma after completion of a 12-month program. They are not educated or licensed for independent decision making for complex care, but obt ain basic training in anat omy and physiology, nutrition, and nursing techniques. Some LPNs/LVNs continue their education to become RNs; in fact, approximately 17.9 percent of RNs were once licensed as LPNs/LVNs. (HRSA, 2010b) While most LPNs/LVNs have an interest in advanci ng their education, a numbe r of barriers to their doing so have been cited, including financial c oncerns, lack of capacity and difficulty getting into ADN and BSN programs, and family commitments (HRSA, 2004). Although this chapter focuses primarily on the education of RN s and APRNs, the co mmittee recognizes the contributions of LPNs/LVNs in improving the quality of health care. The committee also recognizes the opportunity the LPN/LVN diploma cr eates as a possible pathway toward further education along the RN and APRN tracks for the diverse individuals w ho hold that diploma. Distribution of Undergraduate Degrees At present, the most common way to become an RN is to pursue an ADN at a community college. Associate's degree programs in nursi ng were launched in the mid-20th century in response to the nursing shortage that fo llowed World War II (Lynaugh, 2008; Lynaugh and Brush, 1996). The next most common undergraduate nursing degree is the BSN, a 4-year degree typically offered at a university. Baccalaur eate nursing programs emphasize liberal arts, advanced sciences, and nursing coursework across a wider range of settings than are addressed by ADN programs, along with formal coursework that emphasizes both the acquisition of leadership development and the exposure to community and public health competencies. The least common route to becoming an RN currently is the diploma program, which is offered at a erally lasts 3 years.

SOURCE: NLN, 2010b. Entry into Practice: The Licensing Exam3 Regardless of which educational pathway nursi ng students pursue, those working toward an RN must ultimately pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN), which is administered by the Na tional Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), before they are granted a license to practice. Rates of success on the NCLEX-RN are often used for rating schools or for marketing to potential students. As with many entry-level licensing exams, however, the NCLEX-RN uses multiple-choice, computer-based methods to test the minimum competency requi red to practice nursing safely. The exam is administered on a pass/fail basis and although rigorous , is not meant to be a test of optimal performance. Following passage of the exam, individual state boards of nursing grant nurses their license to practice. The content of the NCLEX-RN is based on su rveys of what new nurses need to know to begin their practice. As with most entry-leve l licensing exams, the content of the NCLEX-RN directly influences the curricula used to educate nursing students . Currently, the exam is skewed toward acute care settings because this is wher e the majority of nurses are first employed and where most work throughout their careers. To keep pace with the changing demands of the populations, incl uding the shift toward increasing care in health care system and patient 3 See https://www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm. of Sciences.

Greater emphasis must be placed on competencies relate d to community health, public health, primary care, geriatrics, disease prevention, health prom otion, and other topics beyond the provision of nursing care in acute care settings to ensure that nurses are re ady to practice in an evolving health care system. Costs of Nursing Education Although a limited number of educational grants and scholarships are available, most of individuals seeking nursing edu cation must finance their own education at any level of preparation. Costs vary based on the pathway selected for basic prepar ation and through to doctoral preparation. The LPN degree is the leas t expensive to attain, followed by the ADN, BSN (accelerated program), BSN, master's of science in nursing (MSN), and PhD/doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degrees. It is no surprise that educational costs and living expenses play a major role in determining which degree is pursue d and the numbers of nurses who seek advanced degrees. To better understand the costs of nursing education, the comm ittee asked The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Nursing Research Networ k to estimate the vari ous costs associated with pursuing nursing education, spec ifically at the advanced pract ice level, in comparison with those for a medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO). The RWJF Nursing Research Network produced several comparis on charts in an attempt to c onvey accurately the differences in costs between alternative nu rsing degrees and the MD or DO degree. This task required making assumptions about public versus private and proprietary/for-pro fit education options, prerequisites for entry, and years required to complete each degree. An area of particular difficulty arose in assessing costs associat ed with obtaining an ADN degree. In most non health care disciplines, the associate's degree takes 2 years to complete. In nursing, however, surveys have found that it takes students 3 to 4 years to complete an ADN program because of the need to fulfill prerequisites necessary to prepare students for entry into degree programs and the lack of adequate faculty, which lead to long waiting lists for many programs and classes (Orsolini- Hain, 2008). Box 4-1 illustrates the challenges of this task by outlining the difficulty of comparing the cost of becoming a physician with the cost of becoming an APRN. The task of comparing the increasing \"sticker costs\" of nursing and medical education was complicated further because much of the data needed to compute those costs is either missing or drawn from incomparable years. In the end, the committee de cided not to include detailed discussion of the costs of nursing education in this report.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH BOX 4-1 Costs of Health Professional Education Depending on the method used, the number of advan ced practice registered nurses (APRNs) that can be trained for the cost of training 1 physician is between 3 and 14. Assessing the costs of education is a multidimensional problem. Manno (1998) has suggested that costs for higher education can be measured in at least four ways: \"the production cost of delivering education to students; the 'sticker price' that students/families are asked to pay; the cost to students to attend college, in cluding room and board, books and supplies, transportation, tuition, and fees; and the net price paid by students after financial aid awards\" (Starck, 2005). While the first of these measures, the production cost to the institution, is the most complete, it is the most complex to derive. One study attempted to compare the educational cost for various health professions. This study, sponsored by the Association of Academic Heal th Centers (Gonyea, 1998), used the 1994 methodology of Valberg and colleagues, which included 80 percent essential education and 20 percent complementary research an d service (Valberg et al., 1994). The conclusion reached was that for every 1 physician (4 years), 14 advanced nurse practitioners or 12 physician assistants could be produced (Starck, 2005). If one examines simply the cost to students of postsecondary training (the \"sticker price\"), the differences among professions are slightly less dramatic. The cost to students is defined as the tuition and fees students/families pay. This measure does no t include costs associated with room and board, books, transportation, and other living expenses. Nor does it include those costs incurred by the educational programs that may be beyond what is co vered by tuition revenues. Residency programs for physicians are not included in this esti mate because students do not pay them. Medical residencies are funded largely by Medicare, and in 2008, totaled approximately $9 billion per year ($100,000 on average for each of about 90,0 00 residents) for graduate medical education. (MedPAC, 2009). Some of the Medicare expenditures are for indirect costs, such as the greater costs associated with operating a teaching hospital. Estimate s of the average cost per resident for the federal government are difficult to establish because of the wide variation in payments by specialty and type of hospital. In addition, residency costs vary signific antly by year, with the early years requiring more supervision than the later years.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-7 Why More BSN-Prepared Nurses Are Needed The qualifications and level of education required for entry into the nursing profession have been widely debated by nurses, nursing orga nizations, academics, and a host of other stakeholders for more than 40 years (NLN, 2007 ). The causal relationship between the academic degree obtained by RNs and patient outcomes is not conclusive in the research literature. However, several studies support a significant asso ciation between the educational level of RNs and outcomes for patients in the acute care setting, incl uding mortality rates (Aiken et al., 2003; Estabrooks et 2005; Friese et al., 2008; Tourangeau et al., 2007; Van den Heede et al., 2009). Other studies argue that clinical experience, qualifications before en tering a nursing program (e.g., SAT scores), and the number of BSN-prepar ed RNs that received an earlier degree confound the value added through the 4-year educational program. One study found that the level of experience of nurses was more importa nt than their education level in mitigating medication errors in hospitals (Blegen et al., 2001). Another study performed within the Department of Veterans Affa irs (VA) system found no signi ficant association between the proportion of RNs with a baccalaureate degree and patient outcomes at the hospital level (Sales et al., 2008). This debate aside, an all-BS N workforce at the entry level would provide a more uniform foundation for the reconceptualized roles for nurses and new models of care that are envisioned in Chapters 1 and 2. Although a BSN education is not a panacea for all that is expected of nurses in the future, it does, relative to other educati onal pathways, introduce students to a wider range of competencies in such arenas as health policy and h ealth care financing, leadership, quality improvement, and systems thinking. One st udy found that new BSN graduates reported significantly higher levels of preparation in evidence-based pr actice, research skills, and assessment of gaps in areas such as teamwo rk, collaboration, and practice (Kovner et al., 2010)\u2014other important competencies for a future nursing workforce. Moreover, as more nurses are being called on to lead care co ordination efforts, they should have the competencies requisite for this task, many of which are included in th e American Association of Colleges of Nursing's (AACN) Essentials of Baccalaureate Educa tion for Professional Nursing Practice . 4 Care within the hospital setti ng continues to grow more co mplex, and nurses must make critical decisions associated with care for sicker , frailer patients. Care in this setting depends on sophisticated, life-saving tec hnology coupled with complex information management systems that require skills in analysis and synthesis. Care outside the hospital is becoming more complex as well. Nurses are being called upon to coordi nate care among a variet y of clinicians and community agencies; to help patients manage ch ronic illnesses, there by preventing acute care episodes and disease progression; and to use a variety of technological tools to improve the quality and effectiveness of care. A more edu cated nursing workforce would be better equipped to meet these demands. An all BSN-workforce would also be poised to achieve higher levels of education at the master's and doctoral levels, required for nur ses to serve as primary care providers, nurse researchers, and nurse faculty\u2014pos itions currently in great dema nd as discussed later in this chapter. Shortages of nurses in these positions continue to be a barrier to advancing the profession and improving the delivery of care to patients. 4 See http://www.aacn.nche.edu/e ducation/pdf/BaccEssentials08.pdf. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Some health care organizations in the United States are already leading the way by requiring more BSN-prepared nurses for entry-level position s. A growing number of hospitals, particularly teaching and children's hospitals and those that have been recognized by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Magnet Recogniti on Program (see Chapter 5), favor the BSN for employment (Aiken, 2010). Depending on the type of hospital, the goal for the proportion of BSN-prepared nurses varies; for example, t eaching hospitals aim for 90 percent, whereas community hospitals seek at le ast 50 percent (Goode et al., 2 001). Absent a nursing shortage, then, nurses holding a baccalaureate degree are usually the preferred new-graduate hires in acute care settings (Cronenwett, 2010). Likewise, in a recent survey of 100 physician members of Sermo.com (see Chapter 3 for more informati on on this online community), conducted by the RWJF Nursing Research Network, 76 percent of physicians strongl y or somewhat agreed that nurses with a BSN are more competent than th ose with an ADN. Seventy percent of the physicians surveyed also either strongly or somewh at agreed that all nurs es who provide care in a hospital should hold a BSN, although when asked a bout the characteristics they most value in nurses they work with, the physicians placed a significantly higher value on compassion, efficiency, and experience than on years of nursing education and caliber of nursing school (RWJF, 2010c). In community and public health settings, the BSN has long been the preferred minimum requirement for nurses, given the competencies , knowledge of community-based interventions, and skills that are needed in th ese settings (ACHNE, 2009; ASTDN, 2003). The U.S. military and the VA also are taking steps to ensure that the nurses making up their respective workforces are more highly educated. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force require all active duty RNs to have a baccalaureate degree to practice, and th e U.S. Public Health Service has the same requirement for its Commissioned Officers. Additi onally, as the largest em ployer of RNs in the country, the VA has established a requirement that nurses must have a BSN to be considered for promotion beyond entry level (AACN, 2010c). As Table 4-1 shows, however, the average earnings of BSN-prepared nurses are not substantially higher th an those of ADN- or diploma- prepared nurses. TABLE 4-1 Average Earnings of Full-Time RNs, by High est Nursing or Nursing-Related Education and Job Title Earnings Position Diploma ($) Associate's Degree ($) Bachelor's Degree ($) Master's/ Doctoral Degree ($) Overall Average ($) All nurses those who provided earnings information to surveyors are included in the calculations used for this table.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-9 Decades of \"blue ribbon panels\" and reports to Congress on the health care workforce have found that there is a significan t shortage of nurses with bacca laureate and higher degrees to respond to the nation's health needs (Aiken, 2010) . Almost 15 years ago, the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice, which a dvises Congress and the secretary of Health and Human Services on areas rele vant to nursing, called for the development of policy actions that would ensure a minimum of 66 percent of RNs who work as nurses would have a BSN or higher degree by 2010 (Aiken et al., 2009). The resu lt of policy efforts of the past decade has been a workforce in which approximately 50 percent of RNs hold a BSN degree or higher, a figure that includes ADN- and diploma-educated RNs who have gone on to obtain a BSN (HRSA, 2010b). Of significant not e, the Tri-Council for Nurs ing, which consists of the American Nurses Association (ANA), American Organization of Nurs e Executives (AONE), National League for Nursing (NLN), and American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), recently released a consensus policy statement calling for a more highly educated nursing workforce, citing the need to increase the number of BSN-prepared nurses to deliver safer and more effective care (AACN, 2010a). In sum, an increase in the percentage of nurses with a BSN is imperative as the scope of what the public needs from nurses grows, expectations surrounding quality heighten, and the settings where nurses are needed prolifer ate and become more complex. The formal education associated with obtaining the BSN is desirable for a variet y of reasons, including en suring that the next generation of nurses will master more than basi c knowledge of patient car e, providing a stronger foundation for the expansion of nursing science, and imparting the tools nurses need to be effective change agents and to adapt to evolving models of care. As di scussed later in this chapter, the committee's recommendation for a more highly educated nursing workforce must be paired with overall improvements to the educa tion system and must include competencies in such areas as leadership, basic health polic y, evidence-based care, qua lity improvement, and systems thinking. Moreover, even as the brea dth and depth of cont ent increase within prelicensure curricula, the cari ng essence and human connectedness nurses bring to patient care must be preserved. Nurses need to continue to provide holistic, patient-c entered care that goes beyond physical health needs to r ecognize and respond to the social , mental, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. Ot her fundamental elements of nur sing education, such as ethics and integrity, need to remain intact as well. The Goal and a Plan for Achieving It In the committee's view, increasing the percen tage of the current nursing workforce holding a BSN from 50 to 100 percent in th e near term is neither practi cal nor achievable. Setting a goal of increasing the percentage to 80 percent by 2020 is, however, bold, achievable, and necessary to move the nursing workforce to an expanded set of competencies, especia lly in the domains of community and public health, lead ership, systems improvement and change, research, and health policy. The committee believes achievi ng the goal of 80 percent of the nursing workforce having a BSN is possible in part because much of the educational capacity needed to meet this goal exists. RNs with an ADN or diploma degree have a num ber of options for completing the BSN, as presented below. The combination of these options and others yet to be developed will be needed to meet the 80 percent goal\u2014no one strategy will provide a universal solution. Technologies, such as the use of simulation and distance learning through online courses, will have to play a key role as well. Above all, what is needed to achieve this goal is the will of nurses to return to PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While there are challenges associated with shor tages of nurse faculty and clinical education sites (discussed below), these challenges are le ss problematic for licensed RNs pursuing a BSN than for prelicensure students, who require mo re intense oversight and monitoring by faculty. Additionally, most of what ADN-pr epared nurses need to move on to a baccalaureate degree can be taught in a classroom or on line, with additional tailored clinical experience. Online education creates flexibility and provides an additional skill set to students who will use technology into the future to retrieve and manage information. Over the course of its deliberations and duri ng the forum on education held in Houston, the committee learned about several pathways that are available to achieve th e goal of 80 percent of the nursing workforce having a BSN (additional innova tions discussed at the forum on education can be found in the forum summary on the CD-R OM in the back of this report). For RNs returning to obtain their BSN, a number of optio ns are possible, including traditional RN-to-BSN programs. Many hospitals also have joint arrangem ents with local universities and colleges to offer onsite classes. Hospitals generally provide stip ends to employees as an incentive to continue their education. Online education programs make courses available to all students regardless of where they live. For prospective nursing students, there are traditional 4-year BSN programs at a university, but there are also community colleges now offering 4-year baccalaureate degrees in some st ates (see the next section). Educational collaboratives between universities and community colle ges, such as the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education (described in Box 4-2), allow for automatic and seamless transition from an ADN to a BSN program, with all schools sharing curriculum, si mulation facilities, and faculty. As described below, this type of model is goes beyond th e conventional articula tion agreement between community colleges and universities. Beyond tr aditional nursing schools, new providers of nursing education are entering the market, such as proprietary/fo r-profit schools. These programs are offering new models and alternatives for delivering curriculum and reaching RNs and prospective students, although each of these school s should be evaluated for its ability to meet nursing accreditation standards, including the provision of clinical experiences required to advance the profession. Two other important programs designed to facilitate academic progression to higher levels of education are the LPN-to-BSN and ADN-to-MSN programs. The ADN-to-MSN program, in particular, is establishing a significant path way to advanced practi ce and faculty positions, especially at the community college level. Financial support to help build capacity for these programs will be important, including funding for grants and scholarships for nurses wishing to pursue these pathways. By the same token, the committee believes that diploma programs should be phased out over the next 10 years and should consolidate their resources with those of community college or preferably university programs offering the baccalaureate degree. Additionally, there are fe deral resources currently being us ed to support diploma schools that could better be used to expand baccala ureate and higher education programs.

That new nurse is capable of independent decision making while practicing in acute care settings and able to marshal the best available evidence while providing leadership within changing systems. \u2014Christine A. Tanner, PhD, RN, A. B. Y oumans-Spaulding distinguished professor, School of Nursing, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon In 2006, when Basilia Basin, BSN, RN, entered nu rsing school at Mount Hood Community College in Gresham, Oregon, near Portland, she was not sure whether she w ould pursue a bachelor's degree. A paycheck was important, she thought, and if she coul d obtain an associate's degree and a license after 3 years of schooling, why stay on for a fourth year to get her bachelor's? She took her time answering the question, but in the end she went for \"the opport unity for professional development,\" she said. Ms. Basin was in the first class of nursing students affiliated with the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education (OCNE; www.ocne.org), a partnership, fo rmed in 2003, between the five geographically dispersed campuses of Oregon Health & Science Un iversity (OHSU) and eight community colleges across Oregon. The 13 campuses share a standard, competency-based curric ulum that was developed by faculty at full-partner community colleges and the university. The model makes the best use of scarce resources by pooling faculty, classrooms, and clinical education resources in a state with urban, rural, and frontier settings (Gubrud-Howe et al., 2003; T anner et al., 2008). Community college nursing students can obtain their associate's degree in 3 years and continue for another year at OHSU to receive their baccalaureate without leaving their rural communities. This is facilitated through a seamless co- enrollment process across types of sc hools and financial aid transfers from the community college to the university. The overarching goal is twofold: to broaden and strengthen the professional competency of new nurses like Ms. Basin and to use scarce resources wisely to address the nursing shortage. Ms. Basin took her nursing licensure examinati on after she attained her associate's degree, remaining dually enrolled at Mount Hood and OHSU. \"It was quite a unique experience,\" she said, \"working as a nurse and being in school to become a nurse.\" That experience is one that Christine A. Tanner, PhD, RN, FAAN, would like to make less unique for nursing students in her state. \"We crea ted a system that makes the best use of faculty resources, clinical training sites, and the strengths of the community college systems and the university,\" said Dr. Tanner, A. B. Youmans-Spaulding distinguished professor at OHSU's nursing school. Using resources more efficiently was not her sole aim, however. The nation needs \"a new kind of nurse,\" she said, one competent in the skills needed for care in the 21st century. But only 21 percent of nurses receiving an associate's degree nationwide go on to obtain a bac helor's degree (HRSA, 2006), leaving the nation with an insufficient supply of nurses who can become fa culty, advanced practice registered nurses, or clinicians prepared for a future health care system that emphasizes community-based care. Dr. Tanner knew that nursing schools needed a new kind of curriculum. She and her OHSU colleagues met with representatives of the community colleges and agreed to craft a single nursing curriculum that would span all 13 campuses. The first c ourse in the program, after prerequisites, is health promotion. It introduces students to clinical decisio n making and nursing leadership\u2014\"learning to think like a nurse,\" as Dr. Tanner put it\u2014as they relate to prevention and wellness. Students then move on to courses in chronic illness management and acute care. Those who remain enrolled for the bachelor's take courses in population-based care, epidemio logy, leadership, and outcome management. Although the number of nursing students per facult y member in Oregon nearly doubled between 2001 and 2008 (Oregon Center for Nursing, 2009), 95 to 100 percent of graduates of OCNE schools pass the nursing licensure exam (the national average is 88 percent [(NCSBN, 2009)]). Of students in the OCNE system who attain an associate's deg ree, 45 percent receive a bachelor's degree. One important result is that nurses with a baccalaureate are becoming more widely distributed in rural areas. Dr. Tanner is working on educational redesign with the Center to Champion Nursing in America, funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and its state partnerships of nursing and other stakeholders concerned about the nur sing shortage. Ten state partne rships have committed to adopting PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH the model; five states\u2014Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, California, and New Mexico\u2014have already begun. Dr. Tanner is consulting with faculty members in at least ten other states, and the nation's largest urban public university system, the City University of New York, is adopting the model as well. Robyn Alper, MA, BSN, RN, an OCNE graduate now working as a nurse for a county in northern Oregon, may personify the OCNE ideal. \"The students coming out of OCNE have the skill to practice anywhere, but with an eye toward being a leader in t he profession,\" Ms. Alper said. \"I feel I can go out into the community\u2014not with every skill perfectly honed, but I know how to find what I need to get my job done.\" The committee anticipates that it will take a few years to build the educational capacity needed to achieve the goal of 80 percent of the nursing workforce being BSN-prepared by 2020, but also emphasizes that existing BSN completio n programs have capacity that is far from exhausted. Regional networks of schools working t ogether, along with health care organizations, may best facilitate reaching this goal. Moreover, the committee believes this clearly defined goal will stimulate stakeholders to take action. Exampl es of such action include academic and health care organizations/employers partnering to achieve strategic alignment around workforce development; government and foundations introduc ing funding opportunities for scholarships to build faculty and provide tuition relief; state boards of nursing increasing the use of earmarks on licensure fees to offset the cost of education; and states developing st atewide policy agendas and political action plans with identified leader s in nursing, government, and business to adopt measures to meet the goal. The Role of Community Colleges Community colleges play a key role in attrac ting students to the nursi ng education pipeline. Specifically, they provide an opportunity for st udents who may not have access to traditional university baccalaureate programs because of those programs' lack of enrollment capacity, distance, or cost. Community colleges have an important role to play in ensuring that more BSN-prepared nurses are available in all regions of the United States and that nursing edu cation at the associate level is high quality and affo rdable and prepares ADN nurses to move on to higher levels of education. Currently, ADN- and BSN-prepared nurs es are not evenly di stributed nationwide. BSN-prepared RNs are found more commonly in urban areas, while many rural and other medically underserved communities depend heavily on nurses with associate's degrees to staff their hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities (Cr onenwett, 2010). Figure 4-2 shows the highest nursing or nursing-relate d education by urban/rural residence. According to a study by the Urban Institute, \"medical personnel, including nurses, tend to work near where they were trained\" (Bovjberg, 2009; see Figure 4-3). This su ggests that state and community investments in nursing education (e.g., building nu rsing school capacity, building in frastructure to support that capacity, funding the purchase of technology, and offering scholarship s) may be an effective way to reduce local and regional shortages. Commun ity colleges are the predominant educational institutions in rural and medically underserved areas. Therefore, they must either join educational collaboratives or develop innovative and easil y accessible programs that seamlessly connect students to schools offering the BSN and higher de grees, or they must develop their own BSN programs (if feasible within state laws and re gulations). Community colleges must foster a culture that promotes and values academic pr ogression and should encourage their students to continue their education through st rategies that include making th em aware of the full range of PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

PETERSBURG COLLEGE AND OTHERS OPEN THE DOOR TO THE BACHELOR 'S DEGREE IN NURSING The more education a nurse has, the better the patient outcomes you're going to see. \u2014Jean Wortock, PhD, MSN, ARNP, dean and professor, College of Nursing at St. Petersburg College, St. Petersburg, Florida Tamela Monroe was 33 and working in sales in 1997 when she decided to pursue a career in nursing. She looked into the associate's degree program at a campus of St. Petersburg Junior College about a mile from her home in Palm Harbor, Florida. She did not consider the bachelor's of science in nursing (BSN) program at the University of South Florida (U SF) in Tampa; she had started working as a nurse's aide and felt she could not give up her job to go to school full time. \"I was just starting out in nursing,\" she said. \"And to lose any more money would not have been a good thing.\" She earned her associate's degree in 2001. When St. Petersburg Junior College changed its name to St. Petersburg College in 2002 and became the first baccalaureate-granting community college in Florida, Ms. Monroe pursued the BSN there. She was a licensed registered nurse (RN) working in a cardiac progressive care unit; classes were held in the community hospital where she worked. She received her bachelor's degree in 2004, and went on to USF to obtain her master's degree in 2006. Now 46, she is a clinical nurse leader in an orthopedic and neuroscience unit in a Tampa-area facility, as well as an adjunct instructor in nursing at Saint Petersburg College. The first community college in Florida to grant baccalaureate degrees, St. Petersburg College enrolled the first students in its BSN program in 2002. Now, its 613 BSN students and 687 associate's degree in nursing students can take classes on campus or online. Nine community colleges in Florida offer the BSN, and at least three other states are wo rking on allowing their community colleges to offer baccalaureates, including BSNs. Ms. Monroe is grateful to have earned a BSN at a co st 20 percent lower than the university's tuition, and she sees this as an important development in nu rsing education. \"It presents an opportunity for nurses in this area who might not have the finances or the time to travel all the way to a larger campus,\" she said. Some critics argue that in granting baccalaureates, community colleges are reaching beyond the bounds of their original mission of granting 2-year degrees as a stepping stone to a university education. Other opponents say that community college enrollm ents\u2014and funds\u2014are already stretched to the limit. In Michigan, for instance, critics say that community college tuition for the BSN will have to rise to avoid the need for more state funding (Lane, 2009). Still, many nurses are praising the quality, conv enience, flexibility, and affordability of the BSN programs available at community colleges. Jean Wo rtock, PhD, MSN, ARNP , dean and professor of nursing at Saint Petersburg College, said her scho ol's BSN program is opening up an important channel for Florida nurses to advance their education in a state where 46 percent of qualified applicants to BSN programs were turned away in 2009 because of facult y shortages and other factors (Florida Center for Nursing, 2010). \"We strongly encourage all of our baccalaureate graduates to go on for master's degrees,\" she said. \"And a number of ours have.\" Dr. Wortock said that St. Petersburg College an d USF have worked closely in the past 9 years to determine the degrees each institution would offer: \"We'r e offering some that they prefer not to offer so that they can focus more on master's programs in a particular field.\" St. Petersburg College now offers 22 bachelor's degrees, and even though both institutions have RN-to-BSN programs, the St. Petersburg nursing school has had high enough enrollments to allow t he hiring of eight full-time faculty members with doctorates to teach in its BSN program. Dr. Wortock has talked to nurses at community colleges in California, Washington, and Michigan about how her school took the lead in offering the BSN in Florida. And while she acknowledged that the movement is controversial, it is a movement nonetheless. \"It will give us a cadre of graduates and nurses that are much more prepared for research and evidence-based practice,\" she said.

Nursing schools across the United States collectively turn away tens of thousands of qualified applicants each year be cause of a lack of capacity (Kovner and Djukic, 2009)\u2014a situation that makes filling projected n eeds for more and different types of nurses difficult. Figure 4-4 shows the breakdown of nu mbers of qualified applicants who are turned away from ADN and BSN programs. An examination of the root causes of the edu cation system's insufficient capacity to meet undergraduate educational needs re veals four major barriers: (1 ) the aging and shortage of nursing faculty; (2) insufficient c linical placement opportunities of the right kind or duration for prelicensure nurses to learn thei r profession; (3) nursing education curricula that fail to impart relevant competencies needed to meet the fu ture needs of patients and to prepare nurses adequately for academic progression to higher de grees; and (4) inadequate workforce planning, which stems from a lack of the communications, data sources, and information systems needed to align educational capacity with market demand s.

The same forces that are leading to deficits in the numbers and competen cies of bedside nurses affect the capacity of nursing faculty as well (Allan and Aldebron, 200 8). According to a survey by the NLN, 84 percent of U.S. nursing schools trie d to hire new faculty in the 2007 2008 academic year; of those, four out of five found it \"difficult\"5 to recruit faculty, and one out of three found it \"very difficult.\" The principal difficulties included \"n ot enough qualified candidates\" (cited by 46 percent) and the inability to offer competitiv e salaries (cited by 38 percent). The survey concluded that \"post-licensure pr ograms were much more likely to cite a shortage of faculty, whereas pre-licensure programs reported that lack of clinical placement settings were [sic] the biggest impediment to admitting more students. Sp ecifically, almost two thirds (64 percent) of doctoral programs and one half of RN-BSN and master's programs identified an insufficient faculty pool to draw from as the major constrai nt to expansion, in cont rast to one third of prelicensure programs\" (NLN, 2010a). Age is also a contributing factor to faculty shor tages. Nursing faculty tend to be older than clinical nurses because they must meet requirements for an advanced degree in order to teach. Figure 4-5 shows that the average age of nurses who work as faculty as their principal nursing position\u2014the position in which a nurse spends the majority of his or her working hours 6\u2014is 50 to 54. By contrast, the median age of the total RN workforce is 46. More than 19 percent of RNs whose principal position is faculty are aged 60 or older, while only 8.7 percent of nurses who have a secondary position as faculty\u2014those who hold a nonfaculty (e.g., clinical) principal position\u2014are aged 60 or older. Nurses who work as faculty as their secondary position tend to be younger; among nurses under age 50, more work as faculty as their secondary than as their principal position (HRSA, 2010b). Moreover, the av erage retirement age for nursing faculty is 62.5 (Berlin and Sechrist, 2002); as a result, many full-time faculty will be ready to retire soon. Given the landscape of the health care system and the fragmented nursing education system, the current pipeline cannot easily re plenish this loss, let alone meet the potential demand for more educators. In addition to the innovative strate gies of the Veterans Affairs Nursing Academy (VANA) and Gulf Coast Health Services Steering Committee (GCHSSC) for responding to faculty shortages (discussed later in this chap ter), a potential opportuni ty to relieve faculty shortages could involve the creation of programs that would a llow MSN, DNP, and PhD students to teach as nursing faculty interns, with mentoring by full-time faculty. Effects of the first degree at entry into the profession Nurses who enter the profession with an associate's degree are less likely than those w ho enter with a bachelor's degree to advance to the graduate level over the course of their career (Cleary et al., 2009) . Figure 4-6 gives an overview of the highest educational degree obtained by women and men who hold the RN license.

Approximately 80 percent of the time , however, ADN graduates fail to move beyond a BSN. Therefore, the greatest number of nurses w ith a master's or doctorate, a prerequisite for serving as faculty, received a BSN as their in itial degree. Since two- thirds of current RNs received the ADN as their initial degree, Aiken's analysis sugges ts that current ly \"having enough faculty (and other master's prepar ed nurses) to enable nursing schools to expand enrollment is a mathematical improbability\" (Aik en et al., 2009). A separate an alysis of North Carolina nurses led to a similar conclusion (Bevill et al., 2007). Table 4-2 shows the length of time it takes those nurses who do move on to higher levels of educat ion to progress from completing initial nursing education to completing the highest nursing degree achieved.

As shown in Table 4-3, the average annual earnings of nurses who work full time as faculty (most with either a master's or doctoral degree) total $63,949. By contrast, nurse practitioners (NPs) (with either a master's or doctoral degree ) average just over $85,000 (see Table 4-4). Section 5311 of the Affordable Ca re Act (ACA) offers an incentive designed to offset lower faculty salaries by providing up to $35,000 in loan repayments and scholarships for eligible nurses who complete an advanced nursing degree and serve \"as a full-time member of the faculty of an accredited school of nursing, for a total period, in the ag gregate, of at least 4 years.\" 7 However, the ACA does not provide incentiv es for nurses to de velop the specific educational and clinical competencies required to teach.

Projections of future faculty demand To establish a better unders tanding of future needs, the committee asked the RWJF Nursing Research Netw ork to project faculty demand for the next 15 years. After reviewing data from the AACN8 and the NLN (Kovner et al., 2006), the network estimated that between 5,000 and 5,500 faculty positions will remain unfilled in associate's, baccalaureate, and higher degree programs. This projection is based on hi storical nurse faculty retirement rates and on graduati on trends in research-focused nursing PhD programs. Although a doctoral degree is often required or preferred for all current faculty vaca ncies, some of these positions can be filled with faculty holding DNP or master's degrees. If faculty retirement rates decrease and/or ne w faculty positions are created to meet future demands (resulting, for example, from provisions for loan repayment in the ACA), these factors will affect the shortage estimates. Additionally, the faculty supply may be affected positively by growing numbers of graduates with a DNP degree (discussed later in this chapter) who, as noted above, may be eligible for faculty positions in some academic institutions. Insufficient Clinical Pl acement Opportunities As nursing education has moved out of hosp ital-based programs and into mainstream colleges and universities, integr ating opportunities for c linical experience into coursework has become more difficult (Cronenwett, 2010). Nursi ng leaders continue to confront challenges of the academic and practice worlds in ensuring that nursing associated with the separation 8 Personal communication, Di Fang, Director of Research and Data Services, AACN, March 3, 2010.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-21 students develop the competencies required to enter the workforce and function effectively in health care settings (Cronenwe tt and Redman, 2003; Fagin, 1986). While efforts are being made to expand placements in the community and more care is being delivered in community settings, the bulk of clinical education for studen ts still occurs in acute care settings. The required number of clinical hours varies wi dely from one program to another, and most state boards of nursing do not specify a minimum number of clinical ho urs in prelicensure programs (NCSBN, 2008). It is like ly, moreover, that many of the cl inical hours fail to result in productive learning. Students spend much of thei r clinical time performing routine care tasks repeatedly, which may not contribu te significantly to increased learning. Faculty report spending most of their time supervising students in hands -on procedures, leaving little time focused on fostering the development of clinical reasoning skills (McNelis and Ironside, 2009).9 Some advances in clinical education have been made through strong academic service partnerships. An example of such partnerships in community settings is nurse-managed health centers (discussed in Chapter 3), which serve a du al role as safety net practices and clinical education sites. Another, commonly used model is having skilled and experienced practitioners in the field oversee student clinical experiences . According to a recent in tegrative review, using these skilled practitioners, called preceptors, in a clinical setti ng is at least as effective as traditional approaches while conserving scarce facu lty resources (Udlis, 2006). A variety of other clinical partnerships have been designed to increase capacity in the face of nursing faculty shortages (Baxter, 2007; DeLunas and Rooda, 2009; Kowalski et al., 2007 ; Kreulen et al., 2008; Kruger et al., 2010). In addition to academic service partnerships and preceptor models, the use of high-fidelity simulation offers a potential so lution to the problem of lim ited opportunities for clinical experience, with early studies s uggesting the effectiven ess of this approach (Harder, 2010). The NLN, for example, has established an onlin e community called the Simulation Innovation Resource Center (SIRC), where nurse faculty can learn how to \"design, im plement, and evaluate the use of simulation\" in their curriculum.10 However, there is little evidence that simulation expands faculty capacity, and no data exist to de fine what portion of cl inical experience it can replace. To establish uniform guidelines for educators, accreditation requirements should be evaluated and revised to allow simulation to fu lfill the requirement for a standard number of clinical hours. The use of simulation in relati onship to the promotion of interprofessional education is discussed below. Increased attention is being focused on the dedicated education un it (DEU) as a viable alternative for expanding clinical education capacity (Moscato et al., 2007). In this model, health care units are dedicated to the instruction of students from one program. Staff nurses who want to serve as clinical inst ructors are prepared to do so, and facu lty expertise is used to support their development and comfort in this role. DEUs we re developed in Australia and launched in the United States at the University of Portland in Oregon in 2003. Si nce then, the University of Portland has helped at least a dozen other U.S. nursing schools establish DEUs. In programs that offer DEUs, students perform two 6-week rotations per semester, each instructor/staff nurse ents at a time, and a university faculty member oversees the teaches no more than two stud 9 This paragraph, and the three that follow, were adapted from a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Transforming Pre-Licensure Nursing Education: Preparing the New Nurse to Meet Emerging Health Care Needs,\" prepared by Christine A.

Early results suggest the DEU can dramatically incr ease capacity and have a positive effect on satisfaction among students and nursing staff. A mul tisite study funded by RWJF is currently under way to evaluate outcomes of the DEU model. DEUs offer benefits for the nursing schools, the hospitals, th e faculty, and the students. Because the hospital employs th e clinical instructors, the nursing school can increase its enrollment without increasing cost s. The hospital benefits by training students it can hire after their graduation and licensure. Students benefit by having consistent clinical instructors each day, something not guaranteed under the traditional preceptorship model. As the case study in Box 4-4 shows, the benefits of DEUs extend beyond the academic environment to the practice setting as well. BOX 4-4 The Dedicated Education Unit A NEW MODEL OF EDUCATION TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT WITHOUT RAISING COSTS Our clinical instruct ors want the patients to go home with the best outcomes and the students to leave here with the best learning experiences. These students will be the ones taking care of us in the future, and we want them to be very well prepared. \u2014Cindy Lorion, MSN, RN, nurse manager, neurovascular and orthopedic units, Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, Portland, Oregon Jamie Sharp, a 21-year-old University of Portl and (UP) nursing student who has performed clinical rotations in a variety of units, remembers a particula rly unpleasant experience in a psychiatric unit where she felt she was \"in the way\" of her nurse preceptors. This was in stark contrast to her experience on a neurovascular unit at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, where she had just one clinical instructor, a nurse who was eager to teach her. That neurovascular unit was a dedicated education unit (DEU). Created in Australia in the late 1990s and launched in the United States at UP in 2003, t he DEU model joins a school of nursing with units at local hospitals, where experienced staff nurses become clinical instructors of juniors and seniors in the bachelor's degree program. Each instructor teaches no more than two students at a time, but the DEU can be used around the clock. With a DEU, a nursing school can \"cultivate a uni t\" as an excellent learning environment, said UP's dean of nursing, Joanne Warner, PhD, RN, FAAN. Most important, she added, is \"the expertise of the nurses there\u2014they know the clinical procedures, t he current medications, the policies of the hospital.\" The DEU differs from a usual clinical rotation in the relationship that develops between instructor and student, something that cannot take place when a prec eptor has eight students that change from week to week. The instructor gets to know the strengths and weaknesses of the student and supports the student in building confidence and relevant knowledge and skills. Ms. Sharp was paired with Cathy Mead, ADN, RN, a nurse with 25 years of experience in the unit who received clinical instructor training from the nursing school. Her instruct ion is overseen by both a university faculty member and the unit's nurse manager. Dr. Warner said that the benefits to her school a nd to students are quite tangible: \"We have tripled our enrollment. If we had a traditional model I would not have the budget to hire the clinical faculty needed.\" The number of students on clinical rotations in creased from 227 in 14 units in 2002, before the DEUs were implemented, to 333 in 6 units in 2006, af ter the DEUs were instituted (Moscato et al., 2007). Now, up to 60 percent of a UP nursing student's clinical rotations take place in DEUs. But equally important, the students report learning more in DE Us and are seeking clinical placements on them. It might appear that the university profits far more than the hospital\u2014especially since nearly 40,000 qualified applicants were turned away from baccalaureate nursing programs in 2009 because of shortages of faculty and clinical teaching sites (A ACN, 2009c)\u2014but that is not the case, said Cindy Lorion, MSN, RN, nurse manager of the neurovascula r and orthopedic units at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center. The clinical instructors are enthusias tic about their new role. They receive adjunct faculty PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-23 appointments at UP, gaining such benefits as library access but no additional pay from the university (some but not all facilities increase a clinical instruct or's salary). Ms. Lorion has seen an increase in evidence-based prac tice and in the retention of nurses, as well as better-prepared graduates, many of whom seek jobs at the hospital. She also said that \"a village\" grows around the students, with everyone from physicians to nurses' aides taking part in \"raising\" them. The partnership has led to changes in teaching and in clinical care. After a student made an error by injecting a medication into the wrong tube, the hos pital changed its policy on syringe placement, and the school added a \"tubes lab\" to its courses. A limited number of available clinical training site s in some areas may hamper widespread use of the model, and some units may take students on reluctantl y, requiring a change in organizational culture. Nonetheless, more than 100 schools of nursing part icipated in an international symposium on DEUs in 2007, and more than 20 are developing their own DEUs. After 25 years as a nurse, Ms. Mead is pursuing he r bachelor's degree. \"I definitely have to keep it fresh,\" she said of the challenge of working with stud ents like Ms. Sharp. \"And not everyone can say that after being on the same unit for years.\" Need for Updated and Adaptive Curricula A look at the way nursing students are educated at the prelicensure level11 shows that most schools are not providing enough nur ses with the required competencies in such areas as geriatrics and culturally relevant care to meet the changing hea lth needs of the U.S. population (as outlined in Chapter 2) (AACN and Hartfor d, 2000). The majority of nursing schools still educate students primarily for acute care rather than community settings, including public health and long-term care. Most curricula are organi zed around traditional me dical specialties (e.g., maternalchild, pediatrics, medical surgical, or adult health) (McN elis and Ironside, 2009). The intricacies of care coordination are not adequate ly addressed in most prelicensure programs. Nursing students may gain exposure to leading health care disciplines and know something about basic health policy and available health and social service programs, such as Medicaid. However, their education often does not promote the skills n eeded to negotiate with the health care team, navigate the regulatory and access stipulations that determine patients' eligibility for enrollment in health and social service programs, or understand how these programs and health policies impact health outcomes. Nursing curricula need to be reexamined and updated. They need to be adaptive enough to undergo conti nuous evaluation and improvement based on new evidence and a changing science base, changes and advances in technology, and cha nges in the needs of patients and the health care system. Many nursing schools have dealt with the rapid growth of health research and knowledge by adding layers of content that require more instruction (Irons ide, 2004). A wide range of new competencies also are being incorporated in to requirements for accreditation (CCNE, 2009; NLNAC, 2008). For example, new competencies have been promul gated to address quality and patient safety goals (Cronenwett et al., 2007; IOM, 2003a). Greater emphasis on prevention, wellness, and improved health outcomes has led to new competency requirements as well (Allan et al., 2005). New models of care being promulgated as a result of health ca re reform will need to be introduced into students' experiences and will require competencies in such areas as care any of which could be focused in alterna tive settings such as reate new student placemen t options that will need to be tested for coordination. These models, mschools and workplaces, will c 11 Available evidence is based on evaluation of BSN programs and curricula. Evidence was not available for ADN or diploma programs.

(See also the discussion of competencies later in the chapter.) The explosion of knowledge and de cision-science technology also is changing the way health professionals access, process, and use informa tion. No longer is rote memorization an option. There simply are not enough hours in the day or years in an undergraduate program to continue compressing all available information into the cu rriculum. New approaches must be developed for evaluating curricula and presenting fundame ntal concepts that can be applied in many different situations rather th an requiring students to memori ze different lists of facts and information for each situation. Just as curricula must be assessed and rethought, so, too, must teaching learning strategies. Most nurse faculty initially learned to be nurse s through highly structured curricula that were laden with content (NLN Boar d of Governors, 2003), and too few have received advanced formal preparation in curriculu m development, instructional de sign, or performance assessment. Faculty, tending to teach as th ey were taught, focus on covering content (Benner et al., 2009; Duchscher, 2003). They also see curriculum-related requirements as a barr ier to the creation of learning environments that are both engaging and student-centered (S chaefer and Zygmont, 2003; Tanner, 2007). GRADUATE NURSING EDUCATION Even absent passage of the ACA, the need fo r APRNs, nurse faculty, and nurse researchers would have increased dramatically under any s cenario (Cronenwett, 2010). Not only must schools of nursing build their capac ity to prepare more students at the gr aduate level, but they must do so in a way that fosters a unified, competency-based approach with the highest possible standards. Therefore, building the science of nursing education research, or how best to teach students, is an important emphasis for the field of nursing edu cation. For APRNs, graduate education should ensure that they can contribute to primary care a nd help respond to shortages, especially for those populations who are most underserved. For nur se researchers, a focus on fundamental improvements in the delivery of nursing care to improve patient safety and quality is key. Numbers and Distribution of Graduate-Level Nurses As of 2008, more than 375,000 women and men in the workforce had received a master's degree in nursing or a nu rsing-related field, and more than 28,000 had gone on to receive either a doctorate in nursing or a nursing- related doctoral degree in a fiel d such as public health, public administration, sociology, or education 12 (see Table 4-5) (HRSA, 2010b). Master's degrees prepare RNs for roles in nursing administration and clinical leadersh ip or for work in advanced practice roles (discussed be low) (AARP, 2010 [see Annex 1-1]). Many nursing faculty, particularly clinical instructors, are prepared at the master's level. Doctoral degrees include the DNP and PhD. A PhD in nursing is a research-oriented degree de signed to educate nurses in a wide range of scientific areas that may include clinical scienc e, social science, policy, and educated nurses teach in university settings and conduct research education. Traditionally, PhD- 12 Nursing-related doctoral degrees are defined by the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) as non-nursing degrees that are directly related to a nurse's career in the nursing professi on. \"Nursing-related degrees include public health, health administration, social work, education, and other fields\" (HRSA, 2010b).

The DNP is the complement to other practice do ctorates, such as the MD, PharmD, doctorate of physical therapy, and others th at require highly rigorous clinic al training. Nurses with DNPs are clinical scholars who have the capacity to tr anslate research, shape systems of care, potentiate individual care into care needed to serve populations, and ask the clinical questions that influence organizational-level re search to improve performance using informatics and quality improvement models. The DNP is a relatively ne w degree that offers nurses an opportunity to become practice scholars in such areas as clinic al practice, leadership, quality improvement, and health policy. The core curriculu m for DNPs is guided by the AACN's Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice . 13 Schools of nursing have been developing DNP programs since 2002, but only in the last 5 years have the numbers of graduates approach ed a substantial level (Raines, 2010). Between 2004 and 2008 the number of programs offering the de gree increased by nearly 40 percent, as is shown in Figure 4-7. At this point, more evidence is needed to examine the impact DNP nurses will have on patient outcomes, costs, quality of care, and access in clinical settings. It is also difficult to discern how DNP nurse s could affect the provision of nursing education and whether they will play a significant role in easing facu lty shortages. While the DNP provides a promising opportunity to advance the nursing profession, an d some nursing organizations are promoting this degree as the next step for APRNs, the committee cannot comment directly on the potential role of DNP nurses because of the cu rrent lack of evidence on outcomes. 13 See http://www.aacn.nche.edu/dnp/pdf/essentials.pdf .

Although 13 percent of nurses hold a graduate degree, fewer than 1 percent (28,369 nurses) have a doctoral degrees in nursi ng or a nursing-related field, the qualificati on needed to conduct independent research (HRSA, 2010b). In fact, on ly 555 students graduated with a PhD in nursing in 2009, a number that has remained cons tant for the past decade (AACN, 2009a). As noted, key roles for PhD nurses include teaching future gene rations of nurses and co nducting research that becomes the basis for improvements in nursing practice. As the need for nursing education and research and for nurses to engage with interpro fessional research teams has grown, the numbers of nurses with a PhD in nursing or a related field have not kept pa ce (see Figure 4-7 for trends in the various nursing programs). The main reasons for this lag are (1) an inadequate pool of nurses with advanced nursing degrees to draw upon, (2) faculty salaries and benefits that are not comparable to those of nurses with advanced nursing degrees working in clinical settings, and (3) a culture that promotes obtaini ng clinical experience prior to continuing graduate education.

APRNs serv e as NPs, certified nu rse midwives (CNMs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and certified re gistered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). To gain certification in one of these adva nced practice areas, nurses must take specialized courses in addition to a basic core curriculum. Credit requ irements vary from program to program and from specialty to specialty, but typical ly range from a minimum of 40 credits for a master's to more than 80 credits for a DNP. Upon completion of re quired coursework and clinical hours, students must take a certification exam th at is administered by a credentia ling organization relevant to the specific specialization, such as the American Nurs ing Credentialing Center (for NPs and CNSs), the American Midwifery Certification Board (for CNMs), or the National Board on Certification and Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists (for CRNAs). Nurses who receive certifica tion, including those serving in all advanced practice roles, provide added assurance to the public that th ey have acquired the specialized professional development, training, and competencies require d to provide safe, quality care for specific patient populations. For example, NPs and CNSs may qualify for certification after completing a master's degree, post-master's coursework, or doctoral degree through an accredited nursing program, with specific advanced coursework in areas such as health assessment, pharmacology, and pathophysiology; additional content in health promotion, disease prevention, differential diagnosis, and disease management; and at least 500 hours of faculty-supervi sed clinical training within a program of study (ANCC, 2010a, 2010c). Certification is time-limited, and maintenance of certification require s ongoing acquisition of both knowledge and experience in practice. For ex ample, most advanced practice certification must be renewed every 5 years (NPs, CNSs); re quirements include a minimum of 1,000 practice hours in the specific certification role and popul ation/specialty. These requirements must be fulfilled within the 5 years preceding submi ssion of the renewal application (ANCC, 2010b). CRNAs are recertified every 2 year s and must be substantially enga ged in the practice of nurse anesthesia during those years, in addition to completing continuing educ ation credits (NBCRNA, 2009). Recertification for CNMs is shifting from 8 to 5 year s and also involves a continuing education requirement (AMCB, 2009). As the health care system grows in complexity, expectations are that APRNs will have competence in expanding areas such as t echnology, genetics, quality improvement, and geriatrics. Coursework and clini cal experience requirements are in creasing to keep pace with these changes. Jean Johnson, Dean of the School of Nursing at The George Washington University, notes that in term s of education, this is a time of major transition for APRNs.14 With the DNP, some nursing education institutions are now able to offer professional parity with other health disciplines that are shifti ng, or have already shifted, to requi re doctorates in their areas of practice, such as pharmacy, occupational and physical therapy, and speech pathology. As discussed above, DNP programs allow nurses to hone their expertise in ro les related to nurse executive practice, health policy, informatics, an d other practice specialties. (It should be noted, however, that throughout this report, the discussion of AP RNs does not distinguish between those with master's and DNP degrees who have graduated from an accredited program.) 14 Personal communication, Jean Johnson, Dean, School of Nursing, George Washington University, September 3, 2010.

For the latter role, a doctoral degree is required, yet as noted above, fewer than 1 percent of nurses have achieved this level of education. This number is insufficient to meet the crucial need for resear ch in two key areas: nur sing education and nursing science. Research on Nursing Education At no time in recent history has there been a gr eater need for research on nursing education. As health care reform progresses, basic and adva nced nursing practices are being defined by the new competencies alluded to a bove and discussed in the next section, yet virtually no evidence exists to support the teaching appr oaches used in nursing education.15 Additionally, little research has focused on clinic al education models or clinical experiences that can help students achieve these competencies , even though clinical education constitutes the largest portion of nurses' educa tional costs. Likewise, little evidence supports appropriate student/faculty ratios. Yet current clinical e ducation models and student/faculty ratios are limiting capacity at a time when th e need for new nurses is projecte d to increase. The paucity of evidence in nursing education and pedagogy calls for additional research and funding to ascertain the efficiency and effectiveness of approaches to nursi ng education, advancing evidence-based teaching and interprofessional kn owledge. Chapter 7 outlines specific research priorities that could shape im provements to nursing education. In a recent editorial, Broome (2009) highlighted the need for three critical changes required to \"systematically build a...science that could guide nurse educators to develop high quality, relevant, and cost-effective models of edu cation that produce graduates who can make a difference in the health system\": funding to support nursing education researc h, potentially via mechanisms through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); multidisciplinary research training programs, including postdoctoral training to prepare a cadre of nurses dedicated to developing the science of nursing education; and efforts to foster the development of PhD progr ams that have faculty expertise to mentor a new generation of nursing education researchers. Research on Nursing Science The expansion of knowledge about the science of nursing is key to prov iding better patient care, improving health, and ev aluating outcomes. Along with an adequate supply of qualified nurses, meeting the nation's growi ng health care needs requires continued growth in the science people and populations and designing health systems. Nurse he discovery and translation of knowledge that can be generated of delivering effective care for scientists are a critical link in t 15 Some faculty development programs and training oppor tunities are offered through universities and professional organizations, such as the AACN and the NLN. Additiona lly, the NLN offers a certification program for nurse educators, who can publically confirm knowledge in the areas of pedagogy, learning, and the complex encounter between educator and student. This certification progra m can provide a basis for innovation and the continuous quality improvement of nursing education.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-29 by nurses and other health scientis ts. To carry out this crucial wo rk, a sustainable supply of and support for nurse scientists will be necessary (IOM, 2010). The research conducted by nurse scientists has led to many fundamental improvements in the provision of care. Advances have been realize d, for example, in the prevention of pressure ulcers; the reduction of high bl ood pressure among African Amer ican males; and the models described elsewhere in this repo rt for providing transitional care after hospital discharge and for promoting health and well-being among young, disa dvantaged mothers and their newborns. Yet nursing's research capacity has b een largely overlooked in the development of strategies for responding to the shortage of nur ses or effecting the necessary transformation of the nursing profession. The result has been a serious mismat ch between the urgent need for knowledge and innovation to improve care and the nur sing profession's ability to res pond to that need, as well as a limitation on what nursing schools can include in their curricula and what is disseminated in the clinical settings where nurses engage. A 2005 report of the National Research Council, Advancing the Nation's Health Needs: NIH's Research Training Program , focuses on nursing research. It identifies four important barriers to the future of the field: an aging cad re of nursing science researchers, longer times required to complete doctoral degrees, increasi ng demands on nursing fa culty to also meet workforce demands, and an increasing emphasis on clinical doctoral programs over those aimed at training researchers (NRC, 2005). Overcoming these barriers will be esse ntial to achieving the transformation of the nursing prof ession that this report argues is essential to a transformed health care system. COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION Competencies that are well known to the nursi ng profession, such as care management and coordination, patient education, public health intervention, and tr ansitional care, are likely to dominate in a reformed health care system. As Edward O'Neil, Director, Center for the Health Professions at the Univer sity of California, San Franci sco, pointed out however, \"these traditional competencies must be reinterpreted for students into the settings of the emergent care system, not the one that is being left behind. This will require faculty to not only teach to these competencies but also creatively apply them to health environments that are only now emerging\" (O'Neil, 2009). Emerging new competencies in decision making, quality improvement, systems thinking, and team leadership must become part of every nurse's professional formation from the prelicensure through th e doctoral level. A review of medical school education found th at evidence in favor of competency-based education is limited but growing (Carraccio et al., 2002). Nurs ing schools also have embraced the notion of competency-based education, as not ed earlier in the chapte r in the case study on the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education (Box 4-2). In addition, Western Governors University uses competency-based educat ion exclusively, allowing nursing students to move through their program of study at their own pace. Mastery of the competency is achieved to the satisfaction of the faculty without the normal time-bound semester structure (IOM, 2010).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-30 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Defining Core Competencies The value of competency-based education in nursing is that it can be strongly linked to clinically based performance expe ctations. It should be noted that \"competencies\" here denotes not task-based proficiencies bu t higher-level competencies that represent the ability to demonstrate mastery over care management knowl edge domains and that provide a foundation for decision-making skills under variety of clin ical situations across all care settings. Numerous sets of core competencies for nursing education are availabl e from a variety of sources. It has proven difficult to establish a single set of competencies that cover all clinical situations, across all settings, for all levels of students. However, there is significant overlap among the core competencies that exist because many of them are derived from such landmark reports as Recreating Health Professional Practice for a New Century (O'Neil and Pew Health Professions Comm ission, 1998) and Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (IOM, 2003b). The competencies in these reports focus on aspects of professional behavior (e.g., ethical standards, cultural competency) and emphasize areas of care (e.g., prev ention, primary care), with overarching goals of (1) providing patient-centered care, (2) applying quality improvement principles, (3) working in interprofessional t eams, (4) using evidence-based practices, and (5) using health information technologies. Two examples of sets of core competencies come from the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education 16 and the AACN. The former set features co mpetencies that promote nurses' abilities in such areas as clinical judgm ent to individuals and families in self-care practices for promotion of health and management of chronic illness; and teaching, delegation, and supervision of caregivers. The AACN's set of competencies is outlined in Essentials for Baccalaureate Education and highlights such areas as \"patient-centered care, interprofessional teams, eviden ce-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning/ critical thinking, genetics and genomics, cultural sensitivity, professionalism, practice across the lifespan, and end-of-life care\" (AACN, 2008b) While students appear to graduate with ample factual knowledge of these types of core competencies, however, they often appear to ha ve little sense of how the competencies can be applied or integrated into real-world practice situations (Benne r et al., 2009). Imparting emerging competencies, such as qual ity improvement and systems thinking, is also key to developing a more highly educated workforce. Doing so will require performing a thorough evaluation and redesign of educational content, not ju st adding content to existing curricula. An exploration of the educationa l changes required to teach all the emerging competencies required to meet the needs of diverse patient po pulations is beyond the scope of this report. Defining an agreed-upon set of core competenci es across health profe ssions could lead to better communication and coor dination among disciplines (see the discussion of the Interprofessional Education Collaborative belo w for an example of one such effort). Additionally, the committee supports the development of a unifie d set of core competencies across the nursing profession and believes it woul d help provide direction for standards across nursing education. Defining these core competencies must be a collaborative effort among nurse zations, and health care organizatio ns and providers. This effort educators, professional organi 16 See http://www.ocne.org/. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-31 should be ongoing and should inform regular upda tes of nursing curricula to ensure that graduates at all levels are prepar ed to meet the current and future health needs of the population. Assessing Competencies Changes in the way competencies are asse ssed are also needed. In 2003, the IOM's Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality called for systemwide changes in the education of health professionals, including a move on the part of accrediting and cert ifying organizations for all health professionals toward mandating a co mpetency-based approach to education (IOM, 2003a). Steps are already being taken to establ ish competency-based assessments in medical education. In its 2009 report to Congress on Improving Incentives in the Medicare Program , the Medicare Payment Advisory Comm ission highlighted an initiative of the Accred itation Council for Graduate Medical Education to require greater competency-based assessment of all residency programs that train physicians in the United States (MedPAC, 2009). The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) has considered various challenges re lated to competency assessment and is considering approaches to ensu re that RNs can demonstrate competence in the full range of areas that are re quired for the practice of nursing.17 A competency-based approach to education strive s to make the competencies for a particular course explicit to students and requires them to demonstrate mastery of those competencies (Harden, 2002). Performance-based assessment th en shows whether students have both a theoretical grasp of what they have learned and the ability to apply that knowledge in a real- world or realistically simulated situation. The transiti on-to-practice or nurs e residency programs discussed in Chapter 3 could offer an extende d opportunity to rein force and test core competencies in real-world settings that are both safe and monitored. Lifelong Learning and Continuing Competence Many professions, such as nursing, that depend heavily on knowledge are becoming increasingly technical and complex (The Lewin Group, 2009). No individual can know all there is to know about providing safe and effective care, which is why nurses must be integral members of teams that include other health prof essionals. Nor can a single initial degree provide a nurse with all she or he will need to know ove r an entire career. Creating an expectation and culture of lifelong learning for nur ses is therefore essential. From Continuing Education to Continuing Competence Nurses, physicians, and other health professionals have long depended on continuing education programs to maintain and develop new competencies over the course of their careers. Yet the 2009 IOM study Redesigning Continuing Educati on in the Health Professions cites \"major flaws in the way [continui ng education] is conducted, fina nced, regulated, and evaluated\" and states that the evidence base underlying current conti nuing education programs is \"fragmented and undeveloped.\" These shortcomi ngs, the report suggests, have hindered the identification of effective educational methods and their integration into coordinated, comprehensive programs that meet the needs of all health professionals (IOM, 2009). Likewise, re is no clear li nk between continuing educ ation requirements and the NCSBN has found that the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 17 Personal communication, Kathy Apple, CEO, NCSBN, May 30, 2010.

This new comprehensive vision is often te rmed \"continuing competence.\" The practice setting, like the academic setting, is challenged by the need to integrate traditional and emerging competencies. Therefore, building the capacity for lifelong learning\u2014which encompasses both continuing competence and advanced degrees\u2014re quires ingenuity on the part of employers, businesses, schools, community and government leaders, and philanthropies. The case study in Box 4-5 describes a program that extends the car eers of nurses by training them to transition from the acute care to the community setting. BOX 4-5 Nursing for Life: The RN Career Transition Program A NEW PROGRAM EXTENDS THE WORKING LIFE OF AGING NURSES BY TRAINING THEM TO WORK IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS I still have a tremendous amount to offer here. I can see myself working well into my 60s. \u2014Sheri Morris, MN, RN, graduate of Nursing for Life, Lambertville, Michigan At age 62 Jackie Tibbetts, MS, RN, CAGS, was thin king, naturally, about retirement. She was nearing the end of a 39-year teaching career when a close fri end became ill, and her proximity to her friend's care and eventual death made her realize she still had a great deal to offer. She felt compelled to return to nursing, her first profession. Ms. Tibbetts now provides skilled nursing care at a retirement community in a suburb of Boston. She made the move to long-term care through the Nursing for Life: RN Career Transition program at Michigan State University (MSU) College of Nursing, an outgrowth of a 2002 online refresher course the school offered. Because she had maintained her registered nurse (RN) license, she was eligible for the course, and with a background in rehabilitation she determined t hat the long-term care setting would be a good fit. Ms. Tibbetts received online education and performed a clinical practicum near her Massachusetts home. Now 64, she plans to work as a nurse \"as long as I'm able,\" she said. In 2006 the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Founda tion, in concert with the College of Nursing at MSU, set out to broaden the opportunities for Michig an's, and the nation's, aging nursing workforce. \"We began to think about some of the needs of mid-to-late-career nurses still working in acute care and looking to move away from that work, for the physica l intensity of it,\" said Terrie Wehrwein, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, associate professor at the school. The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation and the College of Nursing at MSU were among the first recipi ents of a grant from Partners Investing in Nursing's Future, a joint venture of the Northwest Health Foundation and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The program began in 2008 as a pilot project to train licensed RNs to work in four community settings that may be less physically demanding than acute care\u2014home care, long-term care, hospice, and ambulatory care\u2014and that are open to any licensed nurse, not just those in Michigan. (Two new tracks, in case management and quality and safety management, are being developed.) The program has two components: an online, self-p aced didactic course has seven core modules, plus seven modules specific to each specialty, and an 80-hour clinical practicum pairs the nurse, ideally, with a single preceptor in the area of study. Nurs es have 1 year to finish the online course and are encouraged to complete the practicum within 5 weeks. The program has attracted not onl y aging nurses but also younger ones wanting to change work settings. And Michigan is not the only state that benefits; of the 28 nurses who have completed the program, about 10 percent live out of state. (Michigan residents who cannot afford the $1250 tuition may 18 Personal communication, Kathy Apple, CEO, NCSBN, May 30, 2010.

Other states may provide similar assistance.) After receiving a bachelor's degree in nursing in 1974 and a master's in 1982, Shari Morris, MN, RN, left the profession in 1990 to home-school her four sons . She took a Minnesota refresher course in 2006, when she was 54, and got a job in a pediatrician's office. She realized she would need further training to advance in ambulatory care and enrolled in Nursing for Life. For her clinical practicum she chose two pediatric clinics in a nearby hospital. When asked what impact the program has had on her ability to remain a nurse, she said, \"I think, probably, courage.\" The course gave her the self-assurance to apply for a job in teaching when she could not find an opening in ambulatory care; she is now an instructor in nursing at a Michigan community college. \"I felt confident to step out of the first setting I'd been in 17 years and go into another arena, without any difficulties,\" Ms. Morris said. Interprofessional Education The importance of interprofessional collaborati on and education has been recognized since the 1970s (Alberto and Herth, 2009). What is ne w is the introduction of simulation and web- based learning\u2014solutions that can be used to can break down traditional barriers to learning together, such as the conflicting schedules of medical and APRN students or their lack of joint clinical learning opportunities. Simulation technology offers a safe environment in which to learn (and make mistakes), while web-based lear ning makes schedule conflicts more manageable and content more repeatable. If all nursing and medical students are educated in aspects of interprofessional collaboration, such as knowledg e of professional roles and responsibilities, effective communication, conflict resolution, and shared decision making, and are exposed to working with other health professional studen ts through simulation and web-based training, they may be more likely to engage in collaboration in future work sett ings. Further, national quality and safety agendas, including requirements set by the Joint Commission, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, the NLN, and th e Association of Amer ican Medical Colleges (AAMC), along with studies that link disruptiv e behavior between RNs and MDs to negative patient and worker outcomes (R osenstein and O'Daniel, 2005, 2008), create a strong incentive to not just talk about but act ually work on implementing in terprofessional collaboration. England, Canada, and the United States have made strides to improve interprofessional education by bringing students together from acad emic health science universities and medical centers (e.g., students of nursing, medicine, pharmacy, social wo rk, physical therapy, and public health, among others) in shared learning envi ronments (Tilden, 2010). Defined as \"occasions when two or more professions learn with, from, and about each other to improve collaboration and the quality of care\" (Barr et al., 2005), such education is ba sed on the premise that students' greater familiarity with each ot her's roles, competencies, nomen clatures, and scopes of practice will result in more collaborative graduates. It is expected that graduates of programs with interprofessional education will be ready to work effectively in patient-centered teams where miscommunication and undermining behaviors are minimized or eliminated, resulting in safer, more effective care and greater clinician and pa tient satisfaction. Interp rofessional education is thought to foster collaboration in implementing policies and improving services, prepare students to solve problems that exceed the capacity of any one profession, improve future job satisfaction, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This collaborative is committed to the development of models of collaboration that will provide the members' indi vidual communities with the standards and tools needed to achieve productive interprofessi onal education pr actices. These organizations are committed to fulfilling the soci al contract that ever y nursing, pharmacy, dental, public health, and medical graduate is profic ient in the core competencies required for interprofessional, team-based ca re, including preventive, acute, ch ronic, and catastrophic care. The collaborative is also committed to facili tating the identification, development, and deployment of the resources essential to achieving this vision. As a first step, the collaborative is developing a shared and mutually endorsed set of core competencies that will frame the education of the six repres ented health professions.20 Efforts have been made to evaluate the e ffectiveness of interprofessional education in improving outcomes, including increased student sa tisfaction, modified ne gative stereotypes of other disciplines, increased co llaborative behavior, and improved patient outcomes. However, the effect of interprofessional education is not easily verified since control group designs are expensive, reliable measures are few, and time lapses can be long betw een interprofessional education and the behavior of graduates. Barr and colleagues (2005) reviewed 107 evaluations of interprofessional education in published re ports and found support for three outcomes: interprofessional education creates positive inte raction among students and faculty; encourages collaboration between professions; and results in improvements in aspects of patient care, such as more targeted health promotion advice, higher immunization rate s, and reduced blood pressure for patients with chronic heart disease. Reeves and colleagues ( 2009) reviewed six later studies of varying designs. Four of the studi es found that interprofessional education improved aspects of how clinicians worked together, wh ile the remaining two found that it had no effect (Reeves et al., 2008). Although empirical evidence is mixed, widespread theoretical agreement and anecdotal evidence suggest th at students who demonstrate team work skills in the simulation laboratory or in a clinical education environmen t with patients will apply those skills beyond the confines of their academic programs.21 19 This paragraph draws upon a paper commissioned by the committee on \"The Future of Nursing Education,\" prepared by Virginia Tilden, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing (see Appendix I on CD- ROM). 20 Personal communication, Geraldine Bednash, CEO, AACN, August 12, 2010. 21 This paragraph draws upon a paper commissioned by the committee on \"The Future of Nursing Education,\" prepared by Virginia Tilden, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing (see Appendix I on CD- ROM).

A major challenge for the nursing workforce is the underrepresentation of raci al and ethnic minority groups and men in the profession. To better meet the curr ent and future health needs of the public and to provide more culturally relevant care, the nursing workforce will n eed to grow more diverse. And to meet this need, efforts to increase nurses' levels of educational attainment must emphasize increasing the diversity of the student body. This is a crucial concern that needs to be addressed across all levels of nursing education. Racial and Ethnic Diversity Although the composition of the nursing student body is more racially and ethnically diverse than that of the current workforce, diversity continues to be a challenge. Figure 4-8 shows the distribution of minority students enrolled in nur sing programs by race/ethnicity and by program type. Their underrepresentation is greatest for pa thways associated with higher levels of education. In academic year 2008 2009, for example, ethnic minority groups made up 28.2 percent of ADN, 23.6 percent of BSN, 24.4 percent of master's , and 20.3 percent of doctoral students (NLN, 2009). Even less eviden ce of diversity is present among nurses in faculty positions (AACN, 2010b).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-36 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH In 2003, the Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce was establish to develop recommendations that would \" bring about systemic change...[to] address the scarcity of minorities in our health professions.\" The commission's report, Missing Persons: Minorities in the Health Professions (Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce, 2004), offered strategies to increase the diversity of the medical, nursing, and dentistry professions and included recommendations designe d to remove barriers to health professions education for underrepresented minority students. The comm ission's 37 recommendations called for leadership, commitment, and accountability fr om a wide range of stakeholders\u2014from institutions responsible for educating health professionals to profe ssional organizations and health systems to state and federal agencies and Congress. The recommendations focused on expediting strategies to increase the number of minorities in health professions, improving the education pipeline for health professionals, fi nancing education for minority students, and establishing leadership and accountability to r ealize the commission's vision to increase the diversity health professionals. The comm ittee believes the implementation of the recommendations from that report hold promis e for ensuring a more diverse workforce in the future. In the nursing profession, cr eating bridge programs and e ducational pathways between undergraduate and graduate programs\u2014specifica lly programs such as LPN to BSN, ADN to BSN, and ADN to MSN\u2014appears to be one way of increasing the overa ll diversity of the student body and nurse faculty with respect to not only race/ethnicity, but also geography, background, and personal experience. Mentor ing programs that support minority nursing students are another promising approach. One example of such a program is the National Coalition of Ethnic Minority Nursing Associations, a group ma de up of five ethnic minority nursing associations that aims to build the cadre and prep aration of ethnic minority nurses and promote equity in health care across ethni c minority populations (NCEMNA, 2010). This program is described at greater length in Chap ter 5. Another example of a successful program that has promoted racial and ethnic diversity is the ANA Minority Fellowship Program,22 started in 1974 under the leadership of Dr. Hattie Bessent. This program has played a crucial role in supporting minority nurses with pr edoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships to advance research and clinical practice (Minority Fellowship Program, 2010). Programs to recruit and retain more individuals from racial and ethnic minority gr oups in nursing education programs are needed. A necessary first step toward accomplishing this goal is to create policies th at increase the overall educational attainment of ethnic minorities (Coffman et al., 2001). Gender Diversity As noted in Chapter 3, the nursing workforce hi storically has been composed predominantly of women. While the number of men who become nurses has grown dramatically in the last two decades, men still make up just 7 percent of all RNs (HRSA, 2010b). While most disciplines within the health professional workforce have become more gender bala nced, the same has not been true for nursing. For example, in 2009 nearly half of medical school graduates were female (The Kaiser Family Foundation - statehealthfact s.org, 2010), a significant achievement of gender parity in a traditionally male-d ominated profession. Stereotypes, academic acceptance, and role support are challenges for men entering the nursing profession. These barriers must be overcome rger numbers to help offset the shortage of nurses and fill if men are to be recruited in la 22 See http://www.emfp.org/ .

Compounding the gender diversity problem of the nursing profession is the fact that fe wer men in general are enrolli ng in higher education programs (Mather and Adams, 2007). While more men are being drawn to nursing, especially as a second career, the profession needs to continue efforts to recruit men; their unique perspectives and skills are important to the profession and will help contribute additional diversity to the workforce. One professional organization that works to en courage men to join the nursing profession and supports men who do so is the Ameri can Assembly for Men in Nursing (AAMN).23 To increase opportunities for men interested in joining the profession, th e AAMN Foundation, in partnership with Johnson & Johnson, has aw arded more than $50,000 in scholarships to undergraduate and graduate male nursing stude nts since 2004 (AAMN, 2010b). Additionally, each year the AAMN recognizes the best school or college of nursing for men; in 2009, the honor was given to Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California, and Excelsior College in Albany, New York, for their \"efforts in recr uiting and retaining men in nursing, in providing men a supportive educational environment, and in educating faculty, stude nts and the community about the contributions men ha ve and do make to the nursing profession\" (AAMN, 2010a). SOLUTIONS FROM THE FIELD This chapter has outlined a number of challenge s facing nursing education. These challenges have been the subject of much documentation, analysis, and debate (Benner et al., 2009; Erickson, 2002; IOM, 2003a, 2006; Orsolini- Hain and Waters, 2009; Tanner C. A et al., 2008). Various approaches to responding to these challenges and transforming curricula have been proposed, and several are being tested. The committee reviewed the literature on educationa l capacity and redesign, heard testimony about various challenges and potential solutions at the public forum in Houston, and chose a number of exemplars for closer examination. Three of thes e models are described in this section. The committee found that each of these models provided important insight into creative approaches to maximizing faculty resources, encouraging the establishment and funding of new faculty positions, maximizing the effectiveness of clinical education, and redesigning nursing curricula. Veterans Affairs Nursing Academy In 2007, the VA launched the Veterans Affa irs Nursing Academy (VANA)\u2014a 5-year, $40 million pilot program\u2014with the primary goals of developing partnerships with academic nursing institutes; expanding the number of f aculty for baccalaureate programs; establishing partnerships to enhance faculty developmen t; and increasing baccalaureate enrollment to increase the supply of nurses, not solely for th e VA, but for the country at large. VANA also was aimed at encouraging interprofessional programs and increasing the retention and recruitment of VA nurses. 24 23 See http://www.aamn.org/. 24 This paragraph, and the three that follow, draw upon a presentation made by Cathy Rick, chief nursing officer for the VA, at the Forum on the Future of Nursing: Education, held in Houston, TX on February 22, 2010 (see Appendix C) and published in A Summary of the February 2010 Forum on the Future of Nursing: Education (IOM, 2010).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-38 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Since the program's inception, three cycles of re quests for proposals have been sent to more than 600 colleges and schools of nursing, as well as to institutions within the VA system. Fifteen geographically and demographically diverse pilot sites were selected to participate in VANA based on the strength of their proposals. Each funded VANA partnership is required to ha ve a rigorous evaluation plan to measure outcomes. Outcomes are expected to include in creased staff, patient, student, and faculty satisfaction; greater scholarly output; enhanced professional development; better continuity and coordination of care; more reliance on evidence -based practice; and enhanced interprofessional learning. Each selected school is also expected to increase enro llment by at least 20 students a year. The program has already resulted in 2,700 new students, with 620 receiving the majority of their clinical rotation experiences at the VA. Th e graduates of this prog ram may include students who have pursued a traditional prelicensure BSN, a BSN through a second-degree program, or a BSN through an RN-to-BSN program. The number of nursing school faculty has increased by 176 and the number of VA faculty by 264. In addition to the new nurses and faculty, educational innovations have encompassed curriculum revision, including quality and safety st andards; DEUs (described earlier in Box 4-4); and a postgraduate baccalaureate nurse reside ncy (see Chapter 3). Ot her changes include interprofessional simulation training and the deve lopment of evidence-based practice committees and programs. Beyond these specific changes and accomplishments, the VANA faculty has worked to develop the program into a single comm unity of learning and to prepare students in a genuinely collaborative practice environment with clinically proficient staff and educators. Carondolet Health Network The Carondolet Health Network of Tucson, Ariz ona, is an example of how employers can offer educational benefits that improve both pa tient outcomes and the bottom line. Carondelet, which includes four hospitals and other facili ties and employs approximately 1,650 nurses, is featured as one of seven cases studies in the Lewin Group's 2009 report Wisdom at Work: Retaining Experienced RNs and Their Know ledge\u2014Case Studies of Top Performing Organizations . After Carondelet became part of Ascensi on Health in 2002, the Tucson organization embarked on a strategic plan to recruit and re tain more nurses. Arizona faces some of the severest nursing shortages in the nation, and most nurses prefer to live an d work in higher-paying markets, such as Phoenix or southern Califor nia. When Carondelet in stituted an on-site BSN program, which it subsidized in exchange for a 2-year work commitment, the response was dramatic. Instead of an anticipated class size of 20 nurses in the first semester of the program, it enrolled 104. Of interest, it was the business case\u2014the opportunity to decrease the amount of money the organization was spending on costly temporary nurses\u2014that tipped the balance in favor of action (The Lewin Group, 2009). Hospital Employee Education and Training The Hospital Employee Education and Traini ng (HEET) program was developed through a joint effort of the 1199NW local affiliate of th e Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the Washington State Hospital A ssociation Work Force Institute to help address shortages in nursing and nursing-related positi ons through education and upgrad ing of incumbent workers.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING EDUCATION 4-39 The program is administered through the Wash ington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges. Across the state, HEET-funded programs support industry-based reform of the education system and include preparation and completion of nursing care er ladder programs. HEET seeks to develop educational opportunitie s that support both employer needs and the career aspirations of health car e workers. It features cohort- based programs, distance learning, worksite classes, use of a simulation laborat ory for nursing prerequisites, case management, tutoring support for those reentering academia, and nontraditional scheduling of classes to enable working adults to attend and addr ess employee barriers to education. The findings for this union-inspired initiativ e demonstrate its potential to increase racial/ethnic diversity in the nursing population. HEET participants represent a pool of potential nurses who are more diverse than the current nur sing workforce. Providing on-site classes at hospitals appears to support the participation of working adults who ar e enrolled in nursing school while continuing to work at least part time. Workers participating in the HEET program have had lower attrition rates and higher rates of course completion compared with community college students in nursing career tracks. The curr iculum also blends academic preparation with health care career education, thereby opening the doors of coll ege to workers who might not otherwise enroll or succeed (Moss and Weinstein, 2009). CONCLUSIONS The future of access to basic primary care and nursing education will depend on increasing the number of BSN-prepared nurses. Unless this goal is met, the committee's recommendations for greater access to primary care; enhanced, ex panded, and reconceptuali zed roles for nurses; and updated nursing scopes of pr actice (see Chapter 7) cannot be achieved. The committee believes that increasing the proportion of the nur sing workforce with a BSN from the current 50 percent to 80 percent by 2020 is bold but achievable. Achieving this target will help meet future demand for nurses qualified for a dvanced practice positions and po ssessing competencies in such areas as community care, public health, health policy, evidence-based practice, research, and leadership. The committee concludes further that the number of nurses holding a doctorate must be increased to produce a greate r pool of nurses prepared to assume faculty and research positions. The committee believes a target of doub ling the number of nurses with a doctorate by 2020 would meet this need and is achievable. To achieve these targets, however, will requi re overcoming a number of barriers. The numbers of educators and clinical placements are insufficient for all the qualified applicants who wish to enter nursing school. There also is a shortage of faculty to teach nurses at all levels. Incentives for nurses at any level to pursue fu rther education are few, and there are active disincentives against advanced education. Nurses and physicia ns\u2014not to mention pharmacists and social workers\u2014typically are not educated together and yet are increasingly required to cooperate and collaborate more cl osely in the delivery of care. To address these barriers, i nnovative new programs to attract nursing faculty and provide a wider range of clinical educati on placements must clear long-sta nding bottlenecks. To this end, market-based salary adjustments must be made for faculty, and more scholarships must be provided to help nursing st udents advance their educati on. Accrediting and certifying organizations must mandate demonstrated mastery of clinical skills, managerial competencies, and professional development at all levels. Mandated skills, competencies, and professional development milestones must be updated on a more timely basis to keep pace with the rapidly PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html4-40 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH changing demands of health care. All health prof essionals should receive mo re of their education in concert with students from other disciplines . Efforts also must be made to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce. The nursing profession must adopt a framework of continuous lifelong learning that includes basic education, academic progression, and continuing competencies. More nurses must receive a solid education in how to manage complex cond itions and coordinate care with multiple health professionals. They must demonstrate new competencies in systems thinking, quality improvement, and care management and a basic understanding of health care policy. Graduate- level nurses must develop an even deeper understanding of care coordination, quality improvement, systems thinking, and policy. The committee emphasizes further that, as di scussed in Chapter 2, the ACA is likely to accelerate the shift in care from the hospital to the community setting. This transition will have a particularly strong impact on nurse s, more than 60 percent of whom are currently employed in hospitals (HRSA, 2010b). Nurses may turn to alr eady available positions in primary or chronic care or in public or community health, or th ey may pursue entirely new careers in emerging fields that they help create. Continuing a nd graduate education programs must support the transition to a future that rewa rds flexibility. In ad dition, the curriculum at many nursing schools, which places heavy emphasis on preparing student s for employment in the acute care setting, will need to be rethought (Benner et al., 2009).

Strong leadership is critical if the vision of a transformed health care system is to be realized. Yet not all nurses begin their career with thoughts of becoming a leader. The nursing profession must produ ce leaders throughout the health care system, from the bedside to the boardroom , who can serve as full partners with other health professionals and be account able for their own contributions to delivering high-quality care while work ing collaboratively with leaders from other health professions. In addition to changes in nursing practice a nd education, discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively, strong leadership will be required to realize the vision of a transformed health care system. Although the public is not used to viewing nurses as leaders, and not all nurses begin their career with thoughts of b ecoming a leader, all nurses mu st be leaders in the design, implementation, and evaluation of, as well as advocacy for, the ongoing reforms to the system that will be needed. Additionally, nurses will need leadership skills and competencies to act as full partners with physicians and other health pr ofessionals in redesign an d reform efforts across the health care system. Nursing research and practice must continue to identify and develop evidence-based improvements to care, and thes e improvements must be tested and adopted through policy changes across the health care system. Nursing leaders must translate new research findings to the practice environment and into nursing education and from nursing education into practice and policy. Being a full partner transcends all levels of the nursing profession and requires leadership skills and competencies that must be applied both within the profession an d in collaboration with other health professionals. In care environments, being a full partner involves taking responsibility for identifying problems and areas of waste, devising and implementing a plan for improvement, tracking improvement over time, a nd making necessary adjustments to realize established goals. Serving as strong patient advocates, nurses must be involved in decision making about how to improve the delivery of care. Being a full partner translates mo re broadly to the health polic y arena. To be effective in reconceptualized roles and to be seen and accepted as leaders, nurses must see policy as something they can shape and develop rather than something that happens to them, whether at the local organizational level or the national leve l. They must speak the language of policy and engage in the political process effectively, and work cohesively as a profession. Nurses should PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Nurses also should serve actively on advisory committees, commissions, and boards where policy decisions are made to advance health systems to improve patient care. Nurses must build new partners hips with other clinicians, business owners, philanthropists, elected officials, and the public to help realize these improvements. This chapter focuses on key message #3 set forth in Chapter 1: Nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health profes sionals, in redesigning hea lth care in the United States. The chapter begins by cons idering the new style of leadership that is needed. It then issues a call to nurses to res pond to the challenge. The third section describes three avenues\u2014 leadership programs for nurses, mentorship, and involvement in the policy-making process\u2014 through which that call can be answered. The chapte r then issues a call for new partnerships to tap the full potential of nurses to serve as le aders in the health care system. The final section presents the committee's conclusions regarding th e need to transform leadership in the nursing profession. A NEW STYLE OF LEADERSHIP Those involved in the health care system\u2014nurses, physicians , patients, and others\u2014play increasingly interdependent role s. Problems arise every day that do not have easy or singular solutions. Leaders who merely give directions a nd expect them to be followed will not succeed in this environment. What is need ed is a style of leadership that involves working with others as full partners in a context of mu tual respect and collaboration. This leadership style has been associated with improved patient outcomes, a re duction in medical errors , and less staff turnover (Gardner, 2005; Joint Commission, 2008; Pearson et al., 2007). It may also reduce the amount of workplace bullying and disruptive behavior, which remains a problem in the health care field (Joint Commission, 2008; Olender-Russo, 2009; Rosenstein and O'Daniel, 2008). Yet while the benefits of collaboration among h ealth professionals have rep eatedly been documented with respect to improved patient outcom es, reduced lengths of hospital stay, cost savings, increased job satisfaction and retention among nurses, and improved teamwork, interprofessional collaboration frequently is not the norm in the health care field. Changing this culture will not be easy. The new style of leadership that is needed flow s in all directions at all levels. Everyone from the bedside to the boardroom must engage coll eagues, subordinates, and executives so that together they can identify and achieve comm on goals (Bradford and Cohen, 1998). All members of the health care team must share in the collab orative management of their practice. Physicians, nurses, and other health professi onals must work together to br eak down the walls of hierarchal silos and hold each other accountable for improvi ng quality and decreasing preventable adverse events and medication errors. All must display th e capacity to adapt to the continually evolving dynamics of the health care system. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING LEADERSHIP 5-3 Leadership Competencies Nurses at all levels need strong leadership skill s to contribute to patient safety and quality of care. Yet their history as a prof ession dominated by females can ma ke it easier for policy makers, other health professionals, and the public to view nurses as \"f unctional doers\"\u2014t hose who carry out the instructions of others\u2014rather than \"t houghtful strategists\"\u2014those who are informed decision makers and whose independent acti ons are based on education, evidence, and experience. A 2009 Gallup poll of more than 1,500 nationa l opinion leaders,1 \"Nursing Leadership from Bedside to Boardroom: Opini on Leaders' Perceptions,\" identified nurses as \"one of the most trusted sources of health information\" (see Box 5-1) (RWJF, 2010a). The Gallup poll also identified nurses as the health professionals that should have greater influence than they currently do in the cr itical areas of quality of patient care and safety. The leaders surveyed believed that major obs tacles prevent nurses from bei ng more influential in health policy decision making. These findi ngs have crucial implications for front-line nurses, who possess critical knowledge and awareness of the pa tient, family, and community but do not speak up as often as they should. BOX 5-1 Results of Gallup Poll \"Nursing Leadership from Bedside to Boardroom: Opinion Leaders' Perceptions\" Opinion leaders rate doctors and nurses firs t and second among a list of options for trusted information about health and health care. Opinion leaders perceive patients and nurses as having the least amount of influence on health care reform in the next 5 10 years. Reducing medical errors, increasing quality of ca re, and promoting wellness top the list of areas in which large majorities of opinion leaders would like nurses to have more influence. Relatively few opinion leaders say nurses currently have a great deal of influence on increasing access to care, including primary care. Opinion leaders identified top bar riers to nurses' increased influenc e and leadership as not being perceived as important decision makers or re venue generators compared with doctors, having a focus on acute rather than preventive care, and not having a single voice on national issues. Opinion leaders' suggestions for nurses to take on more of a leadership role were making their voices heard and having higher expectations.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html5-4 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH To be more effective leaders and full partners , nurses need to possess two critical sets of competencies: a common set that can serve as the foundation for any leadership opportunity and a more specific set tailored to a particular context, time, and place. The former set includes, among others, knowledge of the care delivery system, how to work in teams, how to collaborate effectively within and across discip lines, the basic tenets of ethica l care, how to be an effective patient advocate, theories of innovation, and the foundations for quality and safety improvement. These competencies also are recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing as essential for baccalaureate programs (AACN, 2008). Leadership competencies recommended by the National League for Nursing and National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission are being revised to reflect simila r principles. More specific comp etencies might include learning how to be a full partner in a health team in which members from various professions hold each other accountable for improving quality and decreasing preventable adverse events and medication errors. Additionally, nurses who are interested in pursui ng entrepreneurial and business development opportunities need competenci es in such areas as economics and market forces, regulatory frameworks, and financing policy. Leadership in a Collaborative Environment As noted in Chapter 1, a growing body of res earch has begun to highlight the potential for collaboration among teams of diverse individuals from different professions (Paulus and Nijstad, 2003; Pisano and Verganti, 2008; Singh and Flem ing, 2010; Wuchty et al., 2007). Practitioners and organizational leaders alike have declared th at collaboration is a key strategy for improving problem solving and achieving innovation in h ealth care. Two nursing researchers who have studied collaboration among health professionals define it as: a communication process that fosters i nnovation and advanced problem solving among people who are of different di sciplines, organizational ranks, or institutional settings [and who] band together for advanced problem solving [in order to] discern innovativ e solutions without regard to discipline, rank, or institutional affiliation [and to] enact ch ange based on a higher standard of care or organizational outcomes. (Kinnaman and Bleich, 2004) Much of what is called collaboration is more likely cooperation or coordination of care. Katzenbach and Smith (1993) argue that truly collaborative team s differ from high-functioning groups that have a defined leader and a set direction, but in which the dynamics of true teamwork are absent. The case study presented in Box 5-2 i llustrates just how important it is for health professionals to work in teams to ensure th at care is accessible and patient centered.

This is about quality of life. You can make the end [of life] as great as the beginning. That's my job. \u2014Amyleigh Overton-McCoy, PhD, GNP-BC, RN, geriatrics nurse practitioner and education director, Texarkana Regional Center on Aging, Texarkana, Texas Bonnie Sturgeon was an independent 80-year-old in 2005 when shortness of breath began to slow her down. She had been living on her own for decades, dr iving herself to church and singing in the choir. She went to the Christus St. Michael Health System in Texarkana, Texas, her home town, for a diagnostic workup. There she met Amyleigh Overton-McCoy, PhD, GNP-BC, RN, a geriatrics nurse practitioner with the Arkansas Aging Initiative (AAI). \"When I first went to see Amyleigh, I was there an ho ur or more,\" Ms. Sturgeon said. \"She asked me every question she could think of, and I wondered how many questions could be asked?\" But the intensive interviewing and testing revealed that s he had three blocked arteries and had experienced a heart attack. Ms. Sturgeon was scheduled for a triple coronary artery bypass grafting procedure. Five years later, she credits Ms. Overton-McCoy with saving her life. \"I've not ever been in her office that she hasn't gone over the past visit, what progress I ma de, and if I've had any new problems, even the smallest thing.\" Patient centeredness, meticulous diagnostics, and wise counsel represent the kind of nursing that might provide a textbook definition of holistic care. This is the kind of care older Arkansans have been receiving since state voters passed the Tobacco Settlement Proceeds Act of 2000, which ordered that state monies from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agre ement go toward health care initiatives, including the AAI. Affiliated with the Donald W. Reynol ds Institute on Aging at the Univ ersity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock, the AAI has two dire ct service components. First, a team consisting of a geriatrician, an advanced practice registered nurse (A PRN), and a social worker provides care at each of eight satellite centers on aging owned and managed by local hospitals (and financially self-supporting through Medicare). The team follows its patient s across settings\u2014hospital, clinic, home, and nursing home\u2014as needed. Second, an education component supported by the tobacco settlement funds targets health professionals and students, older adults a nd their families, and the community at large. The AAI's director, Claudia J. Beverly, PhD, RN, FAAN, said that these two components are funded separately but go hand in hand in practice. New patients usually see a physician for an initial examination. APRNs are responsible for health promotion and disease prevention\u2014mammograms and flu shots, for example\u2014as well as analyses of cu rrent drug regimens. For patients with complex conditions, social workers make referrals and work with families on nursing home placement. Almost all older Arkansans can now access interprofessional geriatric care within an hour's drive of their home. Patients are quite satisfied with their care and with the t eam approach (Beverly et al., 2007). Unpublished analyses of the areas around the centers show lower rates of emergency room use and hospitalization and higher rates of health care knowledge among elderly patients. Physicians at the eight sites report to Dr. Beverly, who is also director of UAMS's Hartford Center of Geriatric Nursing Excellence, which provides some funding to the AAI. She has hired a nurse with a doctorate and a geriatrician to act as associate direct ors. Developing teamwork has been a priority. \"This is such a beautiful case study in how nursing and medicine can work together,\" she said, \"and how, together, we can do good things.\" There have been some obstacles: primary care services are dependent upon Medicare funding, and with an annual budget of $2 million to divide among eight sites, additional revenue is needed. There also may not be enough clinicians trained in geriatrics av ailable. And although Dr. Beverly believes that APRNs \"should have their own panel of patients,\" they see only returning patients at the centers. She said funding has been secured to further evaluate how best to use team members. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html5-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The model has continued to evolve from the first center in Northwest Arkansas that Dr. Beverly started as a Robert Wood Johnson Executive Nurse Fellow. That site is developing a program for the training of in-home caregivers, including home health aides and family members. And a new telehealth project will allow patients and clinicians to \"see\" a specialist electronica lly. \"Economically, this is going to provide a huge benefit to patients,\" Ms. Overton-McCoy said. Leadership at Every Level Leadership from nurses is needed at ev ery level and across all settings. Although collaboration is generally a laudable goal, ther e are many times when nurses, for the sake of delivering exceptional patient and family care, must step into an advocate role with a singular voice. At the same time, effective leadership also requires recognition of s ituations in which it is more important to mediate, collaborate, or fo llow others who are acting in leadership roles. Nurses must understand that their leadership is as important to providing qua lity care as is their technical ability to deliver care at the bedside in a safe and effective manner. They must lead in improving work processes on the front lines; creating new integrated practice models; working with others, from organizational policy makers to state legislators, to craft practice policy and legislation that allows nurses to work to their fullest capacity; leading curriculum changes to prepare the nursing workforce to meet community and patient needs; tr anslating and applying research findings into practice and developi ng functional models of care; and serving on institutional and policy-making boards where cri tical decisions affecti ng patients are made. Leadership in care delivery is particularly im portant in community and home settings where nurses work more autonomously with patients and families than they do in the acute care setting. In community and home settings, nurses prov ide a direct link conn ecting patients, their caregivers, and other members of the health care team. Other memb ers of the hea lth care team may not have the time, expertise, or first-hand experience with the patient's home environment and circumstances to understand and respond to patient and family needs. For example, a neurologist may not be able to help a caregiver of an Alzheime r's patient understand or curtail excessive spending habits, or a surgeon may not be able to offer advice to a caregiver on ostomy care\u2014roles that nurses are perfectly positioned to assume. Leadership in these situations sometimes requires nurses to be assertive and to have a strong voice in advocating for patients and their families to ensure that their needs are communicated and adequately met. Box 5-3 describes a nurse who evolved over the course of her car eer from thinking that being an effective nurse was all about honing her nur sing skills and competencies to realize that becoming an agent of change was an equally important pa rt of her job.

She asked her colleagues why the child had not been discharged. \"It wa sn't because she was not medically stable,\" Ms. Hill said recently, \"but because there was a lack of community resources to support her.\" Inadequate community services existed for a child with special need s in Chicago, the third-largest city in the nation? \"I was dumbfounded,\" she recalled. \"And I said, 'We need to start a consortium. We need to invite policy makers, state agencies, community leaders.' And people just looked at me, like, 'Okay, Connie. How are we going to get that started?'\" As director of 9 West, the 30-bed Allergy/Pulmonary/ Transitional Care Unit, Ms. Hill persisted, and in 2004 the Consortium for Children with Complex Medical Needs was formed. The 75-member coalition of parents, clinicians, advocates, and representatives of government agencies and insurance companies meets quarterly, with the goal of \"networking, educ ation, and advocacy\" on behalf of the city's special- needs children, some of whom may be on ventilators i ndefinitely. For example, the group identified poor reimbursement of home health care as a serious obst acle, and the hospital established ties to agencies able to tackle the reimbursement issue. Now, some children can go home to receive care. Ms. Hill never intended to be a leader. She was worki ng as a staff nurse at the hospital in the mid- 1990s when colleagues encouraged her to apply for a clinical manager position in 9 West. She followed their advice, and in late 2000 when her supervisor fail ed to return from maternity leave, she proposed a \"shared leadership model.\" After a year or so du ring which she and two other nurses shared the directorship, Ms. Hill was asked to become sole director (some st aff were uncomfortable with the decentralized authority, despite good clinical outcomes ). She did so, with a modest goal: \"I wanted to provide a venue for all nurses to have a voice.\" With this goal in mind, Ms. Hill decided in 2008 that 9 West would be a good fit for Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB), a national initiative of T he Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Communication between nurses and rotating medical residents was targeted in the hospital's quest to improve t he coordination of care (Quisling, 2009). As Ms. Hill said, \"It's disheartening when you receive a patient survey and a family says, 'The doctor said this, but then the nurse told me that.'\" A procedure wa s created for staff nurses to provide orientations to residents, who rotate monthly among units, to foster better team comm unication. Residents are now more likely to confer with 9 West nurses during rounds, Ms. Hill said, incr easing satisfaction among nurses, residents, patients, and families. As a doctoral student at the Un iversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Nursing, Ms. Hill is examining an often neglected population: teens born with HIV, a majority of whom are African American and Hispanic. Now that many HIV-positive children surv ive into adulthood, they mature sexually and face the stigma attached to the infection. Ms. Hill's st udy uses PhotoVoice, which involves putting cameras into the hands of HIV-positive teens and asking them for a visual answer to the question, \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\" \"They're writing their own story\" in photographs, she said, a story they can use to raise awareness in others and to remind themselves of their own strengths. Ms. Hill has quite a story herself. As a mother of a grown son, a pediatric nurse who endured many hospitalizations as a child, a researcher whose study is an outgrowth of her advocacy work, and an African American who strives to enhance access to heal th care for all, she is a woman of both practical ideas and lofty ideals. So when she saw that a child capable of living at home had been in her unit for 2 years, her natural response was to assemble a consortium. Today, that child is doing well at home.

As Bennis and Nanus (2003) note, the fast pace of change can be managed only if it is accompanied by leaders who can track the context of the \"social architecture\" to su stain and implement i nnovative ideas. Creating innovative care models at the bedside and in the community or taking the opportunity to fill a seat in a policy-making body or boardroom require s nurse leaders to develop ideas; approach management; and courageously make decisions with in the political, economic, and social context that will make their solutions r eal and sustainable. A shift must take place in how nurses view their responsibility to those they care for; they must see themselves as full partners with other health professionals, and practice and education environments must socialize and educate them accordingly. An important aspect of this socializati on is mentoring others along the way. More experienced nurses must take the time to show th ose who are new and less experienced the most effective ways of being an exceptional nurse at the bedside, in the boardroom, and everywhere between. Technology such as chat rooms, Facebook, and even blogs can be used to support the mentoring role. A crucial part of working within the social architecture is understanding how leadership and practice produce change over time. The nursing pr ofession's history includes many examples of the effect of nursing leadership on changes in systems and improvements in patient care. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, nurse Elizabeth Carnegie led the fight for the racial integration of nursing in Florida by example and through her extraordinary character and organizational skills. Her efforts to integrate the nursi ng profession were based in her se nse of social justice not just for the profession, but also for th e care of African American ci tizens who had little access to a workforce that was highly skilled or provided adequate access to health care services. Also in Florida, in the late 1950s, Dorothy Smith, the firs t dean of the new University of Florida College of Nursing, developed nursing practice models that brought nursing faculty into the hospital in a joint nursing service. Students thereby had role models in their learning experiences, and staff nurses had the authority to improve patient care. From this system came the patient kardex and the unit manager system that freed nurses from the constant search for supplies that took them away from the bedside. In the 1980s, nursing research by Neville Strumpf and Lois Evans highlighted the danger of using restraints on fra il elders (Evans and St rumpf, 1989; Strumpf and Evans, 1988). Their efforts to tran slate their findings into practice revolutionized nursing practice in nursing homes, hospitals, and other facilities by focusing nursing care on preventing falls and other injuries related to restraint use, and led to state and federal legislation that resulted in reducing the use of restra ints on frail elders. Nurses also have also led effo rts to improve health and acces s to care through entrepreneurial endeavors. For example, Ruth Lubic founded the firs t free-standing birth center in the country in 1975 in New York City. In 2000, she opened the Fam ily Health and Birth Center in Washington, DC, which provides care to underserved commun ities (see Box 2-2 in Chapter 2). Her efforts have improved the care of thousands of women over the years. There are many other examples of nurse entrepreneurs, and a nurse entrepreneur network 2 exists that provides networking, aching for nurses seeking to enter th e marketplace and business. education and training, and co 2 See http://www.n urse-entrepreneur-network .com/public/main.cfm.

Leadership skills must be learned and mastered over time. Nonetheless, it is important to obtain a basic grasp of those skills as early as possible\u2014starting in school (see Chapter 4). Nursing educators must give their student s the most relevant knowledge and practice opportunities to equip them for thei r profession, while instilling in them a desire and expectation for new learning in the years to come. Regardless of the basic degree with which a nurse enters the profession, faculty should feel ob ligated to show students the way to their first or next career placement, as well as to their next degr ee and continuous learning opportunities. Moreover, students should not wait for graduation to exercise their potential for leadership. In Georgia, for example, hea lth students came together in 200 1 under the banner \"Lead or Be Led\" to create a student-led, interprofessional nonprof it organization that \"seeks to make being active in the health community a professional habit.\" Named Health Students Taking Action Together (HealthSTAT), the gr oup continues to offer workshops in political advocacy, media training, networking, and fundraising. Its annua l leadership symposium convenes medical, nursing, public health, and other students statewide to learn about he alth issues facing the state and work together on developing potential solu tions (HealthSTAT, 2010). The National Student Nurses Association (NSNA), initiated in 1998, offers an online Leadership University that allows students to enhance their capacity for leadership through several avenue s, such as earning academic credit for participating in the univers ity's leadership activities and discussing leadership issues with faculty. Students work in cooperative relationshi ps with other students from various disciplines, facu lty, community organizations, a nd the public (Janetti, 2003). Box 5-4 profiles two student leaders, one of whom eventually became NSNA president; both represent as well the growing diversity of the nur sing profession, a crucial need if the profession is to rise to the challenge of helping to transform the health care system (see Chapter 4). Looking to the future, nurse leaders will need the skills and knowledge to understand and anticipate population tre nds. Formal preparation of student nurses may need to go beyond what has traditionally been consider ed nursing education. To this end, a growing number of schools offer dual undergraduate degrees in partnership with the universi ty's business or engineering school for nurses interested in starting their own business or developi ng more useful technology. Graduate programs offering dual degree programs with schools of business, public health, law, design, or communications take this idea one step further to equip students with an interest in administrative, philanthropic, regulatory, or pol icy-making positions with greater competencies in management, finance, communication, system design, or scope-of-practice regulations from the start of their careers.

Caceres and Kenya D. Haney BUILDING DIVERSITY IN NURSING , ONE STUDENT AT A TIME A lot of nurses get surprised that I have this interest in politics, but I think it's okay to go into nursing as a second career. \u2014Billy A. Caceres, BSN, RN, staff nurse, New Yo rk University Langone Medical Center, New York If we could open up the doors just a little bit wider for foreign nursing student s, mothers, nontraditional students, and men, that would make a world of difference to patients. \u2014Kenya D. Haney, RN, student, University of Missouri, St. Louis, and immediate past president, National Student Nurses Association Despite improvements to the demographic make up of the nursing workforce in recent decades, the workforce remains predominantly white, female, and middle aged. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 34 percent of the U.S. population but only 12 percent of the registered nurse (RN) workforce, and just 7 percent of RNs are men (AACN, 2010). And diversity matters to patients: many studies have shown that a more diverse health care workforce results in greater access to care for minority populations (IOM, 2004). Two nurses, an African American woman and a Hispanic man, both under age 35, illustrate the growing diversity of the profession and the importance of offering various educational paths as an entry into nursing. Kenya D. Haney, RN, was a married mother of two in 2004 when she was trying to decide between nursing school and law school. She had taken classes toward a bachelor's degree in communications and knew she would need a more flexible program. She chose the associate's degree in nursing program at St. Louis Community College in Missouri: it offe red a part-time option and child care at $2 an hour, which her educational grants covered. If the child care had not been available, she would have waited until her children were older, she said, and then \"gone back to finish the communications degree and gone on to law school. There's just not a doubt in my mind.\" After graduating, Ms. Haney got a job in intensive care; entered the bachelor's of science in nursing (BSN) program for RNs at the Univer sity of Missouri, St. Louis; and joined the Breakthrough to Nursing initiative at the National Student Nurses Association (NSNA). The NSNA initiative aims to increase the number of men entering the profession, recruit an d retain nurses of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds, support nursing students with physical disabilities, and increase enrollment of young and nontraditional students. It works toward these goals by making peers available to students in need of support. Ms. Haney became its director in 2008 and NSNA president in 2009. \"You know, we're not the answer to everything,\" she said of Breakthrough to Nu rsing. \"But we're there fo r support. Maybe we'll just say, 'You can do this. You're not al one, and you really are needed.'\" Billy Caceres, BSN, RN, already had a bachelor's degree in politics and communications and a job in event planning for a New York City nonprofit when he made the decision to pursue a BSN. As an undergraduate at New York University (NYU), he had volunteered to raise awareness of sexual assault and substance abuse on campus and wanted to learn more about health. He applied and was accepted to NYU's College of Nursing in its 15-month accelera ted program for students with a bachelor's in another field. Soon he became involved in the Hartfo rd Geriatric Nursing Institute at NYU. As a nurse, Mr. Caceres has encountered bias at times from patients, especially older women, some of whom feel uncomfortable being cared for by a m an. \"I don't get offended,\" he said. \"But sometimes I think, What if nobody else was around? What would you do? I'm just trying to provide care for you.\" He has just begun his first job as a hospital staff nur se, in a New York City orthopedics unit, and hopes one day to merge his interests in geriatrics and health policy, he said. Both Ms. Haney and Mr. Caceres intend to pursue graduate degrees, perhaps even the doctorate. If so, they will be models for a new generation: only 23 percent of students in research-focused doctoral programs in nursing are from minority backgro unds, and only 7 percent are men (AACN, 2010). Regardless, the two have taken significant steps. As Ms. Haney said, \"Sometimes it's that initial barrier of getting into nursing school that can hurt so many. But the NSNA is a way to bring us together to see that we have one common goal, and that is to be profes sional nurses. Basically, it's for the patient.\" PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING LEADERSHIP 5-11 Will Front-Line Nurses Hear the Call? Given their direct and sustained contact with patients, front-line nurses, along with their unit or clinic managers, are uniquely positioned to design new models of care to improve quality, efficiency, and safety. Tapping th at potential will require de veloping a new workplace culture that encourages and supports leaders at the po int of care (whether a hos pital or the community) and requires all members of a health care team to hold each other accountable for the team's performance; nurses must also be equipped with the communication, conflict resolution, and negotiating skills necessary to succ eed in leadership and partnershi p roles. For example, one new quality and safety strategy requires checklists to be completed before certain procedures, such as inserting a catheter, are begun. Nurs es typically are asked to enfor ce adherence to the checklist. If another nurse or a physician does not wash his/ her hands or contaminates a sterile field, nurses must possess the basic leadership skills to remind their colleague of the protocol and stop the procedure, if necessary, until the checklist is followed. And again, nurses must help and mentor each other in their roles as expert clinicians and patient advocates. No one can build the capabilities of an exceptional a nd effective nurse like another exceptional and effective nurse. Will Community Nurses Hear the Call? Nurses working in the community have long understood that to be effective in contributing to improvements in the entire community's health, they must assume the role of social change agent. Among other things, community and pub lic health nurses must promote immunization, good nutrition, and physical activity; detect emergency health threat s; and prevent and respond to outbreaks of communicable diseases. In addition, they need to be prepared to assume roles in dealing with public health emergencies, including disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. Recent declines in the numbers of community and public health nurses, however, have made the leadership imperative for these nurses much more challenging. Community and public health nu rses learn to expect the une xpected. For example, a school nurse alerted health authorities to the arrival of the H1N1 influenza virus in New York City in 2009 (RWJF, 2010c). Likewise, an increasing number of nurses are being trained in incident command as part of preparedness for natural disaster s and possible terrorist attacks. This entails understanding the roles of and working with community, state, a nd federal officials to assure the health and safety of the public. For example, when the town of Chehalis, south of Seattle, experienced a 100-year flood in 2007, a public health nurse called the secretary of Washington State's Department of Health, Mary Selecky, to ask how to \"deal with and dispose of dead cows, an unforeseen challenge [for] a public health nurse. The nurse knew she needed [to provide] tetanus shots and portable toilets but had not anticipated othe r, less common, aspects of the emergency\" (IOM, 2010). The profile in Box 5-5 illustrates how nurses lead efforts that provide critical services for communities. The profile also shows how nurses can also become leaders and social change agents in the broader community by serving on the boards of health-related institutions. The importance of this role is discussed in the next section. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html5-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH BOX 5-5 Nurse Profile: Mary Ann Christopher CULTIVATING NEIGHBORHOOD NURSING AT THE VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CENTRAL JERSEY I make decisions within the context of really underst anding the impact of service delivery. I think I can see opportunities quickly, because I'm seeing it more from a nurse's perspective, but also a nurse who grew up on a community-based side [of health care delivery]. \u2014Mary Ann Christopher, MSN, RN, FAAN, president and chief executive officer, Visiting Nurse Association of Cent ral Jersey, Red Bank, New Jersey At the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jers ey (VNACJ), president and chief executive officer Mary Ann Christopher, MSN, RN, FAAN, mainta ins a $100 million annual budget, a 4,000-patient daily census, and a 1,700-person staff. Serv ices available to residents in 10 central New Jersey counties include home care, primary care, wellness services, mental health care, rehabilitation, homeless services, and hospice and palliative care. Yet despite the size and complexity of the 98-year-old organization, Ms. Christopher's primary objective has remained simple in her 27-year career there. \"People need to know that you stand for what you say you stand for,\" she said. And what the VNACJ stands for is local communities \"driving\" the services provided. Ms. Christopher has called it Neighborhood Nursing, a collaborative model in which nurse s are assigned to specific neighborhoods so they and community members can respond to what they identify as the most pressing health issues. As an example of the model, she cites a VNACJ nurse who noticed that many residents of a retirement community were exhibiting signs of con gestive heart failure. The nurse proposed that the VNACJ set up a kiosk that would contain a teleheal th monitor. The device would permit residents to check their weight, oxygen saturation, and blood pressu re levels and automatically transmit the values to a cardiac nurse. If a patient's indicators were outside the desired range, the nurse and patient would converse remotely, in real time, and patients needi ng a medication adjustment would be visited. The VNACJ funded the idea, and outcomes are being monitored. Ms. Christopher said that the aims of such an initiative are both immediate and long term. In the short run, the VNACJ hopes to reduce rates of emer gency room (ER) use and repeated hospitalizations\u2014 expensive and inefficient means of managing chr onic illness. As for the long-term goal, the VNACJ nurses strive to give individuals as well as entire comm unities greater control over their health. After the telehealth kiosk was set up, for example, residents began paying attention to one another's weight and blood pressure levels. Ms. Christopher has secured grants to test a wide range of such ideas. For example, the Mobile Outreach Program has reduced rates of ER use among deinstitutionalized mentally ill and homeless patients; funded in the mid-1980s by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the State of New Jersey, it is now supported by local governments. The Mob ile Outreach Program is the VNACJ initiative Ms. Christopher is the most proud of and the one, sh e said, that may be the most replicable. In 1998 the Balanced Budget Act resulted in a 15 per cent reduction in revenues and left the VNACJ with only $100,000 in reserve. Now, even with $24 million in reserve, Ms. Christopher worries about declines in federal, state, and philanthropic funding, es pecially in light of the recent increases in un- and underinsured patients being seen as a result of the recession. Still, she said that the agency's focus on providing services the community values, even as thos e values change, has kept the association fiscally sound. Not all CEOs of visiting nurse associations are nurses (those in New York City and Boston, for example, are not). Ms. Christopher said she can see why it matters that she is a nurse. First, she knows well what nurses can do. She has cu ltivated an atmosphere of honoring st aff ideas (such as the cardiac monitoring initiative). As a result, the VNACJ has a turnover rate of less than 5 percent for nurses. Second, Ms. Christopher is sought after to serve on governing boards and advisory groups and is the only RN on the board of trustees at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. She believes that her nursing expertise, keen sense of community, and fiscal responsibility give her \"legitimacy at any table I'm at...being a guardian for what's best for patients and communities.\" PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING LEADERSHIP 5-13 Will Chief Nursing Officers Hear the Call? Although chief nursing officers (CNOs ) typically are part of the hierarchical decision-making structure in that they have authority and responsib ility for the nursing staff, they need to move up in the reporting structure of thei r organizations to increase thei r ability to contribute to key decisions. Not only is this not happening, however, but CNOs appear to be losing ground. A 2002 survey by the American Organization of Nu rse Executives (AONE) s howed that 55 percent of CNOs reported directly to their institution's CEO, compared with 60 percent in 2000. More CNOs described a direct reporting relationship to the chief operating officer instead. Such changes in reporting structure can limit nurse leaders' involvement in decision making about the most important product of hospita ls\u2014patient care. Additionally, the AONE survey showed that most CNOs (70 percent) have s een their responsibilities increase even as they have moved down in the reporting structure (Balle in Search Partners and AONE, 2003). CNOs face growing issues of contending not only with increased respons ibilities, but also w ith budget pressures and difficulties with staffing, retention, and turnover levels during a nursing shortage (Jones et al., 2008). Nurses also are underrepresented on institution and hospital boards, either their own or others. A biennial survey of hospitals and h ealth systems conducted in 2007 by the Governance Institute found that only 0.8 pe rcent of voting board members were CNOs, compared with 5.1 percent who were vice presidents for medi cal affairs (Governance Institute, 2007). More recently, a 2009 survey of community health systems found that nurses made up only 2.3 percent of their boards, compared with 22.6 percent who were physicians (Prybil et al., 2009). 3 While most boards focus mainly on finance and bus iness, health care delivery, quality, and responsiveness to the pub lic\u2014areas in which the nature of their work gives nurses particular expertise\u2014also are considered key (Center for Healthcare Governance, 2007). A 2007 survey found that 62 percent of boards included a quality committee (Governance Institute, 2007). A 2006 survey of hospital presidents and CEOs showed the impact of such committees. Those institutions with a quality committee were more likely to adopt various oversight practices; they also experienced lower mortality rates for six common medical conditions measured by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Inpatient Quality Indicators and the State Inpatient Database s (Jiang et al., 2008). The growing attention of hospital boards to quality and safety issues reflects the increased visibility of these issues in recent years. Several states and the Ce nters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for example, are increasing their oversight of speci fic preventable errors (\"never events\"), and new payment structures in health care reform ma y be based on patient outcomes and satisfaction (Hassmiller, 2009; IOM, 2000; King, 2009; Wachter, 2009). Given their expertise in quality and safety improvement , nurses are more likely than many other board members to understand the issues involved and often can educate other members about these issues (Mastal et al., 2007). This is one area, then, in which nurse board members can have a significant impact. Recognizing this, the 2009 survey of community health systems mentioned ed that community health system boards consider appointing above specifically recommend 3 It should be noted that, while there are many more physici ans than nurses on hospital boards, health care providers still are generally underrepresented.

More CNOs need to prepare themselves and seek out opportunities to serve on the boards of health-related institutions. If decisions are taking place about patient care and a nurse is not at the decision-making table, important perspectives will be missed. CNOs should also promote leadership activities among their staff, encourag ing them to secure important decision-making positions on committees and boards, both internal and external to the organization. Will Nurse Researchers Hear the Call? Nurse researchers must develop new models of quality care that are evidence based, patient centered, affordable, and accessible to diverse po pulations. Developing and imparting the science of nursing is also an important contribution to nurses' ability to deliver high-quality, safe care. Additionally, nurses must serve as advocates and implementers for the program designs they develop. Academic service partnerships that typically involve nursi ng schools and nearby, often low-income communities are a first step towa rd implementation. Given that a nursing school does not exist in every community, however, such partnerships cannot achieve change on the scale needed to transform the health care system. Nurse researchers must become active not only in studying important care delivery questions bu t also in translating research findings into practice and developing and setting the policy agendas. Their leadership is vital in ensuring that new state- and federal-level policies are based on evidence and will help increase quality and access while decreasing costs and health care di sparities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides opportunities for demonstration projec ts and pilot programs directed at various elements of nursing. If these projects and progr ams do not adequately track nursing inputs and intended/unintended outcomes, they cannot hope to achieve their potential. Nurse researchers should seek funding from th e National Institute for Nursing Research and other institutes of the National Inst itutes of Health, as do scientists from other disciplines, to help increase the evidence base for improved models of care. Funding might also be secured from other government entities, such as AHRQ and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and local and national foundations, depending on the research topic. To be competitive in these efforts, nurses should hone their analytical skills with training in such areas as statistics and data analysis, econometrics, biometrics, an d other qualitative and quantitative research methods that are appropriate to their research topics. Mark Pauly, codirector of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Interdisciplinary Nursing Quality Research Initiative, argues that, for nursing research to achieve parity with ot her health services re search in terms of acceptability, it must be managed by interprofessi onal teams that include both nurse scholars and scholars from methodological and m odeling disciplines. For nurse re searchers to achieve parity with other health services researchers, they must develop the skills and initiative to take leadership roles in this research. 4 4 Personal communication, Mark Pauly, Bendheim Professor, Professor of Health Care Management, Professor of Business and Public Policy, Professor of Insurance and Risk Management, and Professor of Economics, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Codirector of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Interdisciplinary Nursing Quality Research Initiative, June 25, 2010.

The Gallup poll of 1,500 opinion leaders referenced earlier in this chapter also highlighted fragmentation in the leadership of nursing organizations as a challenge. Responding opinion leaders predicted that nurses will have little in fluence on health care reform over the next 5 to 10 years (see Figure 5-1). By contrast, they believed that nurses should have more input and impact in areas such as planning, policy develo pment, and management (Figure 5-2) (RWJF, 2010a). No one expects all professional health or ganizations to coordinate their public agendas, actions, or messaging for every issue. But nursing or ganizations must conti nue to collaborate and work hard to develop common messages, includi ng visions and missions, with regard to their ability to offer evidence-based solutions for improvements in patient care. Once common ground has been established, nursing organizations will need to activate their membership and constituents to work together to take action and support shared goals. When policy makers and other key decision makers know that the largest group of health prof essionals in the country is in agreement on important issues, they listen a nd often take action. Conversely, when nursing organizations and their members disagree with one another on important issues, decisions are not made, as the decision makers often ar e unsure of which side to take.

The Nu rsing Alliance for Quality Care (NAQC)5 is a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded effort with the mission of a dvancing the quality, safety, and value of patient-centered health care for all individuals, including patients, their families, and the communities where patients live. Based at Th e George Washington University School of Nursing, the organization stresses the need for nu rses to advocate actively for and be accountable to patients for high-quality and safe care. The establishment of the NAQC \"is based on the assumption that only with a stronger, more unifi ed 'voice' in nursing policy will dramatic and sustainable achievements in quality and safety be achieved for the American public\" (George Washington University Medical Center, 2010). ANSWERING THE CALL The call for nurses to assume leadership roles can be answered through leadership programs for nurses; mentorship; and involvement in the policy-making process, including political engagement. 5 See http://www.gwumc.edu/healthsci/departments/nursing/naqc/.

Sometimes that development comes through experience. For exam ple, nurse leaders at the executive level historically earned their way to their position through their competence, ra ther than obtaining formal preparation through a busin ess school. However, development as a leader can also be achieved through more formal education and training programs. The wide range of effective leadership programs now available for nurses is illustrated by the examples described below. The challenge is to better utilize th ese opportunities to develop a great er number of nursing leaders. Integrated Nurse Leadership Program The Integrated Nurse Leadership Program (INLP), 6 funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, works with hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area that wish to remodel their professional culture and systems of care to im prove care while dealing more effectively with continual change. The program develops hosp ital leaders, offers training and technical assistance, and provides grants to support the program's implementation. INLP has found that the development of stable, effective leadership in nursing-related care is associated with better-than-expected patient care outcomes and improve ments in nurse recruitment and retention. The impact of the program will be evaluated to produce models that can be replicated in other parts of the country. Fellows Program in Management fo r Nurse Executives at Wharton 7 When the Johnson & Johnson Company and the Wharton School joined in 1983 to offer a senior nurse executive management fellowship, the program concentrated on helping senior nursing leaders manage their departments by prov iding them, for example, intense training in accounting (Shea, 2005). The Wharton Fellows program has changed in many ways since then in response to the evolving health care environmen t, according to a 2005 review (Shea, 2005). For example, the program has strengthened senior nu rsing executives' ability to argue for quality improvement on the basis of solid evidence, including financial documentation and probabilistic decision making. The program also aims to improve such leadership competencies as systems thinking, negotiation, communicatio ns, strategy, analysis, and th e development of learning communities. Its offerings will likely undergo yet more changes as hospital chief executive and chief operating officers increasingly come fr om the ranks of the nursing profession. 6 See of Sciences.

It provides a 3-year in-dep th, comprehensive leadership development experience for nurses who are already serving in senior lead ership positions. The program is designed to cultivate and expand fello ws' capacity to lead teams and organizations. The fellowship program includes curriculum and program activities that provide opportunities for executive coaching and mentoring, team-bas ed and individual leadership projects, professional development that incorporates best practices in leadership, as well as access to online communities and leadership networks. Th rough the program, fellows will to master 20 leadership competencies that co ver a broad range of knowledge and skills that can be used when \"leading self, leading others, leading the or ganization and leading in health care\" (RWJF Executive Nurse Fellows, 2010). Best on Board Best on Board9 is an education, testing, and certification program th at helps prepare current and prospective leaders to serve on the governing board of a health care organization. Its CEO, Connie Curran, is a registered nurse (RN) who chaired a hospital nursing department, was the dean of a medical college, and founded her own national management and consulting services firm. A 2010 review cites the growing rec ognition by blue ribbon panels and management researchers that nurses are an untapped resource for the governing bodies of health care organizations. The authors argue that while nurse s have many qualities that make them natural assets to any health care board, they must also \"understand the advantag es of serving on boards and what it takes to get th ere\" (Curran and Totten, 2010). Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows and Investigator Awards Programs While not limited to nurses, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows and Investigator Awards programs10 offer nurses, other health prof essionals, and behavioral and social scientists \"with an interest in health [t he opportunity] to participate in health policy processes at the federal level\" (RWJF Scholars, Fellows & Lead ership Programs, 2010). Fellows work on Capitol Hill with elected officials and congr essional staff. The goal is for fellows to use their academic and practice experience to inform th e policy process and to improve the quality of policies enacted. Investigators are funded to comp lete innovative studies of topics relevant to current and future health policy. Participants in both programs receive intensive training to improve the content and delivery of messages in tended to improve health policy and practice. This training is critical, as investigators are often called upon to testify to Congress about the issues they have explored. The health policy fe llows bring their more detailed understanding of how policies are formed back to their home orga nizations. In this way, they are more effective about policy changes that lead to improvements in patient care. leaders as they strive to bring 9 See http://8 See \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In this rega rd, achieving Magnet status indicates that the nursing workforce within the institution has a ttained a number of high standards relating to quality and standards of nursing practice. These standards, as designated by the Magnet process, are called \"Forces of Magnetism. \" According to ANCC, \"the full expression of the Forces embodies a professional environment guided by a st rong visionary nursing leader who advocates and supports development and excellence in nursi ng practice. As a natural outcome of this, the program elevates the reputation and standards of the nursing profession\" (ANCC, 2010). Some of these Forces include quality of nursing leadership, management style, quality of care, autonomous nursing care, nurses as teachers, in terprofessional relations hips, and professional development. Mentorship12 Leadership is also fostered through effec tive mentorship opportunities with leaders in nursing, other health professions, policy, and busine ss. All nurses have a responsibility to mentor those who come after them, whether by helping a new nurse become oriented or by taking on more formal responsibilities as a teacher of nursing students or a preceptor. Nursing organizations (membership associations) also ha ve a responsibility to provide mentoring and leadership guidance, as well as opportunities to sh are expertise and best practices, for those who join. Fortunately, a number of nursing associations have organized networks to support their membership and facilitate such opportunities: The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) conducts an expertise survey that is used to identify subject matter expe rts across topic areas within its membership; it also maintains a list of nursing education expert s. Names of these experts are shared with members on request. These resources also are us ed to identify experts to serve on boards, respond to media requests, and serve in othe r capacities. In addition, AACN offers an annual executive leadership development pr ogram and a new deans mentoring program to further promote and foster leadership. 11 See http://www.nursecreden tialing.org/Magnet/ProgramOverview.aspx . 12This section draws on personal communication in 2010 w ith Susan Gergely, Director of Operations, American Organization of Nurse Executives; Beverly Malone, CEO, National League for Nursing; Robert Rosseter, Chief Communications Officer, American Associ ation of Colleges of Nursing; and Pat Ford Roegner, CEO, American Academy of Nursing.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html5-20 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The National League for Nursing (NLN) has es tablished an Academy of Nurse Educators whose members are available to serve as me ntors for NLN members. NLN engages these educators in a variety of mentoring program s, from a National Scholarly Writing Retreat to the Johnson & Johnson mentor ing program for new faculty. While AONE does not have a formal ment oring program, it has developed online learning communities where members are enc ouraged to interact, post questions, and learn from each other. These online communitie s facilitate collaboration; encourage the sharing of knowledge, best practices, and re sources; and help members discover solutions to day-to-day challenges in their work. The American Academy of Nursing keeps a detailed list of nur se \"Edge Runners\"13 that describes the programs nursing leaders have developed and the outcomes of those programs. Edge Runner names and contact info rmation are prominently displayed so that learning and mentoring can take place freely.14 The American Nurses Association just passe d a resolution at its 2010 House of Delegates to develop a mentoring program for novice nurses. The program has yet to be developed. Over the years, the National Coalitio n of Ethnic Minority Nurse Associations (NCEMNA) has offered numerous workshops, webinars, and educational materials to develop its members' competencies in leadership, policy, and communications. NCEMNA's highly regarded Scholars program15 promotes the academic and professional development of ethnic minority investigators, in part through a me ntoring program. It serves as a model worth emulati ng throughout the nursing profession. Involvement in Policy Making Nurses may articulate what they want to happe n in health care to make it more truly patient centered and to improve quality, access, and value. They may even have the evidence to support their conclusions. As with any worthy cause, ho wever, they must engage in the policy-making process to ensure that the changes they believe in are realized. To this end, they must be able to envision themselves as leaders in that process an d seek out new partners who share their goals. The challenge now is to motivate all nurses to pursue leadership roles in the policy-making process. Political engagement is one avenue th ey can take to that e nd. As Bethany Hall-Long, a nurse who was elected to the Delaware State Hous e of Representatives in 2002 and is now a state senator, writes, \"political actions may be as simp le as voting in local sc hool board elections or sharing research findings with st ate officials, or as complex as running for elected office\" (Hall- Long, 2009). For example, engaging school board candidates about the fundamental role of school nurses in the management of chronic cond itions among students can make a difference at budget time. And if the goal is broader, perhaps to locate more community health clinics within the local school board is absolutely vital. As Hall-Long writes, schools, achieving buy-in from 13 The Edge Runner program is a component of the American Academy of Nursing's Raise the Voice campaign, funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The Edge Runner designation recognizes nurses who have developed innovative, successful models of care and interventions to address problems in the health care delivery system or unmet health needs in a population. 14 See AAN's Edge Runner Directory, \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMING LEADERSHIP 5-21 however, \"since nurses do not regularly communicat e with their elected officials, the elected officials listen to non-nursi ng individuals\" (Hall-Long, 2009). Political engagement can be a natural outgr owth of nursing experience. When Marilyn Tavenner first started working in an intensive care unit in Virginia, sh e thought, \"If I were the head nurse or the nurse manager, I would make changes. I would try to influence that unit and that unit's quality and staffing.\" After she be came a nurse manager, she thought, \"I wouldn't mind doing this for the entire hospital.\" After su cceeding for several year s as a director of nursing, she was encouraged by a group of physic ians to apply for the CEO position of her hospital when it became available. Eventually, Timothy Kaine, governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, recruited her to be the state's secretar y of health and human resources. In February 2010, Ms. Tavenner was named deputy administrator for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Like many nurses, she had ne ver envisioned working in government. But she realized that she wanted to have an impact on he alth care and health care reform. She wanted to help the uninsured find resources and access to care. For her, that meant building on relationships and finding opportuni ties to work in government. 16 Other notable nurses who have answered the call to serve in government include Sheila Burke, who served as chief of staff to former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, has been a member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and now teaches at Georgetown and Harvard Universities; and Mary Wakefield, who was named administrator of HRSA in 2009 and is the highest-ranking nurse in the Obama Admini stration. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's office has had back-to-back nurses from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows Program as staffers since 2007, providing a significant entry point for the development of new health policy leaders. Additionally, in 1989 Senator Daniel I nouye established the Military Nurse Detailee fellowship program. This 1-year fellowship provides an opportunity for a high-ranking military nurse, who holds a minimum of a master's degree, to gain health policy leadership experience in Senator Inouye's office. The fellowship rotates among three branches of service (Army, Navy, and Air Force) annually. 17 During the Clinton Ad ministration, Beverly Malone served as deputy assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 2002, Richard Carmona, who bega n his education with an associate's degree in nursing from the Bronx Community College in New York, was appointed surgeon general by President George W. Bush. Shirley Chater le d the reorganization of the Social Security Administration in the 1990s. Carolyne Davis se rved as head of the Health Care Finance Administration (predecessor of the Centers for Medicare a nd Medicaid Servi ces) in the 1980s during the implementation of a new coding system that classifies hospita l cases into diagnosis- related groups (DRGs). From 1979 to 1981, Rhet augh Dumas was the first nurse, the first woman, and the first African American to serve as a deputy director of the National Institute of Mental Health (Sullivan, 2007). Nurses also have served as regional di rectors of HHS and as senior advisors on health policy to HHS. As for elected office, there were three nurse members of the 111th Congress\u2014Eddie Bernice D-CA), and Carol yn McCarthy (D-NY)\u2014all of whom had a hand Johnson (D-TX), Lois Capps ( 16 This paragraph draws on personal communication with Marilyn Tavenner, principal deputy administrator and chief operating officer, Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services, May 11, 2010. 17 Personal communication, Corina Barrow, Lieutenant Co lonel, Army Nurse Corps, Nurse Corps Detailee, Office of Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI), August 25, 2010.

Lois Capps organized and co-chairs th e Congressional Nursing Caucus (which also includes members who are not nurses). The group focuses on mobilizing congressional support for health-related issues. Additi onally, 105 nurses have served in state le gislatures, including Paula Hollinger of Maryland, who sponsored one of the nation's first stem cell research bills. None of these nurses waited to be asked; they pursued their positions, both elected and appointed, because they knew they had the exper tise and experience to make changes in health care. Very little in politics is accomplished without preparation or allies. Health professionals point with pride to multiple aspects of the Prescr iption for Pennsylvania initiative, a state health care reform initiative that preced ed the ACA and is also described in Box 5-6. As is clear from a detailed 2009 review, success was not achieved overnight; smaller legislative and regulatory victories set the stage starting in the late 1990s. Even some apparent legislative failures built the foundation for future successes because they caus ed nurses to spend more time meeting face to face with physicians who had organized oppositi on to various measures. As a result, nursing leaders developed a better sense of where they could achieve compromises with their opponents. They also found a new ally in the Chamber of Commerce to counter opposition from some sections of organized medicine (Hansen-Turton et al., 2009). Hansen-Turton and colleagues draw three major le ssons from this experience. First, nurses must build strong alliances within their ow n professional community, an important lesson alluded to earlier in this chapter. Pennsylvania's nurses were able to speak with a unified voice because they first worked out among themselves which issues mattered most to them. Second, nurses must build relationships with key policy makers. Pennsylvania's nurses developed strong relationships with several legisl ators from both major political parties and earned the support of two successive sitting governors: Thomas Ridge (Republican) and Edward Rendell (Democrat). Third, nurses must find allies outsi de the nursing profession, part icularly in business and other influential communities. Pennsylvania's nurses gained a strong ally in the Chamber of Commerce when they were able to demonstrate how expanding regulations to allow nurses to do all they were educated and demonstrably capable of doing would help lower health care costs (Hansen-Turton et al., 2009). Perhaps the most important lesson to draw from the Pennsylvania experience lies in the way the campaign was framed. The focus of attent ion was on achieving quali ty care and cost reductions. A closer examination of the issues showed that achievi ng those goals required, among other things, expanding the roles and responsi bilities of nurses. What drew the greatest amount of political support for the Prescription for Pennsylvania campaign was the shared goal of getting more value out of the health care syst em\u2014quality care at a sustai nable price. The fact that the campaign also expanded nursing practice was secondary. T hose expansions are likely to continue as long as the emphasis is on quality care and cost reduction. Similarly, the committee believes that the goal in any transformation of the health care system should be achieving innovative, patient-centered, high-val ue care. If all stakeholders\u2014from legislators, to regulators, to hospital executives, to insurance companies\u2014act from a patient-centered point of reference, they will see that many of the solutions they are seeking require a tran sformation of the nursing profession.

Torregrossa, Esq., director, Governor's Office of Health Care Reform for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania When Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell took offi ce in 2003, one-twelfth of the state's 12 million residents had no access to health care, 80 percent of health care expenditures went to treating chronic illnesses, and $3 billi on was spent annually on avoi dable hospitalizations of chronically ill patients. Pennsylvanians were 11 percent more likely than all other Americans to use the emergency room (ER). On his first day in office, Governor Rendell established the Office of Health Care Reform to begin to address residents' access to affordable, high-quality health care. In January 2007 he announced a major new blueprint for that reform, Prescription for Pennsylvania (known as Rx for PA, www.rxforpa.com), which would promote access to care for all Pennsylvanians and reduce the state's skyrocketing health care expenses. In the 3-plus years since, many initia tives have been undertaken, including: expanding health insurance coverage for the uninsured; improving access to electronic health informat ion through the Pennsylvania Health Information Exchange; establishing a chronic illness commission, whic h in 2008 recommended, among other proposals, the patient-centered medical home; addressing workforce shortages through the Pennsylvania Center fo r Health Careers; establishing seven \"learning collaboratives\" that involve about 800 providers and 1 million patients and teach a variety of providers to collaborate on primary care teams; and expanding the legal scope of practice for physi cian assistants, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, and dental hygienists (although legislation is still needed to allow APRNs to prescribe medications independently). This last strategy has had an impact on access to care, particularly for the uninsured and underinsured. There are now 51 retail clinics that us e APRNs in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and they provide care to 60 percent of the state's unins ured, said Ann S. Torregrossa, Esq., who in 2005 was named deputy director and in 2009 director of the Offi ce of Health Care Reform. Ms. Torregrossa said that of 300,000 visits to such clinics, about hal f would have been ER visits. Retail clinics have been shown to reduce costs and improve access to care (Mehrotra et al., 2009). Other outcome data after the first year of Rx for PA show an increase in the number of people with diabetes receiving eye and foot exam inations and a doubling of the number of children with asthma who have a plan in place for controlling exacerbations (Pennsylvania Governor's Office, 2009). There are about 250 nurse-managed health centers nationwide and 27 in Pennsylvania; many are affiliated with schools of nursing and provide care at a 10 percent lo wer cost than other models\u2014including a 15 percent reduction in ER use and a 25 percent reduction in prescription drug costs (according to unpublished data from the National Nursing Centers Consortium [NNCC]). Tine Hansen-Turton, MGA, JD, CEO of the NNCC and vice president of the Public Health Management Corporation, a nonprofit institute, said t hat nurses involved in Rx for PA have a great deal to teach clinicians and leaders in other states as they grapple with health care reform (Hansen-Turton et al., 2009). The nurse-managed health centers in particular offer a preventive care model that improves access to care. And Pennsylvanians have given high marks to the care they have received from APRNs, Ms. Hansen-Turton said, adding, \"It's all about access.\" PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html5-24 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH A CALL FOR NEW PARTNERSHIPS Having enough nurses and having nurses with the ri ght skills and compet encies to care for the population is an important societal issue. Having allies from outside the profession is important to achieving this goal. More nurses need to reach out to new part ners in arenas ranging from business, government, and philanthropy to state and national medical associations to consumer groups. Additionally, nurses need to fo rtify alliances that are made through personal connections and relationships. Just as important, society needs to understand its stake in ensuring that nurses are effective full partners and leader s in the quest to deliver quality, high-value care that is accessible to diverse populations. The full potential of the nursing profession in care, leadership, and research must be tapped to deal with the wide ra nge of health care challenges the nation will face in the coming years. Eventually, to transform the way health care is delivered in the United States, nurses will have to move not just out of the hospital, but al so out of health care organizations entirely. For example, nurses are underrepresented on the boards of private nonpr ofit and philanthropic organizations, which do not provide health care services but often have a large impact on health care decisions. The Commonwealth Fund and the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, have no nurses on their boards, although they do have physicians. Without nurses, vital ground-level perspectives on quality improvement, care coordi nation, and health promotion are likely missing. On the other hand, AARP provides a positive example. At least two nurses at AARP have served in the top leadership and governance roles (president and chair) in the past 3 years. Nurses serve on the health and long-term services policy committee, and the senior vice president of the Public Policy Institute is also a nurse. AAR P's commitment to nursing is clear through its sponsorship, along with The Robert Wood J ohnson Foundation, of the Center to Champion Nursing. CONCLUSIONS Enactment of the ACA will provide unprecedented opportunities for change in the U.S. health care system for the foreseeable future. St rong leadership on the part of nurses, physicians, and others will be required to devise and implement the changes necessary to increase quality, access, and value and deliver patient-centered care. If these efforts are to be successful, all nurses, from students, to be dside and community nurses, to CNOs and members of nursing organizations, to researchers, must develop leader ship competencies and serve as full partners with physicians and other health professionals in efforts to improve the health care system and the delivery of care. Nurses must exercise thes e competencies in a collaborative environment in all settings, including hospitals, communities, schools, boards, and political and business arenas. In doing so, they must not only mentor others al ong the way, but develop partnerships and gain allies both within and beyond the health care environment.

Planning for fundamental, wide-rangi ng changes in the preparation and deployment of the nursing workforce will require comprehensive data on the numbers and types of professionals curre ntly available and required to meet future needs. Such data are needed across the health professions if a fundamental transformation of the health care system is to be achieved. Major gaps exist in currently available workfo rce data. Filling these gaps should be a priority for the National Health Work force Commission and other structures and resources authorized under the Affordable Care Act. Chapters 3 through 5 have argued for the need to transform the nursing profession to achieve the vision of a reformed health care system set forth in Chapter 1. Achieving this vision, however, will also require a balance of skills and perspectives among physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Yet da ta are lacking on the numbers a nd types of health professionals currently employed, where they are employed, and in what roles. Understa nding of the impact of bundled payments, medical homes, accountable care organizations, health information technology, comparative effectiveness, patient en gagement, and safety, as well as the growing diversification of the American population, will not be complete without information on and analysis of the contributions of the various types of health profe ssionals that will be needed. For cost-effectiveness comparisons, for example, differ ent team configurations, continuing education and on-the-job training programs, incentives, and work flow arrangements\u2014all of which affect the efficient use of the health care workforce\u2014mu st be evaluated. Having these data is a vital first step in the development of accurate m odels for projecting workforce capacity. Those projections in turn are needed to inform th e transformation of nursi ng practice and education argued for in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Awareness of impending shortages of nurses, pr imary care physicians, geriatricians, and dentists and in many of the allied health professions has led to a growing consensus among policy makers that strengthening the health care wo rkforce in the United States is an urgent need. This consensus is reflected in the creation of a National Health Workforce Commission (NHWC) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) whose miss ion is, among other things , to \"[develop] and [commission] evaluations of education and trai ning activities to determine whether the demand for health care workers is being met,\" and to \"[ identify] barriers to UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The committee believes these initiatives will prove most successful if they analyze workforce needs across the professions\u2014as the Department of Veterans A ffairs (VA) did in the 1990s (see Chapter 3)\u2014 rather than focusing on one profession at a ti me. Furthermore, national trend data are not granular enough by themselves to permit accu rate projections of regional needs. This chapter addresses key message #4 set fort h in Chapter 1: Effective workforce planning and policy making require better da ta collection and an improved in formation infrastructure. The chapter first provides a closer l ook at what is known about the wo rkforce in two areas of urgent need: primary care providers and nurses. It then examines gaps in currently available workforce data. The third section describes the experience of one regional workforce plan in Texas that aims to maintain the right numbers and types of nurses to meet its needs. The final section presents the committee's conclusions about the need for better data on the health care workforce. CURRENT ESTIMATES OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND NURSES Primary Care Projections The United States has nearly 400,000 primar y care providers (Bodenheimer and Pham, 2010). As noted in Chapter 3, physicians ac count for 287,000 of these providers, nurse practitioners for 83,000, and physician assistan ts for 23,000 (HRSA, 2008; Steinwald, 2008). While the numbers of nurse practitioners and ph ysician assistants are steadily increasing, the number of medical students a nd residents entering primary care has declined in recent years (Naylor and Kurtzman, 2010). In fact, a 2008 su rvey of medical students found only 2 percent planned careers in general internal medicine, a common entry point into primary care (Hauer et al., 2008). There is a great deal of geographic variati on in where primary care providers work. About 65 million Americans live in areas that are officially identified as primary care shortage areas according to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) (Rieselbach et al., 2010). For example, while one in five U.S. re sidents live in rural ar eas, only one in ten physicians practice in those areas (Bodenheim er and Pham, 2010). A 2006 survey of all 846 federally funded community health center s (CHCs) by Rosenblatt and colleagues (2006) found that 46 percent of direct care provide rs in rural CHCs were nonphysician clinicians, including nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and physician assistants; in urban clinics, the figure was 38.9 percent. The contingent of physic ians was heavily dependent on international medical graduates and loan forg iveness programs. Even so, the vacancies for physicians totaled 428 full-time equivalents (FTEs), while those fo r nurses totaled 376 FTEs (Rosenblatt et al., 2006). Expansion of programs that encourage hea lth care providers to practice primary care, especially those from underrepresented and culturally diverse backgrounds, will be needed to keep pace with the demand for community-based car e. For further discussion of variation in the geographic distribution of primar y care providers, see the secti on on expanding access to primary care in Chapter 3. 1 Patient Protection and A ffordable Care Act Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlMEETING THE NEED FOR BETTER DATA ON THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 6-3 In 2008, the Government Accountability Office de termined that there were few projections of the future need for primary care providers, an d those that existed were substantially limited (Steinwald, 2008). Arguably, it is simpler to project the future supply of health professionals than to project future demand for their services. It is difficult to predict, for example, the pattern of increased demand for primary care after fu ll implementation of th e ACA adds 32 million newly insured people to the health care system. W ill there be a short, marked spike in demand, or will the surge be of longer durati on that leaves more time to ad apt? Given that there are more than 6,000 health professions primary care sh ortage areas nationwide (HRSA, 2010), the question remains of whether grow ing demand for primary care can best be met by an increased number of providers or by better distribution of existing providers. Nursing Workforce Projections Trend data consistently point to a substantial shortfall in the numbers of nurses in the near future. HRSA has calculated a shortfall of as many as 1 million FTEs by 2020 (HRSA, 2004). However, that projection is almost certainly t oo high because it depends on extrapolating today's unsustainable growth rates for h ealth care to the future. A more conservative estimate from 2009 suggests a shortage of 260,000 re gistered nurses (RNs) by 2025; by comparison, the last nursing shortage peaked in 2001 with a vacancy rate of 126,000 FTEs (Buerhaus, 2009). Yet this more conservative projection is almost certainly too low because the new law is \"highly likely to increase demand for health care services and he nce for nurses\" (RWJF, 2010a). Figure 6-1 shows a forecast of supply and demand for FTE RNs, 2009 2030. For a more detailed examination of the projected nursing shortage based on the num bers and composition of the workforce, the effects of health reform on the demand for RN s, and the degree to which the RN workforce measures up to this anticipated de mand, see Appendix F (on CD-ROM). FIGURE 6-1 Forecast supply of and demand for full-time equivalent (FTE) RNs, 2009 2030. SOURCE: Spetz, 2009. Reprinted with permission from Joanne Spetz. Copyright 2009 by the author.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html6-4 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The urgency of the situation is masked by current economic conditions. Nursing shortages have historically eased somewhat dur ing difficult economic times, and th e past few years of financial turmoil have been no exception (Buerhaus et al., 2009). Nursing is seen as a stable profession\u2014a rare point of security in an unsettled economy. A closer look at the data, however, shows that during the past two recessions, mo re than three-quarters of th e increase in the employment of RNs is accounted for by women and men over age 50, and there are currently more than 900,000 nurses over age 50 in the workforce (BLS , 2009). Meanwhile, the trend from 2001 to 2008 among middle-aged RNs was actually negative, with 24,000 fewer nurses aged 35 to 49. In a hopeful sign for the future, the number of nur ses under age 35 increased by 74,000. In terms of absolute numbers, however, the cohorts of younge r nurses are still vas tly outnumbered by their older Baby Boom colleagues. In other words, th e past practice of dependence on a steady supply of older nurses to fill the gaps in the health care system will eventual ly fail as a strategy (Buerhaus et al., 2009). Additionally, a 2008 review by Aiken and Cheung ( 2008) explains in detail why international migration will no longer be as effective in plugg ing gaps in the nursing workforce of the United States as it has in the past. Since 1990, recurring shortages ha ve been addressed by a marked increase in the recruitment of nurses from other countries, and the United St ates is now the major importer of RNs in the world. Figure 6-2 compares trends in new licenses between U.S.- and foreign-educated RNs from 2002 to 2008. Alt hough exact figures are difficult to come by, foreign recruitment has resulted in the addition of tens of thousands of RNs each year. However, the numbers are insufficient to meet the projected demand for hundreds of thousands of nurses in the coming years. U.S. immigration policy would have to substantially favor nursing over all other professional categories, and the migration would exacerb ate the current global nursing shortage to politically untenabl e levels (Aiken and Cheung, 2008). 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000 RNs, 2002 2008.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlMEETING THE NEED FOR BETTER DATA ON THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 6-5 GAPS IN CURRENT WORKFORCE DATA As the committee considered how best to inform health care workforce policy and development, it realized it could not answer several basic questions about the workforce numbers and composition that will be needed by 2025. Ho w many primary care providers does the nation require to deliver on its promise of more accessi ble, quality health care? What are the various proportions of physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and other pr oviders that can be used to meet that need? What is the cu rrent educational capacity to m eet the need, and how quickly can it be ramped up? Yet The Robert Wood Johns on Foundation Nursing Research Network, when consulted by the committee, suggested that these projections could be reliably generated within 5 years if better national and regi onal data were collected to s upport workforce prediction models (RWJF, 2010b). Research on the health care workforce to in form policy deliberations is fragmented and dominated by historical debates over what numbers of a particul ar health profession are needed and the extent (if at all) to which government s hould be involved in infl uencing the supply of and demand for health professionals. The methods used to develop projection models are notoriously deficient and focus on single professions, typically assuming the continuation of current practice and utilization patterns. Projecti on models do not allow policy make rs to test and evaluate the impact of different policy scenarios on supply and demand estimates; whether and how health outcomes are associated with various health professions; and whet her interprofessional teambased care is more efficient, lowers costs, and leads to safer car e and improved patient outcomes. In a paper prepared for the committee, Julie Sochalski and Jonathan Weiner emphasize the importance of collecting data that allow for flex ible workforce projections . Meeting the need for adequate numbers of RNs \"to support health care delivery reform will require a wholesale paradigm shift in the framework and context us ed to prepare and deploy the RN workforce and to forecast future requirements\" (Sochalski and Weiner, 2010). The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nursi ng Research Network assessed for the committee the quantity and quality of workforce da ta across health professions and suggested three key areas of need: Core data sets on health care workforce supply and demand\u2014Researchers should develop and routinely update core data sets that facilitate analys is of the supply, demand, and distribution of the health care workfo rce across health professions. To this end, technical assistance and partne rships with licensure boards, educational organizations, and professional associations at the national, state, and local leve ls will be necessary. Surveillance of health care workforce market conditions\u2014Researchers should develop a workforce surplus/shortage surveillance system that provides regular and frequent data (e.g., every 6 12 months) on key workforce indicators. This system would employ surveillance methods similar to those of other economic monitoring systems designed to track trends and provide early warning of changes in the marketplace. The development of such a system will require partnerships with public and private employers and organizations. Health care workforce effectiveness research\u2014 Researchers should develop data and support research to evaluate th e impact of new models of car e delivery on the health care workforce and the impact of workforce confi gurations on health care costs, quality, and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html6-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH access. This effort should include coordination w ith other federal agencies to ensure that key data elements are incorporated into fede ral surveys, claims da ta, and clinical data. Research should include evaluati on of strategies for increasi ng the efficient education, preparation, and distribution of the health care workforce. Finally, workforce research needs to be included in federal pilot and demonstration projects involving payment innovation, introduction of new technologies, team-based care models, and other advances. A major barrier to more strategic health care workforce planning efforts is insufficient basic data on the activities performed by health professi onals. While claims data can yield information on the services provided by physicians and some alli ed health professionals , the efforts of other health professionals, including nurses\u2014is in visible in most federal data sets. As discussed above, the ACA authorizes the NHWC. It also aut horizes a National Center for Workforce Analysis, as well as state and region al workforce centers, and provides funding for workforce data collection and st udies. A priority for these new structures and resources should be systematic monitoring of health care workforce shortages and surpluses, review of the data and methods needed to predict future workforce n eeds, and coordination of the collection of data relating to the health care workforce in federal surveys and in the private sector. These three functions must be actively assumed by the federa l government to build the necessary capacity for workforce planning in the United States. The NHWC has the potential to build a robust workforce data infrastructure a nd a high-level analytic capacity. HRSA's Bureau of Primary Care and Bur eau of Health Professions conduct some monitoring\u2014primarily for nurses, primary care clin icians, mental health professionals, dentists, and pharmacists\u2014for purposes of designating hea lth professional shortage areas/facilities and medically underserved areas/populations and info rming funding decision s to support clinician training. Thus, HRSA is well positio ned to assume leadership in directing resources needed to build a data infrastructure to s upport health care workforce research. One currently available resource for examining th e role of providers in primary care is the National Provider Indicator (NPI). While the NP I is a mechanism for tracking billing services, this data source at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could be thought of as an opportunity to collect workforce data and conduct research on those nurses who bill for services, primarily nurse practitioners. The co mmittee believes the NPI presents a unique opportunity to track and measure nur se practitioners with regard to their practice, such as where they are located, how many are bill ing patients, what kinds of pa tients they are seeing, and what services they are providing. Thes e data would be a significant c ontribution to the supply data currently being collected, adding to the knowledge base about practi ce partnerships, utilization of services, and primary care shortages. The committee encourages CMS to make these data available in a useful way to workforce research ers and others who might contribute to this knowledge base. The NHWC needs to develop predictions for a range of assumptions about future delivery systems and patterns, including the future workforce supply across the professions (see Figure 6-3 for factors to consider) and the demand for services that can be provided by more than one profession or specialty (see Figure 6-4 for factors to consider). The following example illustrates the complexity of developing workforce projections and the depth of the data needs with respect to a single profe ssion, as well as the i nnovative solutions the Gu lf Coast region of Texas found for meeting its nursing needs. The committee commends this example to the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

SOURCE: Salsberg, 2009. GULF COAST HEALTH SERVI CES STEERING COMMITTEE In the 1990s, a group of CEOs of Houston-area businesses and philanthropic groups formed the Gulf Coast Health Servic es Steering Committee (GCHSSC) 2 to address a local nursing shortage. This partnership brings together executives from area hospitals, health care systems, and academic institutions . The group was determined to work together to develop regional solutions to workforce challenges that affected the 13 counties of the greater Houston area. One of the four initial areas of focus for the GCHSSC was building educational capacity to accommodate more nursing students. The other th ree focus areas addressed legislation and regulations, advancing health careers, and improving the wo rk environment where nurses practice. Building educational capacity remains a central focus of the GCHSSC to this day. Thanks to its efforts, more than $30 million wa s infused into Houston area nursing schools from 2001 to 2008.3 Use of Data One of the first things the GC HSSC's educational capacity wo rk group decided to do was to start tracking the numbers of enrollments, gradua tes, and qualified applicants who are turned the greater Hous ton area. The GCHSSC quickly concluded that away from nursing schools in 2 See http://www.gchssc.com/.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlMEETING THE NEED FOR BETTER DATA ON THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 6-9 nursing schools were graduating th e bulk of their students at the wrong time. Nearly all students graduated in May and took their licensing exam shortly thereafter. Yet this is the time that hospitals\u2014still the major employers of nurses in the Houston area \u2014have their lowest number of inpatient admissions; the highest number of inpatie nt admissions typically occurs in January and February. The GCHSSC therefore approached the nursing schools about implementing rolling admissions so that entry-level nurses would gradua te in the fall, winter, and spring. Results thus far are promising. The GCHSSC projects that the spring surge in graduates will nearly disappear in the next 2 years. Increased Student Enrollment The various initiatives undertaken by the GCHS SC have resulted in a 73 percent increase in student enrollment in Houston prelicensure nursing programs, from 2,211 in fall 1998 to 3,829 in fall 2008. Several schools are opening branch cam puses and offering online programs to further increase the pool of eligible students. With an eye toward increasing both the numbers and diversity of the nursing student body, the Universi ty of Houston has launched a nursing program in Victoria, Texas, a city located about 120 m iles outside of Houston. Victoria has a population of 60,000, approximately 45 percent of which is Hispanic (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Meanwhile, the University of Texas at Austin has developed an online nursing program that partners with health care instit utions and enrolls students from across the state. The GCHSSC is identifying which institutions from the Gulf Coas t area have joined with this online program so they can participate in developing a workforce plan for the region. Faculty Shortage The GCHSSC is addressing the local nursing f aculty shortage in several ways. Nursing schools in three major area universities\u2014the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, the University of Texas Medical Bran ch at Galveston, and the Houston campus of Texas Woman's University\u2014have launched accelerated master's of science in nursing (MSN) programs. In tracking the employment of th ese MSN graduates, however, the GCHSSC has concluded that most will be working in hospitals and not taking teaching positions. It is easy to understand why. Local hospitals pa y RNs with an MSN degree 40 to 60 percent higher salaries than MSN-credentialed professors receive. The GCHSSC is working to address this problem. Meanwhile, the George Foundation, a local phi lanthropic organizati on, is helping the University of Texas School of Nursing at H ouston launch an accelerated PhD nursing program. Starting in fall 2010, a cohort of 10 MSN-prepared nurses will begin the program with the aim of completing their degree in 3 years. All stude nts will receive an annual stipend of $60,000, allowing them to attend full time. In return, the ne w PhDs must teach for at least 3 years at the University of Texas School of Nursing at Housto n or in any other nursing education program in the Gulf Coast region. This program is similar to programs in New Jersey and California that are funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, respectively. 4 4 See http://www.njni.org/?county=42 and http://www.moore.org/nursing.aspx .

In th e context of this repo rt, such data are essential for determining what changes are needed in nursing practice and e ducation to advance the vision for health care set forth in Chapter 1. Major gaps exist in curren tly available data on the health care workforce. A priority for the NHWC and other structures an d resources authorized under the ACA should be systematic monitoring of the suppl y of health care workers, re view of the data and methods needed to develop accurate predictions of futu re workforce needs, and coordination of the collection of data on the health care workforce. The building of an infrastructure for the collection and analysis of work force data is a crucial need if the overarching goal of a transformed health care system is to be realized.

The repor t comes at a time of opportunity in health care resulting from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which will provide access to care for an additional 32 million Americans. In the preceding chapters, the committee has described both barriers and opportunities in nursing practice, education, and leadersh ip. It has also discussed the workforce data needed to guide policy and work force planning with resp ect to the numbers, types, and mix of professionals that will be requ ired in an evolving health care environment. The primary objective of the committee in fulfilli ng its charge was to define a blueprint for action that includes recommendations for changes in public and institut ional policies at the national, state, and local levels. This concluding chapter presents the results of that effort. The committee's recommendations are focused on maxi mizing the full potential and vital role of nurses in designing and implementing a more eff ective and efficient health care system, as envisioned by the committee in Chapter 1. The changes recommended by the committee are intended to advance the nursing profession in ways that will ensure that nurses are educated and prepared to meet the current and future demands of the health care system and those it serves. This chapter first provides some context for the development of the committee's recommendations. It details what the committee cons idered to be its scope and focus, the nature of the evidence that supports its recommendati ons, cost considerations associated with the recommendations, and how the recommendations might be implemented. The chapter then presents recommendations for nur sing practice, education, and le adership, as well as improved collection and analysis of interprofessional health care workforce data, that resulted from the committee's review of the evidence. CONSIDERATIONS THAT IN FORMED THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS As discussed throughout this re port, the challenges facing the health care system and the nursing profession are complex and numerous. Challenges to nursing prac tice include regulatory barriers, professional resistance to expanded scop es of practice, health system fragmentation, insurance company policies, high turnover among nurses, and a lack of diversity in the nursing workforce. With regard to nursing education, there is a need for gr eater numbers, better preparation, and more diversity in the student body and faculty, th e workforce, and the cadre of researchers. Also needed are new and re levant competencies, lifelong learning, and interprofessional education. Challeng es with regard to nursing l eadership include the need for leadership competencies among nurses, collabor ative environments in which nurses can learn PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html7-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH and practice, and engagement of nurses at all levels\u2014from stud ents to front-line nurses to nursing executives and researchers\u2014in leadership roles. Finally, comprehensive, sufficiently granular workforce data are needed to ascerta in the necessary balance of skills among nurses, physicians, and other health professionals for a transformed health car e system and practice environment. Solutions to some of these challenges are well within the purview of the nursing profession, while solutions to others are not. A number of constraints affect the pr ofession and the health care system more broadly. While legal and regulat ory constraints affect scopes of practice for advanced practice registered nurses, the major cross-cutting constrai nts originate in limitations of available resources\u2014both financia l and human. These constraints are not new, nor are they unique to the nursing profession. The current ec onomic landscape has magnified some of the challenges associated with these constraints wh ile also reinforcing the need for change. To overcome these challenges, the nursing workforce needs to be well educated, team oriented, adaptable, and able to apply competencies su ch as those highlighted throughout this report, especially those relevant to leadership. The nursing workforce may never have the optimu m numbers to meet the needs of patients, nursing students, and the health care system. To maximize the available resources in care environments, providers need to work effectivel y and efficiently with a team approach. Teams need to include patients and their families, as we ll as a variety of health professionals, including nurses, physicians, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, medical assistants, and social workers, among others. Care teams need to make the best use of each member's education, skill, and expertise, and health professionals need to practice to the full extent of their license and education. Just as physicians delegate to regi stered nurses, then, re gistered nurses should delegate to front-line caregiver s such as nursing assistants and community health workers. Moreover, technology needs to facilitate seamless care that is centered on the patient, rather than taking time away from patient care. In terms of education, efforts must be made to expand the number of nurses who are qualified to serve as faculty. Meanwhile, curricula need to be evaluated, and streamlined and technologies such as high-fidelity simulation and online education need to be utilized to maximize available faculty. Academic practice partnerships should also be used to make efficient use of resources and expand clinic al education sites. In conducting its work and evaluating the cha llenges that face the nursing profession, the committee took into account a number of considerat ions that informed its recommendations and the content of this report. The committee carefull y considered the scope and focus of the report in light of its charge (see Box P-1 in the pref ace to the report), the evidence that was available, costs associated with its recommendations, and implementation issues. Overall, the committee's recommendations are geared toward advanci ng the nursing profession as a whole, and are focused on actions required to best meet long-term future needs rather than needs in the short term.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlRECOMMENDATIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES 7-3 Scope and Focus of the Report Many of the topics covered in this report could have been the focus of the entire report. As indicated in Chapter 4, for example, the report could have focused entirely on nursing education. Given the nature of the committee's charge a nd the time allotted for the study, however, the committee had to cover each topic at a hi gh level and formulate relatively broad recommendations. This report could not be an exhaustive compendium of the challenges faced by the nursing workforce, nor was it meant to serv e as a step-by-step guide detailing solutions to all of those challenges. Accordingly, the committee limited its reco mmendations to those it believed had the potential for greatest impact and could be accomp lished within the next decade. Taken together, the recommendations are meant to provide a st rong foundation for the de velopment of a nursing workforce whose members are well educated and we ll prepared to practice to the full extent of their education, to meet the current and future hea lth needs of patients, and to act as full partners in leading change and advancing health. Implementation of these recommendations will take time, resources, and a significant commitment from nurses and other health professionals; nurse educators; researchers; policy ma kers and government leaders at the federal, state, and local levels; foundations; and other key stakeholders. An emphasis of the committee's deliberations an d this report is nurses' role in advancing care in the community, with a particular focus on primary care. While the majority of nurses currently practice in acute care settings, and much of nursing education is directed toward those settings, the committee sees primary care and pr evention as central drivers in a transformed health care system, and therefore chose to fo cus on opportunities for nurses across community settings. The committee believes nurses have the poten tial to play a vital role in improving the quality, accessibility, and value of health care, and ultimately health in the community, beyond their critical contributions to acute care. The current landscape also directed the committee's focus on primary care; c oncern over an adequate supply of primary care providers has been expressed and demand for primar y care is expected to grow as millions more Americans gain insurance coverage through im plementation of the ACA (see Chapters 1 and 2). Additionally, many provisions of the ACA focus on improving access to primary care, offering further opportunities for nurses to play a role in tran sforming the health care system and improving patient care. The committee recognizes that improved primar y care is not a panacea and that acute care services will always be needed. However, the committee sees primary care in community settings as an opportunity to improve health by reaching people where they live, work, and play. Nurses serving in primary care roles could expa nd access to care, educate people about health risks, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors to prevent diseas e, manage chronic diseases, and coordinate care. The committee also focused on advanced practice registered nurses in its discussion of some topics, most notably scope of practice. Recognizing the importance of primary care as discussed above, the committee viewed the potential contributions of thes e nurses to meeting the great need for primary care services if they could pr actice uniformly to the full extent of their education and training.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html7-4 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Available Evidence The charge to the committee called for the formulation of a set of bold national-level recommendations\u2014a considerable task. To develop its recommendations, the committee examined the available published evidence, dr ew on committee members' expert judgment and experience, consulted experts engaged in The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nursing Research Network, and commissioned the papers that appear in Appendixes F through J on CD- ROM in the back of this report. The committ ee also called on foremost experts in nursing, nursing research, and health polic y to provide input, perspective, and expertise during its public workshops and forums (described in Appendix C). In addition to the peer-reviewed literature and newly commissioned research, the committee considered anecdotal evidence and self-evalu ations for emerging models of care being implemented across the country. Evidence to sup port the diffusion of a variety of promising innovative models informed the committee's de liberations and recommendations. Many of these innovations are highlighted as case studies throughout the report, a nd others are discussed in the appendixes. These case studies offer real-life ex amples of successful i nnovations that were developed by nurses or feature nurses in a lead ership role, and are meant to complement the peer-reviewed evidence presented in the te xt. The committee believes these case studies contribute to the evidence base on how nurses can serve in recon ceptualized roles to directly affect the quality, accessibility, and value of care. Cumulatively, the case studies and nurse profiles demonstrate what is possible and what the future of nursing could look like under ideal circumstances in which nurses would be highly educated and well prepared by an education system that would promote seamless academic progression, in which nurses would be practicing to the full extent of their e ducation and training, and in whic h they would be acting as full partners in efforts to redesi gn the health care system. The committee drew on a wealth of sources of evidence to support its recommendations. The recommendations presented are based on the best evidence available. There is a need, however, to continue building the evidence base in a variety of areas. The committee identified several research priorities to build upon its recommendati ons. For example, data are lacking on the work of nurses and the nursing workforce in general, primarily because of a dearth of large and well- designed studies explicitly explor ing these issues. Accordingly, th e committee calls for research in a number of areas that would yield evidence rela ted to the future of nursing to address some of the shortcomings in the data it encountered. Boxes 7-1 through 7-3 list research questions that are directly connected to the re commendations and the discussion in Chapters 3 through 5. The committee believes that answers to these research questions are needed to help advance the profession. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlRECOMMENDATIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES 7-7 Costs Associated with the Recommendations The current state of the U.S. economy and its e ffects on federal, state, and local budgets pose significant challenges to transforming the health care system. These fiscal challenges also will heavily influence the implementation of the co mmittee's recommendations. While providing cost estimates for each recommendation was beyond the scope of this study, the committee does not deny that there will be costs\u2014in some cases sizable\u2014associated with implementing its recommendations. These costs must be carefully weighed against the potential for long-term benefit. Expanding the roles and capacity of th e nursing profession will require significant up- front financial resources, but th is investment, in the committee's view, will help secure a strong foundation for a future health care system that can provide high-quality, accessible, patient- centered care. Based on its expert opinion and the available evidence, the committee believes that, despite the fiscal challenges, implemen tation of its recommendations is necessary to increase the quality, accessibility, and value of care through the contributions of nurses. Implementation of the Recommendations Each of the recommendations presented in th is report is supported by a level of evidence necessary to warrant its implementation. This does not mean, however , that the evidence currently available to support the committee's recommendations is sufficient to guide or motivate their implementation. The research prio rities presented in Boxes 7-1 through 7-3 constitute key evidence gaps that need to be filled to convince key st akeholders that each recommendation is fundamental to the transforma tion of care delivered by nurses. For example, to be convinced to purchase equipment necessary to expand the number of nurses that can be educated using expensive new teaching technologies, such as high-fidelity simulation, distance learning, and online education modalities, decisi on makers in nursing schools will likely need evidence for the impact of these technologies on increasing the capacity of the nursing education system, as well as assurance that these technol ogies are an effective way to educate students. Likewise, before agreeing to reorganize care and training in a way that supports nursing residencies, hospitals will likel y want to understand the true cost s of such programs, as well as the key ingredients for their success. And before state political leaders can be persuaded to enact legislation to expand and standardize the scope of practice for advanced practice registered nurses, they will need messages to convey to th eir constituents about what these changes will mean for acquiring timely access to high-quality primary care services. The committee urges the health services resear ch community to embark on research agendas that can produce the evidence needed to guide the implementation of its recommendations. At the same time, the committee recognizes, from th e work of Mary Naylor and colleagues (2009), that a strong evidence base, even if supported by th e results of multiple rando mized clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health, will not be sufficient to propel a new model, policy, or practice to a position of wi despread acceptance and implementation. \"Health care is rich in evidence-based innovations, yet even when such innovations are im plemented successfully in one location, they often disseminate slow ly\u2014if at all. Diffusion of innovations is a major challenge in all industries includi ng health care\" (Berwick, 2003). Experience with the Transitional Care Model (T CM), described in Chapter 2, illustrates this point. In this case, barriers intrin sic to the way care is currentl y organized, regulated, reimbursed, and delivered have delayed the ability of a cost-effective, quality-enhancing model to improve the lives of the chronically ill. Learning from barriers to diffuse evidence-based health care PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html7-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH interventions within health syst ems, Naylor and colleagues identif ied several ingredients crucial to successful diffusion. First, the model or i nnovation should be a good fit in response to a critical need, either within an organization or nationwide. Second, without strong champions, especially those with decision-making power, ther e is very little chance of widespread adoption. The researchers learned the hard way the cost of failure to engage all st akeholders in a project\u2014 early, continually, and throughout. Engagement with the media is especially important. An understanding of the landscape is necessary as well and should guide efforts to market the innovation to others. Milestones and measures of success are important to all team members and throughout the entire diffusion proc ess. Finally, flexibility, or the willingness to adapt the model or innovation to meet environmental or organi zational demands, increases the probability of success (Naylor et al., 2009). Planning for the implementation of the comm ittee's recommendations is beyond the scope of this report. However, the committee urges he alth care providers, organizations, and policy makers to carry out the eight recommendations pres ented below to enable nurses to lead in the transformation of the health care system and a dvance the health of patients and communities throughout the nation. CONCLUSIONS The committee believes the implementation of its recommendations will help establish the needed groundwork in the nursing profession to further the work of nurses in innovating and improving patient care. The committee sees its r ecommendations as the building blocks required to expand innovative models of care, as well as to improve the quality, acce ssibility, and value of care, through nursing. The committee emphasizes that the synergistic implementation of all of its recommendations as a whole will be necessary to truly transform the nursing profession into one that is capable of leading change to advance the nation's health. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1: Remove scope-of-practice barriers. Advanced practice registered nurses should be able to practice to th e full extent of their education and training. To achieve this goal, the committee recommends the following actions. For the Congress: Expand the Medicare program to include covera ge of advanced prac tice registered nurse services that are within the scope of practice under appl icable state law, just as physician services are now covered. Amend the Medicare program to authorize advanced practice registered nurses to perform admission assessments, as well as certif ication of patients for home health care services and for admission to hospice and skilled nursing facilities. Extend the increase in Medi caid reimbursement rates for primary care physicians included in the ACA to advanced practice registered nurses providing similar primary care services. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlRECOMMENDATIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES 7-9 Limit federal funding for nursing education pr ograms to programs in states that have adopted the National Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice registered nurse model rules and regulations (Article XVIII, Chapter 18). For state legislatures: Reform scope-of-practice regulations to conf orm to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice registered nurse model rules and regulations (Article XVIII, Chapter 18). Require third-party payers th at participate in fee-for-service payment arrangements to provide direct reimbursement to advanced pr actice registered nurses who are practicing within their scope of practice under state law. For the Centers for Medicar e and Medicaid Services: Amend or clarify the requirements for hospita l participation in the Medicare program to ensure that advanced practice registered nurses are eligible for clinical privileges, admitting privileges, and membership on medical staff. For the Office of Personnel Management: Require insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to include coverage of those services of advan ced practice registered nurses that are within their scope of practice unde r applicable state law. For the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrus t Division of the Department of Justice: Review existing and proposed state regulati ons concerning advanced practice registered nurses to identify those that have anticomp etitive effects without contributing to the health and safety of the public. States with unduly restrictive regula tions should be urged to amend them to allow advanced practice registered nurses to provide care to patients in all circumstances in which th ey are qualified to do so.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html7-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Recommendation 2: Expand opportunities for nurses to lead and diffuse collaborative improvement efforts. Private and public funders, health ca re organizations, nursing education programs, and nursing associations should expan d opportunities for nurses to lead and manage collaborative efforts with physicians and other me mbers of the health care team to conduct research and to redesign and improve practice en vironments and health sy stems. These entities should also provide opportunities for nu rses to diffuse successful practices. To this end: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid I nnovation should support the development and evaluation of models of payment and care de livery that use nurses in an expanded and leadership capacity to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. Performance measures should be developed and implemented expediti ously where best prac tices are evident to reflect the contributions of nurses and ensure bette r-quality care. Private and public funders should collaborate, and when possible pool funds, to advance research on models of care and innovative solutions, including technology, that will enable nurses to contribute to im proved health and health care. Health care organizations should support and help nurses in taking the lead in developing and adopting innovative, patie nt-centered care models. Health care organizations should engage nurse s and other front-line staff to work with developers and manufacturers in the design, development, purchase, implementation, and evaluation of medical and health devices a nd health information technology products. Nursing education programs and nursing asso ciations should provide entrepreneurial professional development that will enable nurses to initiate programs and businesses that will contribute to improved health and health care. Recommendation 3: Implement nurse residency programs. State boards of nursing, accrediting bodies, the federal gov ernment, and health care organiza tions should take actions to support nurses' completion of a transition-to-prac tice program (nurse residency) after they have completed a prelicensure or advanced practice degree program or when they are transitioning into new clinical practice areas. The following actions should be taken to impl ement and support nurse residency programs: State boards of nursing, in collaboration w ith accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission and the Community Health Accr editation Program, should support nurses' completion of a residency program after they have completed a prelicensure or advanced practice degree program or when they are tr ansitioning into new clinical practice areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should redirect all graduate medical education funding from diploma nursing progr ams to support the implementation of nurse residency programs in rural and critical access areas. Health care organizations, the Health Resources and Servi ces Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and philanthropic organizations should fund the development and implementation of nurse resi dency programs across all practice settings.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlRECOMMENDATIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES 7-11 Health care organizations that offer nu rse residency programs and foundations should evaluate the effectiveness of the residency programs in impr oving the retention of nurses, expanding competencies, and improving patient outcomes. Recommendation 4: Increase the proportion of nurses with a baccalaureate degree to 80 percent by 2020. Academic nurse leaders across all school s of nursing should work together to increase the proportion of nurses with a bacca laureate degree from 50 to 80 percent by 2020. These leaders should partner with education accrediting bodies , private and public funders, and employers to ensure funding, monitor progress, and increase the diversity of students to create a workforce prepared to meet the demands of diverse populations across the lifespan. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, working in collaboration with the National League for Nursing Accrediting Co mmission, should require all nursing schools to offer defined academic pathways, beyond articulation agreements, that promote seamless access for nurses to higher levels of education. Health care organizations should encourage nurses with associate's and diploma degrees to enter baccalaureate nursi ng programs within 5 years of graduation by offering tuition reimbursement, creating a culture that fosters continuing education, and providing a salary differential and promotion. Private and public funders should collaborate, and when possible pool funds, to expand baccalaureate programs to enroll more students by offering scholarships and loan forgiveness, hiring more faculty, expanding clinical instruction through new clinical partnerships, and using technology to augment instruction. These efforts should take into consideration strategies to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, a nd geographic distribution. The U.S. Secretary of Education, other fede ral agencies including the Health Resources and Services Administration, and state and private funders shoul d expand loans and grants for second-degree nursing students. Schools of nursing, in collaboration with other health prof essional schools, should design and implement early and c ontinuous interprofessional collaboration through joint classroom and clinical training opportunities. Academic nurse leaders should partner with health care organizations, leaders from primary and secondary school systems, and ot her community organizations to recruit and advance diverse nursing students.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html7-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Recommendation 5: Double the number of nurses with a doctorate by 2020. Schools of nursing, with support from privat e and public funders, academic administrators and university trustees, and accrediting bodies , should double the number of nurse s with a doctorate by 2020 to add to the cadre of nurse faculty and research ers, with attention to increasing diversity. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Educat ion and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission shoul d monitor the progress of each accredited nursing school to ensure that at least 10 per cent of all baccalaureate graduate s matriculate into a master's or doctoral program within 5 years of graduation. Private and public funders, incl uding the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Department of Labor, should expand funding for programs offering accelerated graduate degrees for nurses to increase the production of master's and doctoral nurse graduates and to increase the diversity of nurse faculty and researchers. Academic administrators and university tr ustees should create salary and benefit packages that are market competitive to recr uit and retain highly qualified academic and clinical nurse faculty. Recommendation 6: Ensure that nurses engage in lifelong learning. Accrediting bodies, schools of nursing, health care organizations, and continuing competency educators from multiple health professions should collaborate to ensure that nurses and nursing students and faculty continue their education and engage in li felong learning to gain the competencies needed to provide care for diverse populations across the lifespan. Faculty should partner with health care organizations to de velop and prioritize competencies so curricula can be updated regular ly to ensure that graduates at all levels are prepared to meet the current and future health needs of the population. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Educat ion and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission shoul d require that all nursi ng students demonstrate a comprehensive set of clinical performance competencies that encompass the knowledge and skills needed to provide care across settings and the lifespan. Academic administrators should require a ll faculty to participate in continuing professional development and to perform with cutting-edge competence in practice, teaching, and research. All health care organizations and schools of nursing should foster a culture of lifelong learning and provide resources for interprofessional continuing competency programs. Health care organizations and other organi zations that offer continuing competency programs should regularly evaluate their programs for adapta bility, flexibility, accessibility, and impact on clinical outcomes and update the programs accordingly.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlRECOMMENDATIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES 7-13 Recommendation 7: Prepare and enable nurses to lead change to advance health. Nurses, nursing education programs, and nursing associati ons should prepare the nursing workforce to assume leadership positions across all levels, while public, private, and governmental health care decision makers should ensure that leade rship positions are avai lable to and filled by nurses. Nurses should take responsibility for their personal and professional growth by continuing their education and seeking opportunities to develop and exercise their leadership skills. Nursing associations should provide leadersh ip development, mentoring programs, and opportunities to lead for all their members. Nursing education programs should integrate leadership theory and business practices across the curriculum, including clinical practice. Public, private, and governmental health care decision makers at every level should include representation from nursing on boards, on executive management teams, and in other key leadership positions. Recommendation 8: Build an infrastructure for the collection and analysis of interprofessional health care workforce data. The National Health Care Workforce Commission, with oversight from the Governm ent Accountability Office and the Health Resources and Services Administ ration, should lead a collaborative effort to improve research and the collection and analysis of data on health care workforce require ments. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should collaborate with state licensing boards, state nursing work force centers, and the Department of Labor in this effort to ensure that the data are timely and publicly accessible. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should coordinate with state licensing boa rds, including those fo r nursing, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, to develop and prom ulgate a standardized minimum data set across states and professions that can be us ed to assess health care workforce needs by demographics, numbers, skill mix, and geographic distribution. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should set standards for the co llection of the minimum data set by state licensing boards; oversee, coordinate, and house the data; a nd make the data publicly accessible. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should retain, but bolster, the Health Resources and Services Admini stration's registered nurse sample survey by increasing the sample size, fielding the survey every other year, expanding the data collected on advanced practic e registered nurses, and releasing survey results more quickly. The Workforce Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration should establish a monitoring system that uses the most current anal ytic approaches and data from the minimum data set to systema tically measure and project nursing workforce requirements by role, skill mix, region, and demographics.

The broad scope of this 13-month study included an examination of public and private policies at the national, state, and local levels. The recommendations presented in this report identify vital roles for nurses in designing and implementing a transformed health care system that provides Americans with high-quality care that is accessible, affordable, patient centered, and evidence based. To provide a comprehensive response to its charge, the committee tapped the wide-ranging expertise of its members and reviewed data from a variety of sources, including recent literature; data and reports from the Nursing Research Network, su pported by RWJF; public and stakeholder input gathered through a series of technical workshops and public forums; site visits to a variety of health care settings where nurses do their work; and commissioned papers on selected topics. EXPERTISE The committee was composed of 18 members with expertise and experience in diverse areas, including nursing, federal and st ate administration and regulati ons, hospital and health plan administration, business administration, health in formation and technology, public health, health services research, health polic y, workforce research and policy, and economics. On occasion, the committee identified areas related to its charge th at required specialized knowledge and expertise not available within its membership, such as spec ific areas of law, scope -of-practice regulations, nursing research methods and data analysis, and health policy. In such cases, the committee called upon the foremost experts in those fields to serve as cons ultants and advisors during its deliberations (see the acknowledgmen ts section of the report for a list of these individuals). In addition, the committee benefited from resources ma de available through the unique partnership between the IOM and RWJF, which allowed for bo rrowed-staff agreements that provided the committee with additional expertise from RWJF on nursing, nursing research, and communications. This partnership also facilitated the availabili ty of additional information resources that were provided through AARP's Center for Championing Nursing in America and AcademyHealth. LITERATURE REVIEW Over the course of the study, the committee receiv ed and reviewed a wide range of literature from a variety of sources that was relevant to all aspects of its char ge. Staff monitored key developments related to nursing, including newly published literatu re and legislative activity on both on the federal and state levels, with input from the Center to Champion Nursing in America, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS A-1 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlA-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH the NRN (described below), and GYMR public relations. Each committee meeting and public forum provided an opportunity for distinguished experts to submit arti cles and reports relevant to their presentations. Finally, committee members and the public were invited to submit articles and reports that would further support the committ ee's work. In total, the committee's database of relevant documents included almost 400 articles and reports. Nursing is a frequently studied profession. Since the 1923 release of the Goldmark Report, funded by the Rockefeller Founda tion, hundreds of public and private commissions and task forces have examined many facets of the profe ssion, including its education system, diversity, scope of practice, workforce capacity, and relations hip to other health professions and the public (Goldmark, 1923). The primary driver for this interest in the profe ssion is nurses' essential role in caring for the sick and supporting the well. A nu mber of factors affect the implementation of recommendations contained in previous reports, such as the exclusion of nurses from their production; the failure of the profe ssion itself, through a lack of either resources or political will, to act on the recommendations; or the failure to redirect the focus from nurses to what is necessary to improve patient care. Additional factors, such as context, time, and place, also influence the success of a study and the im plementation of its recommendations. Since 1997, the IOM has produced at least 20 reports or workshop summaries related directly or indirectly to the nursing profession. They all share at le ast four common themes: nurses are a critical factor in health care be cause they are the closest to and spend the most time with patients; nurses need the skills and knowledge to keep patients safe and help them stay healthy or recover from illness; new models of care should be developed to better utilize nurses' skills and knowledge while improving patient care and decreas ing costs; and patients receive better care when nurses and other health professionals work together effectively. Th e last broad-based study of the nursing profession published by the IOM was Nursing and Nursing Education: Public Policies and Private Actions (IOM, 1983). More recen tly, the IOM published Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Environment of Nurses (IOM, 2004). This report describes strategies for improving nurses' work envi ronments and responding to the overwhelming demands they often face, with the ultimate goal of improving the safety and quality of care. As the committee was conducting this study, a number of additional reports about nursing and nursing education, in particular , were released. Four months prior to the launch of the study, Prime Minister Gordon Brown charged a commissi on in England to examine the future of nursing and midwifery. The commission's report, Front Line Care: The Future of Nursing and Midwifery in England (Prime Minister's Commission on the Fu ture of Nursing and Midwifery in England, 2010) states that nurses and midwives have great potentia l to influence health and must renew their pledge to society to deliver high-quality, compassionate care, and that they must be well supported to do so. A report releas ed by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, Who Will Provide Primary Care and How Will They Be Trained? (Cronenwett and Dza u, 2010), likewise suggests that nurses are well positioned to improve hea lth and recommends that any barriers preventing nurse practitioners from serving as primary car e providers or leading models of primary care delivery be removed. Several reports emphasize that continuing education is crucial if nurses, and other health professionals, are to deliver high-quality and safe care throughout their careers. They include Continuing Education in the Health Professi ons: Improving Healthcare Through Lifelong Learning (Hager et al., 2008), another report from the Macy Foundation; the IOM's Redesigning Continuing Education in the Health Professions (IOM, 2009); and Lifelong Learning in Medicine and Nursing (AACN and AAMC, 2010), which was cosponsored by the American PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlMETHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES A-3 Association of Colleges of Nurs ing and the Association of Amer ican Medical Colleges. A report specifically addressing the initia l education of nurses, published by Dr. Patricia Benner and her team at the Carnegie Foundation, Educating Nurses: A Call for Radical Transformation (Benner et al., 2009), calls for a more highly educated nursing workforce, recommending that all entry- level registered nurses (RNs) be prepared at the baccalaureate level and that all RNs earn at least a master's degree within 10 years of initial licensure. RWJF NURSING RESEARCH NETWORK To increase the amount, relevance, and accessibi lity of research availa ble to the committee, RWJF launched a parallel project called the Nurs ing Research Network (NRN) that generated, synthesized, and disseminated a broad range of research findings. These products both anticipated the committee's information needs and were responsive to requests made by committee members throughout the study process. Many of these products informed the committee's discussions of the pr esent and future of nursing. Lori Melichar served as research director for the NRN initiative. She supervised the NRN and led efforts to prioritize a research agenda that would meet the committee's information needs. The majority of the NRN's research act ivities were led and conducted by four research managers from across the country who served as consultants to the committee: Linda Aiken, University of Pennsylvania; Peter Buerhaus, Va nderbilt University; Christine Kovner, New York University; and Joanne Spetz, University of California, San Francisco. Additional researchers and experts were engaged to fill gaps as n eeded. The production and de livery of NRN products, including reports, research briefs , charts, tables, and commentaries , were coordinated by Patricia (Polly) Pittman, of AcademyHealth and subsequently The George Washington University, and her staff. The NRN began by providing the committee with a foundational set of 20 articles in the following areas of nursing policy: chronic and long-term care, education policy, expansion of access to primary care, foreign-educated nurses, human resource management (including nurse turnover rates), improvement of quality and safety (including workforce environment and staffing issues), prevention and wellness, prom otion of health information technology, cost containment, and workforce estimations. To date , the NRN has produced 6 reports, 48 charts and tables, and 13 research briefs. A broad range of topics has been covered, including estimates of supply and demand, scope of practice, faculty shor tages, career ladders, pa yment systems, health information technology, and physicia n and patient perceptions of nursing care. All of these products will be available to the public thr ough either RWJF's website or peer-reviewed publications.

To obtain additional information on specific aspects of the study charge, the committee included in three of its meetings technical workshops that were open to the public and held three public forums on the future of nursing and the role of nurses across various settings. Subject matter experts were invited to these publ ic sessions to present informa tion and recommendations for the committee's consideration, answer the committee' s questions, and participate in subsequent discussions. The three technical workshops were held in conjunction with the committee's July, September, and November 2009 meetings. The purpose of these workshops was to gather information on specified topics. The committee de termined the topics and speakers based on its information needs. The first meeting included a review and discussion of the committee's charge with the study's sponsor, RWJF; an overview an d description of the cu rrent nursing workforce and future workforce needs; and an introduction to the NRN and the resources that would be made available to the committee through the network. The second workshop was intended to provide an overview of the Prime Ministe r's Commission on the Future of Nursing and Midwifery and the efforts in England to transform the nursing profession; a discussion of possible ways for the nursing profession to fulfill its promise; and a review of ongoing health care reform efforts in the United States. The thir d workshop looked at nurses' role in addressing disparities; ways to ensure quality, access, and value in heal th care; and reimbursement and financing of care delivered by nurses. The agenda s for these three workshops are provided in Boxes A-1 through A-3 at the end of this appendix. The three public forums were held in locations across the United States to engage a broader range of stakeholders and the public. The first, held in October 2009 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, focused on quality and safety, technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration in acute care settings. The s econd, held in December 2009 at the Community College of Philadelphia, featured presentations and discussion of achievements and challenges in care in the community and focused on community health, public health, primary care, and long- term care. The final forum, held in February 2010 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, featured discussi on of three topics in nursing edu cation: what to teach, how to teach, and where to teach. Summaries of each of these forums were published separately and are available on the CD-ROM in the back of this re port. The agendas for these forums are provided in Boxes A-4 through A-6 at the end of this appe ndix, and highlights from the forums appear in Appendix C. In preparation for each of the forums and to augment the information gathered from presenters and discussants, the committee solicited written testimony through an online questionnaire (see Boxes A-7 through A-9 at the end of this appendix for the specific questions that were asked). The public and key stakehol ders were invited to provide information on innovations, models, barriers, and opportunities for each of the topics covered at the forums, as well as their vision for the future of nursing overall. The committee received more than 200 submissions of testimony during the course of the study; many of the individuals who submitted this testimony also presented it at the forums. Each forum also included an open microphone session for ad hoc testimony and input from particip ants on a variety of topics relevant to the forum discussions.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlMETHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES A-5 SITE VISITS In conjunction with each forum, small groups of committee members participated in a series of site visits. These visits highlighted a wide range of settings in which nurses work, as well as their various roles. The sites visited included acu te care units in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center\u2014 ranging from critical care units to the emergency department a nd surgical units to child and maternal health and obstetrics units; community health settings in Philadelphia\u2014ranging from a school-based health center to public health c linics and nurse-managed health centers; and education settings in Houston, where committee me mbers saw demonstrations of high-fidelity simulation laboratories and partic ipated in discussions of in terprofessional education and educating for quality control. Committee members also talked with nurses, other care providers, and administrators about the challenges nurses encounter daily in their work in these varied settings. Observations made during these site vi sits informed some of the questions committee members asked speakers at the forums and provided real-world perspectives of seasoned professionals. COMMISSIONED PAPERS The committee commissioned a series of papers fr om experts in subject areas relevant to its statement of task. These papers, included as Appendixes E I on the CD-ROM in the back of this report, were intended to provide in-depth information on five selected topics: A paper written by Barbara L. Nichols, Cath erine R. Davis, and Donna R. Richardson from CGFNS International reviews the ways in which other countries educate, regulate, and utilize nurses. This paper also addre sses the migration and globalization of the nursing workforce and implications for education, service delivery, a nd health policy in the United States. A paper by Barbara J. Safriet describes federal options for maximizing the value of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) in providing quality and cost-effective health care. It includes a review of current mechanisms of payment and financing of services and impediments in the regulatory environment for APRNs, and offers an assessment of policy initiatives that could improve the value of APRNs. A paper written by Julie Sochalski of the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Weiner of The Johns Hopkins University ex amines the nursing workforce and possible shortages in the context of a reformed h ealth care system. It examines trends and projections for the workforce, drawbacks of current approaches to assessing the workforce, opportunities and chal lenges of new workforce approaches, and implications for policy. One paper was presented as a series of brie fs that provides examples of transformative models of nursing across a variety of setti ngs and locales. This paper was compiled and edited by Linda Norlander of the University of California, San Fran cisco, and features collaborative briefs written by 27 fellows of the RWJF Executive Nurse Leadership Program. The briefs cover topics in educa tion, acute care, chronic disease management, palliative and end-of-life care, comm unity health, school-based partnerships.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlC Highlights from the Forums on the Future of Nursing Throughout course of the Robert Wood Johnson In itiative on the Future of Nursing, at the Institute of Medicine (IOM), th e Initiative hoste d three public forums on the future of nursing. These forums were designed to inform the com mittee about the critical and varied roles that nurses play across settings and we re part of a much broader information-gathering effort by the IOM committee and staff, which is discussed in greater detail in A ppendix A. The forums provided an opportunity for members of the co mmittee to hear from a range of experts, stakeholders, and members of the public and to s ee, first-hand, the challe nges and innovations in settings where nurses provide care and are educate d. The three forums were held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Houston and focused on acute care, care in the community, and education, respectively. Prior to the forums a variety of stakeholders and the public were invited to submit written testimony to the committee in areas relevant to the forums. Those submitting written testimony were asked to share their insight and describe innovative models in these areas; barriers that nurses face in delivering care or advancing the pr ofession; how nurses could be further involved in advancing these areas; and their vision for th e future of nursing. Each of the forums was webcasted live to a much larger national audien ce. Additionally, participan ts at the forum were encouraged to share their thoughts and reactions to the di scussion through open microphone sessions, as well as social media tools such Facebook and Twitter. Each of the three forums was planned with the guidance of a sub-group of the committee, which was led by a planning-group ch air; Robert Reischauer chai red the planning group for the acute care forum in Los Angeles, Jennie Chin Ha nsen led the planning gro up for the care in the community forum in Philadelphia, and Michael Bl eich served as chair for the planning group for the education forum in Houston. The half-day forums were not meant to be an exhaustive examination of all settings in which nurses practice nor an exhaustiv e examination of the complexity of the nursing profession as a whol e. Given the limited amount of time for each of the three forums, a comprehensive review of all f acets and all players of each of the main forum themes was not possible. Rather, the forums were meant to inform the committee on important topics within the nursing profession and to hi ghlight some of the key challenges, barriers, opportunities, and innovations that nurses are co nfronted with while working in an evolving health care system. Many of the critical cha llenges, barriers, opportuni ties, and innovations discussed at the forums overlap across settings and throughout the nursin g profession and also are applicable to other health providers and individuals who work with nurses. The following sections of this appendix offer brief summaries and highlights from each of the three forums on the future of nursing: acute care, care in the co mmunity, and education. Appendix A of this report incl udes the agendas for the forums, and the full text of the forum summaries are available at www.iom.edu/nursing and are also included on the CD-ROM in the back cover of this report.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlC-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH ACUTE CARE The Initiative on the Future of Nursing held its first forum on October 19, 2009, at Cedars- Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. This fo rum was designed to explore the challenges and opportunities for nurses in acute care settings an d the changes needed to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of patient care. The forum focused on thre e topics within the context of acute care: quality and safety, te chnology, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Acute care settings were particularly important for the committee to examine, because well over half of all nurses work in acute care settings, where th ey are patients' primary, professional caregivers and the individuals most likely to intercept me dical errors. However, because hospital systems and acute care settings are often complex and chaotic, many nurses spend unnecessary time hunting for supplies, filling out paperwork, and c oordinating staff time and patient care, reducing the time they are able to spend with patients and delivering care. Nearly 300 people attended the acute care foru m and heard presentati ons and discussions with 30 experts, including welcoming remarks from Thomas Priselac, president and chief executive officer of the Cedars-Sinai Health Syst em and chair of the Board of Directors for the American Hospital Associati on, and a keynote presentation fro m Dr. Marilyn Chow, vice president of National Patient Ca re Services at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, CA. During the forum, 19 individuals offered testimony for th e committee's consideratio n. These individuals provided organizational and personal perspectives on the future of nur sing in acute care settings. Key Themes The presentations offered the committee with in sight into the important role that frontline nurses play across acute care settings, as well as the challenges and barriers that these frontline nurses face in their daily work. It was apparent from the presentations that there are a number of successful and promising innovative models being used in acute care settings across the country. However, these models are infrequently transfe rred widely. The discussion at the forum provided the committee with an opportunity to c onsider how rapidly advancing technology, interdisciplinary relationships, and changes in the way acute care is delivered will affect the nursing profession and how nurses will need to be educated to be adequately prepared for their varying roles and responsibilities. A number of important points emerged at the forum: The knowledge of frontline nurses that they gather from their interactions with patients is critical to reducing medical erro rs and improving patient outcomes. Involving nurses at a variety of levels acr oss the acute care setting in decision making and leadership benefits the patient, improve s the organizations in which nurses practice, and strengthens the health care system in general. Increasing the time that nurses can spend at the bedside is an e ssential component of achieving the goal of patient-centered care. High-quality acute care settings require integrated systems that use technology effectively while increasing the efficiency of nurses and affording them increased time to spend with patients. Multidisciplinary care teams characterized by extensive and respectful collaboration among team members improve the quality, safety, and effectiveness of care.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE FORUMS ON THE FUTURE OF NURSING C-3 Many of the innovations that need to be impl emented in the health care system already exist somewhere in the United States, but barrie rs to their dissemination keep them from being adopted more widely. As Dr. Marilyn C how observed, \"the future is here, it just isn't everywhere.\" Site Visits and Solutions Session In the morning before the forum began, indi vidual committee members participated in a series of site visits to a variety of acute care units within Cedars-Sin ai Medical Center. They spoke with nurses, other care providers, and admi nistrators about the ch allenges nurses encounter in their work in acute care settings. The units th at were visited within the Medical Center ranged from critical care, emergency department, and surgical units to child and maternal health and obstetrics units. Following the site visits and the forum, a gro up of RWJF scholars and fellows,1 who had attended the forum and participated in the site visits, met to consider solutions and the most promising future roles for nurses in acute ca re settings with respect to the subthemes of quality and safety, technology, and interdisciplin ary collaboration. A summary of this session was provided to the committee for its review and consideration at the committee's subsequent meeting in November 2009. CARE IN THE COMMUNITY On December 3, 2009, the Initiative on the Future of Nursing held its second forum at the Community College of Philadelphia. This forum examined the challenges facing the nursing profession with regard to care in the community, including asp ects of community health, public health, primary care, and long-term care. Me mbers of the committee planning group for this forum believed that these topics were especially important to the committee's work overall; as the health care system evolves, the provision of care is incr easingly occurring in non-acute settings and is increasingly focused on disease prevention, health promotion, and management of chronic illnesses. Nurses who practice in comm unity settings are vital to ensuring access to quality care. More than 200 forum attendees heard a series of presentations from leaders in the field, including opening remarks from Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell and a keynote from Mary C. Selecky, Secretary of Washington State's Department of Health (an agenda for this forum can be found in Appendix A). During the forum, committee members also heard testimony from 15 individuals representing a wi de variety of organizations and personal viewpoints, as well as remarks made by a number of forum participants as part of an open- microphone session. 1 RWJF works to build human capital by supporting individuals who seek to advance health and health care in America. RWJF invited alumni of seventeen of its scholar , fellow, and leader programs to participate in the Forum on the Future of Nursing. The alumni came from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, including academia, service delivery, research, policy, and health plan administration. Many of the participants were alumni of the RWJF Executive Nurse Fellows Prog ram and the RWJF Nurse Faculty Scholars Program. Non-nurse participants included alumni of the Investigator Award Program, the RWJF Health Policy Fellows Program, and the RWJF Clinical Scholar Program.

As a resu lt of this forum, the committee was given an opportunity to consider how changing health needs in the community will affect the future of the nursing profession in terms of the way care is delivered, the setti ngs in which care is provided, and the education requirements for the necessary skills and competencies to provide quality care. Many important messages emerged from the pres entations, discussions, and site visits, including the following: Budgets for public health and community hea lth programs are being cut at a time when these programs are needed most to care fo r aging populations and when greater emphasis is being placed on prevention, wellness, ch ronic disease management, and moving care into the community. Nursing in the community occurs through part nerships with many ot her individuals and organizations, and nurses need to take a l eadership role in establishing these vital partnerships. Fostering this type of collabo ration could improve the continuum of care between acute and community care settings. Technology has the poten tial to transform the lives of nurses providing care in the community, as well as their patients, just as it is transforming commerce, education, communications, and entertainment for the public. Varying scopes of practice across states ha ve, in some cases, prevented nurses from providing care to the fullest extent possible at the community level. Nurse-managed health clinics offer opport unities to expand access; provide quality, evidence-based care; and improve outcome s for individuals w ho may not otherwise receive needed care. These clinics also provide the necessary support to engage individuals in wellness a nd prevention activities. Nursing students need to have greater e xposure to principles of community care, leadership, and care provision through change s in nursing school curricula and increased opportunities to gain experience in community care settings. The delivery of quality nursing care has the potential to provide value across community settings and can be achieved though effectiv e leadership, policy, and accountability. Site Visits and Solutions Session Prior to the forum, several members of th e IOM committee visited a number of community- based health centers across Philadelphia. The six Philadelphia sites visited by committee members and the RWJF fellows and scholars were the Living Independently for Elders (LIFE) program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, the Sayre High School School- Based Health Clinic, Community Health Center #3 of the Philadelphia Department of Health, Health Annex, Health Connections, and the 11th Street Family Health Services of Drexel University. Concluding the day's events, RWJF fellows and scholars reviewed what they had heard at the forum and seen duri ng the site visits to develop a set of recommendations for the committee's consideration that were relevant to the delivery of nursing care in the community; PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE FORUMS ON THE FUTURE OF NURSING C-5 highlights from the solutions session were pr ovided to the committee at its January 2010 meeting. EDUCATION On February 22, 2010, the Initiative held its fi nal forum on the future of nursing at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. This forum was designed to examine challenges and opportunitie s associated with nursing e ducation. The nursing education system consists of multifaceted educational pa thways with a mixture of starting points and opportunities for advancement to higher levels. This complex system is responsible for educating and training future generations of nursed that are prepared and able to meet the needs of diverse populations across the lifespan in a health care system that is constantly evolving. This forum on the future of nursing featured welcoming remarks from Dr. John Lumpkin of RWJF and Dr. John Mendelsohn of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and included three armchair discussions that were each led by a moderator from the committee. The armchair discussions focused on three broad, overl apping subjects: what to teach, how to teach, and where to teach (an agenda for this fo rum can be found in Appendix A). More than 300 people assembled in Houston to listen to the discussion and participate in the forum, and an additional 330 registered for the forum's live webcast. During the forum 12 participants presented formal testimony to the committee, while several more participants offered ad hoc remarks and insight during an open-microphone se ssion that concluded th e discussion at the forum. Key Themes The armchair discussions clearly illustrated the challenges of educating and developing a nursing workforce that can achieve the delicate balance among advancing science, translating and applying research, caring for individuals and families across all settings, and providing leadership. The committee heard about the sh ortcomings of the educational pipeline and infrastructure that have resulted in a defici ency in the number of nurses completing advanced degrees and moving into faculty positions, which in turn contributes to the limited the capacity of the system. Armchair discussants offered a glimps e of the future of nursing education as they described strategies, innovative models, and tech nologies that are being implemented across the country to expand the capacity of the educati on system and to better prepare nursing graduates with the competencies and skills required to co nfront the challenges they will encounter in practice settings throughout their careers. Several important points emerged from the forum: Collaboration, communication, and systems thinki ng should be the new basics in nursing education. Nurses, particularly nurse educators, need to keep up with a rapidly changing knowledge base and new technologies thr oughout their careers to ensure a well-educated workforce. Care for older adults, increasingly occurring out side of acute care settings, will be a large and growing component of nursing in the futu re, and the nursing education system needs to prepare educators and pract itioners for that reality.

Technology\u2014such as that used in high-fideli ty simulations\u2014that fosters problem-solving and critical thinking skills in nurses will be esse ntial for nursing education to produce sufficient numbers of competent, well-trained nurses. Nursing education needs to make use of re sources and partnerships available in the community to prepare nurses who can serve their communities. Articulation agreements and education consor tiums among different kinds of institutions can provide multiple entry points and conti nued opportunities for progression through an educational and career ladder. In addition to necessary skill sets, nursing education needs to provide students with the ability to mature as professionals and to continue learning throughout their careers. Sites Visits and Solutions Session Following the forum, committee members participated in visits to one of three sites in Houston: the University of Texas Health Science Center at H ouston School of Nursing (UTH), Texas Woman's University (TWU), or the Na tional Aeronautics a nd Space Administration (NASA). During the site visits, committee members had the opportunity to converse with nursing students, educators, administrators, a nd experts in training fo r quality, safety, and collaboration about some of the i nnovative strategies that are bei ng used to better educate nurses. Some of the models described included us e of: distance learning and accelerated doctoral programs; advanced technology in educational settings and interdisciplin ary education programs; and training for quality and safety, collaborati on in a team environment, and continuing education. The site visits also offered a number of demonstrations such as a physical assessment lab using retired physicians as e ducators, students working in high-fidelity simulation labs, and a nurse-managed clinic. After the completion of the forum and the site visits, a group of RWJF scholars and fellows, who had attended both activities, met to discus s possible solutions and the most promising directions for the future nursi ng education with respect to wh at should be taught, how it should be taught, and where it should be taught. A summar y of this session and the solutions suggested was provided to the committee for its review a nd consideration at the committee's subsequent meeting in April 2010.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlD-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH INTRODUCTION Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) have expanded in numbers and capabilities over the past several decades with APRNs being highly valued and an inte gral part of the health care system. Because of the importance of APRNs in car ing for the current and future health needs of patients, the education, a ccreditation, certification and licensure of APRNs need to be effectively aligned in order to continue to ensure patient safety while expanding patient access to APRNs. APRNs include certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse pr actitioners. Each has a unique hist ory and context, but shares the commonality of being APRNs. While educati on, accreditation, and certifi cation are necessary components of an overall approach to prepari ng an APRN for practice, the licensing boards- governed by state regulations and statutes-are the final arbiters of who is recognized to practice within a given state. Currently, there is no uniform model of regula tion of APRNs across the states. Each state independently determines the APRN legal scope of practice, the roles that are recognized, the criteria for entr y-into advanced practice and the certification examinations accepted for entry-level competence assessment. This has created a significant barrier for APRNs to easily move from state to state and has decreased access to care for patients. Many nurses with advanced gradua te nursing preparation practice in roles and specialties e.g., informatics, public health, education, or administration) that are essential to advance the health of the public but do not focus on direct care to individuals and, therefore, their practice does not require regulatory recognition beyond the Register ed Nurse license granted by state boards of nursing. Like the four current APRN roles, practice in these other advanced specialty nursing roles requires speciali zed knowledge and skills acquired th rough graduate-level education. Although extremely important to th e nursing profession and to the de livery of safe, high quality patient care, these other advanced, graduate nurs ing roles, which do not focus on direct patient care, are not roles for Advanced Practice Register ed Nurses (APRN) and are not the subject or focus of the Regulatory Model presented in this paper. The model for APRN regulation is the product of substantial work conducted by the Advanced Practice Nursing Consensus Work Group and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) APRN Committee. While these groups bega n work independent of each other, they came together through representatives of each group participating in what was labeled the APRN Joint Dialogue Group. The outcome of this work has been unanimous agreement on most of the recommendations included in this document. In a few instances, when agreement was not unanimous a 66% majority was used to determin e the final recommendation. However, extensive dialogue and transparency in the decision-making process is reflected in each recommendation. The background of each group can be found on pages 13-16 and individual and organizational participants in each group in Appendices C-H. This document defines APRN practice, describe s the APRN regulatory model, identifies the titles to be used, defines specia lty, describes the emergence of new roles and population foci, and presents strategies for implementation. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlNCSBN CONSENSUS MODEL D-7 Overview of APRN Model of Regulation The APRN Model of Regulation described will be the model of the future. It is recognized that current regulation of APRNs does not reflect all of the components described in this paper and will evolve incrementally over time. A proposed tim eline for implementation is presented at the end of the paper. In this APRN model of regulati on there are four roles: certifie d registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), certified nurse-midwife (CNM), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), and certified nurse practitioner (CNP). These four roles are given th e title of advanced practice registered nurse (APRN). APRNs are educated in one of the four roles and in at least one of six population foci: family/individual across the lifespan, adult- gerontology, pediatrics, neonatal, psych/mental health. APRN education programs, including degree-granting and post-gradua te education programs 2, are accredited. APRN education consists of a broad-based education, including three separate graduate-level courses in advanced physiology/pathophysiology, health assessment and pha rmacology as well as appropriate clinical experiences. All developing APRN education progra ms or tracks go through a pre-approval, pre- accreditation, or accreditation process prior to admitting students. APRN education programs must be housed within graduate programs that are nationally accredited 3 and their graduates must be eligible for national certif ication used for state licensure. Individuals who have the appropria te education will sit for a certi fication examination to assess national competencies of the APRN core, role and at least one population focus area of practice for regulatory purposes. APRN certification programs will be accredited by a national certification accrediting body 4. APRN certification programs will require a continued competency mechanism. Individuals will be licensed as independent practitio ners for practice at the level of one of the four APRN roles within at least one of the si x identified populati on foci. Education, certification, and licensure of an individual must be congruent in terms of role and population foci. APRNs may specialize but they cannot be licensed solely within a specialty area. In addition, specialties can provide depth in one's pr actice within the established population foci. Education and assessment strategies for speci alty areas will be developed by the nursing profession, i.e., nursing organizations and special in terest groups. Education for a specialty can occur concurrently with APRN education required for licensu re or through post-graduate education. Competence at the specialty level wi ll not be assessed or regulated by boards of nursing but rather by the prof essional organizations. 2 Degree granting programs include master's and doctoral programs. Post-graduate programs include both post- master's and post-doctoral ce rtificate education programs. 3 APRN programs must be accredited by a nursi ng accrediting organization that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) and/or the Council fo r Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), including the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC), Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA), Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education (ACME), and the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health Council on Accreditation. 4 The certification program should be nationally accredited by the American Board of Nursing Specialties (ABNS) or the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlD-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH In addition, a mechanism that enhances th e communication and tran sparency among APRN licensure, accreditation, certifi cation and education bodies (LACE) will be developed and supported. APRN REGULATORY MODEL APRN Regulation includes the essential elements: licensure, accreditation, certification and education (LACE). Licensure is the granting of authority to practice. Accreditation is the formal review and appr oval by a recognized agency of educational degree or certification programs in nursing or nursing-related programs. Certification is the formal recognition of the knowledge, skills, and experience demonstrated by the achievement of st andards identified by the profession. Education is the formal prep aration of APRNs in graduate degree-granting or post- graduate certificate programs. The APRN Regulatory Model applies to all elements of LACE. Each of these elements plays an essential part in the implementation of the model. Definition of Advanced Pr actice Registered Nurse Characteristics of the advanced practice regist ered nurse (APRN) were identified and several definitions of an APRN were considered, including the NCSBN and the American Nurses Association (ANA) definitions, as well as others. The characteris tics identified aligned closely with these existing definitions. The definition of an APRN, delineated in this document, includes language that addresses responsibility and accountability for health promotion and the assessment, diagnosis, and management of patient problems, which includes the use and prescription of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. The definition of an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) is a nurse: 1. who has completed an accredited graduate-l evel education program preparing him/her for one of the four recognized APRN roles; 2. who has passed a national certification examination that measures APRN, role and population-focused competencies and w ho maintains continued competence as evidenced by recertificat ion in the role and popula tion through the national certification program; 3. who has acquired advanced clinical knowledge and skills preparing him/her to provide direct care to patients, as well as a component of indirect care; however, the defining factor for all APRNs is that a significant component of the education and practice focuses on direct care of individuals; 4. whose practice builds on the competencies of registered nurses (RNs) by demonstrating a greater depth and breadth of knowledge, a greater synthesis of data, increased complexity of skills and interventions, and greater role autonomy; 5. who is educationally prepared to assume responsibility and acc ountability for health promotion and/or maintenance as well as the assessment, diagnosis, and management PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlNCSBN CONSENSUS MODEL D-9 of patient problems, which includes the use and prescription of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions; 6. who has clinical experience of sufficient depth and breadth to reflect the intended license; and 7. who has obtained a license to practice as an APRN in one of the four APRN roles: certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), certified nur se-midwife nurse specialist (CNS), or certified nurse pract itioner (CNP). Advanced practice registered nurses are licensed independent practitioners who are expected to practice within standards established or recognized by a licensi ng body. Each APRN is accountable to patients, the nur sing profession, and the licensing board to comply with the requirements of the state nurse pr actice act and the quality of a dvanced nursing care rendered; for recognizing limits of knowledge and experience, planning for the management of situations beyond the APRN's expertise; and for consulting with or referring patients to other health care providers as appropriate. All APRNs are educationally prepar ed to provide a scope of services across the health wellness- illness continuum to at least one population focu s as defined by nationally recognized role and population-focused competencies; however, th e emphasis and implementation within each APRN role varies. The services or care provided by APRNs is not defined or limited by setting but rather by patient care need s. The continuum encompasses the range of health states from homeostasis (or wellness) to a disruption in the st ate of health in which basic needs are not met or maintained (illness), with health problems of varying acuity occu rring along the continuum that must be prevented or resolved to mainta in wellness or an optim al level of functioning (WHO, 2006). Although all APRNs ar e educationally prepared to pr ovide care to patients across the health wellness-illness continuum, the emphasis and how implemented within each APRN role varies. The Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist The Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist is prep ared to provide the full spectrum of patients' anesthesia care and anesthesia-related care for individuals across the lifespan, whose health status may range from healthy through all recognized levels of acuity, including persons with immediate, severe, or life-threatening illnesses or injury. This care is provided in diverse settings, including hospital surgic al suites and obstetrical deli very rooms; critical access hospitals; acute care; pa in management centers; ambulatory su rgical centers; and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, ophthalmol ogists, and plastic surgeons. The Certified Nurse-Midwife The certified nurse-midwife provides a full rang e of primary health car e services to women throughout the lifespan, including gynecologic care, family planning services, preconception care, prenatal and postpartum care, childbirth, and care of the newborn. The practice includes treating the male partner of thei r female clients for sexually tr ansmitted disease and reproductive health. This care is provided in diverse settings, which may include home, hospital, birth center, and a variety of ambulatory care settings including private offices and community and public health clinics.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlD-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The Clinical Nurse Specialist The CNS has a unique APRN role to integrat e care across the continuum and through three spheres of influence: patient, nurse, system. The three sphere s are overlapping and interrelated but each sphere possesses a distinctive focus. In each of the spheres of influence, the primary goal of the CNS is continuous improvement of patient outcomes and nursing care. Key elements of CNS practice are to create environments thr ough mentoring and system changes that empower nurses to develop caring, evidence-b ased practices to alleviate pati ent distress, facilitate ethical decision-making, and respond to diversity. Th e CNS is responsible and accountable for diagnosis and treatment of health/illness states, disease management, health promotion, and prevention of illness and risk behaviors among indi viduals, families, groups, and communities. The Certified Nurse Practitioner For the certified nurse practi tioner (CNP), care along the well ness-illness continuum is a dynamic process in which direct primary and acute care is provided across settings. CNPs are members of the health delivery system, practicing autonomously in areas as diverse as family practice, pediatrics, internal medicine, geriatrics , and women's health care. CNPs are prepared to diagnose and treat patients with undifferentiated symptoms as well as those with established diagnoses. Both primary and acute care CNPs provide initial, ongoing, and comprehensive care, includes taking comprehensive histories, providing physical examinations and other health assessment and screening activit ies, and diagnosing, treating, a nd managing patients with acute and chronic illnesses and diseases. This in cludes ordering, performing, supervising, and interpreting laboratory and im aging studies; prescribing me dication and durable medical equipment; and making appropriate referrals for patients and families. Clinical CNP care includes health promotion, disease prevention, he alth education, and counseling as well as the diagnosis and management of acute and chroni c diseases. Certified nurse practitioners are prepared to practice as primary care CNPs and acute care CNPs, which have separate national consensus-based competencies and se parate certification processes. Titling The title Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APR N) is the licensing title to be used for the subset of nurses prepared with advanced, graduate-level nursing knowledge to provide direct patient care in four roles: certif ied registered nurse anesthetist, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, and cert ified nurse practitioner. 5 This title, APRN, is a legally protected title. Licensure and scope of practice are based on graduate education in one of the four roles and in a defined population. Verification of licensure, whether hard copy or electronic, will indicate the role and population for which the APRN has been licensed. 5 Nurses with advanced graduate nursing preparation practicing in roles and specialties that do not provide direct care to individuals and, therefore, whose practice does not require regulatory recognition beyond the Registered Nurse license granted by state boards of nursing may not use any term or title which may confuse the public, including advanced practice nurse or advanc ed practice registered nurse. The term advanced public health nursing however, may be used to identify nurses practicing in this advanced specialty area of nursing.

He/she may indicate the population as well. No one, except those who are licensed to practice as an APRN, may use the AP RN title or any of the APRN role titles. An individual also may add the specialty title in wh ich they are professionally recognized in addition to the legal title of APRN and role.

These four roles are given the title of advanced practice registered nurse (APRN). APRNs are educated in one of the four roles and in at least one of six population foci: family/individual across the lifespan, adult-gerontology, neonatal, pediatrics, women's health/gender-related or psych/mental health. I ndividuals will be licensed as independent practitioners for practice at the level of one of the four APRN roles with in at least one of the six identified population foci. Education, certification, and licensure of an individual must be congruent in terms of role and population foci. APRNs may specialize but they can not be licensed solely within a specialty area. Specialties can provide depth in one's practice within the established population foci . * The population focus, adult-gerontology, encompasses the young adult to the older adult, including the frail elderly. APRNs educated and certified in the adult-gerontology population are educated and certified across both areas of practice and will be titled Adult-Gerontology CNP or CNS. In addition, all APRNs in any of the four roles providing care to the adult population, e.g., family or gender specific, must be prepared to meet the growing needs of the older adult population. Therefore, the education program should include didactic and clinical education experiences necessary to prepar e APRNs with these enhanced skills and knowledge. ** The population focus, psychiatric/mental health, en compasses education and practice across the lifespan. ++ The Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) is educated and assessed through national certification processes across the continuum from wellness through acute care. +The certified nurse practitioner (CNP ) is prepared with the acute care CNP competencies and/or t e primary care CNP competencies. At this point in time the acute car e and primary care CNP delineation applies only to the pediatric and adult-gerontology CNP population foci. Scope of practice of the primary care or acute care CNP is not setting specific but is based on patient care needs. Programs may prepare individuals across both the primary care and acute care CNP co mpetencies. If programs prepare graduates across both sets of roles, the graduate must be prepared with the consensus-based competencies for both roles and mu st successfully obtain certification in both the acute and the primary care CNP roles. CNP certification in the acute care or primary care ro les must match the educational preparation for CNPs in these roles. h PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Additional content, specific to the role and population, in th ese three APRN core areas should be integrated throughout the other ro le and population didactic and clinical courses; Provide a basic understanding of the principles for decision making in the identified role; Prepare the graduate to assume responsibil ity and accountability for health promotion and/or maintenance as well as the assessment, diagnosis, and management of patient problems, which includes the use and prescription of pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic interventions; and Ensure clinical and didactic coursework is comprehensive and sufficient to prepare the graduate to practice in the AP RN role and population focus. Preparation in a specialty area of practice is optiona l but if included must build on the APRN role/population-focus competencies. Clinical and didactic coursework must be comprehensive and sufficient to prepare the graduate to obtain cert ification for licensure in and to practice in the APRN role and population focus. As part of the accreditation pro cess, all APRN education programs must undergo a pre-approval, pre-accreditation, or accreditation process prior to admitting students. The purpose of the pre- approval process is twofold: 1) to ensure that students graduating from the program will be able to meet the education criteria necessary for national certification in the role and population-focus and if successfully certified, are eligible for licensure to prac tice in the APRN role/population- focus; and 2) to ensure that programs will meet all educational standards prior to starting the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The pre-approval, pre- accreditation or accr editation processes ma y vary across APRN roles. APRN Specialties Preparation in a specialty area of practice is optional, but if included must build on the APRN role/population-focused competencies. Specialty pr actice represents a much more focused area of preparation and practice than does the APRN role/population fo cus level. Specialty practice may focus on specific patient populations beyond those identified or health care needs such as oncology, palliative care, substance abuse, or nephrology. The criteria for defining an APRN specialty is built upon the ANA (200 4) Criteria for Recognition as a Nursing Specialty (see Appendix B). APRN specialty education and practice build upon and ar e in addition to the education and practice of the APRN role and popul ation focus. For example, a family CNP could specialize in elder care or nephrol ogy; an Adult-Gerontology CNS could specialize in could specialize in pain managemen t; or a CNM could specialize in care of the post-menopausal woman. State licensing boards will not regulate the APRN at the level of specialties in this APRN Regulatory Model. Professiona l certification in th e specialty area of practice is strongly recommended. An APRN specialty preparation cannot replace educa tional preparation in the role or one of the six population foci; preparation can not expand one's scope of practice beyond the role or population focus addresses a subset of the population-focus; title may not be used in lieu of the lic ensing title, which includes the role or role/population; and is developed, recognized, and monitored by the profession. New specialties emerge based on health needs of the population. APRN specialties develop to provide added value to the role practice as well as providing flexibility wi thin the profession to meet these emerging needs of patients. Specialties also may cross several or all APRN roles. A specialty evolves out of an AP RN role/population focus and indicates that an APRN has additional knowledge and expertise in a mo re discrete area of specialty practice. Competency in the specialty areas could be acquired either by educational preparation or experience and assessed in a variety of ways through professional credentialin g mechanisms (e.g., portfolios, examinations, etc.). Education programs may concurrently prepare indi viduals in a specialty providing they meet all of the other requirements for APRN education programs, including preparation in the APRN core, role, and population core competencies. In addition, for licensure purposes, one exam must assess the APRN core, role, and population-focused competencies. For example, a nurse anesthetist would write one cer tification examination, which tests the APRN core, CRNA role, and population-focused competencies, administer ed by the Council on Certification for Nurse Anesthetist; or a primary care family nurse practitioner would write one certification examination, which tests the APRN core, CNP role, and family population-focused competencies, administered by ANCC or AANP. Specialty competencies must be assessed PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In summary, education programs pr eparing individuals with this additional knowledge in a specialty, if used for entry into advanced practice registered nursing and for regulatory purposes , must also prepare individuals in one of the four nationally recognized APRN roles and in one of the six populati on foci. Individuals must be recognized and credentialed in one of the four APRN roles within at least one population foci. APRNs are licensed at the role/popu lation focus level and not at the specialty level. However, if not intended for entry-level preparation in one of the f our roles/population foci and not for regulatory purposes, education programs, using a variet y of formats and methodologies, may provide licensed APRNs with the additi onal knowledge, skills, and abilitie s, to become professionally certified in the specialty area of APRN practice. Emergence of New APRN Role s and Population-Foci As nursing practice evolves and health care need s of the population change, new APRN roles or population-foci may evolve over time. An APRN role would encompass a unique or significantly differentiated set of competencies from any of th e other APRN roles. In addition, the scope of practice within the role or popula tion focus is not entirely subsumed within one of the other roles. Careful consideration of new APRN roles or population-foci is in th e best interest of the profession. For licensure, there must be clear guidance for national recognition of a new APRN role or population-focus. A new role or population fo cus should be discusse d and vetted through the national licensure, accreditati on, certification, edu cation communication structure: LACE. An essential part of being recognized as a role or population-focus is that educational standards and practice competencies must exist, be cons istent, and must be nationally recognized by the profession. Characteristics of the process to be used to develop nationally recognized core competencies, and education and practice stan dards for a newly emerging role or population- focus are: 1. national in scope 2. inclusive 3. transparent 4. accountable 5. initiated by nursing 6. consistent with national standards for licensure, accreditation, certification and education 7. evidence-based 8. consistent with regulatory principles. To be recognized, an APRN role must meet the following criteria: nationally recognized education standards and core competenci es for programs preparing individuals in the role; education programs, including graduate degr ee granting (master's, doctoral) and post- graduate certificate programs, are accredit ed by a nursing or nursing-related accrediting organization that is recognized by the U.S. De partment of Education (USDE) and/or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA); and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Expectations for licensure, accreditation, certification, and education are listed below: Foundational Requirements for Licensure Boards of nursing will: 1. license APRNs in the categories of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Nurse-Midwife, Clinical Nurse Specialist or Ce rtified Nurse Practitioner within a specific population focus; 2. be solely responsible for licensing Advanced Practice Registered Nurses 7; 3. only license graduates of accredited graduate programs that prepare graduates with the APRN core, role and population competencies; 4. require successful completion of a national certification examinati on that assesses APRN core, role and population competencies for APRN licensure. 5. not issue a temporary license; 6. only license an APRN when educat ion and certificati on are congruent; 6 The professional certification prog ram should be nationally accredited by the American Board of Nursing Specialties (ABNS) or the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). 7 Except in states where state boards of nurse-midwifery or midwifery regulate nurse-midwives or nurse-midwives and midwives jointly.

Foundational Requirements for Accreditation of Education Programs Accreditors will: 1. be responsible for evaluati ng APRN education programs including graduate degree- granting and post-graduate certificate programs;9 2. through their established accreditation standards and process, assess APRN education programs in light of the APRN core, role core, and population core competencies; 3. assess developing APRN education program s and tracks by reviewing them using established accreditation standards and gran ting pre-approval, pre-accreditation, or accreditation prior to student enrollment; 4. include an APRN on the visiting team when an APRN program/track is being reviewed; and 5. monitor APRN educational programs thr oughout the accreditation period by reviewing them using established accredita tion standards an d processes. Foundational Requirement s for Certification Certification programs providing APRN certification used for licensure will: 1. follow established certificati on testing and psychometrically sound, legally defensible standards for APRN examinations for licensu re (see appendix A for the NCSBN Criteria for APRN Certification Programs); 8 Grandfathering is a provision in a new law exempting those al ready in or a part of the existing system that is being regulated. When states adopt new eligibility requiremen ts for APRNs, currently practicing APRNs will be permitted to continue practicing within the state(s) of their current licensure. However, if an APRN applies for licensure by endorsement in another state, the APRN would be eligible for licensure if s/he demonstrates that the following criteria have been met: current, active practice in the advanc ed role and population focus area, current active, national certification or recertification, as applicable, in the advanced role and population focus area, compliance with the APRN educational requirements of the state in which the APRN is applying for licensure that were in effect at the time the APRN completed his/her APRN education program, and compliance with all other criteria set forth by the state in which the APRN is applying for licensure (e.g. recent CE, RN licensure). Once the model has been adopted and implemented (date to be determined by the state boards of nursing. See proposed timeline on page 14-15.) all new graduates applying for APRN licensure must meet the requirements outlined in this regulatory model 9 Degree-granting programs include both master's and docto ral programs.

Foundational Requirements for Education APRN education programs/tracks leading to AP RN licensure, granting and post-graduate ce rtificate programs will: 1. follow established educational standards and ensure attainme nt of the APRN core, role core and population core competencies;11,12 2. be accredited by a nursing accrediting organi zation that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) and/or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA);13 3. be pre-approved, pre-accredited, or accred ited prior to the acceptance of students, including all developing APRN education programs and tracks; 4. ensure that graduates of the program are e ligible for national certification and state licensure; and 5. ensure that official documentation (e.g., transc ript) specifies the role and population focus of the graduate. Communication Strategies 10 The certification program should be nationally accredited by the American Board of Nursing Specialties (ABNS) or the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). 11 The APRN core competencies for all APRN nursing ed ucation programs located in schools of nursing are delineated in the American Associa tion of Colleges of Nursing (1996) The Essentials of Master's Education for Advanced Practice Nursing Education or the AACN (2006) The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice. The APRN core competencies for nurse anesthesia and nurse-midwifery education programs located outside of a school of nursin g are delineated by the accrediting organi zations for their respective roles i.e., Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educa tional Programs (COA), Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education (ACME). 12 APRN programs outside of schools of nursing must prepare graduates with the APRN core which includes three separate graduate-level courses in pathophysiology/physiology, health assessment, and pharmacology. 13 APRN education programs must be accredited by a nursi ng accrediting organization that is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) and/or the Council fo r Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), including the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC), Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA), Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education (ACME), and the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health Council on Accreditation.

The purpose of LACE would be to provide a formal, ongoing communication mechanism that provides for transparent and aligned communi cation among the identified entities. The collaborative efforts between the APRN C onsensus Group and the NCSBN APRN Advisory Panel, through the APRN Joint Dialogue Gr oup have illustrated the ongoing level of communication necessary among these groups to ensure that all APRN stakeholders are involved. Several strategies includi ng equal representation on an integrated board with face-to- face meetings, audio and teleconferencing, pass-p rotected access to ag ency web sites, and regular reporting mechanisms have been recommended. These strategies will build trust and enhance information sharing. Examples of i ssues to be addressed by the group would be: guaranteeing appropriate representation of APRN roles among accreditation site visitors, documentation of program completion by educati on institutions, notification of examination outcomes to educators and regulators, notificati on of disciplinary acti on toward licensees by boards of nursing. Creating the LACE Structure and Processes Several principles should guide the formulation of a structure including: 1) all four entities of LACE should have representation; 2) the total should allow effective discussion of and response to issues and ; 3) the structur e should not be dupli cative of existing structures such as the Alliance for APRN Credentiali ng. Consideration should be given to evolving the existing Alliance structure to meet the needs of LACE. Guidance from an organizational consultant will be useful in forming a permanent structure that will endure and support th e work that needs to continue. The new structure will support fair decision-making am ong all relevant stakeholders. In addition, the new struct ure will be in place as soon as possible. The LACE organizational structure should include representation of: State licensing boards, including at least one compact and one non-compact state; Accrediting bodies that a ccredit education programs of the four APRN roles; Certifying bodies that offer APRN certification used fo r regulatory purposes; and, Education organizations that set standards for APRN education. Timeline for Implementation of Regulatory Model Implementation of the recommendations for an APRN Regulatory Model will occur incrementally. Due to the inte rdependence of licensure, accreditation, cert ification, and education, certain recommendations will be im plemented sequentially. However, recognizing that this model was developed through a cons ensus process with participation of APRN certifiers, accreditors, public regulators, educators, and employ ers, it is expected that the recommendations and model delineated will inform decisions made by each of these entities as the APRN community moves to fully implement th e APRN Regulatory Model. A target date for full implementation of the Regulatory Model an d all embedded recommendations is the Year 2015.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlD-20 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH HISTORICAL BACKGROUND NCSBN APRN Committee (previously APRN Advisory Panel) NCSBN became involved with advanced practic e nursing when boards of nursing began using the results of APRN certification examinations as one of the requirements for APRN licensure. During the 1993 NCSBN annual meeting, delegates adopted a position paper on the licensure of advanced nursing practice which included model legislation language and model administrative rules for advanced nursing practice. NCSBN core competencies for certified nurse practitioners were adopted the following year. In 1995, NCSBN was directed by the Delegate Assembly to work with APRN certifiers to make certification examinations suitable for regulator y purposes. Since then, much effort has been made toward that purpose. During the mid and la te 90's, the APRN certifiers agreed to undergo accreditation and provide additional information to boards of nursing to ensure that their examinations were psychometrically s ound and legally defensible (NCSBN, 1998). During the early 2000s, the APRN Advisory Pane l developed criteria for ARPN certification programs and for accreditations agencies. In January 2002, the board of directors approved the criteria and process for a new review proce ss for APRN certification programs. The criteria represented required elements of certification programs that would result in a legally defensible examination suitable for the regulation of adva nced practice nurses. Subsequently, the APRN Advisory Panel has worked with certification pr ograms to improve the legal defensibility of APRN certification examinations and to promot e communication with all APRN stakeholders regarding APRN regulatory issues such as with the establishment of the annual NCSBN APRN Roundtable in the mid 1990's. In 2002, the Advi sory Panel also developed a position paper describing APRN regulator y issues of concern. In 2003, the APRN Advisory Panel began a draft APRN vision paper in an attempt to resolve APRN regulatory concerns such as the proliferation of APRN s ubspecialty areas. The purpose of the APRN Vision Paper was to provide dire ction to boards of nur sing regarding APRN regulation for the next 8-10 years by identifying an ideal future APRN regulatory model. Eight recommendations were made. The draft visi on paper was completed in 2006. After reviewing the draft APRN vision paper at their February 2006 board meeting, th e board of directors directed that the paper be disseminated to boards of nursing and APRN stakeholders for feedback. The Vision paper also was discusse d during the 2006 APRN Roundtable. The large response from boards of nursing and APRN stake holders was varied. The APRN Advisory Panel spent the remaining part of 2006, reviewing and discussing the feedback with APRN stakeholders. (See Appendix C for the list of APRN Advisory Panel members who worked on the draft APRN Vision Paper and Appendix D for the list of organizations represented at the 2006 APRN Roundtable where the draf t vision paper was presented.) APRN Consensus Group In March 2004, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) and the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties ( NONPF) submitted a proposal to the Alliance for PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlNCSBN CONSENSUS MODEL D-21 Nursing Accreditation, now named Alliance for APRN Credentialing14 (hereafter referred to as the APRN Alliance ) to establish a process to develop a consensus15 statement on the credentialing of advanced practice nurses (APNs).16 The APRN Alliance17, created in 1997, was convened by AACN to regularly discuss issues related to nursing education, practice, and credentialing. A number of differing views on how APN practice is defined, what constitute specialization versus subspeci alization, and the ap propriate credentialing requirements that would authorize practice had emerge d over the pass t several years. An invitation to participate in a national APN consensus process was sent to 50 organizations that were identified as having an interest in advanced practice nursing (s ee Appendix F). Thirty- two organizations participated in the APN C onsensus Conference in Washington, D.C. June 2004. The focus of the one-day meeting was to initia te an in-depth examinat ion of issues related to APN definition, specializa tion, sub-specialization, and regulation, which includes accreditation, education, certification, and licensure18. Based on recommendations generated in the June 2004 APN Consensus Conference, the Alliance formed a smaller work group made up of designees from 23 organizations with broa d representation of APN certification, licensure, education, accreditation, and practice. The charge to the work group was to develop a statement that addresses the issues, delineated during th e APN Consensus Confer ence with the goal of envisioning a future model for APNs. The A lliance APN Consensus Work Group (hereafter referred to as the Work Group ) convened for 16 days of intensive discussion between October 2004 and July 2007 (see Appendix H for a list of organizations represented on the APN Work Group). In December 2004, the American Nurses Asso ciation (ANA) and AAC N co-hosted an APN stakeholder meeting to address those issues id entified at the June 2004 APN Consensus meeting. Attendees agreed to ask the APN Work Group to continue to craft a consensus statement that would include recommendations regardi ng APN regulation, specialization, and subspecialization. It also was agr eed that organizations in attenda nce who had not participated in the June 2004 APN Consensus meeting would be included in the APN Cons ensus Group and that 14 At its March 2006 meeting, the Alliance for Nursing Ac creditation voted to change its name to the Alliance for APRN Credentialing which more accurately reflects its membership. 15 The goal of the APRN Work Group was unanimous agreement on all issues and recommendations. However, this was recognized as an unrealistic expectation and may dela y the process; therefore, co nsensus was defined as a two thirds majority agreement by those members of the Work Group present at the table as organizational representatives with each participating organization having one vote. 16 The term advanced practice nurse (APN) was initially used by the Work Group and is used in this section of the report to accurately reflect the backgr ound discussion. However, the Work gr oup reached consensus that the term advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) should be adopted for use in subsequent discussions and documents. 17 Organizational members of the Alliance for APRN Cred entialing : American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Program, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Certification Corporation, Council on Accreditation of Nu rse Anesthesia Educational Programs, American College of Nurse-Midwives, American Nurses Credentialing Ce nter, Association of Faculties of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, Inc., Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, Council on Accreditation, Pediatric Nursing Certification Board, The National Certification Corporation for the Obstet ric Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing Specialties, National Council of State Boards of Nursing, National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties 18 The term regulation refers to the four prongs of regula tion: licensure, accreditation, certification and education.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlD-22 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH this larger group would reconvene at a future da te to discuss the recommendations of the APN Work Group. Following the December 2004 APN Consensus meeting, the Work Group continued to work diligently to reach consensus on the issues surr ounding APRN education, practice, accreditation, certification, and licensure, and to create a fu ture consensus-based model for APRN regulation. Subsequent APRN Consensus Group meetings were held in September 2005 and June 2006. All organizations who participated in the APRN Consensus Group are listed in Appendix G. APRN Joint Dialogue Group In April, 2006, the APRN Advisory Panel met w ith the APRN Consensus Work Group to discuss APRN issues described in the NCSBN draft vi sion paper. The APRN Consensus Work Group requested and was provided with feedback from the APRN Advisory Panel regarding the APRN Consensus Group Report. Both groups agreed to continue to dialogue. As the APRN Advisory Panel and APRN Cons ensus Work Group continued their work in parallel fashion, concerns regarding the need for each group's work not to conflict with the other were expressed. A subgroup of seven people from the APRN Consensus Work Group and seven individuals from the APRN Advisory Panel were convened in January, 2007. The group called itself the APRN Joint Dialogue Group (see Appendi x E) and the agenda c onsisted of discussing areas of agreement and disagreement between the two groups. The goal of the subgroup meetings was anticipated to be two papers that did not conflict, but rather complemented each other. However, as the APRN Joint Dialogue Group continued to meet, much progress was made regarding areas of agreement; it was determined that rather th an two papers being disseminated, one joint paper would be develope d, which reflected the work of both groups. This document is the product of the work of the APRN Joint Dialogue Group and through the consensus-based work of the APRN Consensu s Work Group and the NCSBN APRN Advisory Committee. Assumptions Underlying the Work of the Joint Dialogue Group The consensus-based recommenda tions that have emerged from the extensive dialogue and consensus-based processes delineated in this report are based on the following assumptions: Recommendations must address current issues facing the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) community but should be future oriented. The ultimate goal of licensure, accreditation, ce rtification, and education is to promote patient safety and public protection. The recognition that this document was developed with the participation of APRN certifiers, accreditors, public regulators, educators, and employ ers. The intention is that the document will allow for informed decisions made by each of these entities as they address APRN issues.

The essential elements of APRN regulation are identified as licensure, accredita tion, certification, and education. The recommendations reflect a need and desire to colla borate among regulatory bodies to achieve a sound model and continued communication with the goal of increasing the clarity and uniformity of APRN regulation. The goals of the consensus processes were to: strive for harmony and common understanding in the APRN regulatory community that would continue to promote quality APRN education and practice; develop a vision for APRN regulation, incl uding education, accreditation, certification, and licensure; establish a set of standards that protect the public, improve mobili ty, and improve access to safe, quality APRN care; and produce a written statement that reflects consensus on APRN regulatory issues. In summary, this report includes: a definiti on of the APRN Regulatory Model, including a definition of the Advanced Practice Register ed Nurse; a definition of broad-based APRN education; a model for regulati on that ensures APRN education and certification as a valid and reliable process, that is based on nationally recognized and accepted standards; uniform recommendations for licensing bodies across states; a process and characteristics for recognizing a new APRN role; and a definition of an APRN sp ecialty that allows for the profession to meet future patient and nursing needs. The work of the Joint Dialogue Group in conjunc tion with all organizatio ns representing APRN licensure, accreditation, certificati on, and education to advance a regulatory model is an ongoing collaborative process that is fluid and dynamic. As health car e evolves and new standards and needs emerge, the APRN Regulatory Model will advance accordingly to allow APRNs to care for patients in a safe environment to the full potential of their nursing knowledge and skill.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlNCSBN CONSENSUS MODEL D-31 2004 Recognition as a Nursing Specialty The process of recognizing an area of practice as a nursing specialty allows the profession to formally identify subset areas of focused practice. A clear desc ription of that nursing practice assists the larger community of nurses, healthcare consumers, and othe rs to gain familiarity and understanding of the nursing specialty. Therefore, the document requesting ANA recognition must clearly and fully address each of the fourteen specialty recognition criteria. The inclusion of additional materials to support the discussion and promote understanding of the criteria is acceptable. A scope of practice statement must accompany the submission requesting recognition as a nursing specialty. Criteria for Recognition as a Nursing Specialty The following criteria are used by the Congress on Nursing Practice and Economics in the review and decision-making processes to recognize an area of practice as a nursing specialty: A nursing specialty: 1. Defines itself as nursing. 2. Adheres to the overall licensure requirements of the profession. 3. Subscribes to the overall purposes and functions of nursing. 4. Is clearly defined. 5. Is practiced nationally or internationally. 6. Includes a substantial number of nurses who devote most of their practice to the specialty. 7. Can identify a need and demand for itself. 8. Has a well derived knowledge base particular to the practice of the nursing specialty. 9. Is concerned with phenomena of the discipline of nursing. 10. Defines competencies for the area of nursing specialty practice. 11. Has existing mechanisms for supporting, review ing and disseminating research to support its knowledge base. 12. Has defined educational criteria for speci alty preparation or graduate degree. 13. Has continuing education programs or continuing competence mechanisms for nurses in the specialty. 14. Is organized and represented by a national spec ialty association or branch of a parent organization. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The process was developed with consultation from a nationally re cognized expert in higher education assessment. The process subsequently has been used and valid ated for the development of similar sets of competencies for other areas of nursing practi ce, including competencies for mass casualty education for all nurses and competencies for acu te care nurse practitioners and psych/mental health nurse practitioners. This process for developing nationally recognize d educational standards, nationally recognized role competencies and nationally recognized spec ialty competencies is an iterative, step-wise process. The steps are: Step 1: At the request of the organization(s) representing the role or specialty, a neutral group or groups convenes and facilitates a national panel of all stakeholde r organizations as defined in step 2. Step 2: To ensure broad representation, invitatio ns to participate shou ld be extended to one representative of each of the recognized nursing accrediting organizations, certifiers within the role and specialty, groups whose primary mi ssion is graduate education and who have established educational criter ia for the identified role and specialty, and groups with competencies and standards for education program s that prepare individuals in the role and specialty. Step 3: Organizational represen tatives serving on the national c onsensus panel bring and share role delineation studies, competencies for pr actice and education, sc opes and standards of practice, and standards for education programs. Step 4: Agreement is reached among the panel members Step 5: Panel members take the draft to their individual boards for feedback. Step 6: That feedback is returned to the panel. This is an iterative process until agreement is reached. Step 7: Validation is sought fr om a larger group of stakeholde rs including organizations and individuals. This is known as the Validation Panel. Step 8: Feedback from the Validation Panel is returned to National Panel to prepare the final document. Step 9: Final document is sent to boards re presented on the National Panel and the Validation Panel for endorsement. The final document demonstrates national consen sus through consideration of broad input from key stakeholders. The document is then widely disseminated.

Nearly 450,000 RNs ar e estimated to have received their first US li cense between 2004 and 2008 (HRSA, 2010). The current nursing workforce includes a high proportion of nurses worki ng in the later years of their careers, soon to retire, and a high proportion of nurses at the onset of their careers. Midcareer nurses, the group most needed to fill the roles of those leaving the workforce, are the lowest in number. Therefore, the knowledge, experience, and mentoring that se nior nurses can provide could potentially be lost (Bleich et al., 2009). Tabl e E-1 shows the demographic and educational distribution of the current nursing workforce.

For the past four decades, nursing students have been able to pursue three different educati onal paths: the diploma in nursing, the associate's degree in nursing (ADN), and the bach elor's of science in nursing (BSN). More recently, an accelerated, second- degree bachelor's program for students who possess a baccalaureate degree in anothe r field has become a popular option. DIPLOMA IN NURSING For many years, the most common choice of nur sing students was the diploma program at a hospital-based school. Generally lasting 3 years and providing limited liberal arts content, diploma programs trace their origin to the work of Florence Nightingale and her colleagues in the 19th century. In many ways, diploma programs are similar to apprenticeship programs for physicians in the 1800s before the widespread development of medical schools (Gebbie, 2009). As nursing gained a stronger theoretical foundation and other types of nursing programs increased in number, the numb er of diploma programs declined remarkably throughout the 20th century except in a few states, such as Ne w Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. One advantage of the diploma program is that there are guarant eed clinical spaces for those accepted into the program, something ADN and BSN programs cannot offer. The number of all working nurses who began their nursing education in dipl oma schools fell from 63.7 percent in 1980 to 20.4 percent in 2008; the number of new diploma graduates dropped to 3.1 percent of all graduates in the 2005 2008 graduation cohort (HRSA, 2010). ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE IN NURSING At present, the most common way to become an RN is to pursue an ADN at a community college. The proportion of nurses in the United States whose initial education was an ADN increased from 42.9 percent in 2004 to 45.4 percent in 2008 (HRSA, 2010). ADN programs in nursing were launched in the mid 20th century in response to the nursing shortage that followed World War II (Lynaugh, 2008; Lynaugh and Br ush, 1996). Generally speaking, the ADN remains less expensive than a BSN because of the cost structure of the community college system and the shorter program duration. Once con ceived as a 2-year program, the ADN is seen as taking less time than a BSN, but this situ ation has changed over the years (Orsolini-Hain, 2008). In most non health care disciplines, th e associate's degree takes 2 years to complete. In nursing, however, surveys have found that it take s students 3 to 4 years to complete an ADN program because of the need to fulfill prerequisi tes and the lack of adequate faculty, which lead to long waiting lists for many programs and cl asses (Orsolini-Hain, 2008). The ADN curriculum often combines intense science and clinical co ursework into a condensed time frame, posing additional challenges to completing the program in 2 years.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlUNDERGRADUATE NURSING EDUCATION E-3 BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE IN NURSING The BSN is a 4-year degree, typically offere d at a university; the first university-based schools of nursing were founded in the early 20th century (Lynaugh, 2008; Lynaugh and Brush, 1996). BSN programs emphasize libera l arts, advanced sciences, a nd nursing coursework across a wide range of settings, along with leadership development and exposure to community and public health competencies. As of 2008, 34.2 per cent of RNs throughout the United States had started with a BSN, up from 31.5 percent in 2004 (HRSA, 2010). Beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, an accelerated option for a BS N or MSN became available to applicants who had already completed a bachelor's degree in a different field. Also known as fast-track or second-degree programs, these programs have a dded substantially to the growing number of baccalaureate graduates (AACN, 2010). Most BSN students complete their degrees in 4 years. Accelerated programs that offer the BSN to students who have already completed a b achelor's degree are typically completed in 11 to 18 months, with intense coursework and profe ssional formation accelerated based on previous collegiate and life experience (AACN, 2010). For much of the 20th century, following the release of a significant 1965 position paper of the American Nurses Association, nursing leader s and educators tried to standardize nursing education and make the BSN the minimum entry- level requirement for nursing practice. Four states were targeted for early implementati on (Smith, 2010). Only one of them\u2014North Dakota\u2014 fully followed through on that recommendation by establishing the BSN as the minimum degree in nursing in 1987 (Smith, 2010). In 2003, however, th e state legislature, at the urging of hospitals and long-term care stakeholders, passe d a law that allowed nurses with an ADN to practice (Boldt, 2003). Nationwide, market for ces and the needs of individual employers generally determine whether a BSN is required for entry into practice. LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSES In addition to the RNs, who receive a diploma, associate, or baccalaureate degree in nursing, another undergraduate level degr ee offered is the licensed practi cal/vocational degree in nursing. Licensed practical/vocational nurs es (LPNs/LVNs) are especially important because of their contributions to care in long-term care facilities a nd nursing homes. Historically, LPN/LVN programs have fluctuated based on need. The first training program for licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs ) dates back to the late 19th century. These programs increased in number following the nursing shortage of World War I, and the passage of the Smith Hughes Act, and again following th e nursing shortage of World War II, when LPNs/LVNs were in demand to assist RNs in civilian hospitals (lpntraining.org, 2010), which were short-staffed as a result of war efforts. LPNs/LVNs also found employment in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. LPN/LVN receives a diploma after completion of a 12-month program. The LPN/LVN is not educated for independent decision making for complex care but obtains basic training in anatomy and physiology, nutrition, and nursing t echniques. With additional study, these nurses can perform supplemental nursing tasks that are useful to patients and nursing home residents and can contribute to clinical documentation and team perfor mance. Some LPNs/LVNs also supervise nursing attendants and direct care workers in long-term care settings. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Statistics from the National Counc il of State Boards of Nursing s how little difference in the pass rates of BSN, ADN, and diploma graduates, which is to be expected because the exam tests the minimum standards for safe practice. In 2009, 89.49 percent of 52,241 BSN candidates passed the NCLEX-RN exam, compared with 87.61 percent of 78,665 ADN candidates and 90.75 percent of 3,677 diploma candidates (NCSBN, 2010).

Johns Hopkins University Bloombe rg School of Public Health INTRODUCTION The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Initiative on the Future of Nursing is founded on a major study, undertaken in collabor ation with the Institute of Me dicine, that will \"examine the capacity of the nursing workforce to meet the demands of a reformed health care and public health system.\" A report pursuing such a goal is propitious, and pa th-breaking from the legion of nursing workforce reports produced over the past half-century by departing from \"what is\" and focusing on \"what should be.\" This paper seeks to aid that effort through a detailed examination of how health reform may alter the demand for the registered nurses (RN), and the degree to which the RN workforce measures up to this anticipated demand. A thoughtful examination of the capacity of the RN workforce to support health reform is important for several reasons. The health re form legislation signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which proceeded it, include a range of initiatives th at seek to redesign the organi zation, financing, and delivery of health care. A number of these programs\u2014for example, primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations (ACO s)\u2014rely on interventions that fa ll squarely within the scope of practice of RNs (e.g., care coordination, transitional care). Fu rthermore, expanding the reach of insurance coverage will place greater demands on the primary care system, as witnessed in Massachusetts (Long, 2008; Long and Masi, 200 9), and consequently on RNs and nurse practitioners to practice in these settings (Craven and Ober, 2009). In addition, investment in the expansion of interoperable health information technology (HIT) platfo rms that are critical to the implementation of these system reforms will s pur the growth of community-wide information exchange that has the potential to change the distribution, skill -mix, and scope of practice of nurses in profound ways. So what does a reformed health care deliv ery system foretell for the future nursing workforce? Will the demand for services provid ed by RNs change, as the provisions in the 1 The responsibility for the content of this article rests w ith the authors and does not n ecessarily represent the views of the Institute of Medicine or its committees and convening bodies.

What role will the nursing workforce play in a post-re form environment? This paper examines these questions. We assess the composition, skill set, and scope of practice needed from a future RN workforce to support the health care delivery and coverage reforms that will emerge from the reform legislation and related in itiatives. We describe the fu ture demand for RNs under these reforms, how that demand comports with the curr ent and anticipated future supply of RNs, the challenges in meeting the workforce demands of a reformed health care delivery system, and recommendations for future RN workforce planning. THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE D ELIVERY REFORMS ON DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES OF NURSES What will be the demand for the health care se rvices of RNs under the proposed health care delivery reforms? An examination of the health reform legislation and other related policy initiatives reveals a number of pr ograms and provisions that call fo r reorganization of health care services and the workforce responsible for deli vering them. Their implementation could have a significant effect on the future ro les of and requirements for RNs. Advancing Care Management Models \"Care management\" comprises a broad and evol ving range of strategi es to effectively intervene and improve the care for primarily ch ronically ill in dividuals\u2014those whose care spans multiple providers and requires continuous, long term management. Disease management (DM) programs\u2014diagnosis-specific programs targeting chronic illnesses respon sible for the largest share of health care spending\u2014have been the dominant form of care management programs for the past 15 years. DM programs target patients w ith specific chronic illnesses (e.g., heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes), offer providers tools to improve their clinical management, promote outreach and support strategies to improve patient a dherence to treatment plans, and provide feedback systems to monitor patient outcomes (Krumhol z et al., 2006). Out of DM programs came case management and care coor dination strategies that target persons with multi-morbidity chronic illnesses and complex care n eeds in addition to one or more significant chronic illnesses. These programs rely on rigorous care coordination and well-managed interdisciplinary clinical management to achieve quality outcomes (Anderson, 2005; Bodenheimer, 2008). Provisions in the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Modernization Act of 2003 launched a series of population-based care coordination pilot programs to test the applicability of these strategies for Medicare beneficiaries and to assess the quality improvement outcomes and cost-savings that could be achieved (Anders on, 2005; Foote, 2003). The evaluations revealed that while these programs yielded a variety of im portant quality outcomes, cost-savings remained largely elusive (Ayanian, 2009; Peikes et al., 200 9). These findings echoe d those in an earlier report from the Congressional Budget Office for the U.S. Senate Budget Committee that noted the promise but lack of evidence of cost savings from these programs (CBO, 2004). Further analyses, however, revealed that co st-savings\u2014principally by reducing avoidable hospital admissions\u2014in addition to quality outcomes have been achieved by some care management programs (Bodenheimer, 2009; Bott et al., 2009; Sochalski et al., 2009). Programs that have been successful share several important features: care management strategies directed PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHEALTH CARE SYSTEM REFORM AND THE NURSING WORKFORCE F-3 by nurses who were integral to the physic ian's practice, who coordinated care and communication between the patient and all member s of the interdisciplinary team serving the patient, and who directly provided health care services via in-person and telephonic/electronic methods. Increasing evidence is showing that enhanced and integral involvement of nurses in both the coordination and delivery of care, particularly for patients e nduring multiple chronic illnesses and complex care regimens, and in care ma nagement is critical to achieving cost and quality targets (Fisher et al., 2009). Several programs and initiatives included in the health reform legislation involve interdisciplinary and cross-setti ng care coordination and care ma nagement services of RNs. Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH) Health reform raised the profile of strategies seeking to eliminate fragmentation in care and its costly and poor quality consequences. A r ecent report from the Institute of Medicine's Roundtable on Evidence-Based Medicine (2009) estimated potential annual savings of $271 billion that could accrue by 2014 by fac ilitating care coordinati on which would reduce these discontinuities in care. One such strate gy is the patient-centered medical home, an enhanced model of primary care through which care teams attend to the multi-faceted needs of patients and provide whole pers on comprehensive and coordinate d patient-centered care (Kaye and Takach, 2009). Health reform's version of the PCMH is an outgrowth of both struct ural and care delivery innovations over the past several decades. The st ructure derives from the pediatric medical home model developed to mainstream care for special needs children, and expanded to embrace the consensus view of primary care as first-contact, comprehensive, continuous, coordinated care for all populations (IOM, 1996; Starfield and Shi, 2004) . This model is joined by key elements of Wagner's Chronic Care Model (Wagner et al., 1996), several system redesign features (e.g., interdisciplinary collaboration and fully integr ated HIT), and a new payment structure that recognizes the broad set of serv ices comprising the patient-ce ntered medical home (Berenson et al., 2008). The PCMH is intended to address critical deficiencies in the current primary care system: (1) making the \"patient\" the focus of an d place for care\u2014redesigning practice so that it is truly \"centered\" on patient and caregivers; (2) meeting the growing challenge of managing chronic illnesses in primary care settings; and (3) providing necessary re sources and payment for care management and coordination activities requir ed for an effective PCMH (Berenson et al., 2008; Chokshi, 2009; Ritt enhouse et al., 2009). A fully functional PCMH is founded on patient a nd caregiver engagement in care that meets patient preferences; information and education that promotes self-management; care coordination that monitors, reviews, and follows -up on all services needed and provided across settings; secure transitions across health care settings; and effective information flow across all providers and services to assure integrated care delivery (Davis et al., 2005; Gerteis et al., 1993). This PCMH model is envisioned to result in lower costs throug h reductions in emergency room visits and hospital admissions (Hussey et al., 2009; Eibner et al ., 2009). Patient self- management, care coordination, and transitional ca re\u2014services at the core of the PCMH and shown to result in lower hospital and ER use\u2014are directed and provided by nurses. The Guided Care Program offers an example of a successful PCMH model, one that has improved patient outcomes and quality and reduced health care costs through nursing services (Boult et al., 2008; Boyd et al., 2007, 2008; Leff et al., 2009; Sylvia et al., 2008). The Guided Care (GC) model is a PCMH program using an in terdisciplinary team approach to coordinate PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Based in primary care physician practices, GC nurses coordinate care among health care pr oviders; complete standardized comprehensive home assessments; and collaborate with physic ians, patients, and careg ivers to create and execute evidence-based care guides and actions plans. GC nurses wo rk on a long-term basis with clients, provide transitional care, and assist pa tients with self-management skills and accessing necessary community-based serv ices (Boult et al., 2008). Ea rly findings from a cluster randomized trial of this program reveal a 24 pe rcent reduction in inpatient days, 15 percent reduction emergency room visits, and a net Me dicare savings of $75,000 per Guided Care nurse in the programs (Leff et al., 2009). The Intermountain Healthcare Medical Group in Utah (Dorr et al., 2008, 2009) and the Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care fo r Elders (GRACE) program in Indiana (Counsell et al., 2007) are PCMH models th at have targeted high risk older adults for rigorously coordinated care provided by nurses embedded in primary care practices, in the case of Intermountain, and nurse practitioner/social work er teams in the case of the GRACE program. Each have achieved a significant reduction of hospitalizations and lower costs. Similar gains were also found for high-risk children in PCMH programs. Community Care of North Carolina (McCarthy and Mueller, 2009; St einer, 2008) had nurses provide case management and care coordination services to high-ri sk Medicaid and SCHIP enrolle es, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in hospitalizations for as thma and a 16 percent reduction in emergency room visits and yielding total annual savings of $154 170 million. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 dir ected the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to undertake a dem onstration program to test the effectiveness of PCMH models for Medicare enrollees and the capacity to achieve both quality outcomes and lower health care spending through such approaches to organize primary care. Provi sions in the health reform legislation complement Medicare 's demonstration program, testi ng different PCMH models and creating a new CMS Innovation Ce nter to support testing new approaches to organizing, delivering and paying for health care services (Chokshi, 2009). Their cap acity to achieve real savings, some argue, will depend on the breadth of providers (e.g., primary care, specialists, hospitals) linked to the medical home and the dept h of interdisciplinary collaboration and care coordination among them (Fisher, 2008), underscori ng the focal role that nursing will play in achieving these outcomes. Transitional Care Other innovations in care mana gement also call upon the scope of practice of RNs. Various current and proposed reforms would financially penalize hospitals whos e Medicare readmission rates exceeded an established threshold. These provisions come on the heels of a recent study which found that one in five hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, nearly half of whom return without having seen a physician or other health care practitioner in the interv ening period (Jencks et al., 2009). Of the $103 billion spent by Medicare on hospital care in the study year , 17 percent was spent on readmi ssions that were unplanned and potentially avoidable. These findings raise serious questions a bout the coordination of care and hospital discharge protocols in place where these patients sou ght care (Epstein, 2009). The financial penalty is intended to serve as a significant incentive to hospitals to adopt evidence- based strategies that will reduce avoidable readmissions. Co-incident with the release of the readmission study, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the 14 sites for its ne wly funded Care Transitions Project.

Transitions between settings\u2014e.g., hospital to home, hospital to nursing home\u2014are points of great vulnerability for patients, and poorly managed transitions are a chief culprit in hospital readmissions (Colem an et al., 2006; Naylor et al., 1999, 2004). Two prominent evidence-based models of care for ma naging transitions between settings are founded on nursing services: Coleman's Care Transitions Model and Naylor's Transitional Care Model. The Coleman model employs adva nced practice nurses as \"trans ition coaches\" to manage chronically ill patients and their care needs as they transition betw een settings and to encourage these patients and their caregivers to assume more active roles in ma naging their care. The Naylor model targets complex chronically ill pa tients\u2014those with multiple chronic illnesses and other complicating conditions\u2014and uses specially-t rained transitional care nurses to provide, manage, and coordinate the full complement of c linical care and transiti onal care services during, between, and after the hospital stay. Both the Co leman and Naylor models have demonstrated significant reductions in hospita l readmissions and health care costs. The health reform legislation includes provisions for a start-up progra m of transitional care th at is modeled directly on these two evidence-based models. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) ACOs received noteworthy attention within infl uential legislative circles during the debate on health reform that led to their inclusion in the final legislation as a pilot program. ACOs, modeled in large part after successful integrat ed delivery systems like Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger Health System, have been advanced by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and Engelberg Center for Hea lth Reform at the Brookings Institution. Their structure grew out of the seminal work on th e geographic patterns of health care use and spending from the Dartmouth Institute (Fishe r et al., 2009; Goldsmith, 2009; McKethan and McClellan, 2009). Taking advantage of the natural clustering of health care services around hospitals which the analyses on re gional patterns of service us e revealed, ACOs are envisioned as locally integrated groups of hospitals, physicians, and other providers that are responsible for the health service need s of a defined population of patient s (Crosson, 2009a). Their structure draws from the current Medicare Physician Gr oup Practice demonstration program and the prior decade's Physician Hospital Organization program (Crosson, 2009b). ACOs offer a pathway to cost control through payment reform, by establishing collaborations of providers that enter agreements with payers to be financ ially accountable for the provision of health care services to a defi ned population. These provider collabo rations can take a variety of configurations to accommodate and build upon exis ting local relationships among providers. The payment methods that have been proposed embody a variety of provider in centives to meet cost targets including shared savings, shared risk, partial capitation, and beneficiary incentives such as differential co-pays. Performance measurement is an integral component of ACOs to provide quality and cost benchmarks and progress, and to ensure that cost contro l is not achieved through by limiting necessary or appropriate care. ACOs will depend on several structural and organizational features in order to meet their cost and quality targets. Fully-integ rated electronic health records (EHR) and other types of HIT would be required for timely and meaningful in formation sharing across the entire range of providers. Regular feedback on performance and benchmarks will need to be shared with all PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Moreover, ACOs will be supported and strengthened by adopting rigorous , evidence-based care management practices that are the foundation of many complementary system refo rms, e.g., PCMHs and transitional care, to manage and guide the care of fully-functioni ng teams of providers and to coordinate communication within and acr oss teams, organizations and disciplinary lines. The care management and coordination strate gies adopted by ACOs and other types of integrated delivery systems require an RN workfo rce that is linked to the patient, can readily transition with the patient across time and car e settings and is ultimately accountable for outcomes that transcend time and place. RNs working in this context would be employed by the ACO, one of its practices or contracting care coordination organizations and would be responsible for care management for the most co mplexly ill patients in the group and for their care transitions. These transitions would include from hospital to home or other post-acute setting, from home to hospital, or from ongoing primary care to intensive out-patient secondary care. Expanding Primary Care Capacity The demand to build the primary care nursi ng workforce\u2014both RNs and advanced practice nurses\u2014will grow as accessibility to coverage, service settings, and se rvices increases. The Massachusetts experience provides evidence of this growth in demand: passage of health reform in 2006 led to a substantial increase in demand fo r primary care services only some of which could be met with the existi ng reservoir of primary care re sources (Long, 2008; Long and Masi, 2009). Moreover, today the number of nurse pract itioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) rivals the number of family physicians delivering primary care, t hus a substantial share of the growth in demand for primary care services that will follow the expansion in health coverage will by design fall on the shoulders of nurses (Green et al., 2004). The growth in health centers during the prior decade pr ovides some parameters for quantifying the growth in the demand for the primary care RN workforce. Between 2000 and 2006 the number of patients served by the nation's health centers grew 67 percent, to 16 million. To meet the concomitant increase in demand for care, the number of primary care physicians at health centers grew by 57 percen t, advanced practice clinicians (i.e., NPs, PAs, and certified nurse midwives [CNMs]) by 64 percent, and RNs by 38 percent. Yet despite that growth , according to the National Association for Comm unity Health Centers (NACHC, 2008), health centers fell short by 1,843 primary care providers, including physicians, NPs, PAs, and CNMs, and by 1,384 RNs. NACHC estimates that 56 million people lack access to a primary care medical provider (NACHC, 2007). For health centers to increase th e number of patients served (for medical visits) from 16 million to 30 million, an additional 15,600 to 19,400 primary care providers are estimated to be needed. Using the current skill mix of clinicians, 36 percent of these additional providers\u2014from 5,600 to 7,000\u2014would be NPs/CNMs/PAs. In addition, health centers would require another 11,600 to 14,400 RNs. Assuming th at 75 percent of the advanced practice clinicians would be NPs or CNMs, an additional 16,000 20,000 RNs would be required to meet this demand.

The percent of RNs employed in ambulatory care, e.g., clinics, physicians' offices, health centers remained vi rtually unchanged between 2004 and 2008, at just over 12 percent. This seemingly steady employme nt rate masks the gradual decline in the ambulatory care nursing workforce in a number of states. For example, the RN ambulatory care workforce in Florida grew an appreciably decel erating rate over this period: 25 percent from 2004-06, 12 percent from 2006 2008, and virtually no change from 2008 2009. In 2007 ambulatory care settings employed 7.8 percent of RNs in Pennsylvania, down from 8.4 percent two years earlier. In 2006 6.3 pe rcent of RNs in California worked in ambulatory care, down from 8.3 percent only two years earlier (UCSF School of Nursing and CHWS, 2007). Statistics from the 2004 National Sample Survey of Regist ered Nurses indicate that between 17,000 and 20,000 RNs were working in health center set tings. Meeting the demand for primary care services at community health centers estimated by NACHC would require a doubling of the RN workforce in health centers today, an unlikel y circumstance given the prevailing trends in ambulatory care employment of RNs. Furthermore, community health centers represent only one primary care setting that will demand additional RN s. Other services and settings offering access to primary care and preventive health services and receiving enhanced support from the health reform legislation and consequently will pl ace additional demand on RNs include workplace wellness programs, home-based primary care (e.g., Independence at Home program), nurse home visitation services, nurse-managed health centers, and community health teams. Adoption of Health Care Support Technologies Within the first few months in office President Obama signed economic stimulus legislation that included a significant inve stment to expand the HIT infrastructure for the nation (Blumenthal, 2009). This investment is intended to nourish the seeds of di gital health care that are well-rooted though not widespread. Today only 15 20 percent of hospital RNs practice within a minimally functional HIT infrastructure and well under five percent practice within a fully wired context (DesRoches et al., 2008). However, a full array of HIT is expected to diffuse rapidly over the coming decade, with significant imp lications for future training, staffing models, and workforce policies for RNs. HIT is anticipa ted to lead to: (1) pr ofound changes in the content and process of clinical practice; (2) a redesign of the ro les and skill-mix of the health care workforce and the ways in which multi-disc iplinary teams will work with one another; (3) new paradigms for how time and place will infl uence the delivery of care; and (4) increased care efficiency and better outcomes. Changing Clinical Practice HIT will fundamentally change the ways that RNs plan, deliver, document, and review clinical care. The process of obtaining and reviewing diagnostic information, making clinical decisions, communicating with patie nts and families, and carrying out clinical interventions will radically depart from how these activities occur today. Moreover, the relative proportion of time RNs spend on various tasks is likely to change appreciably over the coming decades. While arguably HIT will have its greatest influence over how RNs plan and document their care, all facets of care will be mediated increasingly by digital work flow, computerized knowledge management, and decision support.

In the future virtually every facet of nursing pr actice in each setting wh ere it is rendered will have a significant digital dimension around a co re electronic health r ecord. Biometric data collection will increasingly be automated, and dia gnostic tests, medications and some therapies will be computer generated, managed and delivered with computer support. Patient histories and examination data will increasing be collected by devices that interface dir ectly with the patient and automatically stream into the EHR. Auto mated blood pressure cuffs, PDA-based functional status, and patient history surveys are examples of this. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHEALTH CARE SYSTEM REFORM AND THE NURSING WORKFORCE F-9 In HIT supported organizations a broader array and higher proportion of se rvices of all types will be provided within the context of comput er templates and workflows. Care and its documentation will less frequently be \"free-hand\". As routine aspects of care become digitally mediated and increasingly rote, RNs and other cl inicians can be expected to shift and expand their focus to more complex and nuanced \"high touch\" tasks that thes e technologies can not readily or appropriately accomplish. This w ould include communication, guidance and support of the patient/consumer and their families. There will likely be gr eater opportunity for interventions such as counseling, behavior change, and social and emotional support\u2014interventions that lie squarely with in the province of nursing practice. Redesigned Roles and Skill-Mix The new practice milieu\u2014where much of nursing and medical care is mediated and supported within an interoperable \"digital comm ons\"\u2014will support and potentially even require a much more effective integration of multiple disc iplines into a collaborative team focused on the patient's unique set of needs. Furthermore, interoperable EH Rs linked with personal health records and shared support systems will influence how these teams work and share clinical activities. It will increasingly be possible for providers to work on digitally-linked teams who will collaborate with patients and their fa milies no longer limited by \"real time\" contact. As the knowledge base and decision pathways that previously resided primarily in the clinicians' brain are transferred to \"clinical decision support\" (C DSS) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) modules of advanced HIT systems, some types of care most commonly provided by nurses can readily shift to personnel w ith less training or to the patient and their families. Similarly, many types of care prev iously provided by physicians and other highly trained personnel can be effectively provided by advanced practice and other specialty trained RNs. Furthermore, the performance of these funda mentally restructured teams will be monitored through the use of biometric, psychometric, and other t ypes of process and outcomes \"e-indicators\" extracted from the HIT infrastructure. Change in Time and Place of Care Care supported by interoperable digital networ ks will shift in the importance of time and place. The patient/consumer will need not always be in the same location as the provider and the provider need not always interact with the patien t in real time. As EHRs, CPOE systems, labs results, imaging systems, and pharmacies are a ll linked into the same network, many types of care can be provided without regard to locati on, as the \"care grid\" is available anywhere, anytime. Remote patient monitoring is expanding exponen tially. There is an ever growing array of biometric devices (e.g., indwelling heart or blood sugar monitors) that can collect, monitor and report information from the patient in real time, either in an institution or the home. Some of these devices can also provide direct digitally mediated care\u2014 the automated insulin pump and implantable defibrillators are two extreme examples. The implications of this for nursing will be c onsiderable and as of yet not fully understood (Abbott and Coenen, 2008). It is not clear how much of nursing care might be \"geographically untethered\" when HIT is fully implemented but it will likely be a significant subset of care, possibly in the range of 15 35 percent of what nurses do today. In words, for this proportion of care, nurses need not be in the same locale (or even the same nation) as their patients.

Efficiency and Outcomes HIT adoption is expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness of clinician interactions with each patient and the target population. EHRs and other HIT should lower the cost per unit of service delivered and/or improve the quality of care as measured by outcomes or achievement of other end points, such as increased adherenc e to optimal guidelines. HIT will lead to greater efficiency if it takes less time for a clinician to provide the same unit of service or if a lower-cost clinician now practicing with extensive HIT suppor t can now deliver the same type of care as a higher cost non-HIT supported pr ovider. Controlled \"time and motion\" studies that have compared clinicians doing the same task with and without HIT suppor t have produced mixed findings on time efficiencies gained across c linicians and settings. One area with emerging evidence is hospital nursing time saved in documentation, with studies showing a 23 24 percent reduction in documentation time (Poissant et al., 2005). These efficiency gains may be partially offset by the information demands of quality improvement initiatives and similar programs undertaken by a growing number of inst itutions (DesRoches et al., 2008). CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS The composition and distribution of the current RN workforce is diverging increasingly from workforce need to support the implementation of h ealth reform and related initiatives. Reversing a 15-year trend, a growing number of RNs are employed in hospital settings\u201462 percent of employed RNs in 2008 (U.S. Department of Hea lth and Human Services, 2010) compared with 56 percent in 2004 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Higher salaries in the acute care sector appear to have drawn RNs to hospitals from other health care settings as well as re-entrants into the workforce. Furthermore, only 10 12 percent of RNs work in ambulatory care settings\u2014settings where much of the system innovation is targeted yet where the evidence base for effective clinical nursing practice is under-devel oped. Moreover, current payment policy and employer behavior have pr oduced a nursing practi ce model (i.e., staffing composition and scope of practice) that is largely setting-defined rather than patient-centered, so coordination of care and managing transitions across settings has not developed as an integral part of nursing care. The recent Carnegie Founda tion report on the future of nursing education (Benner et al., 2009) noted that few schools natio nwide have clinical curricula that allow students to follow patients and families across time and institutional settings; consequently students clinical experiences focus on acute in-pa tient care and episodic car e in the health care settings. Finally the RN workforce is reported to be in the grips of a decade-long nursing supply shortage that is poised to worsen with the im pending exodus of a substantial number of retiring baby-boomers. Looming large among these retir ees are nursing faculty whose departure will impede the replenishment of the depleted RN ranks.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHEALTH CARE SYSTEM REFORM AND THE NURSING WORKFORCE F-11 Historically, the U.S. health care system has b een able to absorb the entire available supply of RNs. The wide geographic ava ilability of nurses, their deep and nimble skill set, and lower wages relative to physicians and other health care professionals have contributed to their employment in every setting where health care services are delivered. Between 2001 and 2008, total RN FTEs rose roughly 25 percent (Buerhau s et al., 2009) while the general population grew only 7 percent, continuing a decades-long pattern of rising RN to population ratios (Figure F-1). The behavior of health care institutions\u2014t he main employers of nurses\u2014influenced by government and health plan reimbursement policies, appear to be the main driver of RN demand, a demand that appears to be all but inexhaustibl e. The education sector has responded to that demand, producing nurses well-prepared to deliver acute care services largely in acute care settings, with a shallow skill set and thin distri bution in other areas such as ambulatory care, home-based and community-based care, and geriatrics and long-te rm care services. 02004006008001000 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 FIGURE F-1 RN-to-population ratio, 1980 2008.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlF-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH If the demand for RNs changes in response to th e system changes and incentives embodied in the health reform legislation and related ini tiatives, what will it take for the RN workforce respond in kind, and what are the implications fo r workforce planning? Viewing the future RN workforce through the lens of health reform would significantly re-c haracterize the supply shortage and thus re-direct policy actions to build , skill, and distribute an RN workforce that can meet the demands of a reformed health care delivery system (Bovbjerg et al., 2009). Increasing the presence of RNs in settings and positions that will assist the development of care management initiatives will require preparing RNs to direct team-based care management strategies and transitional care from ambulatory care practices, and re-assessing the need for a growing share of the nurses to fill staffing vacanci es in hospitals. Hospital vacancy rates derive from staffing levels that vary significantly across regions (Figure F- 2), and across hospitals within regions, and are largely determined local ly based on an estimate of the number of nurses needed to meet some pre-determined ideal th reshold (Goldfarb et al., 2008). Grumbach and colleagues (2001) remark on the absence of widely accepted standard for what constitutes adequate RN staffing levels in hospitals. A review of the evidence on the outcomes of RN staffing levels in hospitals does not produce a staf fing rate or configuration that consistently yields positive outcomes, in spite of substantia l cross-sectional associations between the number of RNs and hospital patient outcomes (Kane et al., 2007; Lankshear et al., 2005). Nonetheless, vacancy rates\u2014which are widely accepted as ev idence of supply shortages of RNs\u2014continue to be used in workforce planning efforts to estima te the shortfall in hospital RNs and drive policy action and educational system responses that su pport the diversion of RNs to hospitals and setting-specific models of nursing practice.

Re-tooli ng nursing education and revamping working conditions and salaries in ambul atory care will be needed to stem the flow of nurses to hospitals, both RN as well as advanced practice nurses. The growing evidence of the influence of prolonged hours of interns and resi dents on medical errors and adverse events has led to the introduction of regulations limiting thei r hours. This \"shortfall\" in medical resident hours has stimulated a demand for, and a gradual migration of, NPs to acute care settings. And while the shortage of primary care capacity would be expected to engender greater demand for all primary care providers includi ng NPs, barriers to pr actice interfere with their full employment in ambulatory care. Even in states where state practice acts allow NPs to practice fully and independently, the demand for NPs has been constrai ned by health plan pract ices (e.g., failure to be credentialed as primary care provi ders) and reimbursement policies. Getting the RN workforce required to support he alth care delivery reform will require a wholesale paradigm shift in the framework a nd context used to prepare and deploy the RN workforce and to forecast future requirements. This shift will be predicated on the degree to which the implementation of the health reform legislation \"recalibrates\" the demand for RNs. Payment reform that rewards effective coordination of care over inefficient use of acute inpatient services will demand RNs with skills in care management particularly for the complexly chronically ill, transitional care and community-based services. Payment reform that promotes the creation of medical homes will demand the production of RNs who can provide and direct interdisciplinary teams in the pr ovision of primary care services. Accountable care organizations that are responsible for the full range of hea lth needs of defined populations will demand RNs whose skills span from primary care to end-of-life care and who practice follows the patient and family/caregivers across the full range of settings including the home. And all of these innovations will require fully integrated, interopera ble HIT that will support health care teams in ways that are likely affect the eff ective use of all of their members. The challenges to achieving this RN workforce in the future are grouped in three general categories. The first challenge lie s in the health care marketplace. Currently nurses are hired by employers to fill vacant positions rather than to provide specific skills, perpetuating an employment pattern that is insensitive to diffe rent and potentially more efficient skill mix configurations. The healthcare mark etplace, and payers in particular, have not offered sufficient incentives for health care employers to demand a nursing workforce that aligns the skills of RNs more effectively with needs of patients and the health care system. There are few integrated delivery systems or ACO-type entitie s that are responsible for, and explicitly rewarded for, their overall performance across the settings that comprise their system of care rather than a single setting. In the main, financial pe rformance is captured and rewarded at the level of the individual setting (e.g., hospitals) a nd not at the system level (e.g., ACO), so the behavior of each setting is independent and driven by its own goals. Conseque ntly, hospitals lack the financial incentive to hire and deploy RNs to provide tr ansitional care if the outcome is reduced income in the form of reduced admissions. ACO-type organizations lack the incentive to employ RNs to provide care coordination and team management services if these entities are not rewarded for improved financial performance and quality outcomes that these services produce. The second challenge lies in the educational sector. As currently de signed primary nursing education prepares nurses to function in discrete settings rather than across settings (Benner et al., 2009) and as individual clin ical providers rather than team members. Team-based care and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlF-14 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH care coordination are not meaningfully integrat ed in primary nursing educational pedagogies. Reorienting nursing education to incorporate thes e themes will require significant redesign of both classroom and clinical education. Furthermore, primary nursing education is still largely focused on the acute care setting. Preparing RNs, in addition to advanced practice clinicians, to practice in ambulatory care settings where the demand for care is clearly growing will require a substantial shift in classroom e ducation but even a greater shift in the clinical practica for students. Finally, the scope and breadth of nursing education needed to meet the needs of reformed health care delivery will require as sessment of whether th e current educational modality\u2014where the majority of nurses complete their primary nursing education in associate degree programs\u2014produces the right mix of RNs a nd skills needed to enact these reforms. Without a change in demand, however, the educa tional system will continue to produce the RN supply\u2014the numbers and skill composition\u2014that it has in the past. Finally, workforce planning and forecasting will likewise require a comparable paradigm shift. Forecasting models based on current RN demand will not produce useful estimates to guide future policy, i.e., the capacity of the RN workfor ce to meet the needs of future models of health care services. The current RN workforce is deficien t in a number of dimensions to support health reform. Specifically, there is a shortage of RNs deployed to ambulatory care settings and a shortage of advanced practice nurses delivering primary care serv ices. There is a shortage of RNs trained and working as care managers direct ing and delivering care coordination for patients in acute and post-acute care systems. There is a shortage of RNs with sufficient training and experience in the full array of clinical practice an d team management skills that reorganized care delivery models will require. Estimating these shortages, and deve loping the pathway to resolving them argues for a wholesale new appr oach to assessing future nursing requirements and preparing and allocating nursing resources to meet those requi rements. Moreover, without a national, integrated approach to workforce plan ning, one that includes and obligates the critical stakeholders to the goals of an evidence-based and effectively-deployed health care workforce, forecasting efforts will produce estimates that ca nnot guide future workforce planning. In the absence of interdisciplinary collaboration, health care education a nd the supply forecasts it feeds will proceed as a decentralized, professionally-governed activity that produces estimates of health care workforce requirements that meet in dividual professional goals that may not serve the nation's need for an effectivel y prepared and deployed workforce. Further challenging these efforts w ill be incorporating the effects of fully integrated health information support, which available evidence sugge sts will significantly influence the skill mix needed to deliver health care services. HIT will be a key factor affecting the practice of nursing and medicine over the next generation, and its impact on nursing practice and workforce requirements is still very poorly understood. In the future, a more complex calculus will be needed to assess the overall change in efficiency or cost vs. benefit of HIT systems. It will be necessary to provide controlled evidence showin g the impact of an entire well calibrated HIT supported system within an ACO or other integrated delivery systems. Rather than a single end-point (like RN time spent charting) a full market basket of patient outcomes will need to be included as the end point in this equation. And th is assessment would also need to account for the fact that the ACO will likely be able to adju st the skill-mix of its HIT-supported workforce in order to deliver the same or higher level of care quality more efficiently. For example, this could be accomplished by substituting a higher percentage of lower salaried professionals who can extend their scope of practice w ith guidance from computerized clinical support systems.

For too long health services research and heal th workforce studies have not been effectively integrated. Studies testing various models for redesigning health care service delivery have focused primarily on the outcomes achieved by deliv ery system innovations in contrast to usual care but have not included an explicit assessme nt of the relative contributions of different configurations and skill sets of health care clinicians to the outcomes achieved. Health care workforce research has largely adopted a human capital approach\u2014i.e., st udies assessing supply and demand for various health care clinicians and factors contributing to recruitment and retention of health care workers\u2014with little tim e spent on assessing the optim al mix of clinicians and skills to achieve cost and quality outcomes. By failing to integrate these two analytic areas, we produce a health care workforce that is poorl y positioned to efficiently and effectively enact delivery system reforms that stand to improve system performance and costs. Demonstration projects that assess the effects of service delivery innovations a nd encourage a range of skill mix models as well as role differentiation (i.e., who performs which tasks) will grow the evidence base that is sorely needed to inform both heal th system redesign and workforce planning. Only a concerted and cumulative effort will produce the evidence needed to guide payment policy changes that support delivery sy stem and workforce reforms. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Se rvices should estab lish a government-wide inter-agency innovations research collaborative comprising all agen cies/departments engaged in health care service delivery and research, with the goal of tes ting new models to organize and pay for health care services and determining the workforce features critical to achieving desired cost and quality outcomes from these new models. The Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force (QuIC), established in 1998 harness the fede ral government's efforts in health care quality improvement, offers a prototype for such an initiative (AHRQ, 2001). Th e purpose of the QuIC was \"to ensure that all Fede ral agencies involved in pur chasing, providing, studying, or regulating health care services worked in a coordinated manner toward the common goal of improving quality care.\" Our proposed innovations research collaborative would span such agencies as the Veterans Health Administrati on, the Department of Defense, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National In stitutes of Health, and CMS. The new Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that will be established as part of health reform implementation (The Commonwealth Fund, 2010) woul d be an integral participant. Dedicated funding from each agency would be set aside to bu ild the pool of funds available to undertake the concerted body of research needed and in crease the target populations and workforce configurations studied to furthe r our understanding of how to most effectively structure these innovations. Private sector part nerships would be encouraged, especially with the payer community, since an appropriately-aligned paym ent policy is the linchpin to adopting new models of care by providers and demanding the workforce needed to enact them. Additional partnerships with organizations engaged in qua lity and outcomes measurement, such as the National Quality Forum, should likewise be pursu ed.

In addition to determining the skill mix configur ation that produces optimal cost and quality outcomes, a full assessment of the methods and processes by which those configurations are achieved will be needed. This assessment would explicate the range of policy and strategic initiatives that could be pursued to promote su ch configurations. Such skill mix changes have been of great interest to the UK National Health Services (NHS), who sponsored a systematic review of the literature on the shifting roles of he alth care providers (Sibba ld et al., 2004). In that review, which focused to a considerable degree on nursing, the authors offered a framework that captured the range of processes through which cha nges in the roles, and thus the skill mix, of health care providers occur (Box F-2). The author s further note certain ad ministrative or policy changes, largely at the interface between settings, that could likewise lead to shifts in roles and skill mix of providers (Box F-2). Dubois and Singh (2009) note that achieving optimal \"skill mix\" options requires taking a much more dyna mic approach to workforce utilization by exploring the full range of skill flexibility and skill development that could lead to newly configured roles and more effectively deployed st aff. This process woul d involve identifying and confronting any institutional and re gulatory barriers to achieving the staff configurations needed to meet the cost and quality outcomes of these delivery system innovations.

Over the years the federal government has invested considerable resource s in analytic efforts to estimate the future supply of and demand for doctors, nurses, and a range of allied health workers. Together the estimates from these activitie s have been used to estimate the shortfall or surplus in these health occupati ons. These efforts are flawed in several significant ways that affect their utility for future workforce planni ng. As discussed earlier the demand-based models are founded on current patterns of demand which we have shown for nurses to poorly conform to evidence-based models for effective nursing use. The supply-based models derive from current patterns of producing nurses th at are influenced in part by current demand and by current patterns of education that are no t well aligned with the future RN workforce requirements to support delivery system redesign. Finally, these models do not take into account the overlap in the skills and abilities of RNs and other health occupations, e.g., doctors, as well as other nursing personnel categories. In its 2008 report, \"Out of Order, Out of Ti me,\" the Association for Academic Health Centers (2008) calls for the cr eation of a national health work force planning body to provide a coordinated approach to health workforce planning that offers an integrated national strategic vision rather than decentralized multi-stakeho lder decision-making. This idea is echoed in provisions in the health reform legislation cal ling for the creation of a National Health Care Workforce Commission. Our proposed recommenda tion would support and augment the work of this Commission in two ways: (1) by creating an Advisory Group responsible for developing a range of options for building integrated skill-b ased workforce requirements models, and (2) by providing funding through AHRQ to explore ways to assess and compare the outcomes of health care services offered under a range of skill-mix configurations derived from these integrated requirements models.. These strategies would be founded on a comprehensive review of the literature and related resources illuminating the full range of workforce configurations employed in the delivery of health care services a nd, where available, associated outcomes.. The reorganization of health care servi ce delivery that will a ccompany many of the innovations included in health reform has potentially profound implications for RNs, whose broad scope of practice places them at the cross- section of virtually all health care settings. Redefining roles and responsibilities of health team members that such innovations will entail could significantly affect the skill mix of the team and of nursing in part icular. For example, HIT or other technological innovations ma y allow health care workers with less training to move into expanded roles with efficiency gains while mainta ining quality, e.g., lab techs rather than nurses recording and monitoring biol ogical responses to treatment changes; simultaneously these innovations may lead to improved care by moving c linicians into previously unmet clinical arenas, e.g., moving RNs into providing care management. In both instances these role redefinitions\u2014lab techs moving in to clinical lab monitoring from which nurses exit as they PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This recommendation provides strate gies to develop and evaluate a broad range of workforce configurations and assess their implications for health care workforce planning. Moreover, by shifting the focus from personnel sh ortages to skill shortage we i nvite a wider and more diverse array of policy options to meet the care delivery needs of the public with more effective skill mix configurations. Recommendation 3: Nursing education mu st become a full partner of health care system redesign through meaningful participation in redesign initiatives, and revamping its educatio nal enterprise to meet the needs of redesigned service delivery. Health care services redesign and the nursing educa tion enterprise are not well aligned, as noted in highlights from the recent Carnegie Foundation study on nursing education: \"A major finding from the study is that t oday's nurses are undereducated for the demands of practice. Previous researchers worried about the education-practice gap; th at is, the ability of practice settings to adopt and reflect what was being taught in academic institutions. Now, according to the authors, the tables are turned: nurse administ rators worry about the practice-education gap, as it becomes harder for nursing education to keep p ace with the rapid changes driven by research and new technologies.\" (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 2009). Delivery system redesign initiatives included in health reform depend upon a set of skills and experiences that nursing educat ion has yet to incorporate de monstrably into its pedagogy. Primary nursing education is still largely lo cated in the acute care domain, with students mastering the care of the acute manifestations of chronic disease rather than care management of complex chronic illness. Care coordination and management are not integral to the classroom and clinical activities of nursing students, and yet it is a role that nurses can and have ably assumed in delivery settings where such skills will be increasingly dema nded. Transitional care, which the evidence to date shows is a critical feature in preventing hospital readmissions and other adverse events, lies directly in the scope of nursing practice. Yet clinical education does not afford the opportunity to follow patients across health care settings. Thus transitional care, as well as all other cross-setting m odels of care, are infrequently practiced and thus even less frequently taught. Despite its in creasing recognition as the foundati on for effective care into the future, team-based care and multi-disciplinary ca re management remain if anything the province of classroom instruction and rarely connected to the prac tice setting. Primary care and community-based approaches to care represent a minority share of the nu rsing curriculum even as the demand for these services is predicted to grow. The consequen ce is the production of succeeding generations of nurses that are not we ll-positioned\u2014in numbers and skills\u2014to meet the needs of a redesigned delivery system. Meaningful collaboration between nursing education and health care delivery redesign will encourage the alignment in their go als, which is critical to their joint success. Opportunities to advance such collaboration, and mechanisms for its support, should be actively sought. For example, Medicare-funded pilot studies and demonstration program s testing programs that rely on nursing-led interventions, such as ACOs or tr ansitional care, should include representatives from nursing education\u2014its leadership as well as key stakeholders, such as the regulatory bodies that determine the terms and scope of nursing ed ucation and practice\u2014in activities associated PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlHEALTH CARE SYSTEM REFORM AND THE NURSING WORKFORCE F-19 with the design, review, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of these initiatives. In similar form, health professions schools testing models of inter-professio nal education and other models of team-based care education should include representatives from the clinical directors of medicine and nursing in health systems and other key stakeholders from the clinical practice communities. In reciprocal fashion, this collaboration shoul d inform nursing education as to where gaps exist in educational offerings and skills developm ent to meet the needs of a redesigned delivery system. Closing the gaps will involve thoughtful a ppraisal of where and how to integrate these new areas of knowledge and clinical experiences into the current curricular offerings. Faculty expertise will need to be developed in a number of these care models. The premium on clinical placements will require consideration of how simulation learning environments may augment current clinical experiences. HRSA should em panel a Technical Advisory Group whose purpose would be to make recommendations on the role and opportunities for rele vant agencies within the federal government to support the developmen t of new programmatic and curricular offerings to build this needed skill set, in cluding a full review of the grants and initiatives within Title VIII and other sources of federal funding for nursi ng education. The report from the Technical Advisory Group should include a discussion of the role of other critical stakeholders, e.g., state regulatory bodies, health care pr ivate foundations, professional associations , etc., in better aligning health professions education with the unfolding reforms from health care reform and related initiatives.

Group Health Home Care and Hospice Introduction From the time of Florence Nightingale when nursing introduced public health and hygiene principals to the care of wounde d soldiers, to the twentieth ce ntury establishment of advance practice nurses, nursing has been at the forefront of health care transformation. We are now challenged as the health care needs of the populati on change from an acute and infectious disease focus to that of an aging population with chronic di sease. The cost of health care is rising and the number of people who are poorly served by our health care system is increasing. Along with the change in the health care landscape we are facing a nursing workforce shortage and a nursing leadership shortage. By th e year 2025, it is estimated that we will have a shortfall of between 300,000 and a million nurses. F our out of every ten nurses will be over the age of fifty (Buerhaus, 2008). Moreover, by 2020 , 75 percent of the current nurse leaders will have left the nursing workforce (Hodes, 2009). The following briefs represent the creative and innovative thinking of nurse leaders to address our current and future challenges. Th ey were prepared for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing In stitute of Medicine Committee, by fellows of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Executive Nurse Fellows program. This is an advanced leadership program for nurses in senior executiv e roles in health serv ices, public health and nursing education who aspire to he lp lead and shape the U.S. hea lth care system. The program is designed to give nursing and nur ses a more influential role ac ross many sectors of the economy. Fellows in this program represent the expertise a nd leadership of today and the leadership of the future. These briefs include background on the needs, evidence-based innovations and most important, recommendations fo r healthcare in 21st century. The briefs include the following areas in health care and health care education: Transformational Partnershi ps in Nursing Education Innovative Nursing E ducation Curriculum Acute Care 1 The responsibility for the content of this article rests w ith the authors and does not n ecessarily represent the views of the Institute of Medicine or its committees and convening bodies.

In order to meet the challenges of the future we must embrace technology, foster pa rtnerships, encourage collaboration across disciplines and settings, ensure continuity of care and promote nurse-lead/nurse managed health care. Technology. Advances in technology open a new worl d in the provision of health care. The use of technology includes electronic health records, tele-health, remote monitoring, education through simulation and a host of as yet undiscovered innovations. Partnerships and Collaboration. The importance of partnering and collaborating extends beyond interdisciplinary care at th e bedside to nursing education-community partnerships, community and business partnerships and public and private partnerships. Continuity of Care Across Settings. Our current \"siloed\" system leaves significant gaps in care. Smooth transition of patients from settin g to setting is especi ally needed with the elderly and chronically ill populations. Nurse-lead and Nurse Managed Health Care. From the developing model of primary care community based programs to retail-bas ed nurse practitioner clinics, nurses are filling in the primary care gap. RECOMMENDATIONS Each brief includes an important set of r ecommendations specific to the area addressed. However, a number of universal recommendations emerge that direct the future of nursing and health care. Education. The current nursing education model is not adequate to meet the needs of the future. Education must develop new partne rships with the community, business and healthcare institutions. More emphasis and re sources must be directed to preparing master's and PhD level nurses. Public Policy. Solid funding sources are needed to support nurse practitioners, nurse managed community health programs and nursi ng education. Funding must cross settings from acute care to home and community base d care. Nurses must be included on local, state and national health care advisory and policy committees. Care Models. We must continue to develop inn ovative care models based on current successes such as the acute care agile self-directed nursing t eams, the rural healthy aging community model and school-based and community-based nurse managed clinics. These models should cross disciplines, foster collaboration and partner with communities, business and other organizations.

In order to make th is happen nursing must adapt education and curriculum to the new century, promote higher e ducation, advocate for in novative models of care and advocate for the health care and edu cation policy to sup port those innovations.

University of Kansas Teri A. Murray, Ph.D., R.N. Saint Louis University INTRODUCTION Although the nursing care environmen t has changed significantly ove r the past 30 years, little has changed in the educational methods used to prepare new nurses . Since the 1930s, most clinical education in nursing ha s been structured with a facu lty member supervising a small group of students on one or more in-patient units. Students usually move to new settings for each clinical rotation. This traditional model is h eavily dependent on nursing faculty and often requires students to wait for direct faculty su pervision. Students often are \"strangers\" to the registered nurses providing patient care in thes e settings. This arrangement can compromise the cohesiveness of the nursing team and limit opport unities for building professional relationships between students, registered nurses and other members of the health care team. Developing a more structured and cohesive partnership between the registered nurse a nd the student, both of whom are providing care to the same patients, has the potential to revitalize clinical education in nursing. BACKGROUND Since Buerhaus (2000) first documented the nursing shortage facing the United States, educational institutions have been challenged to increase capacity. The most commonly cited reasons for lack of nursing school capacity are a shortage of nursing faculty and availability of clinical sites (AACN, 2008). Over the last d ecade new partnership models have developed to finance the creation and expansi on of nursing programs, create acce ss to nursing education at all levels, expand and support faculty members, and increase capacity to - and experiences at- clinical sites for students. As early as 1993, the Robert Wood Johnson F oundation provided stimulus grants through Colleagues in Caring, a grass-root s, state by state initiative to bring together healthcare administrators, academics, state regulators, and le gislators. This early dialogue prompted states and health care providers to broaden financia l support for colleges of nursing, develop joint PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMATIONAL MODELS OF NURS ING ACROSS DIFFERENT CARE SETTINGS G-5 simulation training centers, and create new approaches to placing nursing students in clinical settings. The initial support from a major phila nthropic organization evol ved into centers for nursing workforce expansion in a number of stat es. The number of gra duates has increased, but is still not sufficient for future workforce needs (Buerhaus et al., 2009). New models for accelerated doctoral programs are key to producing more nursing faculty and innovative partnerships are imperative th e success of these programs. Pre-licensure nursing education is a costly e ndeavor. While healthcar e organizations have contributed to existing schools, others have acquired nursing schools as part of broader hospital acquisitions. Feeling the pressure of nursing shorta ges as they plan future organizational growth, large health systems have forged partnerships with private universities to open additional schools of nursing. Institutions such as DeVry, Kapla n, the University of Phoenix, and Western Governors University have business models th at can respond to market needs with rapid expansion. The International Univers ity of Nursing in St. Kitts, West Indies is the first off-shore US-based college of nursing. This sector can be e xpected to grow, especially as states and local communities respond to budget shortf alls in a downturn economy. INNOVATIONS Across the nation, innovative academic-service partne rships are re-envisioning the role of the registered nurse as clinical t eacher and facilitating 1:1 relati onships between nurses and students over extended periods of time (Allen et al., 200 7; Joynt and Kimball, 2008; Moscato et al., 2007). In these partnerships, students, facult y, and staff report that students have less unproductive time spent waiting for clinical su pervision and better socialization to the professional nursing role (Udlis, 2008). When clinical education is structured to facilitate relationships between students and nursing staff, the faculty role cha nges as well and includes more involvement with the professional develo pment of nurses as preceptors, coaches, and clinical teachers. Most importantl y, students and faculty are not viewed as visitors in the clinical setting, but rather as integral members of th e nursing team, committed to building cultures of quality and safety (MacIntyre et al., 2009). Many hos pitals are requiring facu lty to participate in internal continuing education and competency validation. Inn ovative partnerships are re- engineering the faculty role to ta ke advantage of what graduate pr epared faculty can bring to the clinical setting. The National Council of State Boar ds of Nursing (2008) reports a wide variation in clinical hours between schools of nursing. There is no ev idence linking any specific number of hours to improved student outcomes. A change in focu s from hours to demonstrated competencies, whether in simulation labs or clinical settings, w ould make more optimal us e of the clinical sites available for student experiences and help make education available to more students. Program evaluation studies that document the relative wo rth of breadth verses depth in the clinical experience will help academic-service partnerships move from traditional to evidence-based approaches. Universities and community co lleges are increasing their e fforts to adopt state-wide curriculum models, allowing for seamless trans ition between programs. These partnerships between associate and baccalaureate nursing prog rams create more efficient and effective educational advancement pathways for students. Recognizing the link between improved patient outcomes and baccalaureate nursing education (Aiken et al., 2003, Heller et al., 2000) and the need to build efficiencies in nursing educati onal programs, the state nursing schools in Oregon PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlG-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH (http://ocne.org) and Hawaii ( www.nursing.hawaii.edu) created Statewide Nursing Consortiums Curriculums that provide a seamless transition to a baccalaureate in nursing for nurses with associate degrees in one additional year of full-time study. These programs are creating reusable learning objects (i.e., case studies, simulation s cenarios, concept-based clinical learning activities) that are immediate, portable, accessible, and rea dy for on-demand education, suitable for a technology savvy student population. Initial outcomes from these programs are promising include an increase in the student's nationa l nursing certification rates and positive student learning outcomes (Tanner, 2009). Innovations in interdisciplinary education on college campuses include new health care models that are designed to produce collaborative learning among students in nursing, management, journalism and communication, and architecture programs (Melnyk and Davidson, 2009). These non-traditional academic partnerships br ing a variety of perspectives and expertise together that could define the future of education, health, and health care. The dramatic expansion of second-degree programs in nursing is producing a more liberally educated nursing workforce that should facilitate interdis ciplinary competence in practice settings. Partnerships between states are also tran sforming nursing education by creating access to educational opportunities across stat e lines. These inter-state collaborations between educational institutions are offering joint pr ograms that increase access to all levels of nursing education in rural and underserved areas in the United St ates through course sharing and collaborative program development across educational instituti ons (i.e., the joint Neonatal Nurse Practitioner program at University of California San Franci sco and University of Hawaii and The Nursing Educational Xchange). Although th ese opportunities are emerging, there is still work to be accomplished on a national level to further support inter-state partnership in nursing education. National nursing licensure at bot h the RN and Advanced Practice levels would allow the state boards of nursing to focus more on consumer protect ion in their state rather than the regulatory issues of granting state licenses. RECOMMENDATIONS Cultivating partnerships will provide many ave nues for building capacity in innovative ways for nursing education. Ten recommendations fo r the future of nursing education are: Create non-traditional partners hips within and outside of educational institutions; Explore opportunities for the creation and expansion of nursing programs through private partnerships and health care institutions; Develop, implement, and evaluate innovativ e academic-practice partnerships between nursing programs and acute care, primary car e, long-term care, community, and public health settings; Move from a time-based model of clinical nursing education to a competency based model, and evaluate the eviden ce to support this type of l earning in nursing education; Support the implementation and evaluation of state wide curriculum models between universities and community college systems; Expand interdisciplinary educat ional opportunities and programs; Champion to incr ease access to educ ational opportunities; Support research for evidenced based educationa l practices that challenge existing norms; PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Innovative partnerships between nursing education and nursing practice are essential if the nursing profession is to meet the challenges ahead. The dissemination of successful innovative models in nursing education requires evidence as well as creative and adaptive partnerships that are developed, nurtured, and evaluated.

Drexel University Lynne M. Dunphy, Ph.D., F.N.P.-B.C. Island Rosalie O. Mainous, Ph.D., A.R.N.P., N.N.P.-B.C. University of Louisville INTRODUCTION The changing landscape of healthcare in Amer ica requires that clinicians be skilled in responding to varying patient expectations a nd values; provide ongoing patient management; deliver and coordinate care across teams, setting, and time frames; and support patients' endeavors to change behavior and lifestyle\u2014e ducation which is in sh ort supply in today's academic and clinical settings (Institute of Me dicine, 2003). Nursing education needs to innovate at the micro and macro system level for the 21s t century. It cannot be business as usual. In order to truly transform car e, practice and education will n eed to partner on curriculum development and the professional socialization of the new nurse. BACKGROUND Innovation in academic settings, specifically colleges of nursing is often hindered by the pressure to meet educational and regulatory re quirements established by national organizations, accrediting agencies, and the state boards of nur sing that govern and set standards for nursing practice at both the baccalau reate and graduate levels (Melnyk and Davidson, 2009). These regulations should not be barri ers to innovation. Time-honored traditions in nursing education such as the current undergraduate clinical in struction model, a disease and illness-oriented curriculum, and the need for extensive clinical practice before matriculating in doctoral programs should be re-examined. There is a need to embrace technology-infused education, trans- disciplinary approaches to care, and translatio nal research. Students need to learn how to effectively assess and manage some of the most significant health problems currently confronting our society (e.g. mental health disorders, obesity, patie nt safety) and how to innovate changes in our health care system (Melnyk et al., 2009). Furthermore, a very uncomfortable, difficult question needs to be asked \"What should be the most appropriate degree for entry into nursing practice?\" Given the complexity and wi de-range of knowledge an d competencies that will be required of nurses in the 21st century, it is strongly recomm ended that nurses be prepared at the baccalaureate level for entry into practice. Moreover, the entry into practice debate needs to be resolved in the 21st century (Benner et al., 2010). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMATIONAL MODELS OF NURS ING ACROSS DIFFERENT CARE SETTINGS G-9 INNOVATIONS: TECHNOLOGY-INFUSED EDUCATION, TRANS-DISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO CARE AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH Simulation is one very effective tool that e xposes students to the complexity of clinical settings without the haza rds of real life (Ironside et al., 2009 ). Future nursing curricula need to develop interdisciplinary simulation scenar ios focusing on collaboration and crucial conversations so that students can learn how to deal with ineffective pr ofessional relationships and unsafe practice in a controlled environmen t (AACN, 2005). Trans-di sciplinary or Inter- professional models of simula tion and debriefing can examine and dissect failed communication in health profession's education and result in a series of reco mmendations to improve health care environments and patient outcomes. The curricul um for the 21st century needs to provide an opportunity for future health care providers to pa rticipate in collaborative education to obtain the necessary advocacy skills to promote a safe, healthy work environment for the patients they serve. Additionally, with the rapid expansion of knowledge, the development of information appraisal and navigation skills are essential for future nurses (Melnyk et al., 2009). Trans-disciplinary or Inter-profess ional models of education are at the core of new type of dedicated education unit: one that educates nurses, physic ians, pharmacists, and other professionals depending on the type of patient needs addressed. De dicated education units have previously implemented best practi ces utilizing the staff nurse as educator (Moscato et al., 2007). This new model of education is broader, more in clusive, and seeks to fi nd commonalties in the cultures of both service and academe and may provid e an ideal site for f aculty practice as well. As a starting point, a hospital environment is chosen as an exemplar to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. Chief nursing officers would dedicate select un its and develop methods to choose seasoned nurses to work in the new environments as change agents. Clinical educators in nursing and other disciplines would establish daily rounds with input from all students at varying levels based on Benner's Novice to Expe rt (Benner, 1984). More experienced students would mentor the novice. A mode l of leveled reflective learning has been described in Sweden utilizing different hospitals for different levels of learning with in the context of the dedicated education unit (Lindahl et al., 2009). Nurses, hospitalists, and other health professionals, are educ ated in teaching pedagogy and contribute to the education and ev aluation of the students. This i nnovative model also facilitates a better understanding of what each discipline contributes to the overall plan of health improvement. Students are exposed to multiple faculty members who share responsibility for students and students become a member of the team (Budgen and Gamroth, 2007). Trans- disciplinary team meetings will periodically assess the adequacy of the model, the experience of the student, and the areas for growth. BUILDING THE SCIENCE It has been well-documented that the nursi ng profession faces a serious shortage of nursing faculty, as well as a severe dearth of underrepresented minority (U RM) faculty (Potempa et al., 2008; Sullivan, 2004), that has dramatic implications for, and is a threat to, the future of nursing. In order for nursing to be a truly resona ting force for health in the 21st century, it is essential that we grow the sc ience of nursing and demonstrate its effectiveness in fostering health. The case can be made that the production of masters and doctorall y prepared nurses is more critical than a focus on preparation of Regi stered Nurses. Difficult decisions must be made.

Advanced Practice Nurses across the board are needed; nurse faculty, nurse leaders a nd nurse scientists are all in high demand. Masters Entry into professional nursing pr ograms has brought a needed cadre of adult learners with broad-based backgrounds into nur sing that enhance the discipline. The emergence of the professional doctorate (DNP) is integral to supporting disciplinar y growth. We promote a view of the practice doctorate as one not divorced from research but rather additive to the development and use of science. But this wi ll not be enough. A solid background in science, scientific inquiry, a nd the scientific basi s of health is essential to develop health care innovation. RECOMMENDATIONS The authors propose strategies to shape the future of healthcare by creatin g models of nursing education focused not only on curriculum cha nges, but also on transforming the student population, integrating the science and research in the curriculum and influencing health care policy. Curriculum and Technology Create truly unique Trans-disc iplinary Simulation Centers across the country where students from the health disc iplines of nursing, health professions, and medicine will be exposed to the complexities of teamwork situations within the clinical setting. Develop curriculum well-grounded in dis ease prevention, health promotion, and screening, and public health. In clude greater emphasis on the aging, older adult, ethics, genetics, public speaking, and wr iting skills (Sau deret al., 2006). Develop sufficient technology sk ills to better support in creased knowledge management including point-of- care technology. Include a nurse educator role in al l master's and doctoral programs. Increased emphasis on global health and know ledge development at all educational levels. Teach students to deal with the ambigu ities of the health care environment. Transforming the Student Population Increase the number of BSN accelerated and Masters Entry in Nursing programs designed for second degree students. Increase doctoral student enrollment esp ecially those of UR M (Kim et al., 2009). Partnership models between research intensiv e institutions and schools with less research are essential. Models that support early pr ofessional movement to the doctorate are essential. Integrating Science and Research Focus on interpreting clinical data and managing improvement. Cultivate disciplinary knowledge across all le vels of curricula based on an understanding of the science of the discip line and the scientific proce ss (Potempa and Tilden, 2004).

The hospital has been the center fo r acute care delivery for more th an a century. There are three major problems with this \"brick and mortar\" model of acute care: Hospital care is the highest cost healthcare and demand is increasing. Hospital care is associated with complications. Poorly designed systems result in errors that compromise patient care and safety. Hospital care is inadequately integrated w ith prevention and post- acute care systems. Care transitions between providers and settings are fragmented. The present acute care hospital is largely de pendent on the over 50 percent of registered nurses in the US who work in hospitals. The pred ominant hospital role of nurses is to care for human bodies and prepare patients and families to leave the hospital as soon as possible. This care delivery model is labor intensive and pred icted to break down as workforce shortages escalate. CARE TEAM OF THE FUTURE: AGILE TEAMS, PRAIRIE LAKES HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WATERTOWN, SOUTH DAKOTA A medical-surgical unit care deliv ery model referred to as \"Ag ile Teams\" replaced a \"Total Patient Care\" care delivery model. In the Total Pa tient Care model, a nurse is assigned a number of patients to care for over a shift. The nurse is often task-o riented with responsibility for medication administration, documentation, and ot her patient care procedures with some assistance from unlicensed personnel. Such models are often fragmented emphasizing the nurse's plan of care for the patient during the shift inst ead of focusing on the in terdisciplinary team's plan to transition the patient to the next level or care. In the Agile Team Model, a team of three beds ide care providers is assigned to care for a cohort of ten to twelve patients. Every team ha s at least one experienced professional nurse but team composition varies. For example, the team ma y consist of three registered nurses or, two registered nurses and a licensed practical nurse or, one registered nurse and two other types of providers. This allows for flexible and productive staffing. Self-organization allows the team to determine how to best provide care for the pa tient cohort depending on patient needs and team capabilities. The traditional care plan report has been eliminated in favor of a daily team planning conference to discuss patient care. The team ente rs data into an electronic record and between PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlG-14 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH meetings, any team member can a ccess the record to view or a dd current information about the patient. This model has improved unit productivity and provided staffing flexibility without compromising patient care. Unit productivity improved from 10.2 hours per patient day to 7.5 hours per patient day. The hospital has adopte d the philosophy of \"doing less with less\" as a sustainable model. The outcome is a high qual ity product with the least amount of waste. FUTURE SCENARIOS While the \"Agile Care Team\" model is an improve ment within the current state of acute care, we need to consider a future that embraces technology and extends beyond the walls of the current hospital system. Imagine the manual care de livery system transformed into one that is managed virtually. An interdisciplin ary care team is located in a cont rol center with capability to plan, monitor and administer treatment to patient s in hospitals or homes. The control center is connected to the patient at the care scene throug h multiple electronic data transfer interfaces. Treatment is administered through technology incl uding robotics or by unli censed staff directed to complete tasks through devices such as web cams, bluetooths, bar code medication verification scanners, and other information tr ansfer devices. Complex tasks once only executed by a highly trained provider can now be comple ted through robotic and information systems. Errors in care are eliminated as providers in the control center fo cus on the treatment plan instead of distractions at the care scene such as comp leting tasks (including me dication administration), looking for supplies, completing paperwork, managing interruptions, and moving patients. Nurse- to-patient ratios, increasing nursing time in direct care, nursi ng stations, and bedside change-of-shift reports between registered nurses are now obsole te. Now the professional nurse in the control center is a provide r of care integration, expert su rveillance, and management of imminent clinical needs such as pain management and emergency intervention. Imagine this. The hospital of the future is not \"a place\" but rather a coll ection of inpatient and outpatient facilities as well as patient homes interconnected through a shared information technology infrastructure. Care will no longer be defined by episodic events such as a hospital stay but rather by the episode of care required across settings and providers to fully recover from an illness or manage an exacerbation of a chroni c disease. Patients and their families will access a \"control center\" website tailored to their needs in their homes to connect to the acute care team and manage their own care. Home monitoring devices will provide data and continuous feedback about clinical status. Readmissions to the hospital due to failure of care protocols and inadequate support will be markedly reduced. Healing will occur at home. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CREATING THE FUTURE Innovative approaches already exist that forecast this model in the future: \"e-ICU\" technology that connects rural hospital ICUs to the e xpertise of larger trauma hospitals; Bar-code medication verification systems and electronic medication administration records; Bedside access to medications and supplies; robotics; PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMATIONAL MODELS OF NURS ING ACROSS DIFFERENT CARE SETTINGS G-15 Interdisciplinary care teams that include engineers to identify poorly designed work processes; and Tele-home health that monitors patients who at home. RECOMMENDATIONS We need to change the way we think about our traditional brick and mortar care delivery system. The emerging changes we believe will be most influential include the following: Human Caring Models. Bent and colleagues (2007) reminds us nursing is the discipline that creates the path to adva nce human health, dignity, and re latedness no matter what our advances in technology may be. Nursing's body of knowledge related to human caring is essential to the healthcare system and must be incorporated into the design and development of any future care delivery m odels. Care delivery models with virtual processes can be designed to maintain hu man relationships for caring and healing. Hospital Workplace Transformation. Initiatives such as Transforming Care at the Bedside and Return to Care empower front li ne teams to make ch anges to care delivery processes that are patient centered and add value. In addition, Magnet credentialing supports cultures of transformational leadership and infrastructure to support innovations and development of new care delivery models . Human factors engineering in hospital units eliminates wasteful, unsafe work-ar ounds and establishes reliable systems for defect-free care. These initiativ es demonstrate the ability of providers to self-organize and innovate for care model transformation. Interdisciplinary Care Teams. Care delivery teams will be interdisciplinary and connect in ways to be most effective to meet patient needs. They will evolve from current models in which team members operate in organizational silos or fo rced matrices (e.g., committees) within organizations. Instead of nur ses developing the patient's care plan for the hospital stay, interdisciplin ary teams will plan the patient's transition to the next level of care. New team roles will develop to manage the transformed system. Care delivery models will be designed with interfaces to e ffectively coordinate services across multiple disciplines and settings. Clinical and ther apeutic decision making will be collaborative. Shared Information Environments. Rich, accessible information environments will complete the transition from manual care m odels to e-care with human caring. Care delivery models will be designe d to provide access to the info rmation needed for clinical and therapeutic practice. Models will be designed to provide the information environment required for critical thinking and professiona l judgment, open access to records, and fully wired patient care settings. Documentation will become a byproduct of the care process, not its own process. SUMMARY Changing the way we think includes discarding our current models of work and replacing them with something altogether different.

Centura Health INTRODUCTION Nurse-led initiatives are at the forefront of the management of chronic diseases\u2014a significant health care focus of the 21st century. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the leading causes of death and disa bility in the United States are chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes. In absolute terms, more than 1.7 million people die of a chronic disease annually in this country. For 25 million people, chronic, disabling conditions cause major limitations in activity ; the prolonged course of illn ess and disability result in extended pain and suffering and decreased quality of life for millions of Americans. The costs in human and economic terms of these diseases are incalculable; paradoxically, these diseases are also the most preventable. This Brief presen ts five nurse-led innova tions in which chronic disease management is approached in cost-eff ective and practical ways, using prevention and health promotion orientations. TRANSFORMACION PARA SALUD The Transformacion Para Salud Program demonstrat ion project at the Larry Combest Community Health and Wellness Center, a nurse-managed primary care center. Advance Practice Nurses oversee four Promotores , who are certified community health workers (CHW). The CHWs apply the Transformation for Health conceptual framework based on Paulo Freire's educational philosophy and developed in the School of Nursing at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (Esperat et al., 2005, 2008), to provide intensive care coordination involving home visitation and telep honic contacts. Clients and families served, who belong to health disparate groups residing in a medically underserved area , are enrolled in the chronic disease management program. Beyond primary medical issues, in applying the transformation framework, the interdisciplinary t eam takes into account social determinants of health in care delivery, and invol ves engagement of a community advisory board in the program implementation. Within the first year of implementation, improvement in both primary PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Cost effectiveness analyses will be conducted at the e nd of the project period. A major challenge is to maintain sustainability of the program beyond the grant period because services are not reimbursable through third part y payors at this time. INTENSIVE PRIMARY CARE The St. Vincent's Nurse-Managed Health Center (STV-NMHC) is opera ted by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) School of Nursing. The mission of STV-NMHC is to provide comprehensive, quality primary care to uninsur ed residents of the Galveston community. The clinic opened in the im mediate aftermath of Hurricane Ik e and is supported by UTMB based on the assumption that the practice can decrease hosp italizations in the patients served resulting in cost savings to the hospital. The Center operates using Intensive Primary Care, designed to serve adults with chronic health problems and based on the premise that this segment of the patient population need more \"intensive\" primary care interv entions just as some patients in hospitals need a different level of care in intensive care units. Nurse practitioners , in partnership with nurse case managers and a highly in tegrated staff, assess patients holistically and address barriers to care and self care. A comprehensive Quality Improvement Program using the Chronic Care Model is in place to address all aspects of care. A new electronic health record tracks outcomes, such as clinical status, functional status, pati ent satisfaction, self management goals, access to care, and practice management functions such as the billable services, as well as cost effectiveness. Barriers encountered include bur eaucratic issues inherent in large academic settings, as well as the need to meet state requirements of medical oversight and practice protocols. A recent change in prescriptive au thority oversight has added to the paperwork burden. Changes in legislations removing oversig ht for nurse practitione rs would significantly help STV-NMHC and similar practices. THE NURSING MOBILE HEALTHCARE PROJECT The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey School of Nursing (UMDNJ-SN), in a collaborative, joint partne rship initiative with the Children's Health Fund, has implemented a nurse-faculty managed Mobile Healthcare Pr oject, designed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of medically underserve d patient populations in four Ne w Jersey cities. Since March 2006, patients have been treated fo r both acute and chronic illnesse s within the scope of practice of Advanced Practice Nurses. The Project serves as a practice site for nursing and medical faculty, and as a clinical rotation for nursing and medical students. Mobile nurse-managed centers enable the deeper penetr ation of this much needed serv ice in underserved communities. This Project is one visionary approach to the Institute of Medici ne's call for the improvement of quality of care through the restructur ing of clinical education, with nursing in leadership roles. Outcomes are tracked using a structured proce ss. One of the main Project outcomes is cost effectiveness, because it util izes faculty-supervised nursing and medical students and an interdisciplinary mobile health team staff. Th is project is in partnership with Project's Community Advisory Board, consisting of representatives from the community-based organizations. Challenges include efforts to e xpand the same reimbursement mechanisms now afforded to fixed site clinics to mobile nurse-managed centers by third party payors.

NURSE MANAGED HEALTH CENTERS Migrant Health Services, Inc. (MHSI) is a HRSA funded voucher program whose primary goal is improving the health status of Hispan ic migrant and seasonal agricultural workers (Guasasco et al., 2002; Lausch et al., 2003). In Minnesota and North Dakota, MHSI has established four seasonal satelli te nurse-managed health centers (NMHC), two mobile units, as well as four year-around NMHC to meet the health and educat ional needs of farmworkers. Services include assessment, health promotion, disease prevention and self-management, health risk assessment, counseling, and health educatio n (Guasasco et al., 2002). Patient outcomes have dramatically improved, such as a significant decrease in patients' hemoglobin AlCs. Another innovation was the development of Cluster Clinic s, a series of nine-eleven mini-clinics, physically arranged so patients can circulate a single site for two or three hours to receive medical care, diabetes education, and counseling. An interdisciplinary di abetes team provides health care, education, and couns eling according to the American Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Recommendations. The educ ation and counseling address su ch issues as nutrition, diet, exercise, tobacco use, foot care, and access to r ecommended services and re ferrals (Heuer et al., 2004). Challenges include continuity and the availabi lity of funding for this invisible, bilingual, mobile population. CENTURA HEALTH AT HOME Centura Health At Home (CHAH) is the larges t home care organization in Colorado and is part of the Centura Health system, a not fo r profit, faith based health care system. CHAH instituted an interact ive Telehealth Program in 2004 for c ongestive heart failu re patients with high recidivism. Telehealth nurses monitor pati ents each day in real time and can perform a video visit enabling one-on-one inte ractions with the patient in their home, responding to real- time diagnosis specific questions. Vital signs, oxygen saturation rate s, and auscultation of heart and lung sounds using NASA technology stethoscopes is collected though the patient may be up to 50 miles away. The telehealth nurse is able to intervene at the right time to address disease- related issues, and to determine if a home visit is indicated. The te lehealth nurse does all of this either from the office or from their home th rough a secure website. With a caseload of 40 patients, the telehealth nurse can monitor and do video visits on 12 patients a day as opposed to a home care nurse who averages five patients a da y with a case load of 20 patients. Telehealth allows the nurse to intervene at the right time while the home care nurse may not know the status of patients until a home visit is conducted; by th e time the home care nurse visits, the patient may already be back in the hospital. Today, over 900 Centura Health patients have received telehealth services. The number of hospital re-a dmissions within 30 days of hospitalization for this group is 9.7 percent, compar ed to hospitals nationwide whic h have a readmission rate of over 20% for primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Three years of tracking of this program shows that 81% have remained wit hout need for further hospitalizations. The intervention has successfully kept patients fr om being readmitted to the hospital, with tremendous savings (estimated $5.2 million) in healthcare dollars, show ing that this technology is the future for home care agencies.

In order to continue and sustain these initiatives the following must occur: Establish solid local, state and federal funding for nurse-led initiatives in chronic care. Support the development implementation and evaluation of innovative nurse-led models of care. Fund education initiatives to train nurse leaders in business, public policy, outcome monitoring and quality improvement. Eliminate regulatory and oversight barriers th at inhibit the ability of advance practice nursing to provide primary care. Nursing is shaping health care of the future by creating innovative programs that are effective, low-cost and reach the pop ulations that most need the care.

Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota Jane Kirschling, R.N., Ph.D. University of Kentucky INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND One antidote to the burgeoning cr isis in healthcare is to re -conceptualize our care delivery model from episodic disease management to living with chronic and life-limiting diseases and injuries. Palliative care, which includes hospice care at the end-of -life, offers a promising method for actualizing this focus. At the core of palliative care is the essence of nursing\u2014car e and caring. When people are struggling to manage thei r health problems, they need astute clinicians who can help interpret their responses to diseases and treatments, advocate for holistic and effective care, facilitate relationships with providers, and provide physical, emotional, and psycho-spiritual care. Although contemporary models of pa lliative care include end-of- life and bereavement care, they are broadly applicable for all people who are experiencing acute, chr onic, or debilitating conditions from the time of diagnosis. Nurses have been instrumental in the evoluti on of hospice and palliative care in Europe and the United States. Dame Cicely Saunders, who was a nurse, physician, and social worker, established the world's first hospice in London in the 1960s. Florence Wald, a colleague of Saunders, and a former dean of the Yale School of Nursing, established The Connecticut Hospice, in New Haven, as America's first hospice in 1974 (NHPCO, 2008). According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Orga nization, 1.45 million patients received hospice services in 2008, including 38.5 perc ent of all persons who died in the United States that year. Nurses comprised the largest number of hospi ce providers involved in that care. (NHPCO, 2009). Registered nurses, as well as advanced practi ce nurses, have also played leading roles as members of interdisciplinary teams in the development of palliative care programs. These teams focus on improving quality of life through pain and symp tom management, enhanced communication and decision-making support, and fac ilitation of safe transitions between care settings (Morrison and Meier, 2004 ). Palliative care programs began to emerge in hospitals in the late 1980s and have evolved to include program s focused on intensive- care, long-term care, community-based care, and pediatric care. Between 2000 and 2005, these programs increased by 96 percent in United States hospitals (AHA, 2007). The demand for these services will continue PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

NURSING AT THE FOREFRONT OF POLICY The National Consensus Project, chaired by Betty Ferrell, PhD, RN, FAAN, which represents four Coalition organizations (the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, the Center to Advan ce Palliative Care, the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association, and the National Hospice and Palliative Care Or ganization) has developed and disseminated the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Pallia tive Care (2004 and 2009).These guidelines serve as a national standard for informing providers, pol icy makers, and consumers about the attributes of high quality palliativ e care (National Consensus Project fo r Quality Palliative Care, 2009). THE NURSE AS A KEY WORKER Patients with palliative care needs often have multiple providers and use several different institutions. This scenario is especially true in pediatrics. To ensure continuity and avoid fractured care, it is essential that the care follow the patient and family. Palliative care provides aggressive symptom manageme nt, coordination of care, a nd psycho-social support with improved linkages to all sites of care (Remke, 2007). A designated \"key worker,\" supported by an interdisciplinary team, is essential to caring for these patients and families in a holistic way (Field and Behrman, 2003). Often this key worker is a nurse who can bri ng in other members of the team as needed. Nurses are experts in coor dinating both the physical and psychosocial care; so they are ideal providers to serve as key wo rkers to provide continuity of care across the continuum of care and through various settings. An example of this model is the Pain and Pall iative Care Program at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota that provide s palliative care to inpatients, patients in their homes, and in a palliative care clinic. The nurse who is the key worker visits patients wherever they are, and assists with care coordination, medication reconciliation, and tr ansition arrangements. These interventions take place in any location, includin g other inpatient facili ties. These \"continuity visits\" encourage consistency and smoot h transitions across sites of care. NURSE PRACTITIONERS AS PALLIATIVE CARE CONSULTANTS On the other end of the age continuum, the Pa lliative Care Center of the Bluegrass, in Lexington, Kentucky employs nurse practitioners who serve as external palliative care consultants to nursing home staff, residents, and their families. These consults can be initiated by physicians or nursing directors at the nursing homes. The nurse practitioners provide both clinical consultation and edu cation to nursing home staff, focusing on symptom management, advance care planning, patient and family communication, and s upporting transitions to hospice services, if needed. Both Medicare and Medicaid will provide reimbursement for this type of external consultation provided by a nurse prac titioner. Nursing homes who have used this consultation service report improved pain and symptom management, increased patient satisfaction, and less emergency room transfers. This Center has been nationally recognized as PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Advanced practice nurses in critical care units , such as Margaret Campbell, PhD, RN at Detroit Receiving Hospital in Michigan a nd Patrick Coyne, MSN, APRN, at Virginia Commonwealth University, have also demonstr ated the effectiveness of interventions by palliative care services within their instituti ons. Campbell has developed protocols that promote both physical and emotional comfort to patients and families during the process of weaning patients from mechanical vent ilation (Campbell, 1998). Coyne and colleagues have demonstrated significant improvements in their patients with pain, nausea, depression, anxiety, and shortness of breath (Coyne, 2009; Khatcheressian, 2005). A COST-EFFECTIVE MODEL OF CARE DELIVERY care interv entions enhance physical and ps ychological well-being, enhance communication between patients, families, and caregivers, increase patient and family satisfaction, and facilitate tran sitions through complex care delivery environments. Beyond these benefits, palliative care tends to be a cost-eff ective model of care delivery. A recent multisite study by Morrison and colleagues (2008) demonstrated significant reductions in pharmacy, laboratory, and intensive care un it costs. In their study, whic h included over 5,000 hospitalized palliative care patients, the palliative care patients who died had a net savings of $4908 per hospital admission, and palliative care patients w ho were discharged alive had a net savings of $1696 per admission, in comparison to matched cohor ts of comparable patients who received usual care. RECOMMENDATIONS Palliative care is a model that is consistent with basic nursing valu es, which include caring for patients and their families regardless of their age, culture, socioeconomic status, or diagnoses, and engaging in caring relati onships that transcend time, location, and circumstances. The following recommendations enhance the role of nur sing in palliative care and enhance care for both patients and families: Support the essential contribu tions of registered nurses and advance practice nurses within the evolving model of palliative care in the United States. Support nursing education and research that advances the palli ative care model. Use the palliative care model as a framew ork when addressing the needs of the chronically ill population. Ensure that nurses with palliati ve and end-of-life care expertise are part of local, state and national health care advisory committees. Ensure that representation on MedPac includes nursing with expertis e in palliative and end-of-life care.

National Nursing Centers Consortium and Public Health Management Corporation Susan Birch, R.N., M.B.A. Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association, Inc. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Nurses across this country are equipped a nd capable of meeting the diverse needs of communities by providing leadership, engaging stakeholders and developing and implementing evidence-based models of care to close the ga p between preventive and primary care services. The overall health improvement of the nation requires evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention. Nurses design and implement these solutions in a multitude of settings including public health, school-b ased health centers, nurse mana ged health centers, convenient care clinics, federal health cente rs, and home health. Nurses wo rking to addre ss the needs of community health have firsthand knowledge in understanding the healthcar e needs of a diverse population, especially in underins ured and uninsured populations facing a widening rift in quality care (Hurley et al., 2005). As far back as 1986, the Office of Technol ogy Assessment (OTA) released a groundbreaking case study about nurse practitioners (NPs) concluding that the quali ty of care provided by NPs is equivalent to and in some cases better than physicians (Safriet, 1992). Using the advanced practice skills of nurses, tec hnology builds capacity to move seamlessly from the individual-to- community level data to build statewide quality scorecards. The Common wealth State Scorecard on Health System Performance for 2009 (Moody and Silow-Carroll, 2009) can look vastly different by 2015 by improving access and preven tive care, ensuring equitable care, and decreasing avoidable hosp italizations that will help lead to improved healthy lives for the country. EVIDENCE BASED MODELS Nurses working in a predominat ely Hispanic community, using Como Convivir Con Su Artritis (How to Live With Your Arthritis), expande d the healthcare team by recruiting leaders from the Hispanic community to be trained to teach the Stanford Self-Management Model, which provides an evidence-based framework to he lp patients understand their role in chronic disease management. Classes were held at local community sites and helped to reach a vulnerable population (Lorig et al., 1999). In part nering with patients, nurses helped patients gain a better understanding of their chronic c ondition and improve medication adherence.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlG-26 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH In the African American community, high blood pressure (HBP) is one of the most common chronic disease in the U.S. A study led by Dr. Martha Hill, the dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, demonstrated how a health care team led by a nurse practitioner, a community health worker and a physician cons ultant successfully lo wered blood pressure by 44% as compared to control group. By lowering blood pressure, the men in the study also benefited from fewer signs of h eart and kidney damage, all of wh ich lead to lower healthcare costs. The nurse practitioner and healthcare t eam worked in a community setting and providing primary care interventions. An important highlight is that the health care team worked with high- risk African American males in an urban community. The multidisciplinary NP led team, ensured patients received regular health care services and established lasting, trusting relationship that led to life style changes ultimately leading to improved hypertension management (Hill et al., 2003). Nurses working in the community play a critical role in health promotion and disease prevention. A study by Dr. Loretta Sweet Jemmott, Director of the NINR Hampton-Penn Center to Reduce Health Disparities, demonstrated how bl ack nurses working in schools, health clinics, and other primary care settings helped at risk ad olescents learn the importa nce of using safer sex practices to reduce their exposure to HIV inf ection. The nurses used various evidence-based interventions designed such as audiovisual demonstrations, technical skill building demonstrations, role-playing, and di scussions to engage the adoles cents in protecting themselves and others in their community from HIV infection (Jemmott et al., 1998). The Nurse-Managed Health Center (NMHC) is an evidence-based model that provides care to 2.5 million patients across the country. Servic es provided in NMHC include primary care, health promotion and disease pr evention services to medically underserved patients living in both rural and urban areas (NNCC, 2009). They strengthen the nation's health care safety-net by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or insura nce status. Services are offered in easily accessible locations such as schools, ho meless shelters, senior centers, churches and public housing developments by a wide array of health care professi onals, including nurse practitioners serving as primary care providers, re gistered nurses, health educators, behavioral health specialists, community outreach workers and collaborating physicians. For many patients, the centers are their only option for accessible and affordable care. In addition to the incredible menu of services provided, NMHC are cost effective as demonstr ated by researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health who analyzed Uniform Data System (UDS) data from the Bureau of Primary Health Care for 1996 to 2001 found that medi cal encounter costs at nurse-managed federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) were 11 percent less than encounter costs with other providers (Bureau of Primary Care, 2009). Convenient care clinics (CCC) are a rapidly expanding, affordable, ac cessible, consumer- driven health care alternative. There are close to 1,200 of these clinics in high-traffic retail outlets, often with a pharmacy adjacent, in more than 30 states and the District of Columbia, reflecting a capacity to see more than 17 millio n patients annually, a number that is easily scalable (CCA, 2009). Generally open seven da ys a week, with exte nded weekday hours, patients are seen on a walk-in basi s and visits typically take 15 20 minutes. Common treatments and diagnoses include cold/fl u, rashes/skin irrita tion, and muscle strains or sprains. CCC clinicians, the majority of whom are nurse prac titioners, also provide immunizations, physicals, and preventive health screenings. CCCs comple ment the medical home by connecting patients to appropriate levels of care. The low cost a nd accessibility of CCCs also lessen demand on emergency rooms.

The new vision of health for Northwest Colorado includes evidence based programs, best practi ce models and visible amenities encouraging wellness, prevention and h ealth. By segmenting the population into five groups: Healthy Beginnings (0 3 years), Healthy Growing (3 19 years), Healthy Living (19 49 years), Healthy Aging (50 years and up) and Healthy Endings (all ages), the VNA has created a continuum of services and an integrated model of service delivery. Thr ough early identification and detection, and community health education, residents are channeled into primary care and a true medical home model. In the past year the VNA has opened a hospice and palliative care residence, implemented an award winning \"A ging Well\" program, and opened a Federally Qualified community health center. Nursing le adership has been central to the holistic, community-based vision. RECOMMENDATIONS Policymakers, funders, educators and practiti oners must look beyond the medical model as the sole solution to community health needs and recognize the contri bution nursing and nurse practitioners (NPs) are making to primary care and the health of the entire community. The following recommendations strengthen th e nursing role in future innovations. Develop and implement performance indicato rs like those used by the Commonwealth Fund's State Scorecard, to monitor whether th e health improvement strategies are being implemented as intended and whether it is having the intended impact. Require the insurance industry to recognize and fund nurse practitioners as primary care providers with a full scope of practice. Require nurse participation on national qual ity committees charged with developing and implementing health information solutions, public health, community and school-based health, development of performance measures, reimbursement formulas, scientific research, clinical guidelines, and potential busin ess solutions to help health reform in our country. Increase the awareness of our legislative lead ers and policy makers of the role and impact of nurses using social marketing and target ed education of the insurance companies, boards of health, and business commun ity especially the HIT Industry.

Kent School District Marykay Vandriel, R.N., M.S.N., Ed.D. Value Health Partners \"Investing in children is not a national luxury or a national choice. It's a national necessity.\" Marian Wright Edelman INTRODUCTION School nurses serve nearly 50 million students in approximately 97,000 public elementary and secondary schools (USDE, 2008). Sadly, almost a quarter of the nation's schools do not have the benefits of a skilled nurse, and yet studies like one conducted by the Milwaukee Public School System found that \"in schools with nurses, principals and clerical staff reported significant reductions in the time that they spen t addressing student health issues. In support of students attending classes, nurse s returned students to their classroom over 90% of the time\" (Baisch, 2009). HISTORICAL AND CURRENT OVERVIEW Nurses have been a part of the school setting si nce the late 1800s, with the initial mandate to monitor vaccinations, decrease school absenteeism and prevent the spread of communicable diseases. In the last ten years school nurses have concentrated on new areas of care that have emerged as a result of: Medical advancements that allow children w ith multiple medical issues to survive; A rising incidence of diseases with life-threatening implications like diabetes, seizures, severe allergic reactions, asthma, bleed ing disorders, and genetic conditions; An increase in mental health disorders, in cluding rising incidence of autism and related neurodevelopment disorders; youth gambling, alcohol, tob acco, drug abuse, and other addictive behaviors; youth with eating disorders, anxi ety, depression, and suicidal ideation; youth exhibiting bullying, harassment and violent behaviors; and An increasing number of children living in poverty, including those who are homeless, migrants, immigrants or refugees. As school districts face budget cuts nationwide, school nurses are often the first to lose their jobs. This is especially true in states that do not mandate school nurses. The federal government requires that children who have health impairme nts need to have a connection with a school PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlG-30 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH nurse, but in many school districts this may mean contracting fo r a few hours of nursing service from an agency source. The national federal guide lines for school nurses are a ratio of one nurse to 750 students. Only 12 states comply with this ratio\u2014Vermont has the lowest ratio: one nurse for 305 students, Utah the highest: one nurse for 4,952 students (Zaslow, 2006). The current nurse-to-student ratio means that nurses cover multiple schools and run from one emergency to another. To address the current inadequacies where nurses face work overload, nurse leaders, together with parents, child ren and communities have developed two innovative school health programs: school based health centers and public-private partnerships, that can be replicated nationwide and can provide many new and exciting opportunities for nurses to expand their scope of practice. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS School Based Health Centers (SBHCS) are prim ary care clinics in the schools that provide developmentally appropriate physical, emotional, behavioral and preventive health care to students regardless of their abil ity to pay. SBHCS are similar to a local primary care office: with a secretary or receptionist, nurse, nurse practitioner, and at some sites a mental health therapist. Currently there are 2,000 SBHCS nationwide, and have had the following positive impacts: SBHCS are prevention and wellness oriented SBHCS see children who othe rwise would not get care One in four adolescents who are at risk for adverse health outcomes such as teen pregnancies, suicide and substance abuse can easily and readily access services in a setting where they spend the majority of their days Nationwide satisfaction surveys indicate that 97 percent of the student s appreciate and value the care they receive; and 60 percent report that they would not have received health services without the health cen ters (Schlitt, 2007). SUCCESS: SCHOOL NURSES AND SB HCS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER Jack, a 10th grade student at a local high school had been to sc hool only eleven days as of December 1st 2008 due to sickness. The school nurse reviewed the absent record with Jack. Jack complained that he would become short of breath walking the half mile to school so he stayed home. With parent permission, she referred Jack to the SBHC. The nurse practitioner diagnosed Jack with asthma and prescribed medication. During the exam she also noted symptoms of depression and referred Jack to the mental heal th specialist at the SB HC. The mental health specialist confirmed the diagnosis of depression along with suicid e ideation and additionally the potential to do harm to himself and others. Jack has remained under the care of the practitioners in the SBHC. December 1, 2009 Jack continue s with a stellar attendance and academic achievement record. His asthma and mental h ealth conditions are unde r control through the combination of care delivery between the schoo l nurse and the staff in the SBHC. This partnership has been successful in keeping Jack safe and healthy and engaged in learning. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMATIONAL MODELS OF NURS ING ACROSS DIFFERENT CARE SETTINGS G-31 PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNE RSHIPS INITIATED BY SCHOOL NURSES Another innovative example in sc hool health programs are th e public-private partnerships that nurses are developing in communities around the country. One of the primary tenets of a nurse is to be a coordinator of care. In research studies condu cted by both Lamb and Sofaer, care coordination is identified as one of the most im portant processes that nurses perform. The IOM has identified care coordination as one of the top 20 priorities for national action to transform the health care system. In the community, the schoo l nurse coordinates care in the public school among a variety of providers and community agencies that offer services to children and their families. The nurse can provide point of service care at the site and manage almost all of the health concerns that students present. This arrangement increases the student's time in the classroom and maximizes education. The nurse is also in an ideal position to guide children and their families into appropriate acute care, if needed. SUCCESS: NURSES DEVELOP COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS Michigan is experiencing the brunt of the economic downturn with their automotive manufacturing base disintegrating. They have been forced to create a model of public - private partnership in order to provide health care to one of their most vulnerable populations: children. The Michigan model has placed the nurse in the dr iver's seat of coordinating care in the school. Funding is primarily provided by the both the health system and the educational system. However, the school nurse typically coordinates over 80 community agencies to provide services for students and their families. This coordinatio n equates to thousands of in-kind hours and dollars. None of which would happen without the nurse. The Michigan model has utilized Community Health Workers (CHW) in their schools as well. It is imperative to note that this is only under the supervis ion of the Registered Nurse. The broadened responsibility has chal lenged nursing to gain new lead ership and delegation skills. This model requires clear practice guidelines and health policies develope d by the state board of nursing and adapted by the school system. The school nurse is the health leader in the school community. She has demonstrated leadership in delivering health outcom es, reducing costs and providing extraordinary benefit to the community. This model has also been replicated and is exportable. RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS NEEDED Certificated School Nurses need to be present in the schools in orde r to advocate for school nursing services for every child. SBHCS contribute to academic achievement by taking physical and behavioral health problems out of the classroom and place them into the hands of qualified medical professions and link st udents to health services a nd resources available in the community. Through collaboration with communi ty providers and building public-private partnerships, primary care, mental health, health education and dental care services can be provided at little or no cost to the students and their families. Improved student outcomes and academic achievement result where schools have a partnership with a school nurse, an established SBHC, and co mmunity collaborations.

Allocate federal and state governments funds to school based health centers so that all students, regardless of their ability to pay, can access comp rehensive medical, dental and mental health care by nurse practitioners, nurses and other health care professionals. Establish funding for school health developmen t of public-private pa rtnerships, including community health worker programs that are led by certifi ed school nurses. Require nurses who work in schools to have a minimum of a bachelor's degree and a school nurse certificate. SUMMARY With an expected increase in the number of children who have complex medical, genetic and psychiatric health conditions th at require more nursing oversi ght, school nursing provides the expertise and coordination to assu re that children receiv e the care they need. School nurses are at the forefront of promoting and developing innova tive school programs like School-Based Health Centers and coordinated partnerships with private and public agencies.

Utah Department of Health Patricia Drehobl, R.N., M.P.H. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention INTRODUCTION A well-educated public health nursing workforce would improve the health of all people and minimize health differences among populations by addressing the physical and social determinants of health (Role PHN, 1998). P ublic health nursing is unique among the nursing specialties in its integration of the art and scie nce of two distinct disc iplines\u2014public health and nursing. Public health nurses (P HNs) employ their considerable expertise in promoting health and preventing disease to addre ss the health needs of populations, such as emerging and re- emerging infectious disease, an epidemic of chronic disease, a rapidly aging population with increasing health needs, escalati ng health care costs, and pressure to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies ranging from H1N1in fluenza to bioterrorism. Many of these challenges cannot be resolved at the individual level and must be addressed through policy and environmental change. PHNs work in partnership with multidisciplinary teams and community members to create conditions in which people can be healthy. PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING ISSUES As the largest component of the public health wo rkforce, PHNs are vital to the protection of health in America's communities; almost every h ealth department in the nation, large or small, employs PHNs (NACCHO, 2009). Unfortunately, pub lic health nursing is in the midst of a crisis\u2014the erosion of the public health nursing infrastructure. Historically, every state health departme nt had an executive PHN position. Today, only 23 states support such a lead ership position (ASTDN, 2008). Se vere budget cuts in local and state health departments have led to the reduction or elimination of PHN positions. In 2004, decrease was reported in registered nurse s working in community and public health settings, down from 18.3 to 14.9 percent (HRSA, 2006). Health departments currently face a PHN shortage; 30 out of 37 states reported public health nursing as the field that will be most affected by workforce shortages in the future (ASTHO, 2004). This critical PHN shortage may jeopardize the system's ability to respond to new and emerging public health threats. Many health departments, particularly those in more rural states, hire nurses from two- year associate degree programs that do not provi de public health content, and who are not prepared to practice pub lic health nursing.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlG-34 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The educational system faces a growing shortage of faculty adequately prepared to teach public health nursing, a lack of clinical sites th at provide meaningful PHN clinical experiences, and little incentiv e or support for advanced PHN graduate study, which has led to low enrollment in PHN graduate programs. EVIDENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING MODELS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AND PU BLIC HEALTH NURSING OUTCOMES A joint practice and data quality project was undertaken by public health nurse managers in four local health departments. The project ut ilized the Omaha System, a standardized nursing language and a computerized clinical documentati on system. This project articulated standards for client assessment, developed pathways of car e for typical PHN client groups and/or client problems, and defined common quality assurance standards to monitor PHN practice and data quality. Standardized data allowed PHNs to compare client outcomes between health departments As a result, public he alth nurses were able to influe nce policy decisions by reporting data to funders, stakeholders, and the community (Monsen et al, 2006). HOME VISITING PROGRAMS The Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) is an ev idence-based program in which public health nurses visit the homes of pregnant, low-income families during pregnancy and teach them to parent during the baby's first two years of life. This program has demonstrated consistently positive outcomes in randomized controlled trials, including pregnancy (reduction in subsequent pregnancies 2 years after child 's birth, reduction in preter m deliveries among women who smoked), parenting (less child abuse and neglec t, reduction in behavi oral and intellectual problems in child age 6, reduction in arrests of child age 15), and family self-sufficiency (fewer arrests of mothers 15 years after child's birt h, increase in father pr esence in the household, reduction in welfare use) (NFP). The program ha s been shown to save taxpayers money, paying for itself based on government spending alone (Isaacs , 2008). It is important to note that nurses are central to the success of this home vis iting program. Utilization of paraprofessionals to deliver the NFP demonstrated little to no effect s as few as two years after program completion (Olds et al., 2004). PHNs across the nation are implementing the NFP in over 300 counties and several statewide programs. Various versions of the Health Care Reform Bill of 2010 have proposed nationwide implementation of the NFP. Public health nu rses, with over a century of expertise in home visiting and established relationships with their communities, are in a position to lead this national initiative. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Not all evidence-based programs are new. Public health nurses cont inue as critical players in some of the most dramatic evidence-based programs in history\u2014 the eradication/reduction of vaccine preventable diseases and tuberculosis . A recent PHN task analysis of 60 PHNs from 29 states revealed that the detec tion, prevention and control of inf ectious diseases are core public health nursing activities (ASTDN). De spite the fact that the PHNs in the task analysis worked in many different program areas ranging from emer gency preparedness to family planning, they PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTRANSFORMATIONAL MODELS OF NURS ING ACROSS DIFFERENT CARE SETTINGS G-35 were all involved with the prevention and c ontrol of vaccine preventable diseases and tuberculosis. Over 90 percent of PHNs reported working in i mmunization clinics, a classic evidence-based intervention. Most of the disease prevention and control work that the PHNs reported was population-focused: surveillance a nd disease investigation; iden tification and outreach to high risk populations; audits of immunization records in schools; audits of clinics to determine compliance with recommended immunization standa rds; and development of population-based immunization registries. As part of emergency preparedness, half of the PHNs were involved in planning and staffing mass dispensing clinics. Tuberculosis (TB) is a similar cross-cutting i ssue. Three fourths of the PHNs reported that they work with clients who have latent or ac tive TB; over 80 percent of PHNs administer and read tuberculin skin tests. The current CDC recommendation for the treatment of persons with TB is Directly Observed Therapy (DOT), or wa tching clients take their medications to ensure compliance. Over two-thirds of PHNs in the task analysis repo rted that they conduct Directly Observed Therapy home visits. Evidence demonstrates that PHN case management dramatically increases successful DOT completion rates (M angura et al., 2002). In 1994, Massachusetts mandated that health departments use nurses to as sess suspected TB cases and manage treatment, resulting in completion rates between 93 and 95 percent, which are among the highest in the nation (Geiter, 2000). REINVIGORATING PUBLIC HEAL TH NURSING EDUCATION Two federal grants\u2014one in Minnesota and a nother in Wisconsin\u2014developed a new model for public health nursing education . Linking Public Health Nursing Practice and Education to Promote Population Health and Linking Education and Practice for Excellence in Public Health Nursing Project brought together public health nursing faculty from baccalaureate schools of nursing with public health nurses from local health departments that provide clinical sites for PHN students. They formed regional projects th at redesigned the PHN student experience based on community priorities. Both projects recruite d, trained, and supported a network of preceptors. These projects resulted in a significant incr ease in collaboration among and between schools of nursing and local health departments, expansion of clinical placement sites, student clinical experiences that contribute to meeting the goals of local health departments, a more active role for local health departments in assuring competen cies necessary to begin PHN practice, greater emphasis on population-based PHN practice in schools of nursing curri cula, and increased numbers of graduates indicating interest in pursuing a career in public health nursing. RECOMMENDATIONS A well-prepared public health nursing workfor ce in numbers sufficient to deliver essential public health services is critical for the heal th and economic well-being of communities. Public health nurses possess a core set of skills and knowledge that allow them to adapt to ever changing community needs. In order to achieve public health nurses' potential, however, they must increase their visibility and policy advocacy.

Safriet, J.D., L.L.M. Lewis & Clark Law School INTRODUCTION As decision makers at every level wrestle with the urgent need to broaden access to health care, three challenges have become clear. The car e provided must be comp etent, efficient, and readily available at all stages of life; it must co me at a cost that both i ndividuals and society at large can afford; and it must allow for appropr iate patient choice and accountability. Among the options available to promote these goals, one stands out: wider deployment of, and expanded practice parameters for, advanced practice nurses (APNs). The efficacy of this option is uniquely proven and scalable. These well-trained provi ders\u2014including nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists\u2014can and do practice across the full range of care settings and patient populations. They have proven to be valuable in both acute- and primary-care roles, and as gene ralists as well as specialists.2 By professional training as well as by regulatory and financial necessity, they have emphasized coordinated and cost-effective care, and they have tended more than other prov iders to establish practices in traditionally underserved areas. The role of any professional group is typically delineated by a process that moves from awareness of capabilities, to acceptance, to acknowledgment and formal policymaking. Despite significant progress in several venues, however, this process has been stymied, in the case of APNs, by the many regulatory obstacles and restrictions that currently impede the full realization of their potential. Chief among these, as I have noted elsewhere, are \"co nflicting and restrictive state provisions governing [APNs'] scope of practice and prescrip tive authority... as well as the fragmented and parsimonious state and federal standards for their reimbursement\" (Safriet, 1992). While an extensive catalog of these restric tions appears in Section I.B(1) below, the following two examples\u2014one state-based and one fe deral\u2014will perhaps capture the flavor of the problem. 1 The responsibility for the content of this article rests w ith the author and does not n ecessarily represent the views of the Institute of Medicine or its committees and convening bodies. 2 For purposes of this paper, I take it as a given that APNs\u2014like any other appropriately trained and licensed professionals\u2014are able and effective providers within the sphere of thei r competencies. This has been amply confirmed by numerous studies and analyses over th e years, and the literature is readily available.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-2 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH In Louisiana, according to the Board of Me dicine, no one other than a physician may treat chronic pain, even if the provider in que stion is trained as a nurse anesthetist, is competent to treat pain, and has been directed to do so by a physician.3 Medicare precludes a certified nurse specialist from certifying a patient for skilled long- term care, or from performing the physical required for admission, even though the CNS has been treating the patient on an ongoing basis.4 THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PROBLEM There are several steps that the federal governme nt can and should take to eliminate, or at least mitigate, the wasteful effects of such needle ss restrictions as these. To approach the task effectively, however, decision makers must (1) unde rstand several contextual factors specific to nursing; (2) be familiar with the extensive array of restrictions that are embedded in state and federal regulations (as well as in private organi zations' policies), and grasp their historical origins; and (3) develop a clea r understanding of the impedime nts\u2014ranging from inertia to resistance to active opposition\u2014to a more rational deployment of APNs. Nurse-Specific Contextual Factors Any effort to design more effective and co st-efficient health car e delivery models by maximizing the contributions of APNs must proceed from a basic understanding of several fundamental aspects of our current framewor k. Among the most important of these are the following. 1. The diversity of nursing practice . \"Nursing writ large\" encompasses a wide variety of skill levels and roles, and nursing practice routinely takes place in an almost infinite variety of settings, ranging fr om the intensive care unit of trauma centers to schools, patients' homes, prisons, long-term care faci lities and nursing homes, community health clinics, and outreach centers. While these di ffuse practice settings and roles have no doubt enhanced the nation's health, the very diffusion and multi-faceted nature of nursing practice has often meant that nursing has been slighted in the nascent measurement movement which seeks to apply cost and care-effectiveness standards. 2. Economic invisibility . Nursing services traditionally ha ve been treated as an expense (albeit an essential one) rather than as an individually identified revenue or income source on institutional or governmental balance sheets. And from the patient's perspective, nursing services rarely, if ever, are separated out from institutional room charges or other professional fees on billi ng statements. Unsurpri singly, these accounting practices promote the wide-spread perception that nurses are not \"revenue generators\" (RWJF, 2010). Perhaps in part because of th is \"revenue invisibility,\" nursing has been underrepresented in, or excluded from, the d ecision-making processes (both private and governmental) that determine the metrics upon which costs, value, pricing and payment are based. This asymmetrical financial treat ment has special salience today, as most 3 Louisiana State Board of Medical Exam iners: Statement of Position, \"Interventional Pain Management Procedures Are Not Delegable,\" June 2006. 4 Social Security Act \u00a7 1819(b)(6).

And as APNs continue to participate in, and often lead, the development of innovativ e practice models designed to better meet patients' needs, it is essential that payment schemes include complete and accurate measurement and valuation of their services. 3. Multiple routes of entry . Nursing is the only profession which has multiple educational pathways leading to professional licensure. In all states but one, successful completion of two-, three- and four-year degree programs is recognized as fulfilling the educational requirements for licensure as a Registered Nurse. This unique multiplicity of qualifying pathways is supported by some, and opposed by others, in the profe ssional, educational and policymaking arenas, and it will no doubt continue to be assessed as workforce policy focuses on assuring an adequate supply of well-prepared nurses. Regardless of how this issue is ultimately addressed, however, the current reality is that two years of nursing education meets the educ ational requirement for licensure as a registered nurse, which is the first step for recognition and licensure as an APN. This fact has posed problems for those who seek to promote wide r legal authority for, and utilization of, APNs. Even though Master's-level educa tion and national cer tification are now uniformly required for APN licensure, 5 policymakers and state legislators are sometimes confused about (or susceptible to opponents' mischaracterizations of) the underlying educational and training requirements when considering expanded recognition of APNs' scopes of practice. While patience and inform ation can overcome most of these concerns, much time and many resources ar e consumed in the process. 4. Care versus cure . As some voices in the current reform debates acknowledge, our emphasis for far too long has been on curing illness, rather than on promoting health. This has led to a systemic over-emphasis on training in acute-care, technologically-robust settings, and to a payment structure skew ed toward procedur al interventions by increasingly sub-specialized providers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we have correspondingly undervalued public health. More to the poi nt, we have consistently undervalued coordinated, primary care provi ded throughout the patient's life spectrum in a variety of settings, including the commun ity, the home, long-term care facilities and hospice. As a group, APNs have extensive experience acro ss all these settings. Their traditional approach of blending counseling with clinical care, and coordinating health services as well as appropriate community resources in support of patients, could be a model for policies that seek a more optim al balance of providers prepared to meet the needs of the American public. 5 For a recently adopted uniform framework for APNs, see APRN Cons ensus Work Group and National Council of State Boards of Nursing APRN Advisory Committee (2008).

It reflects an amalgam of regulations, both prescr iptive and incentivized, at the state, local and federal levels. The effects of these governmental regulations are further compounded by the credentialing and payment policies of priv ate insurers and managed care organizations. The explicit restrictions result ing from this complex and uncoordinated scheme are many, but they can be grouped into two pr incipal categories: (a) state-ba sed limitations on the licensed scopes of practice for APNs (and other providers) which prevent them from practicing to the full extent of their abilities, and (a) payment or reimbursement policies (both governmental and private) that either render them ineligible for payment, or preclude their being paid directly for their services, or pay them at a sharply disc ounted rate for rendering the same services as physicians. In many states, the legal framework authorizi ng APNs' practices has evolved in step with their expanding skills, education, training and abilities. In severa l other states, however, their full utilization is hampered by outdate d (or in some cases newly imposed) restrictions on a full range of professional services. Dependi ng on the jurisdiction, th ese restrictions may preclude or limit the authority to prescribe medications, admit patients to hospi tals or other care f acilities, evaluate and assess patients' conditions, order and evaluate tests a nd procedures, and the like. To illustrate the pervasive and detrimental variations embodied in many state licensure statutes and regulations, consider the following example. Imagine an APN who has attended a nationally accredited school of nursing for the BSN and Master of Nursing de grees, and who has passed the national licensure examination for RN licensure as well as national certification examinations in her APN practice area. Imag ine further that two adjacent states, A and B, have adopted regulations repr esenting both ends of the regulatory spectrum, and that our APN is licensed in both of them. In State A, she is permitted independ ently to examine patients, order and interpret laboratory and other tests, dia gnose and treat illness and injury, prescribe indicated drugs, order or refer for additional services, admit and attend patients in a hospital or other facility, and ge t paid directly for her services. When she steps across the line into State B, however, it is as if her competence has suddenly evaporated. Depending on her practice area and the particular constellation of restrictions adopted by the le gislature of State B, she will encounter many if not most of the following prohibitions. Examination and Certification She may not examine and certify for: worker's compensation, DMV disability placards and license plates, and other DMV testing, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

She may indirectly affect the eligib ility of other providers for payment because pharmacies cannot get payment from some private insu rers unless the supervising or collaborating physic ian's name is on the script, and hospitals cannot bill for APNs' teaching or supervising medical students and residents and advanced practice nursing students (as they can for physicians who provide those same services). As this example illustrates, the restrictions faced by APNs in some states are the product of politics rather than sound polic y. Competence does not change with jurisdictional boundaries; the only thing that changes is le gal authority. Indeed, the point is even more sharply illustrated by those states in which an APN's au thorized scope of practice may vary within the state depending on the geographic locatio n of the practice, the economic status of the patient, or the corporate nature of the practice setting. In sum, this practice environment for APNs echoes the conclusion of a previous Instit ute of Medicine report, which succinctly described the current regulatory framework for health care providers as \"inconsistent, cont radictory, duplicative, outdated, and counter to best pr actices\" (IOM, 2001). And that disturbingly accurate conclusion was based only upon explicit regulatory provisions. APNs must also contend with the additional debilitating effects resulting fr om nursing's traditional \"revenue invisibility,\" and from APNs' absence or exclusion from key decision-making venues such as hospital governing boards and medical staffs and organizations de signing quality and cost metrics. The Costs of This Dysfunctional Regulatory Regime Even though APNs, like all health professionals , have continued to de velop and expand their knowledge and capabilities, the state-based licen sure framework described above has impeded their efforts to utilize these ev er-evolving skills. For historical reasons that will be explained more fully below, virtually all states still ba se their licensure framew orks on the persistent, underlying principle that the practice of medicine encompa sses both the ability and the legal authority to treat all possible human conditions. That being so, the scopes of practice for APNs (and other health professionals) are exercises in legislative ex ception-making, a \"carving out\" of small, politically achievable spheres of practice au thority from the universal domain of medicine. Given this process, it is not surprising that APNs are often subjected to unn ecessary restrictions of the kind I have described. The net result is a distressing catalog of dysfunctions with their attendant costs. Because licensure is state-base d, there are wide variations in scope of practice across the country for all professions other than phys icians. This inconsistency also causes additional problems because payment or reimbursement mechanisms tied to scope restrictions in one state can become the \"common denominator\" for policies applied across all states. The result is often a \"race to the bottom,\" in which decision makers, for reasons of efficiency and uniformity, adopt the most restrictive standards for payment and practice and apply them even in more progressive states. State A, that is, may be subject to perverse pressures to become more like State B, rather than the reverse. This dynamic has been especially problematic for APNs because they, more than most other PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH providers, have been viewed by some in organi zed medicine as real or potential economic competitors. Access to competent care is denied to patients, especially those located in rural, frontier or other underserved areas, in the absence of a willing and available \"supervising\" physician. Able providers are demoralized when they canno t utilize the full range of their abilities, and they often relocate to more accommodating states or leave the practice altogether, thus exacerbating the current maldistributi on and shortage of pr oviders (Huang et al., 2004; Sekscenski et al., 1994; Weissert, 1996). Innovations in care delivery are stifled, especially in communi ty settings that emphasize primary care, as well as in home or institutional settings for patients with chronic conditions. The cost of care is increased and much time is wasted by unnecessary physician supervision, and by duplication of services re sulting from required \"confirming\" visits with a physician and co-signatures for prescriptions or orders. Educational and training functions and opportunities are distorted by disparate reimbursement eligibility for supervision of medical residents or students, on the one hand, and APN students on the other. Flexibility in deployment, both between a nd within existing delivery systems, is unnecessarily reduced. The risk of disciplinary acti on looms over even routine prov ider-patient interactions (such as a telephone consultation or filling a prescription) when these activities cross state borders. Millions of dollars and coun tless hours are spent in state and federal legislative and administrative proceedings focused on restricting or expanding scopes of practice or payment policies. The promise of new technologies and practi ce modes remains significantly unrealized. Tele-practice or tele-health systems, for ex ample, would allow APNs and other providers to utilize telecommunications technology to monitor, dia gnose, and treat patients at distant sites, but their use is stymied by multiple and conflicting licensure laws and payment provisions. Current Impediments to Removal of These Restrictive Provisions The principal causes of the existence and continuation of unnecessarily restrictive practice conditions for APNs can be grouped into three cate gories: (1) purposeful or inertial retention of the dysfunctions resulting from the historical evolution of our state-based licensure scheme, (2) lack of awareness of APNs' roles and abil ities, and (3) organized medicine's continued opposition to expanding the authority of other provide rs to practice and be pa id directly for their services. All of these causes are rooted in the hi storical evolution of th e state-based licensure scheme. The relevance of that history to the cu rrent regulatory environment can scarcely be overstated, and it is there that we must begin if we are to understand the present situation.

By the early twentieth century, each stat e had adopted a so-called \"medical practice act\" that essentially claimed the en tire human condition as the excl usive province of medicine. The statutory definitions of physicians' scope of practice were\u2014and remain\u2014extremely broad. The following medical practice act is representative. Definition of practice of medicine \u2014A person is practicing medicine if he does one or more of the following: (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cu re, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, defo rmity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or instrumentality; (2) Administers or prescribes drugs or medicinal preparat ions to be used by any other person; (3) Severs or penetrates the tissues of human beings. 6 The breadth of definitions such as this was re markable in itself, but the real mischief was accomplished through corresponding provisions making it illegal for anyone not licensed as a physician to undertake any of the acts included in the definition. The claim staked by medicine was thereby rendered not only universal but (in medicine's own view) exclusive,7 a preemption of the field that was further codified when physic ians obtained statutory au thority to control the activities of other health-care pr oviders \"so as to limit what they could do and to supervise or direct their activities\" (Freidson, 1970). Not th at long ago, for example, even registered professional nurses couldn't perform such basic task s as taking blood pressure, starting an IV, or drawing blood unless under a physician's \"order.\" Ab sent such a directive, they would have been deemed to be practicing medicine by \"diagnosing\" or \"penetrating the tiss ues of human beings.\" (The full reach of the latter provision is further illustrated by the fact that, well into the 1970s, only physicians were permitted to pierce ears.) Present-day consequences: competence, author ity, and the disjunction between \"can\" and \"may\" Even though some of the more striking manifest ations of this \"everything is medicine\" approach have gone by the wayside, the author ity to supervise or di rect other providers, combined with the authority to \"delegate\" medical procedures and tasks to non-physicians, persists to this day. It underpin s the legislative infras tructure that continue s to subvert even the best efforts to develop a rational, effective scheme that promotes the highest and best use of all trained providers, especially those\u2014like APNs\u2014who seek to practice to the full extent of their competencies. No matter what their training, experi ence, and abilities, as not ed earlier, they are perpetually in the position of having to carve ou t tasks or functions from the all-encompassing medical scope of practice that still prevails in every state. And even af ter the carving out has been accomplished, it is often accompanied by mandatory physician supervision or 6 Rev. Code Washington \u00a718.71.011 (1)-(3) (1993). 7 Sociologist Eliot Freidson has aptly characterized this statutory preemption as right to practice\" (Freidson, 1970).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH collaboration. In this way, the pervasive medical practice acts \"exert a gravitational force that continues to skew all attempts to rationalize the scopes of practice, or s pheres of lawful activity, for providers other than physicians\" (Safriet, 2002). To be clear, the medical pract ice acts of every state author ize a licensed medical doctor to undertake virtually any kind of medica l or health intervention . Indeed, by virtue of his General Undifferentiated Medical Practice authority (referred to by the profession itself as GUMP), \"an MD may practice gynecology, oncolo gy, orthopedics, pediatrics, reti nal surgery, or psychiatry on alternating days, through treatmen t modalities that are decades ol d or were invented yesterday\u2014 all under the same generic medical license he obtained years ago\" (Safriet, 2002, p. 311). Most physicians, of course, would never think of pr acticing beyond the bounds of their competence, but the point cannot be overstressed that it is no t the licensure laws that prevent them from doing so. Rather, they limit their areas of practice according to norms deriving from common sense and decency, professional ethics and judgment, institutional credentialing and voluntary accreditation standards, and insurance concerns. That is, as individuals they implicitly acknowledge that their authority extends beyond the reach of their competence: They may do much more than they can competently do. And as they acquire new knowle dge and skills, they may deploy them freely under their existing practice acts. Their existing authority, that is, covers any expansion of their competence. Most APNs, in contrast, are in precisely the opposite situation. Thanks to the carving-out process that gave birth to thei r practice acts, their sc opes of practice are so circumscribed that their competence extends far beyond their authority. They can do much more than they may legally do. In addition, they must seek administrativ e or statutory revision of their defined scopes of practice (a costly and often pe rilous enterprise) every time they acquire a new skills set. As a result, their competence\u2014what they can do\u2014is some times several years (or more) ahead of what they may do under existing law. The sum total of wasted professional assets represented by this disparity is striking. The damage caused by the dynamic I have described is troubling enough when viewed from the perspective of a single jurisdiction, but it wrea ks havoc on a national scale. Why? Because in each state the scopes of practice governing all health care provid ers (other than physicians) are the end product of a set of political realities, stru ggles, and compromises particular to that state. Stitched together, these practice acts become a cr azy quilt of widely varied, often inconsistent, sometimes contradictory licensure and payment laws. Although I have made the point already, it bears repeating: the crazy quilt makes no logical sense. Neither the underlying science of health care nor the capabilities of individuals change according to political boundaries. Bodies are bodies, and competence is competence, in both State A and State B. The only thi ng that changes at the border is the authority conferred or withheld by each jurisdiction. Indeed , the success of APNs and othe r providers in providing safe and effective care in State A and its progressi ve ilk\u2014states where thei r authority has been enlarged in keeping with their competence\u2014is th e best possible evidence that the constraints imposed by more restrictive juri sdictions are irrational. As one national organization has noted, \"no study has shown that a state with restric tive scope of practice la ws has better health outcomes than a state with expansive practice acts\" (AAHC, 2008, p. 24). Rather, the more restrictive jurisdictions embody th e confluence of history, legislative realities, and the continuing professional dominance of the first organized group to arrive on the scene. Indeed, the point was neatly (if inadve rtently) made by the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners in the pain-management Statemen t of Position referred to in the Introduction: PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlFEDERAL OPTIONS FOR MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES H-11 IN PROVIDING QUALITY, COST -EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE The Board's opinion is not and cannot be altered by representations that a particular CRNA [Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist] has received postdoctoral training in such areas or has performed such activities in this or another state. A non-physician may have educat ion, training, and, indeed, expertise in such an area but expertise cannot, in and of itself, supply authority under law to practice medicine (emphasis added). In offering the above summary, I want to be clea r that I mean to attrib ute no malice or ill-will to individual actors in the scope-o f-practice battles. The problems have become structural and cultural, and we all\u2014physicians included\u2014pay a huge price for the consequences, measured in extra real dollars spent on health care, in lack of access to competent car e, and in the constant antagonism among health care professionals who would be better served by working cooperatively to provide optimal care. Indeed, one of the saddest conseque nces of the dynamic I have described is that, in fighting the dominan ce of medicine, the other healthcare professions have fallen into some of the same patterns of asse rted ownership and contro l. Physical therapists vie with occupational therapis ts, for example, about who may treat what, and clinical psychologists are often at loggerheads with pr ofessional therapists. Even worse, intra- professional rivalries have begun to emerge: practitioners with more formal training seek to raise the ceiling for themselves while simultaneously str uggling to make sure that their floor remains where it is, i.e. to make sure that no one with less extensive training will be permitted to perform certain contested tasks, regardless of their ability. There is a terrible irony in this \"each against all\" state of affairs, but it is the logical end product of a process that metes out authority based upon who one is, rather than what one can do. 8 8 Interestingly, when it comes to physicians'( rather than all other providers') pr actice, recognition of shared ability seems to trump professional status. For example, with in creased medical specialization and heightened reliance on specialty \"certification\" as a pre-requis ite for institutional privile ges/credentialing as well as for payment eligibility, medical organizations themselves have begun to emphasize that a physician's ability , rather than professional certification or specialty status , should determine scope of practice, at leas t as far as physicians' clinical privileges are concerned. See, for example, the following from a listing of the American Academy of Family Physicians' policy statements on \"Family Physicians Scope of Practice\": \"It is the position of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) that clinical privileges should be based on the individual physician's documented training and/or experience, demonstrated abilities and current competence, and not on th e physician's specialty\".(AAFP, 2010). The American Medical Association (AMA) holds a similar position. Regarding clinical privileges, the 1998 AMA Policy Compendium states, \"The accord ance and delineation of privileges should be determined on an individual basis, commensurate with an applicant's education, training and experience, and demonstrated current competence.\" It also states that \"[i]n impl ementing these criteria, each facility should formulate and apply reasonable non-discriminato ry standards for the evalua tion of an applicant's credentials, free of anti-competitive intent or purpose\" (AMA, 1998). \"AAFP strongly believes that all medical staff members should realize that there is overlap between specialties and that no one department has exclusive 'rights' to privileges\" (AAFP, 2010).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH General Public Lack of Awareness Another result of the history deriving from our all-encompassing medical practice acts is the fact that the general public almost reflexivel y associates health car e with physicians. Although nursing functions have existed for millennia, the formal development and legal recognition of APNs as a distinct professional gr oup has occurred only in the past 40 50 years. Thus, though the public is increasingly familiar with provider titles such as nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife and nurse anesthetist, it is sti ll \"doctor\" who \"knows best.\" As the prominent medical sociologist Eliot Freidson has noted, \"health services\" as understood in the United States \"are organized around professional authority, and their basic st ructure is constituted by the dominance of a single profession [medicine] over a variet y of other, subordinate occupations.\"9 This construct, which underpins the continued centrality of \"doc tor\" and \"physician\" in the popular culture, prevents the public from forming an accurate perception of the many and diverse types of essential health care provider s and their spheres of competence. Instead, misperceptions are reinforced by mass media marketing messages\u2014fo r example, those declaring that \"only your doctor can prescribe\" a drug, when, in fact, APNs in a majority of the states can and do legally prescribe that drug on their own license. Of course, this misperception is both the result of, and sustained by, laws that require a physician's name to be listed on the label for a prescription written by an APN, or require a bill for APN se rvices to be submitted in the physician's name. Of the three impediments to reform that I have identified, this lack of understanding on the part of the general public is clearly the most amorphous. It is a powerfu l part of the overall dynamic, however, because patients and their fa milies can't demand access to, and payment for, APNs' services if they are unaware of the avai lability and effectiveness of those services. Significant advocacy for more rational regula tion will not emerge on a broad scale until laypeople understand what is possi ble, and what is at stake. Legislative Inertia, \"Scope of Practice Fatigue,\" and Organized Opposition to Change Many states have recognized th e evolution of APNs' education and training, as well as their documented practice abilities. In those states, AP Ns' licensure laws have been reformed in two important ways: first, they have been revised to eliminate requirements that APNs enter into formalized practice relationships with physicians (including practice agreem ents or protocols and physician supervision or direction) ; second, they explicitly grant AP Ns the authority to prescribe drugs and devices, to order and inte rpret tests, to admit to appropriate institutional facilities, and to be designated as primary care providers for various insurance pr ograms\u2014all on their own license as regulated by the Board of Nursing.10 In undertaking such refo rms, these states have shaken off the detrimental effects of the medi cal-preemption dynamic described above. Instead, they have based their scope of practice and corollary provisions on assessments of these providers' proven clinical abilities, to the ul timate benefit of their citizens' health and pocketbooks. Which raises the quest ion: why all states haven't done this, especially when faced with the growing, and increasingly expensive, he alth needs of the gene ral public? There may be multiple reasons for this, but three are especially noteworthy. 9 He goes on to add that \"[this] professional dominance is the analytical key to the pres ent inadequacy of the health services.\" Eliot Freidson, Professional Dominance: the Social Structure of Me dical Care (1970). For an especially insightful analysis of the development of the cultural, economic, political, and social authority and dominance of the physician, and especially of orga nized medicine, see Starr (1982). 10 For a comprehensive review of each st ate's regulations, see Pearson (2009).

Change requires not only the identification and analysis of problems and potential solutions, but, even more importantly in the political arena, a coalescence of support sufficient to enact a measur e. Given the usual context within legislators must act\u2014a context reflecting multiple agendas a nd interests, as well as finite political or suasion capital\u2014it is often easier to \"let things be\" than to marshal the forces required for change. This dynamic is compounded, in the case of licen sure practice act proposals, by \"scope of practice fatigue.\" Most legislat ors are well-acquainted with (and many have been caught in the crossfire of) the professional \"tur f battles\" that have played out repeatedly across the states as individual provider groups seek modifications to their professional practic e acts or administrative rules to better reflect their evolving co mpetencies (Finocchio et al., 1998, p. 50).11 Understandably, lawmakers have grown weary of the fight, especially when there may be little to gain and much to lose in championing reform. Organized opposition to change These two factors\u2014legisl ative inertia compounded by weariness and risk-aversion\u2014defi ne the arena within which a more active and powerful force has been brought to bear, and that is the advocacy efforts of several national medical organizations and their state affiliates. Countless thousands of individual physicians (including two who helped create the new roles of nurse practitioner and nurse anesthetist) have long recognized and su pported the full practice capabilities of APNs. It is the official policy of several national medical organizations, however, to actively oppose legal recognition of any ot her providers' expanded authority to practice without physician supervision and be paid directly for their services. Seemingly unmoved by the demonstrably safe and effective practice of unsupervised and directly paid APNs in many stat es, organizations such as the Am erican Medical Association, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to oppose rational re-alignment of APNs' state practice authority a nd eligibility for reimbursement. The following sampling of policies, and public st atements by their officers, is illustrative. The American Medical Association has adopted and continued to re-affirm resolutions which direct the organization to pursue, \"t hrough all appropriate legislative and other advocacy activities,\" 12 measures designed to: \"oppose the enactment of legislation to authorize the independent practice of medicine by any individual w ho has not completed the stat e's requirement for medical licensure,\" 13 (a position that may seem unrem arkable until one remembers that, under the medical practice acts, everything is \"the practice of medicine\"); 11 Finocchio et al., 1998, hereinafter, the Taskforce Report. Others have characterized these considerations as \"scope-of-practice firefights\" an d \"akin to war.\" Jay Greene, Physician Groups Brace for Allied Incursion , AM. MED.

From the American Academy of Pediatrics: \"AAP chapters and state medical and specialty societies, as well as national medical and specialty societies, should be proactive in legislative advocacy and should partner in informing legislators, health care purchasers, the media, and the public about the differences in the education, skills, and knowledge of various health care professionals. Legislative advocacy includes opposing legislation to expand the scope of practice of nonphysician clinicians, particularly independent practice, independent prescriptive authority, and reimbursement par ity\" (AAP Committee on Pediatric Workforce, 2003\u2014reaffirmed January 2006). \"A public conflict with nurse practitioners who have independent practice status in some states, could endanger hopes for health ca re reform that could be very beneficial to pediatricians...We don't want to hurt the efforts of our members to preserve physician-directed primary care [and] we en courage our members to oppose scope of practice legislation' that would permit nurse practitioners to have independent practices\" (Anderson, 2009).16 Although this opposition17 could be motivated by several f actors, a consistent theme seems to be that \"if something is medicine\"\u2014and of course everything is, gi ven the breadth of th definition in state medical practice acts\u2014then it ca nnot be a skill or task that can be competently (or legally) performed independe ntly by anyone other than a medical doctor.

The express purpose of the SOPP is to \"concentrate the resources of organized me dicine to oppose scope of practice expansions by allied [sic] health professionals that threaten the health and safety of the public....\" See AMA Board of Trustees Report 24\u2014A-06, Subject: Limited Licensure Health Care Prov ider Training Standards (2006).

Two aspects of the FSMB Guidelines are es pecially noteworthy. First, they are intended to be considered \"by State medical boards a nd legislative bodies when addressing scope of practice initiatives relating to persons without a license to practice medicine \"19\u2014in other words, to everyone other than physicians , whose scope of practice is seemingly assumed to be not only universal but inviolable and eternal. Second, the underlying a ssumption of the preeminence of medicine is made explicit by the prefatory statement that \"All discussions about changes in scope of practice should begin with a basic understanding of the definition of the pr actice of medicine and recognition that the educat ion received by physicians differs in scope and duration from other health care professionals. Non-physician practitioners may s eek authorization to provide services that are included in the de finition of the practice of medicine under existing state law.\" (Emphases added.)20 Statements like these seem to reify the primacy and exclusivity of medicine. They ignore the reality that competenci es are shared, and that legal authorization of these competencies could and logically should be based on professional abilities rather than notions of exclusive ownership. While this \"everything begins with medici ne\" trope continues to animate the advocacy activities of some, others have pursued a very different approach to ra tionalizing the authority- abilities metric that should guide regulatory prac tice parameters for all health care providers. The most succinct statement of this appro ach is set out in a 2007 monograph entitled Changes in Healthcare Professions' Scope of Pr actice: Legislative Considerations, collaboratively produced by representatives of six associatio ns of regulatory boards (NCSBN, 2007) .21 The monograph emphasizes that the most important\u2014indeed the only relevant\u2014questions concerning scope of practice are whether the \"change will better prot ect the public and enhance consumers' access to competent healthcare services.\" In contrast to the static, exclusivity paradigm adhered to by some, the monograph notes two part icularly relevant basic assu mptions that should frame any scope-of-practice decision: \"Changes in scope of practice are i nherent in our current healthcare system . Healthcare and its delivery ar e necessarily evolving...Healthca re practice acts need to evolve as healthcare demands and capabilities change.\" 18 See, for example, Mirvus (1993): \"[N]urses, clinical ph armacists, and other allied health professionals are now educated and trained to perform many tasks previously assigned only to physicians. In these areas, physicians have a right to autonomy because of their knowledge, but it is not an exclusive right . Instead, it is a right to be shared with other appropriately credentialed professions (emphasis added).\" 19 FSMB Guidelines, p.1. [emphasis added]. 20 Id. 21 The Monograph was developed by representatives of the following organizations: Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB), Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT), Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT), National Co uncil of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), and National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).

No one profession actually owns a skill or activity in and of itself. One activity does not define a profession, but it is the entire scope of activities within the practice that make s any particular profession unique. Simply because a skill or activity is within one pr ofession's skill set does not mean another profession cannot and should not include it in its own scope of practice.\"22 It is to be hoped that this \"safe and effective abilities\" focus will supplant the \"first we must start with medicine\" refrain as legislative and administrative actions to foster less restrictive practice parameters for all providers are undertaken at both state and federal levels. If so, we will move closer to the goal of enhancing the publ ic's access to practiti oners who can provide competent and cost-effective care in a wide range of practice settings. THE GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR CHANGE While professional associations, legislators and administrators are all too familiar with the difficulties encountered in reconciling regulatory au thority with evolving clinical abilities, an awareness of the need for change has been slow to develop in the wider policy making and public arenas. Now, however, with sustained effort s to increase access to care in cost-effective ways, a growing and increasingly di verse chorus of voices is calling for true reform of healthcare workforce regulations. Early Studies: The Pew Commission and Institute of Medicine Reports One of the earliest and most thorough analyses of the regulatory context of health care providers was produced in 1998 by the Pew Commi ssion's Taskforce on Health Care Workforce Regulation (Finocchio et al., 1998). The Task force Report looked broadly at professional regulatory components, includi ng boards and governance struct ures as well as continuing competence requirements, and more particularly at scopes of practice authority. Noting that \"differences from state to state in practice acts for the health professions no longer make sense,\" the Taskforce recommended the development of national standards for uniform practice authority, and the dissemin ation to the states of models base d on \"the least restrictive practice acts for each profession.\" Among their findings and recommendations are the following: \"Traditional boundaries\u2014in the form of le gal scopes of practice\u2014have blurred.\" \"Some scopes of practice c onferred upon licensed occupati ons and professions are unnecessarily monopolistic, thereby restrict ing consumers' access to qualified practitioners and increasing the costs of services.\" \"Clinical practice is no longer based on exclusive profe ssional or occupational domains.\" \"If someone is competent to provide a heal th service safely, and has met established standards, then he or she should be allowed to provide that care and be reimbursed for it, even if that care was historically deliv ered by members of another profession.\" \"Demonstration projects [can] provide an em pirical basis for rational development of legally defined scope of pract ice provisions, which reflect evolving clinical competence, and make optimum use of skilled health care practitioners.\" 22 Monograph, p. 9.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlFEDERAL OPTIONS FOR MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES H-17 IN PROVIDING QUALITY, COST -EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE Several years later, the lessons of the Report's scope-of-practi ce analysis were reflected in the 2001 Institute of Medicine publication Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001), which noted that \"a major challenge in transitioning to the health care system of the 21st century envisioned by the committee is preparing the workforce to acquire new skills and adopt new ways of relating to patients and each othe r.\" Among the approaches recommended by the IOM Committee was a modification of \"the ways in which health professionals are regulated to facilitate the needed changes in care deliv ery. Scope-of-practice acts and other workforce regulations need to allow for innova tion in the use of all types of clinicians to meet patient needs in the most effective and efficient way possible. \" This approach led to the recommendation that research be pursued \"to evaluate how the current regu latory and legal syst ems...facilitate or inhibit the changes needed for the 21st-century health care delivery system.\" The Emerging Consensus More recently, several reports by research orga nizations, as well as statements by health policy analysts, have focused on the need for refo rm of the regulations affecting both practice boundaries and payment for providers such as APNs. A short summary of these commentaries further confirms that the views of health care analysts are conv erging on a central conclusion: the current scope-of-practice fr amework must be changed. In cautioning against the \"Siren Song of GME [Graduate Medical Education]\" expansion as a means of addressing the need for more primary care services, Fitzhugh Mullan and Elizabeth Wiley note: \"The increased need for physician services can be met by better use of the physicians we have now ... and by th e increased use of nur se practitioners and physicians assistants in primary car e and specialty care settings. The important principle underlying this latter strategy is that all clinicians should work to the maximum of their training and licensure (emphasis added)\" (Hea lth Affairs, 2009). In identifying necessary f oundations for cost containment and value-based care, the Engelberg Center at Brookings included as a key reform for improvement of the health care workforce: \" Create incentives for states to amend the scope of practice laws to allow for greater use of nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physician assistants, and community health workers (emphasis added)\" (Engelber g Center for Health Care Reform at Brookings, 2009, p. 2). In a report for the Business Roundtable evaluating the effects of health care reform through the lens of the private sector, Hewitt A ssociates recommended that, as part of the concept proposed in some current reform bills to create an Innovation Center at the Centers for Medicare and Medi caid, test models should incl ude measures to fund \"nurse- practitioners and physician assist ants to manage chronically il l patients,\" and to enhance greater professional service capacity by \"gre ater utilization of nurse practitioners\" (Hewitt Associates, 2009, pp. 8, 22). In a comprehensive analysis of the need fo r a national, coordinated health workforce policy, the Association of Academ ic Health Centers found that \"Inconsistencies in scope of practice laws engender numerous challenges.\" Th e report went on to add that \" lack of national uniformity in scope of practice limits health professionals' mobility and practice, \" and that \"many professionals and poli cymakers believe that the appropriate PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Such a change would also contribute to leveraging workforce capacity and increase access to care.\" Unless and until this is done, \"patients may be unable to obtain the services of skilled providers across state lines and may have fewer choices of safe and effective providers (emphasis added)\" (AAHC, 2008, pp. 21, 26, 27). A National Association of Community Hea lth Centers report on transforming primary care services noted that \"NPs and PAs play a vital role in the delivery of primary care. State scope of practice laws, which regulate the range of pe rmissible practice for various health care professionals, encourage NPs to locate in states allowing them to provide a broader range of services.\" The report added that \"State scope of practice standards set the boundaries by which key primary care provi ders, namely NPs and PAs, can deliver care. State policymakers must consider how these standards encourage or discourage primary care professionals to locate in and form teams in underserved areas. Some states, including Colorado and Pennsylvania, have dealt with primary care shortages in underserved areas by expanding scope of pract ice for NPs, PAs, CNMs, nurses, and dental hygienists. If health centers are to form medica l or health care homes and maximize quality and efficiency, policies that facilitate team functions for patients will be needed (emphasis added)\" (NACHC, 2009). An analysis by the National Academy of St ate Health Policy of state regulations governing retail clinics concl uded that such clinics are a desirable service-delivery mechanism providing accessible, less costly, evidence-based services. The analysis went on to note that, as reported by clinic representatives, the \"most powerful state regulatory tools affecting their operations ar e the scope of practice regulations that govern nurse practitioners and [physician assistants].\" \"The se kinds of regulations can greatly affect the cost structure of retail cl inics and may affect where retail clinics locate, their staffing, and their hours of operation.\" The report concluded that many states have chosen not to regulate these clinics directly, but rather ha ve relied on existing health care provider regulations and market forces to decide the fa te of these clinics, with one 'most notable exception'\": \"o ften in response to physician groups, states have increased physician oversight of non-physician practitioners who work at retail clinics(emphasis added)\" (NASHP, 2009). Pulling It All Together: the RAND Corporation Study All of these themes are echoed and elaborated in one of the most recent and comprehensive reports in the field, which focused specifically on the access, quality and cost gains to be realized by reforming the current regulatory m\u00e9lange. Th e Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy commissioned the RAND Cor poration to \"develop a comprehensive menu and assessment of cost containment strategies an d options and to determine their potential effect on the health care system.\" The resulting repor t released in August 2009 (Eiber et al., 2009) described the results of analysts' assessment of 12 high-priority polic y options, including upper- and lower-bound estimates of potential cost sa vings from these options over ten years.23 In addition, the report identified \"what has to happen to implement a change\" for each of the options. Under the general headi ng of \"Redesign[ing] the Health care Delivery System,\" the most 23 For a summary of results of further modeling of 8 of th e original policy options on a national scale, see Hussey et al., 2009.

The most relevant passages of this secti on of the report are quoted below. \"Option: Encourage Greater Use of Nurse Practitioners ... 26 Nature of the Problem Even though they are educated to pe rform many routine as pects of primary and specialty are and even though studies have shown that they provide care similar to that provided by physicia ns, NPs generally cannot practice as independent medical providers and therefor e are underutilized in the provision of primary care.... Given widespread agreement that there is a cr itical shortage of primary care physicians in the Commonwealth, expanding scope-of-practice laws could be a viable mechanism for increas ing primary care capacity and reducing health care costs. Proposed Policy Option Under a changed [more independent] sc ope of practice, public and private insurers could choose to reimburse NPs directly for their services and could allow consumers to choose a non-physician provi der as their primary care [provider]. Specifically, Allow NPs to practice independent ly, without physician oversight. Allow greater practice autonomy for NPs by eliminating the requirement that the Board of Registration in Nurs ing consult and reach consensus with the Board of Registration in Medicine to promulgate its APN regulations. Reimburse NPs directly for their se rvices. Since NPs [currently] cannot bill directly for their services, bills presented to insurers often are not transparent and may not even indicat e who provided the treatment. Were the state to allow nonphysician providers to practice independently, and therefore bill directly for their serv ices, payers would have the option to pay differential rates for primary care services. Allow consumers to designate an NP as their primary care provider. This was accomplished, pursuant to a new cost containment law, which 24 A third option relevant to ANPs, Create Medical Homes, is not included here since the modeled analysis was limited specifically to \"physi cian-led teams,\" and some current reform proposals include a broader definition of primary care provider-led health homes which could be led by APNs. 25 This latter option is important because retail clinics are staffed principally by nurse practitioners. 26 Although the RAND report included PAs and NPs in this policy option, I have omitted references to PAs from this summary, both because my focus is on APNs, and because the regulatory scheme for PAs is fundamentally different than that for APNs, in that, though individually li censed, their scope of practice in all states is determined by delegation by a required supervising physician.

Use provider payment options (such as capitation and case rates) that would encourage physicians to utilize NPs. Providers or provider organizations that accept risk (such as in capitation or case rate payment) will have an economic incentive to employ NPs, whereas those paid on a fee-for-service basis may not. As obs erved by the Pew Commission, 'The cost-saving imperatives explicit in cap itation will move se rvice-delivery to the least costly practitioners. Moreover, third-party payers likely will focus more on services than on provide rs in determining reimbursement'. Reimburse the same amount for basic medical services, whether provided by a physician or an NP.\" It should be emphasized that, in framing their cost analysis, the report's authors used quite conservative treatment assumptions. For the lowe r bound of savings, they assumed that \"NPs and PAs could provide all care for 6 simple acute conditions (cough, thro at symptoms, fever, earache, skin rash, and nasal congestions), corresponding to the subset of conditions commonly treated at retail clinic s.\" For the upper bound of savings, they assumed that these providers could provide care for these 6 conditions \"as well as for all general medical examinations and well- baby visits.\" Even given th ese narrow treatment paramete rs, the potential savings in Massachusetts over a ten-year period ranged fr om a lower bound of $4.2 billion to a higher bound of $8.4 billion. The authors also noted that the higher savings estimates were supported by a majority of the studies in the research literatur e, which confirm that NPs and PAs \"can deliver care for a large fraction of diagnoses at equivalent quality and lower cost than phys icians,\" that the \"use of NPs leads to high levels of patient satisfaction,\" and that \"NPs are more likely to provide disease prevention counseling, health education, and heal th promotion activities than are physicians.\" Quite tellingly, the factors that were identif ied as tending toward the lower savings range involved some of the common regulatory dysfunctions discussed earlier in this paper. First and foremost was the challenge presented by the n eed for revised laws br oadening the scope of practice of NPs (and, by implication, other APNs as well): \"Proposed changes in scope-of- practice laws are 'among the most highly charged policy issues facing state legislators and health care regulators,' often triggering guild or 'turf battles among prof essions' that have at times lasted over a period of years.\" In addition, the report noted th at the restrictive nature of Massachusetts's practice parameters may have redu ced the supply of NPs av ailable to practice in that state, even if its licensure laws were to be reformed, because many may already have left the state or dropped out of the workfo rce. \"[R]esearch suggests that th e supply of NPs is influenced both by scope of practice and reimbursement policies, and that a greater supply is available in states with more expansive sc ope of practice regulations.\" The detailed analysis containe d in the RAND report confirms and amplifies the fundamental conclusion reached by an ever-growing cohort of health-care policy analysts: many of the most promising efforts to improve our health care de livery system will have to reckon with the debilitating regulatory restricti ons currently imposed on providers' practice parameters. While a fundamental restructuring of thes e laws may be long in coming, th ere are many steps that can be taken now to address some of the well-known, pervasive problems.

Some of these actions emphasi ze uniform national practice standards and parameters, and are therefore perhaps more aspira tional in nature. Others are more specific and immediately actionable. Of the latter, some ha ve to do with the federal government's own policies and agencies, and others are measures that the federal government could take to promote rational policymaking in the states. The Aspirational: What Would an Ideal System Look Like? Rationalizing Education, Licensure, and Compensation If one were charged with the task of desi gning a logical and eff ective educational and regulatory framework for the healthcare workfor ce, it seems clear that the resulting scheme would include few if any of the most notable fe atures of our current sy stem. It would not, for example, segregate students into profession-sp ecific introductory cour ses in biology, anatomy, physiology, chemistry and the like. It also would not presume that all aspects of the healing arts and sciences are within the amb it of any, or surely only one, pr ofession. And given the universal, scientific nature of human physical and mental health, it would not tolerate 50 or more variations in each of the practice parameters for each of the many professional role s, all developed through the lobbying of elected politicians by special interest groups. Finall y, it would not pay for services at a rate based entirel y upon the licensed status of the pr ovider. In short, it would not replicate the educational, practice and pa yment provisions of our current system. Rather, the ideal framework would do the following: provide for a common curriculum for all h ealth professional students for foundational courses, and include requirements for interd isciplinary training in clinical practice settings; recognize that the provision of health care en tails a range of acti ons, and regulate those actions based upon the degree of danger and specialized skill involved; explicitly acknowledge, for tasks that shoul d be regulated, that the competence to perform these tasks safely is not profession-specific; establish appropriately uni form professional standard s and practice parameters; accommodate needed flexibility and evolution in a profession's practice by utilizing assessment processes in which an appointe d, standing committee would review proposals for change and make recommendations for necessary governmental action; and base payment for covered services on what and how well a service was provided, rather than on who provided it. The Federal Role in an Ideal Scheme The logical consequence of such an approach would be national re gulations (including federal licensure or certificati on, as appropriate) for all regulate d health providers, with more uniform educational preparation and scope-of- practice provisions fo r each profession. A variation on this scheme could be what one might call \"shared direct licensure,\" in which the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-22 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH federal government would establish a uniform scope of practice for each profession, while retaining the current role of state licensure boards in perfor ming credentials evaluation and verification, disciplinary f unctions and continued competence assessments. A national approach to licensure (either comp rehensive or shared with the states) is intuitively appealing. After all, th e healing arts, as applied, are or ganic rather than political or geographic, and there are alrea dy many national characteristics and requirements embedded in current systems governing educational accredita tion, licensure examina tions, and professional certification. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the benefits of such an approach, there are undeniably many obstacles to its implementation. Two in particular stand ou t: (1) the realities of the traditional (though not inevitable) role of the states in health care licensure; and (2) the likelihood that the very same forces that have pr evailed in many states would succeed in bringing about a similar result at the national level\u2014that is, in making sure that national standards would embody the most restrictive, rath er than the most progressive and empowering, scope-of-practice provisions, thus actually making th e situation worse in those states that currently pursue a more enlightened approach. The Here-and-Now: What Immediate Steps Can the Federal Government Take to Promote the Highest and Best Use of APNs? Given these and other realities, perhaps the pr eferred path for the fe deral government should be to pursue a more rational regulatory framew ork by (1) promoting best practices drawn from current domestic and international systems and (2) remedying specific problems that are within its power to resolve. There are a number of steps that could be ta ken now to advance this agenda. Articulate National Priorities and Raise P ublic Awareness: the \"Bully Pulpit\" National priorities Through an Executive Order or other appropriate vehicle, the federal government could declare that the highest and best utilization of health care providers is a national priority, c onsistent with the goal of promoting wider access to quality care in cost- effective ways. And unnecessary restrictions on providers' practice scopes distort efficient practice and impede the development of more innovative and effective delivery mechanisms. Public awareness By explicitly identifying the highest and best use of all providers as a national priority, the federal government would also begi n to raise public awaren ess of APNs and other providers and what they can offer. A follo w-on public information campaign could provide further detail. Identify, Integrate, and Publiciz e Best Practices in a Preferre d Scope of Practice Framework Building on previous calls for fe deral action on workforce policies27, the administration (through the Secretary of HHS, the Surgeon General, or CMS) could appoint a Health Workforce Commission . The Commission would be charged with: gathering and analyzing the most progressi ve regulatory provisions to be found both domestically and internationally28; 27 See, for example, the Pew Taskforce, the IOM Report, and the AAHC reports.

This strategy would promote wi der awareness of both the problem s of the current system and the existence of achievable, preferred practices. Incentivize the States to A dopt the Preferred Framework Raise awareness and promote rational analysis Pursuant to existing (or, if necessary, supplemental) statutory authorit y for annual state reports and assessments of Medicaid and SCHIP, the Secretary of HHS and/or the Admi nistrator of CMS could require the Governor and/or Director of Medicaid/SCHIP of each state to submit an annual report that: specifies how any of their state's health care provid er practice acts and regulations impose restrictions not included in the preferred model framework, and documents the justifications for these continued restrictions. A compilation of these reports could be poste d on the HHS and CMS and other appropriate websites and could be distribut ed to associations such as the National Council of State Legislatures and the National G overnors' Association, as well as to public advocacy groups. Create fiscal incentives A final step in this progression would move from in creasing awareness of to incentivizing the adoption of the preferre d framework. The Medicaid federal match formula could be increased by .5 percent for those states that revise their la ws to be consistent with the preferred framework, or (perhaps mo re equitably for those states th at have already reformed their laws) the federal match for non-conforming st ates could be decreased by .5 percent. Ensure That APNs Are Visible, and That Their Roles Are Taken into Account To assure that APNs and nursing in general ar e \"present and accounted for\" when counting matters, at least two significant actions should be taken. The National Center for Health Statistics should confirm that all its National Health Surveys and resulting statistical and series reports include information on the full range of APNs' practices and settings. 28 As I and others have noted elsewhere in some detail [see Safriet, 2002 and Dower, 2008], many preferred practices could be drawn from the existing framework of the Ontario Regulated Hea lth Professions Act. For a complete description of the evolution and current para meters of that scheme, see http://www.hprac.org/en/.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-24 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH All federal agencies (CMS, NC HS, HRSA, etc.) should be char ged with assuring that any coding, assessment or benchmark schema used in any federal health care program (or state program receiving federal funds) for payment, performance, accreditation or forecasting purposes are inclusive and fairly re presentative of the kinds of providers and practices affected by those schema. A partia l list of such metr ics would include the Medical Expenditure Panel Su rvey, HEDIS, CAHPS, CPT codes, performance measures and quality indicator data se ts, Joint Commission and Nationa l Quality Forum standards, and benchmark tools for federally sponsored pilot and demonstra tion projects and the like. Monitor for Anti-Competitive Behavior The Federal Trade Commission should be charge d with actively monitoring proposed state laws and regulations specifically applicable to retail or convenient care clinics (or other innovative delivery mechanisms utilizing APNs) to assure that impermissible anti-competitive measures are not enacted. The need for such monitoring is confirmed by the recent FTC29 evaluations of proposals in Massa chusetts and Illinois and Kentuc ky, which revealed that several such provisions (including limitations on advertising, differential cost-sharing, more stringent physician supervision requirements, restrictions on clinic locations and physical configurations or proximity to other commercial ventures, and limitations on the scope of professional services that can be provided which do not apply to the sa me credentialed professionals in comparable limited care settings) could be considered anti-competitive. Rationalize Professional Education and Tr aining Opportunities and Corresponding Payment Schemes Curriculum The Department of Education should em phasize interdisciplinary curricular opportunities in the criteria used by the Nationa l Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in granting continued recognition of nationally recognized accrediting agencies for health care education. Graduate-level education for APNs Federal funding for graduate level, APN education (and educational loan-repayment subs idies) should be expanded. Since the time and cost required for completing APN educational and tr aining requirements is less than that for comparable physician providers, some have estimated th at an expenditure of $1 billion (of either new funds or those shifted from GME) could lead to a cumulative 25 percent increase in the number of fully qualified APNs over a 10-year period.30 The role of Medicaid and Medicare Medicaid regulations should be clarified to ensure that Nurse-Managed Health Centers and Clinics ar e eligible for Medica id reimbursement. 29 Letter from FTC Staff to Elain Nekritz, Illinois Legislature (May 29, 2008); available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2008/06/V080013letter.pdf ; Letter from FTC Staff to Massa chusetts Department of Health (September 27, 2007); available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/10/v070015massclinic.pdf .

Promote Parity in Recogniti on and Payment for Services Medicaid should require stat es to recognize nurse practit ioners and certified nurse midwives as Medicaid Primary Care Case Managers, as opposed to the current provision for \"optional\" recognition. If an APN's services are allowed by stat e law to be provided autonomously without supervision by any other provider, CM S should not condition any designation (such as those required for \"Centers of Excellence\") or Medicare or Medicaid coverage and payment for those services upon any required supervision. Among other provisions affecting APNs, this would require a revisi on of the current CMS \"Opt-Out\" regulation 31 for conditions of participation for anesthes ia services in hospitals, critical access hospitals, and ambulatory surgical centers. U nder the current regulation, even in states whose licensure laws do not require physician supervision of certified registered nurse anesthetists, CMS will not pay for an \"unsupervised\" CRNA's fully competent and authorized services unless the G overnor of that state, after conferring with the Boards of Nursing and Medicine, certifies to the CMS that s/he has found that \"it is in the best interests of the state's citizens to opt-out of the current federal physician supervision requirements, and that the opt-out is consistent with state law.\" CMS should encourage state Me dicaid programs to cover health care services provided by retail or convenien t care clinics. Consistent with the comprehensive primary car e services they provide to uninsured and vulnerable populations, Nurse-Managed Health Centers should be eligible for the same enhanced reimbursement and support provided by the government to Federally Qualified Health Centers. Undertake Other Available Measures to Improve APNs' Practice Context While I candidly acknowledge that I am not aware of all of the many au thorization, payment, or even survey provisions contained in the hundr eds of state and federal regulatory measures affecting APNs\u2014and I am not sure that anyone could be\u2014I do know that there are many examples of APNs' differential treatment or to tal absence. While policymakers and other public advocates move forward with efforts to remove many of the large-scal e impediments resulting from the dynamics previously discussed, there are immediate steps that can be taken improve the practice context for APNs. Several specific examples follow: The CMS should assure that APN practices, including Nurse-Managed Health Centers, are eligible to receiv e subsidies under the ARRA of 2009/stimulus funds for adoption of the Electronic Health Records systems currently being deve loped by the Health Information Technology Policy Committee, or any other HIT initiatives. 31 66 FR 56762, 11/13/2001, http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=01- 1388-filed.pdf . Currently, 15 these supervision requirements. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlH-26 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH The Office of Personnel Management should co ndition any insurer's participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program upon verification that APNs' services (consistent with their full authority under st ate law) are directly accessible by members and are covered and paid for on the same basis as physicians. Any federally sponsored initiative to promot e patient-centered, coordinated primary care should incorporate the Institute of Medicine's definition of primary care, which includes \"the provision of integrated, acce ssible health care services by clinicians who are accountable...(emphasis added)\" (IOM, 2001). C onsistent with this, legislation and implementing rules should assure that any fede ral pilot or demonstration initiatives under Medicare or Medicaid promoting primary car e (such as \"health- or medical-homes\") include APN-led practices and Nurse-Managed Health Clinics as eligible participants. Furthermore, CMS should encourage or require any accrediting organization (such as the National Committee on Quality Assurance) w hose assessments and recognition are relied upon in any way for basic or enhanced reimbur sement, to include APN-led practices in their health/medical home standards and processes. In Medicare legislation a nd CMS regulations, the terms \"physician\" and \"physician services\" should be defined to include APNs' se rvices when those services are within the APNs' scope of practice as defined by state law. Medicare legislation and impl ementing regulations should au thorize nurse practitioners and certified nurse specialists to certify patients for home health services and for admission to hospice, and clarify that they are authorized to certify admission to a skilled nursing facility, and to perform the initial admitting assessment. Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation should be amended or clarified to facilitate APNs' eligibility for clinical privileges and membership on the medical staff. Nurse-Managed Health Clinics should be included in th e regulatory definition of \"essential community providers\" that will be promulgated pursuant to the section of the Affordable Care Act that creates the Health Benefit Exchanges. CONCLUSION Almost every aspect of health care in the United States is in flux. The current reform debates include a seemingly endless (a nd ever-changing) number of pr oposals intended to reduce costs and improve access to quality health services. At the same time, modes of health care delivery continue to evolve synergistical ly at a breathtaking pace, with newly discovered biologics and pharmaceuticals, increasingly adept robotic interventions, personalized therapeutics, nanotechnology, interactive knowledge platforms, and computerized diag nostic and treatment aids that reduce the barriers of time and geography. The end product of these developments is unknow n. Health care reform, even when finalized, will not be fully implemented for several years, and the resulting ramifications on the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery system will not be understood until even later. And the science and technology of health care de livery will continue to evolve. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The infrastructure necessary for the implementation of any conceivable reforms\u2014and for the application of new assessment and treatm ent modalities\u2014is deeply flawed, stuck in place and amazingly static. More specifically, the framework for certifying to the public that an individual trained to provide care can do so competently is profoundly broken for the reasons I have described. Notwithstanding the larger uncertainties, there are known problems with promising solutions which can be acted on immediately, and which will be helpful now and in the future regardless of the final contours of any reform legislation or further developments in the delivery of care. In sum, the fundamental flaws in the regulatory framework that I have described are real, and they rob us as a nation of the full range of care op tions that our health ca re providers are capable of offering. This is particularly true of APNs, who have a pr oven track record of providing needed care across a range of pa tient populations and practice sett ings\u2014and this in spite of the regulatory obstacles with which they have ha d to contend. Freeing APNs from the unnecessary constraints I have identified (whi ch are at bottom nothing more than the historical artifacts of medical preemption) will achieve two importa nt objectives. First, it will better enable Americans, wherever they are situ ated, to receive much-need health services at a cost they can afford. Second, it will begin to remedy the system ic unfairness that has distorted many aspects of the healthcare delivery system, and will serve as a model for comprehensive reform of our entire regulatory framework by focusing on the evolving ab ility and competence of all providers rather than on rigid proprietary prerogatives.

Cronenwett, Ph.D, R.N., FAAN University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing Summary and Conclusions \"Learn the past, watch the present, and create the future.\" In October, 2009, Don Berwick and I were out of the country when we received invitations from Susan Hassmiller to co-author a background paper on the future of nursing education for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/Institute of Medicine (RWJF/ IOM) Committee on the Future of Nursing. Initial convers ations led to long lists of pot ential topics to be covered. Inevitably, we kept coming back to the question: What would be useful to Committee members who deserved a base for their deliberations that was focused and helpful ? In the end, we decided that detailed descriptions of the current challenges and recommendations for the future of nursing education from two people were not the answer. Instead, we requested and received permission to challenge five lead ers, in addition to ourselves, to write short papers focused on recommendations addressing the most important th ree issues from each of their perspectives. With input from the RWJF/IOM Committee member s and staff, we chose five esteemed (and busy) leaders and asked them to rise to this challenge within te n weeks. Each person agreed, and each met the deadline. There were no group disc ussions, and, since each of us submitted our papers at the same time (no one finished ear ly!), no one altered his or her content based on reading someone else's contributions. The seven papers are reprinted below, followed by a summary of the themes that emerged across papers. How does it match what you would have written? SUMMARY The authors of the preceding papers came from the Northeast, South, Midwest and Western parts of the country. One is a distinguished phys ician colleague, and the nursing educators are comprised of three professors (one a dean emer itus) and three current de ans. Each has exerted leadership\u2014in science, teaching, practice, and policy\u2014for multiple decades. Each leads initiatives that extend beyond the boundaries of th eir places of employment. One is the current 1 The responsibility for the content of this article rests w ith the authors and does not n ecessarily represent the views of the Institute of Medicine or its committees and convening bodies.

Wh at can we learn across the issues each chose to raise? The style of the papers differed, so what wa s called a recommendation, conclusion, or issue varies. I extracted each major poi nt, regardless of label. These major points from all authors are included in the categories below. Following each theme, authors for whom this was a major point are listed in regular font . Some additional authors mentione d the same point but not at the level of recommendations, conclusions or ma jor issues, and their names are listed in italics . Finally, I organized themes using categories that the RWJF/IOM Committee chose for panel presentations at their upcoming meeting (what to teach, how to teach, where to teach), adding a few remaining categories so that all major points were included. What to Teach (or What Students Should Learn) Competencies necessary for continuous im provement of the quality and safety of healthcare systems\u2014patient-centered care, t eamwork and collaboration, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, safety a nd informatics (Berwick, Cronenwett, Tanner ) Mastery of knowledge of systems, interpre tations of variation, human psychology in complex systems, and approaches to gaini ng knowledge in real-world, local contexts (Berwick) Skills and methods for leadership and ma nagement of continual improvement, for nurse-teachers and nurse-executives (Berwick) Competencies needed in new care delivery models Population health and population based care management (Tanner) Care coordination (Tilden) Knowledge based on standardized scie nce prerequisites (Dracup, Tanner) Health policy knowledge, skills and attitudes (Tilden) Competencies related to emerging h ealth needs\u2014e.g., ge riatrics (Tanner) How to Teach Guide students in integrating knowledge from clinical, social and behavioral sciences with the practice of nursing to enhance developm ent of clinical reasoning skills (Cronenwett, Dracup, Tanner, Tanner) Evaluate and test models of inte r-professional education, including timing, determination of what levels of students should learn together, and what content is most effectively delivered with in ter-professional learners (Tilden) Develop and test new approach es to pre-licensure clinical education, including use of simulation (Dracup, Tanner) Involve students in inter-professional quality improvement projects (Berwick, Gilliss, Cronenwett ) Develop model pre-licensure curricula that incorporate best practices in teaching and learning and can be used as a framework fo r community college-university partnerships (Tanner) PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Nonetheless, given the long list of issues that would have been covered had we chosen to write one comprehensive paper, a remarkably small number of themes emerged. H opefully, these rich ideas and themes can be used to inform the deliberations of the RWJF/IOM Committee on the Future of Nursing. Even more hopefully, a collective nationa l response to these important i ssues will create a future that meets nursing's obligations to the society it serves.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-6 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Nursing Education Policy Priorities Linda H. Aiken, Ph.D., FAAN, FRCN, R.N. University of Pennsylvania Nursing is one of the most versatile occupations within the healthcare workforce. In the 150 some years since Nightingale developed and promot ed the concept of an educated workforce of caregivers for the sick, modern nur sing has reinvented itself a numbe r of times as health care has advanced and changed (Lynaugh, 2008). As a result of nursing's versatility, new career pathways for nurses have evolved attracti ng a larger and more diverse applicant pool and a broader scope of practice and responsibilities. Nu rsing, because of its versatility has been an enabling force for change in health care along many dimensions including but not limited to the evolution of the high technology hospital, the possibility for physic ians to combine office and hospital practice, length of hospital stay among the s hortest in the world, reductions in the work hours of resident physicians to improve patient safety, extending national primary care capacity, improving access to care for the poor and rural residents, and co ntributing to much needed care coordination for the chronically ill and frail (Aiken et al., 2009). Indeed, with every pass ing decade, nursing has become a more integral part of health care serv ices to the extent that a future without large numbers of nurses is impossible to envision. A POLICY CHALLENGE From a policy perspective, nursing 's versatility is important to note for the simple reason that nursing has evolved faster than public policies affecting the profession. The result is that nursing's forward progress to bette r serve the public is hampered by the constraints of outdated public policies involving government education subsidies, workfor ce priorities, sc ope of practice limitations and regulations, and pa yment policies. An important priority in national health care reform is achieving better value for the expenditures made on hea lth services. Since health care is labor intensive, getting more value will depe nd in large part on enhancing productivity and effectiveness of the workforce. Nurses repres ent a large and unexploite d opportunity to achieve greater value. The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss several key changes in nursing education policy that are critically needed to shape the nurse workforce to best serve the healthcare needs of the American public in the years ahead. It is written with the assumption that nurse scope of practice and payment policy reforms will take pla ce over the near term to remove some of the existing barriers to nurses practici ng to the full extent of their education and expertise. This assumption is based on steady progress in removing barriers to nursing practi ce at the state level and language in current national health reform legislation showing great er neutrality in the designation of types of health pr ofessionals who can participate in and lead new initiatives in primary care and chronic care coordination. Changes in nursing education policies are needed to insure that the nurse workforce of the future is appropriately educated for anticipated role expansions and changing population needs.

Increase federal and state subsidies for gra duate nurse education at the master's and doctoral levels in the form of scholarships, loan forgiveness, and institutional capacity with a priority on produci ng more nurse faculty. Encourage public and private resource i nvestments to Incentivize students and nursing programs to expedite production of qualifie d nurse faculty by shortening the trajectory from entry into basic nursing educati on through doctoral and post-doctoral study by expedited BSN to Ph.D. programs and comparable innovations. Create a federal health professions workfo rce planning and policy capacity in the Executive Branch with authority to recomme nd to the President a nd the Congress health workforce policy priorities across federal agencies and departments. Recommend the inclusion of health servic es research on various forms of nursing investments in improving care outcomes includi ng comparisons of the cost effectiveness of improving hospital nurse to patient ratio s, increasing nurse education, and improving the nurse work environment. At present comparative effectiveness research is more focused on drug and treatment intervention tria ls than on innovations in care delivery including workforce interventions. PRIORITY FUNDING TO INCREA SE INITIAL BSN GRADUATES Every year the percent of new registered nurse s graduating from associate degree programs increases, and is now over 66 perc ent of all new nurse graduates. Multiple blue ribbon panels on nursing education, including the ju st released Carnegie Foundation Report on Nursing Education (Benner et al., 2010) as well as health workforce reports to Congress for two decades, have concluded that there is a substantial shortage of nurses with BS N and higher education to meet current and future national health care needs. Advances in medical science and technology, the changing practice boundaries betwee n medicine and nursing, and the increase in the share of the population with multiple chronic health conditions create a level of co mplexity in health care that requires a more educated health care workforce. Nursing is the least well educated health profession by far but the one experiencing the greatest expansion in scope of practice and responsibilities. The National Advisory Counc il on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) (1996), policy advisors to the Congress and the U. S. Secretary of Health and Human Services on nursing issues, urged almost 15 years ago that polic y actions be taken to ensure that at least 66 percent of nurses would hold a baccalaureate in nursing or higher by 2010; the actual result is closer to 45 percent. As descri bed in the sections below, grow ing evidence suggests that the shortage of nurses with BSN and higher education is adversely a ffecting a number of dimensions of health care delivery now and these problems will only become exaggerated in the future.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-8 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Quality of Hospital Care A growing body of research documents that hospita ls with a larger proportion of bedside care nurses with BSNs or higher qualifi cations is associated with lo wer risk of patient mortality. Aiken and colleagues (2003) in a paper published in JAMA showed that in 1999, each 10 percent increase in the proportion of a hospital's bedside nurse workforce with BSN qualification was associated with a 5 percent decline in mort ality following common surgical procedures. A similar finding was published by Friese and associat es for cancer surgical outcomes (Friese et al., 2008). Aiken's team has replicated this finding in a larger study of hosp itals in 2006. Similar results have been published for medi cal as well as surgical patients in at least 3 large studies in Canada and Belgium (Estabrooks et al., 2005; To urangeau et al., 2007; Van den Heede et al., 2009). This research has motivated the American Association of Nurse Executives, the major professional organization representing hospita l nurse chief executive officers who employ 56 percent of the nation's nurses, to establish th e BSN as the desired credential for nurses. Many hospitals, particularly teaching hospitals and child ren's hospitals, are acting on the evidence base by requiring the BSN for employment. Nurse execu tives in teaching hospitals have a goal of 90 percent BSN nurses, and community hospital nurs e executives aim for at least 50 percent BSN- prepared nurses (Goode et al., 2001 ). Since only 45 percent of be dside care nurses have a BSN, many executives cannot reach their goals. Access and Costs There is some research evidence that the cost effectiveness of nursing improves with a more educated workforce. In Aiken's JAMA paper, evidence was presented to show that the mortality rates were the same for hospitals in which nur ses cared for 8 patients each, on average, and 60 percent had a BSN and in hospitals in which nurses cared for only 4 patients each but only 20 percent had a BSN (Aiken et al., 2003; Aiken, 2008). More research is needed to assess the comparative value of investing in different nursing strategies that evaluate the relative cost and outcomes of increasing nurse staffing, educati onal levels, and improving the organizational context and culture of th e nurse work environment. At this point the evidence is encouraging that a more educated hospital nurse workforce might allow for a smaller nurse workforce without adversely affecting patient outcomes. If confirmed in future research, this finding could have important implications for both cost of hospita l care and for the number of nurses actually needed in the future to staff hospitals. In the ambulatory sector, there is a strong re search base documenting that nurses with advanced clinical training, usua lly master's degrees in advanc ed clinical practice, provide primary care with outcomes comparable to, a nd in some domains like symptom control and satisfaction better than, t hose of physicians and with lower co sts (Horrocks et al., 2002; Griffiths et al., 2010). Rand researchers estim ated, for example, that the stat e of Massachusetts could save up to $8 billion over a decade by attracting more a dvanced practice nurses and removing barriers that prevent them from practicing at the full level of their educa tion and expertise (Eibner et al., 2009). Increased use of advanced practice nurses is one of the very fe w practice innovations currently under considered in national health reform, including medical homes and chronic care coordination, that would yield net cost savings nationally according to Rand researchers (Hussey et al., 2009).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-9 How the Shortage of BSN Nurses Impacts Future Nurse Supply As argued above, the shortage of BSN nurses ha s implications for health care quality and safety, access, and costs of care. A less well recognized consequence of the shortage of BSN nurses is a shortage of faculty which could have a long term impact on national production capacity of nurses for the future. The Department of Labor estimates that 600,000 new jobs will be created for nurses over the next 10 years, the highest rate of new job production for any profession (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). In addition, over a half million nurses in the current workforce, which has an average age of around 48, will reach retirement age over the same period resulting in the need for over a million nurses to be added to the nationa l workforce. The good news is that there is tremendous interest in nursing as a career in th e U.S. after a century of difficulty attracting the best and brightest to nursing. The reasons fo r this unprecedented interest are multi-faceted having to do with attractive incomes, averag ing nationally $65,000 a year and higher in some locations, better job prosp ects than in other employment sect ors, and perceptions of personally satisfying work helping others. If we can take advantage of this unpr ecedented interest and expand nursing school production, future nursing shortages could be gr eatly attenuated. The bad news is that nursing schools do not have the capacity to absorb the great windfall in applicants. Estimates suggest th at at least 40,000 qualified appli cants to nursing schools are being turned away each year (AACN, 2009). Ther e are several reasons why nursing schools are unable to accept the influx of a pplicants. Nursing schools have expanded enrollments steadily for more than a decade with graduations in creasing from about 75,000 in 1994 to 110,000 in 2008. Resources of all kinds are now stretched and schools are having difficulty expanding further. Institutions of higher education in general are experiencing seri ous budget constraints and as a result are slowing enrollment growth. Additionally the shortage of nursing faculty has become a major constraining factor. A strategy for ameliorating the nurse faculty shortage that has received little attention to date is to increase entry level education of nurses to produce a larger pool of nurses likely to obtain graduate education. In a recent paper in Health Affairs Aiken and colleagues provided a cohort analysis to determine the highest education ach ieved by nurses receiving their basic or initial nursing education between 1974 and 1994 (Aiken et al., 2009). We found th at choice of initial nursing education program\u2014associate degree or baccal aureate--was the majo r predictor of final educational attainment. Close to 20 percent of nurses irrespective of initi al nursing education obtain a higher degree. However, of the 20 percen t of associate degree nurses who obtain an additional degree, 80 percent stop at the baccalaur eate degree. Of the 20 pe rcent of nurses with a baccalaureate degree who go on for additional education, almost 100 percent obtain at least a master's degree. This is an important findi ng for the design of policy interventions since investments in encouraging BSN education have not disti nguished between RN to BSN programs and basic BSN programs. The yield for te achers is entirely different between the two types of programs. If the current scenario of distribution of nurses by type of basic education had been reversed since 1974 and 66 percent of nurse s had graduated from BS N programs instead of 33 percent, we estimate that there would be over 50,000 more nurses with master's and higher degrees today. We concluded in our Health Affairs paper that it was a mathema tical improbability that the nurse faculty shortage could be solved without changing the distributi on of nurses by type of basic education. There are simply not enough nurses who obtain a master's or higher degree to PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-10 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH meet the dramatic increase in demand for clinic ians, administrators, te achers, and leaders who require a graduate degree. What would be the expected yield in terms of nursing faculty that w ould be likely to obtain by increasing basic BSN education? To answer this we undertook an analysis of the National Sample Surveys of Registered Nurses over time to explore whether career trajectories of nurses with graduate education had changed over time. The answer is yes\u2014significantly. For example, in 1982, 17 percent of nurses with master's degr ees and 62 percent of nurses with doctorates were in faculty positions compared to only 7 pe rcent of master's and 41 percent of nurses with PhDs in 2004. Nurses with graduate degrees ar e selecting positions in clinical care and administration in ever larger numbers. The yield for teachers is clearly greater for those who earn doctoral degrees which argues for policies that ag gressively recruit BSN nurses into expedited doctoral education thus bypassi ng the master's which has a very clinical curriculum and a different endpoint end objective focused on produc ing clinicians. Probably for historical reasons, many schools build their curricu la sequentially from the BSN to MSN to doctoral degree. However, the clinical masters in specialty practice has little to do with learning to teach or to conduct research. The clinical masters is not a building block for doctoral study but a terminal degree like the MBA or the Masters in Engineering. In order to address th e faculty shortage two things would have to happen simultaneously. More nurses would need to initiate basic nursing education at the baccalaureat e level AND expedited BSN to PhD programs would need to be expanded to interest students in teaching career s earlier and expedited to bypass the clinical masters that emphasize career trajecto ries in clinical care. The clinical master's is not a building block for doctoral education but a different career pathway. Tying educational loan forgiveness to teaching is a reasonable supplemental strategy along with a focus on BSN to PhD education to help offset lower incomes in faculty positions. Actually closing the gap between pr actice and academic salaries is not feasible. The gap exists in every practice discipline including medicine, law, business, and engineering. University faculty salaries vary for different fiel ds depending upon market factors but not enough to close the gap between teaching and practice within disc iplines. Combining clinical and academic responsibilities for nurse faculty is a potential strategy for enhanc ing faculty incomes. However, in only a few nursing specialties like nurse anes thesia or executive positions are rates of remuneration for clinical nursing care high enough to offset lower academic salaries for teachers with joint clinical appointments. Articulation programs aimed at facilitating a dditional education for RNs with less than a baccalaureate degree have been tried for decades and do little to produce more teachers. Once nurses qualify for licensure, 80 percent do not seek further education. Oregon has the most innovative approach to improvi ng articulation between associ ate degree and baccalaureate programs by standardizing requirement; the Oregon program has twic e the success rate than the national average with 40 percen t of associate degree nurses obta ining the BSN. However, the Oregon articulation initiative would not solve the s hortage of teachers beca use most of those who get the BSN will not go for a second additiona l degree. RN to MSN programs would have a somewhat higher yield for teachers than RN to BSN completion courses bu t not nearly as high a yield as BSN to PhD programs. Associate degree education is appealing to pol icy makers because it seems to offer upward mobility because it is less expensive and more geographically accessible. However data suggest in the case of registered nurses that initial qualification for licensure at the associate degree level actually constrains educational and career mobility compared to those who initially qualify at the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The advantages of associate degree education, lo wer out of pocket costs and geographic proximity, can be offset in the ca se of nursing by public subsidies for educational costs and distance learning. The length of associ ate degree and baccalaure ate programs are not significantly different because of licensure requ irements. Maintaining th ree (including diploma) educational pathways for nurses th at at least on the surface do not seem radically different have a dramatic impact on the upward educational mobility of nurses thus contributing to the shortage of faculty and other nurses requiri ng graduate level education. The majority of countries with comparable hea lth care to the U.S. have moved to standardize nursing education at the baccalaureate entry level including the European Union. States have the authority in the U.S. to set licensure requirements for nursing. Prospects for standardizing education of nurses thro ugh licensure changes across 50 states are not good. However, financial incentives imbedded in public subsidies for nursing education could have a significant effect on changing patterns of education just as payment incentives change medical practice patterns. The IOM Committee should recommend increasi ng public subsidies for basic nursing education\u2014federal and state\u2014and tying thes e funds to the production of baccalaureate graduates. Policies should be neutral on types of institutions\u2014community colleges or 4 year colleges and universities-- that could benefit from funding. Capitation funding on the basis of BSN graduates from basic education programs c ould be effective in sh ifting the proportion of graduates towards more with BS N qualifications. Coupled with increased funding for graduate nurse education, this could be an effective strategy for addressi ng the faculty shortage along with shortages of advanced practice nurse clinicians and administrators. IOM Committee members in a previous discussion of this option asked what the yield would be for faculty positions in increasing baccalaureate graduates. Additional research is needed to answer this important question directly. Howeve r, we know from existing research that BSN initial graduates are 3 times more likely to get a Master's degree and twi ce as likely to get a doctoral degree than associate degree nurses (A iken et al., 2009) wh ich would likely produce more teachers. Because the current yield of t eachers is relatively low overall among nurses with graduate degrees\u2014only 7 percent of master's graduates and 41 percent of doctoral graduates electing faculty positions\u2014policies to increase b accalaureate initial educa tion would have to be accompanied by efforts to increase the teacher yield. Promising strategies to increase the teacher yield among those with graduate credentials include scholarship and educational loan repayment for those in teaching roles and funds to expand BSN to PhD expedited programs. And investments in more baccalaureate nurse graduates would also likely return additional benefits in the form of better quality, impr oved access, and efficiency for t hose electing clinical practice roles, an outcome in the public's interest. INCREASED FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING FOR GRADUATE NURSE EDUCATION The evidence is strong that the growth of advanced nurse practic e has contributed to improved access to general care (Aiken et al., 2009). Over the past decade advance practice nurses have largely staffed the new retail clinics that currently provide about 3 million ambulatory visits a year at an es timated per visit cost of below the average cost to a physician office. Additionally, advanced practice nurses have enabled the largest expansion of Community Health Centers since the Great Society Program ; CHCs currently provide over 16 million visits in 7300 sites to largely underserved people. In to tal, advance practice nurses are estimated to PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-12 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH provide up to 600 million ambulatory patient vis its a year, a national primary care capacity enhancement that will become increasingly cri tical to access in a context of primary care physician shortage. The rate of production of new advanced prac tice nurses (APNs) which had been growing steadily since the 1970s has been flat in recent years. Interest among nurse s in advanced practice roles appears strong but th e shortage of student financial aid for graduate nurse education has a chilling effect on enrollment growth. It is difficult for many nurses to forego employment income to attend graduate programs full time w ithout scholarships or loans which are in short supply. The major source of funding for gra duate nurse education is Title VIII annual appropriations which currently total about $60 m illion (estimate for graduate education only, not all of Title VIII funding), compared to $2.4 bill ion for direct graduate medical education for physicians. A large proportion of APN students pursue graduate e ducation on a part time basis which slows the production of new graduates. Empl oyer tuition benefits, an important source of educational assistance for prac ticing nurses have been reduced during the economic downturn eroding available financial support for graduate nurs e education, particularly at the master's level which is generally required for a dvanced nurse clinical practice. Medicare, since its inception, has paid for a shar e of graduate medical education. It has also reimbursed some hospitals for a portion of thei r nursing education costs. An analysis we conducted of 2006 HCRIS data from CMS s uggested that Medicare funding for nursing education was slightly less than $160 million an nually, a small amount compared to medical education investments, but almost as much as all of Title VIII funding fo r nursing in that year. CMS has a larger estimate of $300 million in Medicare payments for nursing education but we cannot verify that estimate with publically available data. Bu t whether Medicare funding is $160 million or $300 million annually, policies governing expenditures are very different from how the funds are spent in support of medical education, the amount is large relative to other sources of federal support for nursing education, and the f unding does not materially affect the supply of nurses or the quality of nursing care for the elderly (Aiken and Gwyther, 1995). Most of the funds are limited to hospital-sponsored diplom a nursing schools which currently prepare less than 5 percent of new RNs annually. Also 5 to 6 states account for almost half of Medicare nursing education funding because of the locati on of the relatively few surviving diploma nursing schools. A number of workforce studi es and commissions includ ing a 1997 IOM Committee have called for the realignment of Medicare funding for nursing e ducation to graduate nursing education (IOM, 1997). The health reform bill passed by the Senate proposes a small demonstration of up to 5 hospitals to test Me dicare payments for graduate nursing education. While better than no progress at all, the proposed demonstration is too small to significantly advance a change in Medicare policy that is long overdue. There is sufficient information available now as suggested by the Institute of Medicine in 1997 to realign Medicare nursing ed ucation funding to graduate nur sing education. This could be a budget neutral programmatic shift which woul d more than double current federal funding levels for graduate nursing edu cation and serve as a significant stimulus fo r increased production of advanced practice nurses to meet the multitude of existing and emerging needs resulting from the continuously changing boundaries between nursing and medicine.

The modest nursing policy capacity is located within the Heal th Resources and Services Administration, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) w ith little of its own funding and no authority to enga ge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which controls Medicare nursing ed ucation funding or the Depart ment of Education where the largest funding for nursing educat ion resides in the form of Carl Perkins Act funding for community colleges. Patterns of basic pre-licensure education fo r nurses have changed dramatically in the 45 years since the nation's last major health reform\u2014Medicare and Medicaid. In 1965, over 85 percent of nurses received th eir basic education in hospital sponsored diploma programs; now less than 5 percent do. The percentage of regist ered nurses receiving trai ning in associate degree programs was less than 2 percent in 1965 but is over 66 percent today. Baccalaureate nursing programs produced about 10 percent of new nurses in 1965, which increased to about a third of new nurses by 1980, and has been stable there fo r 30 years (Aiken and Gwyther, 1995). Current Medicare policies for support of nursing education as implemented by CMS are still based on nursing education patterns that existed when Medicare was passed but that are practically irrelevant today. CMS has been resistant to propo sals to realign existi ng Medicare support for nursing education to graduate nursing educati on through multiple different administrations in Washington. The single largest source of federal support for nursing education is the Department of Education's funding for community colleges thr ough the Carl Perkins. Perkins funds exceed $8 billion annually. A high priority should be se t on examining whether and how Perkins funds could be targeted to incentivize community college nursing programs to increase the proportion of their nursing students who comp lete their initial education w ith a BSN. There are numerous feasible strategies to do this including having community colleges offer the BSN as in Florida and other states as well as i nnovative partnerships with 4 year colleges and universities perhaps using state of the art distance learning technologies supported by Perkins funding. The most influential of the many commissions on nursing over the decades was the 1982 IOM Study, Nursing and Nursing Education: Public Policies and Private Actions . That study made a recommendation involving an organizational change within HHS that dramatically altered national nurse leadership and nursing education. The r ecommendation was to move the responsibility and budget authority for nursing research from HRSA to NIH where research was highly visible and influential. Th e establishment of the National Institute of Nursing Research within two decades fundamentally transformed th e engagement of nursing in evidence-based innovations to improve health outcomes, helped create new and important interdisciplinary research and research traini ng collaborations, improved the re levance and quality of nursing education in universitie s. The proposal to establish a nursi ng workforce authority at a higher level of the federal government could have an eq ually influential impact on the adequacy of the national nurse workforce.

Of the many types of recommendations the Committee might consider, recommendations regard ing federal (and state) fundi ng of nursing education are among the most actionable and potentially influential in creating a future for nursing that serves the public's interests in patie nt-centered accessible health services at affordable costs. What is good for the public is genuinely good for nursing. Using public nursing education policy as a vehicle for achieving a better balance be tween the qualifications of nurses and national health care needs could result in great re turn on investment now and in the years ahead.

Berwick, M.D. Institute for Healthcare Improvement \"I see.\" said the nurse, \"You're saying that I have two jobs: doing my job, and making my job better.\" In the 20 years since I first heard that co mment from my colleague, Paul Batalden, MD (retold January 2010) who was quoti ng a participant in a course he was teaching on health care improvement, I have never heard a more succinct summary of the modern view of the pursuit of quality in a complex system. It is a deceptively simple idea, replete with implications for the preparation, self-image, support, and daily life of the professional. It represents a comprehensive goal for the modern nurse and for those w ho wish to prepare people for that role. The capacity to \"make my job better\" is not in born. Nor is it usually taught in professional education. What professional e ducation, including nursing educati on, has more reliably focused on is the content of the job\u2014the subject matter knowledge and c ognitive and manipulative skills to care for patients in existing processes and in stitutions. Standards exist for how one ought to perform tasks, including dynamic tasks like probl em-solving, professional preparation instills mastery of those tasks, and prof essional licensure and certificati on allege to assure achievement of that mastery. W. Edwards Deming, one of the great theorists and teachers of improvement in systems contexts, distinguished this discipline-specific and subject-matte r knowledge, which tells one, in effect, \"how to be a nurse,\" from what he called \"Knowledge for Improvement\" (or, less felicitously, \"Profound Knowledge\") (Deming, 1994) , which would tell one \"how to improve nursing\" or, more accurately, \"how to help improve the system of which nursing is a component.\" Mastery of the first\u2014subject-ma tter mastery\u2014does not confer mastery of the second\u2014knowledge for improvement. This form of knowledge invites attenti on to the system in which professional work is conducted. In some ways it is surprising how little our pe dagogy promotes appreciation of systems of care. Arguably, most graduates of most health professional educational program suffer from considerable \"functional illiteracy\" about the systems in wh ich they work. Few emerge from their studies with a well-develope d sense of responsibility for the performance of these systems, even though they work in those systems and depend on them every day. The evidence of serious deficiencies in the performance of health care as a system is overwhelming and incontrovertible . It fueled the findings and r ecommendations of the landmark Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm, in the year 2001, which claimed: \"Between the health care we have and the care we could have lies not just a gap but a chasm\" (IOM, 2001, p. 1). Its diagnosis: incapable system s of care: \"In its current form, habits, and environment, American health care is incapable of providing the public with the quality health care it expects and deserves\" (IOM, 2001, p. 43). The Chasm Report established six \"Aims for Improvement\" of care, which now compose a safety harm from care); PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-17 effectiveness (increasing the reliability of alignment between scientific evidence and practice, reducing both underuse of effective practices and overuse of ineffective ones); patient-centeredness (offering patients and thei r loved ones more control, choice, self- efficacy, and individualization of care); timeliness (reducing delays that are not in strumental, intended, and informative); efficiency (reducing waste in all its forms); equity (closing racial and socioeconomic gaps in quality, access, and health outcomes). In the decade since the Chasm Report , the social imperative for all six of these improvements has increased, with perhaps speci al emphasis lately on \"efficiency \" as the costs of American health care have come to appear less and less sustainable. Activities in health care policy, management, and payment have increased, with more or less coherence, in pursuit of those goals. Yet the response from health professionals (a nd the faculties who tr ain them) to shoulder accountability for health system performance has been limited, and in many places virtually absent. If, as the Chasm Report alleges, the current system of care is \"incapable\" of the needed improvement, then, logically, purs uit of the IOM Aims for Improve ment requires that the system change. Nursing, like any health car e profession, can become an object of change, or an agent of change. The latter role will require a new form of professionalism with new skills in system redesign.2 Nursing is positioned well to be a change agent. One recent national project to reduce patient injuries, the Institute for Healthcare Im provement's \"100,000 Lives Campaign\" (McCannon et al., 2006) translated th e IOM aims of \"safety\" and \"effec tiveness\" into operational form as \"bundles\" of evidence-based care procedures, su ch as the \"Central Line Bundle\" to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infections, the \"Ventilator Bundle\" to present respirator- associated pneumonias, and Rapid Response Teams, to intercept patient deterioration with early warning, diagnosis, and treatment. Hundreds of hos pitals reported success in improved patient outcomes, and a recurrent patter n included activated nurses, suppor ted to standardize their own processes of care according to the IHI \"bundles,\" and empowered and supported to monitor and enforce those standards across disciplines, incl uding with their physicia n colleagues (Berwick et al., 2006). Present steadily at the point of care, committed to excellence and reliability, equipped to measure locally, biased toward t eamwork, and, crucially, en couraged to innovate locally to adapt changes to local contexts, nur ses proved the ideal leaders for changing care systems and raising the bar on results. Some relevant education innovation are well-underway. The pion eering work of the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) proj ect (Cronenwett et al., 2007) and the adoption by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing of the QSEN quality improvement competencies in The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for undergraduate nursing education is heartening and opens the possibility that students across the professions will develop similar 2 Some elements of that new professionalism have been labeled in the reformulation of goals of resident training by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educa tion (ACGME) as \"systems-bas ed practice\" and \"practice- based learning and improvement.\" The Association of Bo ards of Medical Specialties were \"partners\" in the definition of competencies both for initial certification (after residency) and for Maintenance of Certification\u2014a process adopted now by each medical specialty member of the ABMS. The latter means that every practicing medical specialist will be required to demonstrate performa nce improvement in practice in order to maintain their board certified specialty status.

Fu rther, QSEN's work on faculty development (Cronenwett et al., 2009a) and graduate nursing education (Cronenwett et al., 2009b) to extend these ideas into all of nursing professional develo pment is exciting. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's \"Open School for the Health Prof essions\" is an interpro fessional educational community that helps students from all the health professions to acquire the skills to become change agents for healthcare improvement. From the viewpoint of nursing education, the capacity to help improve systems of care has two big elements: (a) personal skills and (b) a context of leadership and management that allows those skills to thrive in action. Nursing educatio n fit for the needs of th e 21st century will attend to both. PERSONAL SKILLS: THE CATEGORIES OF KNOWLEDGE FOR IMPROVEMENT Deming's four \"profound knowledge\" categories offer a useful framework for education goals and achievements for nurses capable of helping to improve systems: 1. Knowledge of Systems 2. Knowledge of Variation 3. Knowledge of Psychology 4. Knowledge of How to Gain Knowledge Let us explore each. Knowledge of Systems \"Knowledge of Systems\" refers to understand ing the technical charac teristics of complex systems, in which factors like interdependency, feedback loop s and other non-linear dynamics, uncertainty, and sensitivity to small changes constantly operate. Wit hout systems knowledge, one approaches work (or life in general) as a series of lists, with a mentality of checking-off tasks, with assumptions of direct and linea r cause-and-effect dynamics. The world, or the organization, is modeled like a machine, and simp lification seems helpful. In health care, of course, things rarely work that way. In clinical work, medications can have remote, delayed, and confusing side-effects; organs interact in co mplex and powerful ways; patient status can be unstable, with feedback loops that spiral into sudden disasters and unwelcome surprises. Well-trained nurses are familiar with system dynamics of that sort: they understand the pituitary- adrenal-hypothalamic axis; they have studied fa mily systems; and they are alert always to medication interactions and the effects of or gan failure on physiology. Each of these requires \"knowledge of systems,\" that is, knowledge of the body as a system, for appropriate diagnosis and response. Where \"knowledge of systems\" is less robust in the preparation of nurses (as well as most other health professionals ) is in understanding the work of health care as a system. This ignorance is the harvest less of inte nt than of historical accidents. In effect, modern health care is a assemblage of component roles, disciplines, and institutions built up more or less independently, and often without much regard for their interactions. Nurses and doctors who will work together for their entire professional lives ra rely train together for even a single day. Tasks are compartmentalized. In many medical record s \"nursing notes\" remain separate from PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-19 \"physicians' notes,\" and in many hospital ward s the \"Nurses' Conference Room\" and \"Nursing Rounds\" are separate from the \"Doctors' Conference Room\" and \"Medical Rounds.\" The fragmentation runs deep, as refl ected in language, oaths, uniform s, schedules, and prerogatives. In addition, the processes of care, themselves, by which I mean the flows and steps through which patients, specimens, information, and ideas pass, are often unclear and designed, if at all, only unconsciously. No one is really sure what al l the steps are that a patient traverses from admission to diagnosis to treatment to discharge, and no one is in charge of the entire flow. In Paul Batalden's words, health care lacks the \"catwalks\" that make processes visible, and therefore analyzable, in manufacturing. It is very hard to manage and improve what one cannot see or understand, and \"process illiteracy\" confounds health care redesign often. This is not inevitable. \"How do we do that?\" is a perfectly reasonably and tractable question for almost any set of interdependent deeds in hea lth care, just as long as someone is in a position to ask and to mobilize the information to find the answer. The answer may prove embarrassing\u2014 there may be no stable process at all, or the one that does exist can look, upon inspection, absurdly wasteful or unscientific; but, the ability to examine and study processes opens the door to changing processes, which is on the road to improving them. I am not a nurse, but my guess is that nursi ng educators will have no difficulty at all recognizing some educational goals in which \"knowle dge of systems\" is already a high priority. For example, I suspect that nursing training for some specialist roles, such as for participation in an open heart surgery team, is fu ll of attention to system dynamics of all sorts. No patient has ever gotten successfully onto and off of a heart- lung machine without exquisite attention by an entire team to process steps, interdependenc ies, and interactions, likely very consciously designed and monitored. The task in modernization of nursing educat ion is to generalize the pursuit of system knowledge into all that nursing is and does. Topics of relevance may include (a) health care as a system; (b) general systems theory; (c) queuing theo ry and flow in care systems; (d) reliability and reliability engineering; (e ) lean production, and (f) resilien ce (Spear, 2008). In the important and special arena of safety, system topics include (g) human fact ors science (Reason, 1990), (h) team communications and co llaboration, (i) failure mode and effect analysis, and (j) properties of high-reliability organizations (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2007), to name a few. Knowledge of Variation Professor George Box has said, \"All systems pr oduce information on the basis of which they can be understood.\" The new professional capable of leading and participating in improvement knows how to hear and use that information. Measurement is abundant in health care, as nurses well know. Nurses spend an inordinate proportion of their time documenti ng and recording things; they m easure all the time. However, measuring is not at all the same task as using measurement, especially using measurement to improve. When measuring for improvement (as opposed to measuring for judgment or measuring for selection), one is either (a) observing va riation to extract id eas or (b) introducing variation to study the consequences. Observing variation is what nurses do every day in recording a pati ent's vital signs, for example. The aim is inference: either that the pa tient is stable, or that a systematic or sudden change in status is underway. In effect, every blood pressure or temperature measurement is a test of a hypothesis that, either, \"something special is going on\" or that \"nothing special is going PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-20 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH on.\" Nurses in that role are like other scie ntists\u2014continually measuring and making repeated inferences (Berwick, 1991). How well they do that helps to determine patie nts' outcomes. \"Is the antibiotic working as expected?\" \"Is the blood pressure coming under control?\" \"Is the pa tient entering, or staying in, proper fluid balance?\" Upon the answers to thos e questions, based on prop er interpretation of variation, rest crucial decisions about maintaining or cha nging theories and therapies. The challenges of proper interpretation are significa nt, and neither physicians nor nurses yet today receive sufficient instruction in how to understand variation correctly. The consequence of failure are what Dr. Deming referr ed to technically as two forms of \"tampering.\" The first form is to react to a random change in a measuremen t\u2014such as a temporary rising temperature or a temporarily falling blood pressure\u2014 as if it were informative (\"the an tibiotic is not working,\" or \"this patient needs more pressor\") when, in f act, the observed fluctuat ion is only random, and would revert if nothing new were done. The converse form of tampering is to classify a change as characteristic of a system when, in actual fact, it is not at all likely to be representative of the general system from which it comes. This misi nterpretation can lead one to make a wholesale change in response to a special event, as when our transportation security system radically alters inspection regimes in response to a single, unlikely-to-be- repeated threat.3 As modern medical care and monitoring multiply the volume of information and the number of measurements flooding the nurse at the front line, the demand for tec hnical sophistication in interpreting physiological and bioc hemical variation rises steadil y. The modern nurse should be equipped as never before with the knowledge to interpret variation correctly, to avoid tampering, and to increase agility in appropriate response. What applies to patients applies to systems of care, as well. The \"vital signs\" of health care as a system are numerous and, lik e measurements of patients, in creasing in availability daily. System characteristics include, for example, waiti ng times and delays, rates of complication and outcomes of surgery and other interventions, inf ection, and mortality, patient satisfaction, costs and levels of waste and efficiency, safety levels and adverse events, and levels of variation in approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Many such measurements are appearing in new forms of accountability of health care orga nizations and professionals to payers, regulators, accreditation agencies, consumer groups, and licensing bodies. The psychology of such external measurement can be quite negative, inducing fear, anger, and sometimes deceptive practices even among the most committed professionals, but this negative cy cle ought not to obscure a basic fact: that the improvement of health care systems requires very much the same type of measurement, used internally, that scrutiny bodies demand and use for other purp oses externally (Berwick et al., 2003). Ideally, even if no one else required measur ement of infection rates or surgical outcomes, clinicians, themselves, ought to seek them avidly as a crucia l resource for making care better. Modern nurses will, of necessity, have to learn the tasks involved in measurement for scrutiny and compliance\u2014that's the hard fact . But, modernized nursing education will emphasize far more the role and use of system me trics as a support to th e continual improvement of health care along all six of the IOM dimensions . Individual nursing practic e will, in that mode, include avid measurement and s ophisticated interpretation to an swer questions of the form: \"How is our system doing at X, and what can th e variation tell us a bout how to do better?\" 3 The technical description of the first form of tamperin g is \"reacting to common cause variation is if it were of special cause;\" the second form is \"r eacting to special cause variation as if it were of common cause.\" Knowing the difference between \"special cause\" and \"common cause\" variation is at the h eart of modern statistical process control. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-21 Measurement for improvement goes far beyond mere observation. It includes systematic, local interventions\u2014making changes in processe s of care and assessing and learning from the consequences of those changes. An important boundary exists between formal scientific investigations\u2014experiments that ought to invoke the whole apparatus of planning and human subjects protection that are now required in some settings\u2014and the daily practice of continual improvement through the introduc tion and assessment of better local processes\u2014the \"Plan-Do- Study-Act\" approach that is at the core of modern improvement methods, and about which we will have more to say below. That said, the modern nurse ought to be equipped to participate in and often to lead systematic changes in work processes, and to assess their effects on the outcomes desired (Langley et al., 2009). Knowledge of Psychology Largely because interdependency, especially interdependency among people, is so much a characteristic of complex systems, like health care, human nature and psychology play a strong role in the success or failure of improvement effo rts. Dr. Deming had in mind a rather long list of the components of \"psychology\" whose unde rstanding and mastery underpin successful improvement work. One short subset of relevant skills is this: Conflict resolution and negotiation; Group process and meeting management; Forging and maintaining cooperation and coalitions; Adult learning; Understanding motivation, especi ally intrinsic motivation; Communication and signaling; and Maintaining a culture of safety. The unifying concept among these topics is \"managing and improving interpersonal relationships,\" which can be daunting in a context of high pressures on production, historical boundaries among disciplines and subsystems, hier archy, and high risk. Scholars of so-called \"high reliability organizations\" (\" HROs\") (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2007) nonetheless find that it is exactly under conditions of stress, risk, and complexity that relationships matter the most in determining success. It may be impossible for nurs es unilaterally to effect better relationships unless other professionals aims to do the same, but nurses are so central to health care processes that they may well be able to take the lead. Knowledge of How to Gain Knowledge Learning in complex systems is, itself, comp lex. Non-linear systems confound attempts to develop and enforce simple models of cause-and- effect, and so traditional, hypothetico-deductive methods to explore cause-and-eff ect often fail. We know that in the daily life of parenting, marital relationships, and team sports, where \"continual learning and improvement\" replaces \"planned experiment\" as an a pproach for gaining knowledge. Even where firm, cause-and-effect knowledge exists in science-based health care\u2014the knowledge, for example, that antibiotic A will almost always kill bacterium B\u2014the application of that knowledge runs straightaway into the messy world of complex systems. That is, reliably getting the antibiotic safely into the body of a patient with that ge rm turns out to be a constant PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-22 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH challenge as systems fail (the order got lost), unp redicted side-effects occur (the patient is on an incompatible other drug), local circumstances become highly relevant (the drug is unfamiliar to the new doctor), and errors multiply (the bact eriological report was on the wrong patient). The fact is frustrating and inescapable: in health care, as in any complex enterprise, the simple, scientific facts lie fallo w without continual adaptation to local contexts. The consequence for improvement is this: almost all effective improvements require continual, local experimentati on\u2014local growth in knowledge. A ll improvement requires change (although not all changes are improvements), and proper change requires continual learning. A modern workforce, including modern nurses, is fully equipped to act as \"scientists at work.\" When the nurse quoted at the top of this essay said, \"I have two jobs: my job and improving my job,\" she was entering a world of continual trial and learning for both of those roles. We might call the subject, scarily, \"epistemol ogy,\" for it involves, after all, a theory of knowledge, itself: the idea that human beings in complex systems best acquire new knowledge by making changes and studying the effects of those ch anges. But, it is in fact not so arcane at all. This is the form of learning that all healt hy people use in almost a ll the common endeavors of their daily lives\u2014the endeavors that they care about and are in some degree of control over: sports, hobbies, loving relationshi ps, cooking, dieting, and getting a good night's sleep. In every single case, the individual who wishes to ge t better finds ways continually to test new approaches, knowing that, as we all know: \"If you continue to do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten.\" That's not good enough for your tennis game or your gardening, and it's not good enough for the work of health care, either. The jargon of modern improvement is \"PDS A\"\u2014\"Plan-Do-Study-Act.\" This describes a simple, iconic cycle of aim-setting, testing, re flection, and change based on reflection. The modern nurse who intends to \"improve the job\" effectively needs to be a master of the \"PDSA Cycle\" at work. Unlike in gardening or tennis, PDSA at work is not a solo enterprise. Almost all forms of organized quality improvement activity today involve teams; groups, not soloists, carry out the tasks of will-building, measurement, id ea-generation, design and conduct of small-scale tests of change, reflection, and guidance to further action. Thes e compose quality improvement projects. For a modern nurse, participation and lead ership in such project work is the form taken of action based on \"knowledge about how to gain knowledge.\" LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS The four areas of skill and knowledge explor ed above\u2014systems, variation, psychology, and epistemology\u2014compose a strong set of goals fo r modernized nursing ed ucation on behalf of quality improvement. One key element is missi ng, however\u2014the context of leadership and management that allows those skil ls to thrive. Not all nurses will become formal system leaders during their careers, but those who do will more e ffectively nurture system improvement if they understand how to lead improvement. A full exploration of \"leadership for improve ment\" is beyond the scope of this essay, and numerous resources are readily av ailable attempting to describe wh at leaders need to know in order to foster improvement in the systems they lead (Reinertsen et al., 2008). However, a few leadership-dependent elements deserve special mention because they inter act so strongly with the topics addressed above: Setting Aims and Building Will to Improve PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

When leaders, including nursing leaders, establ ish these and other preco nditions in the work setting, they can effectively li berate the energy and wisdom of the front-line staff and middle managers to incorporate continuous improvement in to their daily work, an d they stand a better chance of assuring that these good- hearted, local improvement efforts align with and support the most important strategic goals of the organizatio n and system as a whole. Just as good teachers in a classroom make it possible for students to become active learners, so do good managers make it possible for nurses and all health professionals to become active, curious, effective, and, ideally, joyous improvers. SUMMARY Modern health care demands continual system improvement to better meet social needs for safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timelin ess, efficiency, and equity. Nurses, like all other health professionals, need skills and support to participate effectively in that endeavor, and, often, to lead it. Nursing education is poise d to accelerate progress by embedding healthcare improvement skills in all phases of professional formation. Following are recommendations inte nded to support this vision: 1. Preparation of nurses should in clude mastery of knowledge of systems, interpretation of variation, human psychology in complex systems, and approaches to gaining knowledge in real-world contexts. 2. During professional preparation, nurses-in-t raining should experi ence and reflect upon active involvement in multi-dis ciplinary quality improvement projects and work settings that foster day-to-day change and improvement. 3. During professional preparation, nurses-in-t raining should experi ence, reflect upon, and develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes th at create competence in patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, evidence-bas ed practice, quality improvement, safety, and informatics. 4. Preparation of nurse-teachers and nurs e-executives should include acquiring and practicing skills and methods for the lead ership and management of continual improvement. 5. Organizations that license and certify nurses or accredit nursing education programs should require evidence of nurses' preparation for participation in or leadership of teams that work to continuously improve health care systems and i ndividual and population health.

Proposed changes in nursing education, therefore, must derive from broad societal aims. In the United St ates, we face few challenges as daunting as the one before us, namely to simultaneously improve the health of populations, enhance the patient experience of care (including quality, access, and reli ability), and reduce, or at least control, the per capita cost of care (Berwick et al., 2008). Among the many issues that nursing educators could be called upon to address to meet these aims (Cleary et al., 2010; Forbes and Hickey, 2009), I have chosen three that, if addressed, wo uld have significant im pact on nursing's ability to meet society's needs as outli ned by the above \"triple aim.\" CONCLUSION I. In order to meet the nation's need for nurses, people with strong academic preparation need to be educated in collegiate nursing programs in far greater numbers than they are today. In 1992, Fagin and Lynaugh reviewed the histor y of nursing education and proposed that societal needs for nursing as an occupation (i .e. a vital work serving the public) and as a profession (i.e., a living body of kno wledge and skills) were best met if the proportion of nurses prepared at the baccalaureate (B SN) level exceeded those prepar ed in associate degree (ADN) and diploma programs (Fagin and Lynaugh, 1992). They proposed three me thods (direct transfer linkage, partnership projects, and nurse associat e programs) to end the bifurcation of nursing education between univers ities and community colleges and to assure that graduation patterns did not result in a workforce with the majority of the country's nurses possessing the associate's degree as their highest level of educational pr eparation. Although features of each of Fagin and Lynaugh's (Fagin and Lynaugh, 1992) proposed met hods can be found in programs implemented during the last two decades (for instance, improvements in articulation agreements, partnership projects like the Oregon Consortium for Nursi ng Education, and differentiation of North Dakota licensure levels), our nation c ontinues to produce far more pre-licensure graduates from ADN than BSN programs annually (roughly 60/40 percen t if one includes RN-BSN transition degrees [Aiken et al., 2009]). The literature debating the relative merits of pre-licensure education at ADN and BSN levels is large and beyond the scope of this paper. Some evidence suggests that th e percentage of nurses prepared at the BSN level on hospital units is pos itively correlated with better patient outcomes (Aiken et al., 2003), and during times when no shortage of nurses exists, the baccalaureate graduate is now the preferred new graduate hire. Nonetheless, most states continue to educate greater numbers of ADN than BSN graduates ever y year. In North Carolina, new pre-licensure graduates who completed programs in 2006 included only 29 percent who were graduates of BSN or entry-MSN programs (North Carolina Ins titute of Medicine, 2007). Including the RN- BSN graduates, the total propor tion of BSN or higher degree graduates in 2006 rose to only 36 percent (North Carolina Inst itute of Medicine, 2007). Some states graduate even lower proportions of BSNs among their new nurse graduates each year (California Strategic Planning PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-26 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Committee for Nursing, 2010). Fagin and Lyna ugh's (1992) predictions concerning the diminishing educational levels of the overall composition of the nursing workforce have come true. States invest in the above combination of nursing pre-licensure programs for many reasons, not the least of which are the lower costs in facu lty salaries and student tuition/fees associated with associate degree programs. But another impo rtant factor is the ge ographic distribution of ADN programs, which are more likely to be offe red in rural and other medically underserved communities than are BSN programs in American colleges and universities. The Urban Institute, in their recent study of the nursing workforce, re ported that medical pers onnel, including nurses, tend to work near where they are trained, so the distribution of support for nursing education matters (Bovbjerg et al., 2009). Nursing personnel are needed in virtually every community in America, and ADN programs help ensure that th e nation has a broader ge ographic distribution of nursing personnel than we could a ttain with BSN graduates alone. Nonetheless, we have created a huge problem with our current educational patterns. By educating more ADN than BSN graduates, we have narrowed the pipeline of nurses likely to go on to graduate school. The greater the number of nurses in basic pract ice, the greater the number of nurses needed in advanced roles, such as nurse managers, nur se executives, clinical nurse specialists, and faculty. Health care reform bills may enable greater access to primary care, thus escalating the need for nurse practitioners and midwives. All of these roles require that nurses seek graduate education. Nurses who receive their pre-licensure education in colleges and university programs are overwhelmingly more likely to go on to graduate school than graduates of ADN programs. Using North Carolina licensure data, Bevill and colleagues (2007) analyzed the pursuit of higher educational degrees of RNs from two cohorts. They reported: Only 26% of the 2,418 members of the 1983- 84 cohort at 20 years and 17% of the 4,211 members of the 1993-94 cohort at 10 year s pursued higher degrees, and just 19% and 12% of the respective cohorts di d so in nursing. More than 80% of all nurses in either cohort who attained a mast er's degree in nursing or a doctorate in any field began their nursing career with a bachelor's degree. (Bevill et al., 2007, p. 60) Aiken and colleagues (2009) reported similar results from a national study. They found that of the nearly 1.4 million nurses who obtaine d ADN or BSN degrees between 1970 and 1994, only 6 percent of the nurses with original ADN de grees had gone on to earn graduate (master's or doctoral) degrees, whereas n early 20 percent of the origin al BSN graduates had done so. Though improving overall educational levels with programs that smooth the pathway from ADN to BSN are valuable, the critical need is to assure an adequate pipeline for graduate education by expanding the capacity of current and future BSN programs. One important innovation of the last decad e has been the opening of accelerated BSN (ABSN) programs for students who already have college degrees in anot her field. A previous argument advanced in favor of ADN education as a response to nursing shortages (that is, that you could produce new nurses in two years instead of four), became obsolete as universities opened programs that educated BSN graduates in 12 18 months. Currently, there are 218 ABSN programs in the U.S. and an additional 57 programs that accelerate students in a direct path to a PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

ABSN programs, while addressing the need for new nurses in basic practice, have served as an unusually successful pipeli ne for advanced practice (APN) master's programs. They attr act students who bring rich ba ckgrounds from other fields, academically successful students, and students who are motivated and know what they want from a career (AACN, 2009a). Bentley (2006) an d Brewer and colleagues (2009) found that the accelerated program graduates, when compar ed to traditional nursing bachelors degree graduates, were more likely to be male, non-White, and older, thus addressing the need for increased diversity in nursing. Brewer and collea gues (2009) also reported that the accelerated graduates often moved quickly into management positions. In February, 2009, the American Associati on of Colleges of Nursing reported 2008 09 survey data from 663 nursing schools (87 percent of total number of coll egiate-level programs) showing that almost 50,000 qualified applicants to collegiate nursing programs were turned away (AACN, 2009a). The most frequen tly cited reason was insufficient faculty (63 percent) (AACN, 2009a). To ensure the future ability of nursing educati on to meet societal needs, therefore, we must increase our capacity to educate college/unive rsity-bound students. These graduates will expand the number of nurses in basic practice, but they w ill also address other critical needs, namely our shortages of nursing faculty and primar y care advanced practice nurses. An additional benefit derives from the fact that students exposed to health care leaders at early stages in their career, as collegiate students are, are likely to become the nursing leaders of tomorrow. (Personal note: At the 2009 Sigma Theta Tau International Biennial Convention, among the nursing leaders honored w ith prestigious Founders' Awards, each in accepting their award spoke about the importance of exposure to distinguished nursing l eaders early in their careers). RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Fund a longitudinal national study to track the percentages of new nurse graduates per year from ADN/diploma vs. collegiate pre-licensure programs by state. Include tracking of data regarding faculty shortages, primary care nu rse practitioner and basic nursing shortages by state, with the goal of better understanding the relationships between new nurse educational levels and critical societal needs. 2. Advance media attention to states that exemp lify \"best practices\" in the distribution of new nurse graduates derived from ADN versus BSN programs. 3. Through capitation approaches, direct enrollment expansion funds (from private or public sources, especially federal Title VIII funds) that assure expans ion of pre-licensure programs at colleges/universities until such a time as there is greater equity in production of new nurse graduates.

To meet societal needs for primary care providers, nursing education needs to expand the numbers of annual graduations from programs that prepare nurse practitioners. Although health care reform legislation remains unfinished, the United States may extend health insurance to more than 30 million Americans with a promise that they (and all currently insured citizens) will have access to high quality and affordable care. Shortages of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and phys ician assistants are severe under current conditions and will escalate dramatically (as Massachusetts is currently experiencing) if Congress passes the bills under consideration (New England Healthca re Institute, 2009). Health care costs will have to be reduced or contained, or the nation will face an economic burden that is unsustainable. Under any likely scenario, the need for nurse practitioners (NPs) will increase dramatically. In the most recent academic year, approximately 7,500 8,000 students graduated from NP programs (AANP, 2009b). Of the 125,000 NPs practicing today, most qualify as primary care providers (49% family, 18% adult, 3% gerontological and 9% pediatric specialties) (AANP, 2009b). Currently, the vast majority of student s complete educational requirements for certification exams in their NP specialty at the end of master's (MSN) programs. Recently, Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs have been introduced, adding competencies related to organizational systems leadership for quality improvement, information systems and patient care technology, healthcare policy, inter-professional collaboration and clinical prevention for improving patient and population health (AACN, 2006). These competencies, currently provided in post-master's DNP programs almost exclus ively, build on specia lty practice education received in MSN programs and, in most cases , practice experience from basic practice, administrative, or faculty roles. It is beyond the scope of this pape r to describe fully the rationale for the practice doctorate (AACN, 2004), but major reasons include the demand for formal practice-centered education and scholarship opportunitie s beyond those provided by the master's degree and equity issues with ot her health professionals who ha ve converted their professional master's programs to professional doctorates in programs equivalent in length to most nursing master's programs (e.g., physical therapy, pharmacy, etc.). Most schools of nursing with graduate pr ograms (approximately 475) feel tremendous pressure (whether or not they have the resour ces to mount quality DNP programs) to convert their master's or post-master's DNP programs to DNP programs that prepare NPs for entry into practice because of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing position statements on the DNP, as represented below: AACN members have endorsed the transi tion from specialty nursing practice education at the master's level to the DNP by the target goal of 2015. AACN recognizes the importance of maintaini ng strong interest in roles (e.g., nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, nur se midwife, and nurse anesthetist) to meet existing health care needs. In response to practice demands and an increasingly complex health care system , programs designed to prepare nurses for advanced practice nursing will begin the transition to the practice doctorate for nurses who initially want to obtain the DNP , as well as for nurses with master's degrees who want to return to obtain the practice doctorate. AACN will assist schools in their transitioning to the DNP and in their effo rts to partne r with other institutions to provide necessary gradua te level course work. Specialty focused PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-29 master's level programs will be phased out as transition to DNP programs occurs. Master's programs will continue to be offered and will prepare nurses for advanced generalist prac tice. (AACN, 2006, p. 12) No licensure or certification requirements mand ate this change to date. Even the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the au tonomous accrediting agency associated with AACN which will accredit DNP programs, has to da te said nothing about requiring a transition to entry-to-practice DNP programs The entry level DNP has been opposed by a mi nority within the profession since its conception (Dracup et al., 2005; Melies a nd Dracup, 2005). Recently, some AACN member deans and the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties submitted letters to the AACN Board requesting that they remove the thr eat of the 2015 date for requiring the transition to entry DNP programs (persona l communications, November 2009). With a dearth of qualified faculty, many programs of uneven quality are being mounted. But the bigger issue is that faculty members have begun to realize what a tremendous investment of faculty and student time is required to complete the DNP. Doctoral requirements for independe nt projects/dissertations are important for building the capacity for DNPs to contribute to quality improvement and translational science, but they take time and commitment to scholarly approaches to inquiry. Schools are realizing that they cannot educate the same numbers of DNPs per year at the entry level as they are currently gr aduating at the MSN level. Inevitably, a transition to DNP programs for entry into NP practice would reduce the production of NPs at exactly the time when the country may experience a dramatic increase in need. We have not yet seen a decrease in the number of MSN graduates per year, because only a small number of schools have phased out MSN specialist programs to date. To increase, or even maintain , the current annual graduation numbers of primary care NPs would require funds (from students and schools) to pay for at least one additional year of study for each graduate, sufficient numbers of qualified faculty members to teach the additional year's program content and supervise individual scholarship projects, and more preceptors for the additional hours of supervised clinical time. These are significant costs during a pe riod of economic downturn that has reduced budgets for almo st all schools of nursing. The irony is that the literature is replete w ith results of studies showing that the NP workforce, as currently trained, provides patient care of high quality. Pohl and colleagues (Pohl et al., in press) reviewed the literature in a recent background pa per for the January 2010 Josiah Macy Conference, \"Who Will Deliver Primary Ca re and How Will They Be Trained?\" Their summary stated: NPs have practiced in a variety of models, and the outcomes of their practices have been studied for more than 40 years. Repeatedly, when quality of care has been assessed in studies that are highly rated on strength of evidence, NP providers have been found to provide e quivalent, and in some cases, superior care. Because of the supervision requirements and payment models that have funded physicians as heads of practices, evidence about relative costs of care using various primary care provider mix teams has been difficult to obtain. Such studies are needed prior to implemen tation of any public policy that would reimburse primary care at significantly hi gher costs.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-30 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Rather than mandating the increased costs to students, faculty and schools of nursing that would be required to convert to entry DNP programs now, all pressure to start DNP entry programs should be removed, allowing the external environment (societal needs, school budgets, student and employer demand) to settle the issu e over time. At a minimum, nursing education should commit to a transition period that will not diminish production capacity at a time of critical societal need. Many or ganizational leaders (maybe even AACN, and definitely CCNE) would welcome an external voi ce that emphasized that the need s of patients and society should take precedence over professional aspirations at this time. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Fund a project that would include RWJF/IOM Committee members and representatives of relevant professional organiza tions involved in APN certific ation, accreditation, education and practice. Provide facilita tive leadership (lik e Ellen Kurtzman did for the RWJF-funded project to achieve consensus on establishing a Nursing Quality and Safety Alliance) for reaching consensus that DNP programs should be launched as post-master's programs for the foreseeable future so that nursing maintains or increases the numbers of NP graduates each year. 2. As a secondary goal in the process above, ensu re that nursing master's programs remain targeted at specialist preparation, not generalist prepara tion as currently proposed by AACN. 3. Fund the development of briefs aimed at st ate governors and attorney generals that emphasize the importance (to the cos t/quality of health care in thei r states) of removing legal, regulatory, or reimbursement policy barriers to th e ability of nurse practitioners to serve as primary care providers or leaders of patient centered medical homes or other methods of patient care delivery. CONCLUSION III. New models of educatio n are needed to ensure that the competencies required to do the work and improve the work of nursing and healthcare are embedded in nursing education programs. Nursing education programs began to transi tion out of hospital- based, apprenticeship programs into academic settings (colleges/univers ities and community colleges) over fifty years ago. Aligning nursing education with the dom inant American appro ach to professional preparation in other fields fo stered numerous gains for the advancement of knowledge, the development of faculty and adva nced practice roles, and the qu ality of nursing education and practice. Throughout the decades, however, nur sing leaders have been challenged by the separation of academic and practice worlds a nd the difficulties associated with building sufficiently strong links between practice and academe to ensure that nursing students develop the competencies that make them able to work e ffectively in health care settings (Cronenwett and Redman, 2003; Fagin, 1986). Recent studies of newl y licensed registered nur ses illustrate that the gap remains (Kovner et al., 2010; Pellico et al., 2009). For example, the new nurses in the study by Pellico and colleagues called for more e ducational experiences i nvolving 8-hour clinical days, more realistic patient/nurse ratios, and better preparation for comm unication activities such as change-of-shift reports, delegating, roundi ng with physicians, and charting (Pellico et al., 2009).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-31 Added to this perennial problem, the first decade of the 21st century was marked by a series of Institute of Medicine reports outlining the problems with healthcare quality and safety. In response, the pace of change in practice settings escalate d, as new quality improvement processes and measures were adopted, and data about quality and safety became transparent to the public. By and large, full-time faculty memb ers in schools of nursing were uninformed about these changes as they developed. Not surprisi ngly, Kovner and colleague s found that 39 percent of new nurses in a 2008 survey thought they were \"poorly\" or \"very poorly\" prepared or \"had never heard of\" quality improvement, although BSN graduates reported significantly higher levels of preparation in evidence-based practice and assessing gaps in teamwork and collaboration (Kovner et al., 2010). Since 2005, the Robert Wood J ohnson Foundation has funded the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) project (Cronenwett et al., 2007, 2009a,b) to address the challenge of educating nurses who will be prepared to c ontinuously improve the health care systems in which they work. Faculty have available two websites with resources for developing teaching strategies aimed at the knowledge, skills, and a ttitudes that must be developed to achieve competence in patient-centered care, teamwo rk and collaboration, ev idence-based practice, quality improvement, safety, and informatic s (Cronenwett et al., 2007)\u2014namely the QSEN website at www.qsen.org and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School at http://www.ihi.org/IHI/Programs/IHIOpenSchool/. A series of faculty development conferences and national forums on this topic are being launched by QSEN (through UNC and AACN) to provide further support for embedding these topics in nursing programs. The rapidity with which nursing faculty can become \"out of t ouch\" with the requirements of current practice was made evident during this decade (Sherwood and Drenkard, 2007), and there is much yet to learn about how to overcome th e negative consequences of the gaps between nursing education and practice. The Carnegie Commission funded a study of professional formation across multiple disciplines, and a recent book by Benner and colleagues (Benner et al., 2009) described a call for radical transformation of nursing educati on. To the point being raised here, the multi-year study concluded that there needs to be better integration of coursework with clinical experiences, so that coursework and cl assroom learning are tied to what actually happens in patient care rather than being studied in the abstract. Faculty, they argue, must help students make the connection between acquiring and using knowledge, so that students develop clinical reasoning skills for the diverse, complex practice that is nursing (Benner et al., 2009). Faculties cannot perform these functions unless they possess clinical expertise or wo rk closely with nurses in practice at each step from curriculum design to development of simulation, classroom and clinical teaching strategies and assessment of student performance. Likewise, there are great challenges associated with teaching system co mpetencies (as opposed to the competencies related to the care of individual patients), such as inter-professional teamwork and collaboration, safety sciences or quality improvement, when faculty are not actually doing the work of improving health care systems themselves. Nursing faculties and their practi ce partners have tried a variety of strategies to continuously improve the preparation of students for prac tice. Some examples (without citing a huge literature) are: capstone courses with staff nurse preceptors, dedicated education units, faculty practices, inter-professio nal learning experiences, cross-appoin ting nursing staff on faculties and faculty members on patient care units, requiring t eachers of undergraduate students to practice at least a day a week, hiring clinical experts to help faculty develop cases for simulated clinical teaching, and keeping student clinical experiences in one institution for greater depth in exposure PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

More innovation is needed, along with studies that will help identify \"best practices\" for dissemination. The other major barrier to ach ieving effective practice compet encies is the lack of a structured and financially supported residency training program dur ing the first year of initial licensure as a nurse. Because sc hools of nursing prepare pre-licensure graduates as generalists, newly licensed nurses, by defin ition are not prepared with th e knowledge and skill base for practice with specific patient populations. Wherev er a new nurse begins practice, a period of mentored supervision and support should be prov ided. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing is working to promote criteria for the tran sition to practice period that would need to be met before the new nurse was re-licensed at the e nd of the first year of practice (Benner et al., 2009). AACN and the University Healthsystem Consortium offer support, and accreditation through CCNE, for nurse residency programs aimed at BSN graduates (NCSBN, 2009). Nonetheless, no consistent requirement for nurse residencies reinforces the importance of this phase of education for the practice of nursing. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Promote innovation and evaluation of novel appr oaches to improving preparation for the practice of nursing through designated Title VI II (HRSA, USPHS) funding mechanisms. 2. Urge accrediting bodies (CCNE and NLNAC) to require evidence that faculty have the practice expertise or effective clinical partne rships to prepare students for the work of nursing practice and improving the wo rk of nursing and health care. 3. Promote funding mechanisms for the developm ent and testing of ne w methods of inter- professional education through simulation, case studies, and clinical practice. 4. Promote innovation and evaluation of models that engage nursing faculty in the work of improving health care. 5. Support learning collaboratives of state boards of nursing who are wil ling to work out the issues related to implementing regulatory requirements for transition to practice residencies as a prerequisite for initial re-licensure. 6. Require that any hospitals receiving GME m onies for \"nursing education\" devote those resources to supporting transition to practice residency programs. FINAL THOUGHTS The exercise of choosing only three areas of focus for this paper makes me realize the challenge that RWJF/IOM Committee members face as you decide what actions to take to ensure that nursing meets the needs of the public for th e foreseeable future. I hope the ideas from these collective papers on the Future of Nursing Education assist you in your di fficult but important task. REFERENCES AACN (American Association of Colleges of Nursing). 2004.

University of California, San Francisco School of Nursing The nature of nursing has changed drastically over the past few decades. The complexity of care in many diverse settings, the role of advanced practice nurses as independent providers, and the growing recognition of the important role of scientific evidence upon which to base nursing practice have changed the way nurses are view ed by the public and the way they should be educated. The complex demands of practice co mbined with a shortage of experienced practitioners in many of the h ealth care professionals have cr eated opportunity and, in some areas, a state of potential crisis. As health care reform looms a nd the population continues to age, nursing education must embrace these challenges, expanding and improving on what it offers currently to better prepare the nurse of the future. Many issues face the nursing profession today; all seem to be filled with odd contrasts. Nursing is a profession characterized by a highly complex practice with nurses often making life and death decisions. Yet the formal education required to prepare clinicians for this challenging practice is less than any of the other health pr ofessions (i.e., nurses can currently practice with a two-year asso ciate degree and 80 percent who enter the profession with this degree c hoose not to get further formal education in the form of another degree) (Aiken et al., 2009). The projections for nursing shortages in the ne ar future are alarming, but the urgency of those shortages are blunted by the current economic crisis th at has kept many nurses in the workforce and has reduced vacancy rates. The seeming resolution of the shortage has diverted the attention of the media and govern ment to other problems and has reduced the chances that nursing education wi ll receive the resources it need s to expand enrollments. A current and projected faculty shortage is a serious impediment to solving the preparation of new nurses, but nursing f aculty remain one of the most poorly compensated categories of nurses. Nursing is a profession that increasingly mu st be based on science and strong empirical data and yet the number of scientists with in it to generate new knowledge remains disappointingly small. Nursing is a profession charged to care for a highly diverse populati on of patients and yet it remains highly non-diverse in gender, race and ethnicity. The lack of diversity among nurses, with the consequent discordance between clinician and client, serves to reduce the effectiveness of the care nurses provide. Finally, it is a profession that must have strong interprofession al relationships with other members of the health care team to be effective and yet nurse s (and other health professionals) are educated tradit ionally in silos with little exposure to students in other health professions and no formal opportunities to develop team skills. This list is undoubtedly incomplete. Even taken alone, it underscores th e need for a critical reappraisal of how we educat e the next generation of nurse s and what recommendations we make to federal and state governments, as well as to the organizations re sponsible for accrediting PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Three issues will be highlighted in this paper: the shortage of nurse scientists, the lack of educational preparation for pr eparing nurses to provide patie nt-centered care within an interprofessional team of health care providers, and the lack of ef fective formal teaching in pre- licensure programs in the areas of nursing science, natural and social sciences, humanities and leadership. Two of the three are particularly germane to university-based schools of nursing who are facing severe faculty shorta ges and to practicing clinicians who make decisions each day based on tradition rather than empi rical evidence. The third area was highlighted in the recent Carnegie Foundation Report on nursing educatio n (Benner et al., 2010) and has important ramifications for the entire nursing profession and for the future health of our nation. THE SHORTAGE OF NURSE SCIENTISTS According to the most recent survey of the RN population conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administ ration (HRSA) in 2004, the number of RNs in the United States is 2.9 million (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). The number of nurses prepared at the masters or doctoral level rose to 376,901, which was an increase of 37 percent from 2000 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Although 13 percent of nurses hold a graduate degree, only 1 percent have a PhD and are prepared to conduct independent research in their field. In fact, onl y 555 students graduated w ith a PhD in nursing in 2009, a number that has been relatively unchanged for the past decade (AACN, 2009). Thus, the numbers of nurse scientists working to create the empirical data upon which nursing practice is based is trivial compared to the need. Why do so few nurses pursue doctoral study? The problem is not access. The number of PhD programs has doubled over the past two decad es; however, the number of nursing graduates prepared at the PhD level has remained essent ially unchanged (AACN, 20 09). Three reasons for the continuing shortage of nurse scientists can be posited. First, educatio nal preparation at the associate degree or hospital diploma level serves as an impediment to easy access to graduate study. In 2004, 34 percent of registered nurses (n = 981,238) reported the associate degree as their highest level of nursing or nursing-related education, while 18 percent (n = 510,209) held a hospital diploma (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Over 50 percent of nurses today would face approximately 8 to 9 years of formal university-based education in order to receive a PhD compared to the 4 to 5 years re quired to attain a PhD in other disciplines that require a baccalaureate degree. Entry into the nu rsing profession at the associate degree level serves as a disincentive for the majority of nurse graduates to continue further study to the PhD level (Cleary et al., 2009). Even more dishearten ing is that the fact that the number of nurses whose highest educational degree in nursing is the associate degree has increased by 232 percent since 1980 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Moreover, the vast majority of these nurses (i.e., those who obtain an associ ate degree to practice nu rsing) do not pursue a bachelor's degree anytime in their career. In 200 4, only 21 percent of RNs initially educated in associate degree programs had received a baccalaureate degree, while only 6 percent of this population had gone on to obtain a MS or PhD degr ee (Aiken et al ., 2009). Thus, nurses prepared at the associate degree level are highly unlikely to undertake doctoral study during their careers. Second, nurses have more interruptions in thei r careers and often begin doctoral study at a later age than individuals in other discipline s. The nursing profession traditionally has viewed PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-37 clinical experience as a prerequisite to graduate education and new gradua tes were encouraged to practice clinically by faculty and peers between degrees rather than co ntinuing straight on to obtain a PhD. This career path has resulted in th e norm of nurses returni ng for a master's degree in their mid-thirties to become an advanced practice nurse (e.g., nurse pr actitioner or clinical nurse specialist) or administrator, then returning to the work force for another decade, and finally returning to graduate school to obtain a PhD in th eir late thirties or even older. Nurse scientists complete their doctoral degrees, on average, at the age of 46, which limits the number of years they have to build a scientific program and contribute to the sc ientific base of nursing practice (Dracup et al., 2009). To help reverse this tr end, many nursing schools have developed programs that admit students into graduate programs direct ly from undergraduate or master's programs and faculty are slowing changing their commi tment to this model of advisement. Third, faculty salaries provide an important disi ncentive to return to sc hool to obtain a PhD. Although academics in all disciplines are rarely compensated at the same level as their peers in industry, the disparity for nurses is one of the largest. Nurses working as clinicians make, on average, 30 percent more than assistant prof essors, who typically make from $50,000 to $70,000 at the assistant professor level (Dracup et al., 2009). Advanced practice nurses make, on average, 100 to 150 percent more than assistant professo rs (Cleary et al., 2009). In a recent survey conducted by the American Association of College s of Nursing (AACN) to describe the nursing faculty shortage, respondents cite d inadequate salary as the nu mber one cause of the faculty shortage (Fang and Tracy, 2009). Besides the three reasons cited above to explain the low number of PhD-prepared nurses, the development of a professional doct orate (i.e., the Doctor of Nursing Practice of DNP) is also a trend worth noting. The degree was introduced in 2004 by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) with a recommendation by its members to adopt the DNP degree for all advanced practice nurses by 2015. The degree is de signed as the terminal degree for nursing practice and may be combined with a PhD for nurses interested in conducting translational science. The reasons given by the organization at the time of adoption were the following: the rapid expansion of knowledge underlying nursing pract ice; increased complexity of patient care; national concerns about the quality of care and patient safety ; shortages of nursing personnel which demands a higher level of preparation for leaders who can design and assess care; shortages of doctorally-p repared nursing faculty; and increasing educational expectations for the preparation of other members of the healthcare team. The degree has been a source of contention within the profession and has evoked concerns by various physician and nursing organizations (Dracup et al., 2005; AMA, 2010). However, DNP programs have mushroomed across the states with 92 currently awarding degrees and anothe r 102 in the planning process (AACN, 2009). Whether or not DNP programs will attract applicants that would not have been interested in a PhD is unknown and what affect it will have on future PhD applications is also unknown. However, it is important to note that the program is focused on pr eparing its graduates \"to fully implement the science developed by nurse res earchers prepared in PhD, DNSc, and other research-focused nursing doctorate s\" (AACN, 2010) Its graduates are not expected to contribute scientific discoveries or to lead interdisciplinar y teams of scientists. Thus, the DNP will not meet the need for more nurse scientists an d it may contribute to their shortage. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-38 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Recommendations Related to Shortage of Nurse Scientists Address the pipeline. A major impediment to attrac ting the large number of nurses scientists needed in the future is the high percentage of nurses prepared in community colleges. Federal and state funding needs to be allocated to creati ng innovative solutions to assisting graduates of community colleges to get BS degrees such as allowing community colleges to award BS degrees (a controversial but attractive option) or developing programs like the Oregon model wher e all nursing students ar e enrolled in the university and have the option of completing a fourth year to attain their BS degree (Tanner et al., 2008). It would be helpful if the Committee clarified the role of the DNP for the broader community and considered the impact of DNP programs on the shortage of PhD graduates. It is currently not clear whether universities wi ll appoint DNP graduates to tenure-track positions, but clarification of this point will be important for the profession as it continues to clarify the differences between the two doctoral degrees. Do nurse scientists conducting tran slational research need both a DNP and a PhD? If the answer is yes, the pipeline has just become longer. Augment Federal and State Funding for PhD students and their research. One way to compensate for low faculty salaries is for nursing students to be relieved of their educational debt. The Nurse Faculty Loan Progr am under Title VIII creates a student loan fund within individual schools of nursing that students can access. Students who teach at a school of nursing following graduation can cel up to 85 percent of their educational loans plus interest. In 2007 and 2008, 729 stude nts were funded nationally each year, a 43 percent decrease from the preceding years. 4 With almost 4,000 students in PhD programs in nursing during those same years, as well as an unknown number studying in other disciplines, this program needs to be st rongly augmented and widely publicized. A second program under Title VIII provides educational grants to schools (i.e., Advanced Education Nursing Grants) that can be used to support students in graduate programs. Again, the amount available for indi vidual schools is paltry compared to the need. For example, the University of Califor nia San Francisco School of Nursing receives an average of $200,000 of AEN funds annually to support 720 graduate students. Student debt is inevitable and the dream of a faculty position fades quickly. Funding for pre- and post-PhD research a nd study is availabl e through the National Institute of Nursing Research, but agai n this funding has been severely limited. Historically the Institute was funded at one of the lowest ra tes among all the institutes at the National Institutes of Health since its inception, which limits its ability to support doctoral students. Two other new sources of funding are pending and require strong support by the Committee on the Future of Nursing. Nursing organizations have long urged Congress to redirect Medicare funding (GME funds) that currently is rest ricted to hospital diploma nursing education towards gradua te education (Aiken et al ., 2009). This change would give hospitals incentive reimbursement fo r students and allow hiring of additional faculty. Also, capitation grants (similar to the Nurse Training Acts of 1971 and 1975) would allow schools to recruit additional doctoral students as well as improve facilities 4 Source: Division of Nursing, Health Re sources and Services Administration 2006 2008 as summ arized in AACN's Congressional Requests: A Focus on Promoting Acce ss to Quality Health Care.

The bleak outlook for nursing faculty shortages will not change without massive changes in federal support for nursing education. A LACK OF INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLORATION IN EDUCATION In both acute and chronic health care se ttings, there is mounting evidence that interprofessional practice models are effectiv e in improving patient outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction, and health care costs (IOM, 2004; Needleman and Hassmiller, 2009). However, these models of interprofessional prac tice are not based on the educational experiences of health care professionals, w ho are most often taught in univer sity departments or schools that function as educational silos that encourage li ttle or no contact with students from other professions. Students from schools of medicine, nursing and pharmacy, for example, rarely share courses, participate in discussion groups, or e xperience faculty (and therefore role models) from health care professions other than their own dur ing their formal education. The tradition of educational isolation in the health care disciplin es encourages the maintenance of historical stereotypes and discourages the communication skill s and understandings that are essential for effective teams. Unfortunately, assembling multiple professionals together in a single clinical setting after graduation does not guarantee interprofessional collabo ration will occur, despite the fact that it is increasingly recognized as fundament al to the quality and safety of patient care. Role confusion can abound. For example, physicians and nurse pr actitioners share many of the same role functions despite a very different philosophical orientation, which can be source of conflict and differing priorities. Clinical nurses specialists and social workers both focus on the family system, which may lead to confusion of respons ibilities and functions. Professional organizations may fuel professional rivalries by conducting vari ous turf protection exercises, particularly related to reimbursement. Hospitals, where much of health care is delivered, have rigid organizational structures and professional hierarchies that often se rve to create a \"we\" vs. \"they\" structure within the different disciplines represen ted on a team that is the antithesis of a highly functioning team. Students need to gain the skills of communication and collaboration across health care disciplines early in their careers if they are to function effectively in professional teams. The benefits of creating an interprofessional educational ex perience are great. Students are able to exchange different theo retical perspectives, address hist orical stereotypes, and develop communication and leadership skills that are cri tical to highly functioning teams in the clinical setting (Spear and Schmidhofer, 2005). An import ant benefit from the st andpoint of university administrators is the potential for sharing resour ces, including expert f aculty, space and physical equipment. For example, an increasing number of universities are beginning to build simulation centers designed for interprofessional student t eams to participate in exercises designed to increase teamwork. Sharing a single simulati on center provides the various professional programs with opportunities for rea listic interprofessional learning th at are difficult to arrange in real clinical practice. The simulation exercises bu ild confidence before contact with real patients and provide a safe environment where mistakes become learning opportunities. Working together on patient scenarios a nd real-life case studies can also improve teamwork and promote better understanding between professions. So if collaboration and effective communication among disciplines is so valuable, why is it so little in evidence in nursing education? Some of the reasons are historical. Student nurses in PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-40 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH hospital diploma programs were often taught by medical facult y. When nursing education moved out of the hospital setting, some nurse educators were eager to shed the tradition of medical faculty as well. Medical schools, in turn, migrat ed to universities decades before schools of nursing. This difference in timing meant that many schools of medicine were established without any school of nursing, and they still do not ha ve a nursing program in the same university. Nursing programs are now housed in community colleges or in universities that do not have schools of medicine or other health disciplines. Curriculum for different health professions were developed without collaboration fr om other disciplines. The most egregious symptom of the lack of collaboration in education is the large number of medical programs that are on different academic calendars than the othe r health care disciplines in their same university, making it difficult for students to have a platform for collaboration. Ultimately it is the responsibility of educators in the various disciplines to create a learning environment in which students, preceptors, and patients may teach and learn from one another. They can do this through a variety of strategies: A single orientation day for the health prof essions that introdu ces the philosophy of interprofessional education Joint faculty appointments Shared courses across schools that incl udes the completion of assignments by interdisciplinary teams Interdisciplinary student-managed clinics Social networking sites that include students from all health professions, and Interprofessional social events sponsored by the university Educated in an interdisciplinary model, indivi duals entering the workforce will do so with the mindset that collaboration among all healthcare practitioners is how pa tient care should be approached. The mindful inclusion of interpro fessional educational experiences potentially will lead to more effective communication across disciplines and ultimately patient care that is safe, cost-effective, and of high quality. Recommendation Related to Interprofessional Collaboration in Education Develop and implement strategies to rew ard interprofessional collaboration in nursing education. The development of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards by NIH is a model of how to develop a cultu re of interdisciplinary teams where none existed. Creating an award structure that de manded interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists forged many researcher alli ances on university campuses. Similarly, the education of health professionals must be viewed through a different lens than is currently used. Accrediting bodies and unive rsity review committees should include interprofessional collaboration as part of the criteria for a quality nursing program, as well as the programs of other health prof essions such as medicine and pharmacy. Expectations for interprofessional collabora tion must be set in university program reviews, accreditation criteria, and individual faculty promoti on criteria if a change in culture is to be achieved.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-41 PRELICENSURE NURSING EDUCATION This third area is the easiest and the hardest to pr esent. It is the easiest because it has recently been the topic of an exhaustive study by the Carn egie Foundation. It is the hardest because the findings of their study are complex and require d a full-length book to present (Benner et al., 2010). After numerous site visits and c ountless interviews, the authors made 26 recommendations that deserve se rious consideration by the Committ ee. It seems that to ignore the major findings of the first systematic study of nursing education in decades would be folly. Briefly, the research team of Benner and co lleagues focused on a variety of basic nursing programs by which students are prepared to take the NCLEX-RN examination and become registered nurses as well as one RN-to-BS N program. They visited 2 community college programs (billed as 2 years in length but often 4 y ears because of the required pre-requisites and waiting list times), 3 generic b accalaureate programs, 2 fast-track second baccalaureate degree program of 14 to 18 months designed for student s with a bachelor's degree in another field, a single diploma program offered through a frees tanding school of nursing affiliated with and sponsored by a hospital (2 to 3 years in length), and a single master's entry level program that provided a prelicensure program fo r students with a bachelor's de gree in any subject followed by a 2-year master's program. The researchers iden tified three areas of apprenticeship in basic nursing programs: acquiring and using knowledge a nd science, developing skilled clinical reasoning, and ethical comportment and formation. Th ey found the latter two areas adequately or more than adequately addresse d in the educational programs th ey reviewed. They found the former sadly deficient across all programs where students were often subjected to thousands of power point slides as a substitute for knowledge tran sfer. Given the complexity of patient care in today's demanding environment and the increas ing independence of nurses who must judge among various treatment alternatives and select the best course of action, the lack of nurses' preparation for their role in terms of scientific principles and clinical knowledge is somewhat astounding and clearly disturbing. The review team found the variet y of pre-requisites across progr ams troubling, particularly in light of the large number of applicants coming with a degree from another bachelor's degree program. Some nursing programs had stringent scie nce prerequisites while others had almost none. They were concerned that, in particular, RN to BSN program s often did not have the depth of science courses required for grounding appropriate clinical knowledge. Ultimately the sciences required to prepare students for nursi ng education must be rigorous and similar across programs. Finally the pedagogies of the classroom were not ed to be sadly deficient compared to the effective pedagogies of teaching in the clinical setting. Classroom instruct ors need to adopt the teaching methods that are so effective in the clin ical world of patient care, while also increasing the quality and level of nursing science, natural and social sciences, and humanities. Recommendations Related to Prelicensure Education Standardize Prerequisites . The lack of standardization across different programs means that students in the same program bring varyi ng degrees of preparation to their learning of the clinical science require d for care of patients. The pr ofession must create a standard list of relevant prerequisites in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences that all programs would be expected to adopt.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-42 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Require the BSN for entry into practice. This is perhaps the most contentious of recommendations but also the one that has alluded the profession for the past five decades. The various entry paths into the pr ofession have been confusing to the public and to other health professionals. It will be important to provide incentives for nurses with AD degrees to return for a BSN or, when possible, a MS degree. Articulated programs will be crucial as we move towards an all BSN entry into the nursing profession. Consider more effective teaching strategies related to the transfer of clinical science in the preparation of new nurse graduates than currently used. A great deal of research has been conducted over the past two decades on problem-based learning and other teaching strategies effective in engaging st udents in learning. According to Benner and colleagues (Benner et al., 2010), many of thes e have not been adopted by faculty teaching the formal component clinical science. Th ey recommend that pedagogies be developed and used to keep students focused on the patient's experience. Medical pathology and disease mechanisms are best taught in di rect association with patients' illness experiences, psychosocial responses, and needs for self-care. Simulation exercises, case studies, and group experiences can all be used to enhance learning. Since many of these learning strategies have been adopted by our colleagues in the other health sciences, models are available. National repositories of case studies would be of great support in this transition from the \"death-by-PowerPoint\" lecture format to a more student-engaged and patient-focused format.

Sadly, Benner, Sutphen, Leonard and Day (2010) have re ported that too often nurse educators replicate their ow n educational experience for stude nts, failing to recognize the many reasons why such preparation is inadequate to meet the needs of today's nurse. In fact, nursing education is not the business of preparing nurses for today , but for tomorrow . The invitation to identify three critically impor tant areas of reform in nursing education has proven to be a more difficult assignment than wa s initially obvious to me. A lifelong educator, I feel as though I have been given three wishes. If I could \"rub the lamp\" and change three things, what would they be? Why would I select thes e reforms and how would I undertake the needed changes? The invitation, not a simple intellectua l exercise, begs the question of me\u2014\"What am I, in my capacity as a leader in nursing educat ion, doing to address the fu ture?\" And the personal vulnerability lies in confronting the possibility th at if I identify three reforms that have little relationship to my daily work, I may be part of the problem. To contextualize my comments, I offer a few observations about my career and point of view. I have worked as a nurse educator in baccalaureate and higher degree programs since 1974. My appointments have taken me to public a nd private institutions, secular and religious, and most often to large academic health cente rs. Over the last 25 years, my classroom and mentoring activities have focused on the prepar ation of advanced prac tice nurses for primary care and the preparation of nurse scientists; I have remained in contact with entering, second degree students in nursing by teaching a course on leadership. Since 1993, I have held major administrative responsibilities, first as a department chair, later as a dean, and currently as a dean and vice chancellor in a large acad emic health center within a unive rsity distinctive for culture of interdisciplinarity.

I have often re called her insisten ce that I make good use of my time while conducting patient rounds, doing at least three or four things at once: check on the condition of the patient, make sure the room is clean and the facilities are in good working order (e.g., night lights have working bulbs), that no unnecessary equipment has been left in the patient's room and that the members of the care delivery team have comp leted their assignments as scheduled. Although I was a successful pupil, at 21 years of age I found her to be a bit overbearing and exceptionally humorless. Year s later, I looked back on my educational experience with her and realized two things: 1) Being organized, observant and able to multi-task were all valuable assets; and 2) Her name was \"Miss Fortune.\" The skills gained under the dire ction of Miss Fortune have con tinued to be valuable to me, despite the changes in the patter ns of care delivery and the movement away from team leading. She introduced me to basic management and I will always be grateful. Th e anecdote also serves as a reminder that while some lessons are enduring, and the basic skill sets timeless, much of the content of nursing education has changed. The body of knowledge required for safe practice has grown geometrically, as have the tools for accessing information, and the skills required for the safe delivery of care. Educational reforms must address how we improve access to needed and relevant information for students within nursing, how we develop the nurse's ability to access and use information following program completion and how the educationa l pathway is ordered to assist in build a career pathway in clinical nursing. I believe the three reforms I have selected will address these broad concerns. REFORM 1. Place greater emphasis on the development of committed partnerships that will enrich nursing education programs, specifically partnerships with nursing service, medi cal education, and a select group of disciplines that are especially relevant to health and health care delivery (engineering, business, policy, law and the environment). The fractured relationship between nursing edu cation and nursing servi ce must be repaired. Although somewhat exaggerated, many would generalize that academic nurses view nurses in service delivery as anti-intel lectual and, conversely, the service delivery community views academic nursing as irrelevant and out of touc h. The chasm works against the progress of both communities, communities that are actually one, se parated by two distinct corporate missions. A variety of structures designe d to bring nursing education and service into closer alignment were implemented at the University of Florida (Dorothy M. Smith), Rush (Luther R. Christman), Rochester (Loretta C. Ford) and Case Western Reserve (Joyce Fitzpatric k) in the 1970's. In several of these models, one leader was appoi nted to oversee both education and service delivery. Dually appointed faculty members were expected to teach and deliver care or provide leadership in the care delivery setting. Faculty co mplained that their days were unending and the combined work of delivering clinical care a nd teaching was impossible. By the 1990's these models unraveled and the leadersh ip functions were again assigned to separate leaders, one for education and one for service. By necessity and given a world of competing demands, the delivery of care requires an immediate focus on th e life and death needs of patients, the \"tyranny of the urgent,\" and this overrides the needs of st udents or scholarly projects, which are less time- PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

But the separation of education and service has resulted in a practice-education gap that is growing. Benner and co lleagues suggest that the probl em is largely due to nursing education's inability to keep up with changes in the service sector (Benner et al., 2010). The problem is not new. In 1983, th e Institute of Medicine report, Nursing and Nursing Education: Public Poli cies and Private Actions, included the following recommendation: Closer collaboration between nurse edu cators and nurses who provide patient services is essential to give students an appropriate balance of academic and clinical preparation (IOM, 1983). That 27 year old report urged the federal gover nment to offer grants that would promote collaboration. The American Association of Colleges of Nu rsing has advocated for the development of strategic partnerships between education and se rvice and their web site includes profiles of selected arrangements that appear to be su ccessful. The American Organization of Nurse Executives web site lists materials for educa tion and service partners to evaluate their collaborations. Calls for education- service partnerships continue in the nursing literature (Gilliss and Fuchs, 2007). Recommendation 1: Where possible, particularly at Academic Health Centers, promote governance structures th at combine the strategic, rather than the operational oversight for nursing. Recommendation 2: Require the demonstration of an education-service partnership in accreditation criteria fo r education and service settings, to include such activities as shared govern ance, shared teaching, shared clinical problem solving, and participation in continuing education. Today's faculty shortage is though t to relate, in part to salary disparities between education and service. The median annual salary for a be ginning registered nurse (who may not have a college degree) was $62,089 in April 2009 (Salar y Wizard, 2010); the me dian salary for a doctorally prepared assistant professor wa s $89,973 in 2009 (Fang et al., 2009). Although the salary difference of approximately $28,000 may seem a large increase, the additional educational expenses combined with opportunity costs of returning to school may be daunting for some nurses. The implementation of the Nursing Educ ation Loan Repayment Program has eased the financial pain for those nurses who wish to di rect their careers toward roles in education. The loan program now repays 60 percent of the qualifie d loan balance in exchange for two years of service in an approved shortage facility. An additional 25 percen t may be negotiated for a third year of service (HRSA, 2010). The program hol ds the promise of preparing more faculty members to teach, but that does not address the development of specific competencies required to teach in clinical areas. In fact, many newl y doctorally prepared nurses anticipate moving into faculty roles where they can redirect their car eers toward non-clinical pursuits. The faculty shortage is real, but the more specific problem is id entifying faculty talent to teach in the clinical area. Those competencies are in short supply and we need to create incentives to promote the development or maintenance of clinical expertise and clinical engagement.

Develop institutionally based incentives for facu lty to maintain clinical competency, such as participation in a faculty practice plan. In many fields the careers may reflect a migr ation from industry to education to public service and back. This has not been typical in nursing. Movement from the practice setting to the educational settings and back has not been valued. Rather, a distin ct skill set and preparation has been identified for each role. Increasingly, educ ators are expected to have a background in curriculum design, tests and measurement and pedagogy. The criteria for advancement in the academy represent yet another barrier. Adhering to the standards set by most universities, academic nursing programs impose specific, rigorous and rather narrow criteria for appointment and promotion. These criteria rely more heavily on scholarly accomplishments than on practice acumen. The net effect is the evolution of a professorate with limited knowledge and experience in the practice environment (which is seen as a distraction to the development of a program of research) and limited understanding of how to prepare graduates fo r the realities of practice. Recommendation 4: Expand criteria for faculty appointment and advancement to include recognition of practice-based accomplishments, including leadership, innovation and evaluation. Normalize the career movement between the practice and educational settings within nursing. Every report published by the IOM for the last decade has called for the use of teams for the delivery of care. (I am completely confident that one of my fellow author s will go into this issue in detail, but I will list the recommendation for the record.) Reports suggesting that teams do affect better patient care outco mes (Grumbach and Bodenheimer, 2004), but there is very little evidence that effective educationa l approaches for co-education of members of the health care team have been enacted, evalua ted and replicated. Team work is an essential skill in today's health care delivery system and students must be prepared to function on teams. Incentives must be direct programs toward making this change. Recommendation 5: Promote funding initiatives that will plan and implement classroom and clinical co-education of health care providers, particularly nursing and medicine. Explore existing federal mechanisms to sustain worthwhile results, for example the combined use of Titles VII and VIII for models within primary care. Although universities organize them selves into orderly pods cal led disciplines, real world problems seldom emerge as discipline-specific. The order imposed by disciplines directs those within the discipline toward a quasi-proprietary body of knowledge , provides a set of tools for discovery and frames data elements systemati cally to promote problem solving. But, the down side of that order is that disc iplines tend to bring the same basic set of information and solutions to novel problems. Said another way, if your only tool is a hammer, then all your problems look like nails. Some believe that multidisciplinary coll aboration has moved from the periphery to the core of our work in universities (University L eadership Council, 2009). The problems we face are simply too diverse and complex to approach with old solutions. The content and problem PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-48 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH solving approaches used within the discipline of nursing will be enhanced through closer educational exchange wi th other disciplines. Recommendation 6: Although others sources provide greater detail on the specific curricular changes needed (s ee Benner et al., 2010), alliances with other disciplines will yield new approaches to the problems faced in nursing education and service delivery. In particular content and practical experiences should be developed wi th engineering, business, public and health policy, legal and environmental experts. REFORM 2: Recognize the important role that Translation will play in strengthening nursing education, improving nursing practice and connecting the two. The Institute of Medicine Report, To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health Care System estimated in 1999 that many as 98,000 people die in hospitals each year as a result of medical error (IOM, 1999). Further, these errors have b een estimated to cost approximately $37.6 billion each year; roughly half of the expense is attributab le to preventable errors (AHRQ, 2010). In the decade since that report was published the care delivery community has undertaken needed reforms to appoint patient safety officers and prom ote cultures of safety th at will assist in the creation of a quality and safety conscious work environment. Within the education community the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sponsored the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Project (Cronenwett et al., 2009), directed by Linda Cr onenwett. The lessons of the QSEN project provide some direct ion for other areas in which ther e are education-practice gaps. In brief, Cronenwett and colleagues found that faculty interested in creating a quality and safety curriculum acknowledged their limite d expertise and willingness to engage in a collaborative. With a relative small financia l package, teams from a group of 15 schools participated in an educational collaborativ e that developed and implemented systematic curricular changes that were clin ically relevant. In this case, critically important knowledge was disseminated to the educational environment. Recommendation 7: Identify the top ten priority areas for faculty learning and use similar, evidence-based approaches to accelerating the development of expertise/capacity (learning collabo rative) in key areas. Provide public recognition for those educational environm ents that have developed expertise in the ten areas. Encourage a service-delivery focused organization, such as the American Organization of Nurse Executi ves, to lead the identification of topics and the development and implementation of the recognition. Conversely, useful evidence produced within th e academy does not always find its way into clinical practice. Numerous sources cite the frequent disconnect between practice decisions and the evidence that would suppor t them (IOM, 2001; Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt, 2005). The management of information, though improved thr ough technology, requires additional resources for use in the clinical setting. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-49 Recommendation 8: Enlist nursing education (that is, faculty and students) in clinically-based activities supporting knowledge development and process improvement at the point of care. The establishment of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) has been controversial within nursing (Dracup et al., 2005; Meleis and Dracup, 2005) and beyond (Landro, 2008). The design and implementation of DNP programs has varied considerably from Columbia University's focus on the development of doctorally prepared advanced practice nurses who can utilize skills and knowledge to independently provide expert nursing care in all car e settings (Columbia University, 2010), to programs like Duke's that focus on leadership, innovation and translation and aim to a prepare nurse leaders for interdis ciplinary health care teams who will work to improve systems of care, patient outcomes, quality and safety (Duke University, 2010). Although one can argue that the lack of curricular standardiz ation in these programs is problematic for the public and the professi on, their popularity is clear. In 2009, the AACN reported that 92 DNP programs were curren tly enrolling students and another 102 DNP programs were in the planning stages. From 2007 to 2008, DNP program enrollments nearly doubled from 1,874 to 3,415. During that same peri od, the number of DNP graduates increased from 122 to 361 (AACN, 2010). Data available from the AACN's 2009 Enrollment Survey indicate that enrollments in research-focuse d doctoral nursing programs have continued to increase slightly (from 3,439 in 2004 to 3,976 in 2008) while DNP enrollments increased from 170 to 3,415 during the same interval (Fang and Bednash, 2009). The obvious conclusion is that the programs are meeting a need. Anecdotally, ou r students report they would never have been interested in a PhD; they want to advance their understanding of how to effect improvements in the health care environment. Recommendation 9: Advance the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) as a vehicle for the preparation of advanced practice nurses for leadership roles in translation\u2014to include examination of evidence, innovation, policy revision and dissemination. At Duke we have developed the Duke Transla tional Nursing Institute (DTNI), housed within and partially funded by the NIH supported Clinical and Translational Science Award (the Duke Translational Medicine Institute). We have hired experts to facilitate inquiry by staff nurses at the point of care; hired experts to facilitate the evaluation of i nnovative models of care; and hired experts to study the barriers and facilitator of dissemination of change. We have begun a small grants program and hired staff to consult on research design and an alysis, and manuscript development. Recommendation 10: Promote the creation of research facilitation structures that promote knowledge development at the point of care, the testing and evaluation of innovative models of care and the study of implementation. Build incentives into funding mechanisms that encourage a variety of forms of similar collaboration. Explicitly promote the development of and translation of knowledge into nursing practice and practice improvements through the CTSA mechanism.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-50 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH REFORM 3: Commit to the prep aration of masters prepared specialists in nursing, and prepare these graduates to deliver care that is safe, culturally competent, high value/low cost, and patient-centric. For over 30 years, the research li terature has consistently substantiated the safety and quality of care delivered by masters prepared nurses, part icularly nurse midwives and nurse practitioners delivering primary care (Brown and Grimes, 1995). Today 1,400 Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs), 28,000 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists CRNAs), 125,000 Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and over 2,300 Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs) are providing ad vanced practice nursing in the US. The proposal to move all specialty preparation to the doctoral level and use the master's degree in nursing to prepare gene ralist by 2015, as advanced by the American Association of Colleges of Nurs ing, has not been based on evidence that this will improve the quality of care delivered. Further, the probability is high that an extende d educational pipeline would deter qualified nurses from continuing through the doctorate. At a time when the nursing education community is being called upon to produce more primary care pr oviders to meet the growing national need for primary care, such a proposal seems ill-timed, if not irresponsible. Justifications that current masters program curricula are over-credited should not substitute for more careful examination of how to teach the specialty content in a fewer number of credits. Finally, current employers of masters prepared nurses have expressed concern that there are no roles/no needs for the masters prepared gene ralists and they are unlikely to hire them. Recommendation 11: Advocate for th e continued preparation of the specialist at the masters level; en courage market forces, rather than professional societies and educational accrediting groups, to drive a change that appears profession-centric, rather than in the interests of improving patient care. Recommendation 12: Challenge the cu rrent credit-heavy requirements in existing masters programs to test innovat ions in teaching that would improve competence and reduce program credits. If models of care delivery using masters prepared nurse generali sts are available, conduct rigorous evaluations of their use and outcomes, in cluding value, to serve as the basis of proposed changes. Upon reflection, this list of reforms and sp ecific recommendations do correspond to many of my ongoing responsibilities; however, the opportunity to review the work of others and consider the limits of my own actions has served as a ca talyst to do more next week. The responsibility for the educational and personal development of the nursing work force has vast and far reaching consequences for nursing and for health care. Rapid social changes, acceleration in knowledge development and the development of new tools for managing information will not go away. We must change our approach to ensure that it addr esses the context and the goal. We must lead with the future in mind.

Tanner, R.N., Ph.D., FAAN Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing ABSTRACT Evidence is accumulating that nurses completing pre-licensure programs are not equipped with the essential knowledge and skills for today's nursing practice, nor prepared to continue learning for tomo rrow's nursing. Citing the need to improve quality and increase capacity, this pa per offers three recommendations for transforming nursing education: (1) Creat e new nursing education systems which use existing resources in community colle ges and universities and which provide for common prerequisites and a shared competency-based nursing curriculum and instructional materials. (2) Convene one or more expert panels to develop model pre-licensure curricula which: (a) can be used as a framework by faculty in community college-university partnerships for development of their local curriculum; (b) are based on emerging h ealth care needs and widely accepted nursing competencies as interpreted for new care delivery models; (c) incorporate best practices in teaching and learning. (3) Invest in a national initiative to develop and evaluate new approaches to pre-licensure clinical education, including a required post-graduate residenc y under a restricted license. The author notes that these changes will require significant investment in the reforms, as well as in nursing education research a nd faculty development. The return on investment would be improved educationa l capacity and a better prepared nursing workforce, responsive to emerging health care needs and rapidly changing health care delivery systems. TRANSFORMING PRE-LICENSURE NURSING EDUCATION: PREPARING THE NEW NURSE TO MEET EMERGING HEALTH CARE NEEDS The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching joins a chorus of calls for transformation of pre-licensure nursing educat ion (Benner et al., 2009). Citing the shift of significant responsibility to nurses for managing complex medical regimens, as well as increasing complexity of community based pr actices, Benner and colleagues concluded that nurses entering the field are not equipped with the essential k nowledge and skills for today's practice nor prepared to conti nue learning for tomorrow's nursing (p. 31). They found: (1) weak curricula in natural sciences, technology, social sciences and humanities, and in developing cultural competency; (2) weak classroom instruct ion and limited integration between classroom and clinical experiences; (3) lim ited strategies in helping studen ts develop habits of inquiry, raising clinical questions, seeki ng evidence for practices; (4) facu lty and student perception that students are ill-prepared for their first job and dissatisfaction w ith the teaching preparation of current nursing faculty; (5) and multiple pathways to eligibility for the licensure examination, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-53 with tremendous variability in prerequisites, the curricular re quirements, and the quality of offerings. The Carnegie study is one of many citing the inadequate preparation of nurses for today's practice in complex, acute care environments (Burritt, 2009 ; Berkow et al., 2008; Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 2002; NCSBN, 2001) There is a growing body of evidence that confirms registered nurses are indeed essential to patient safety (AHRQ, 2007) and experts warn of further compromise in patient safety and care quality as experienced nurses retire in droves and the ra tio of new graduates to experienced nurses increases (Orsolini-Hain and Malone, 2007) . While 84 88 percent of new graduates are employed in hospital-based practice for their first position (Kovner et al., 2007; Kenward and Zong, 2006), increasing numbers of nurses have migrated to non-acu te care settings. Currently only 60 percent of all nurses practice in hospitals while over 40 percent of nurses practice in non- acute care settings, such as ambulatory clinics, nursing homes, schools and public health (HRSA, 2004). As care continues to shift from hospitals to community-bas ed settings, as the population ages and care management in the community b ecomes more complex, and as new health care needs emerge, a new kind of nurse will be needed. Educational programs must be redesigned to better prepare this nurse. In addition to these quality issues, educational capacity issues must also be addressed. The projected shortage of nurses is well-documented (Buerhaus et al., 2009) and academic institutions have done a remarkable job of increasing enrollments (AACN, 2009b; NLN, 2009a) but without further action, the supply of new nurse s will fall well-short of the demand as a result of serious limitations in educational capacity. In the 2006-07 year, over 40 percent of qualified applicants for pre-licensure programs did not gain admission (NLN, 2008) and in 2008 2009, approximately 40,000 qualified applicants were turned away from nursing programs (Kovner et al., 2009). Principal causes for limitations in educ ational capacity: shortage of qualified faculty, insufficient number, quality and type of sites for clinical education and budgetary constraints. AACN, 2009a,b; NLN, 2006, 2009a,b) In this paper, I offer three recommendations related to transformation of pre-licensure education which address the quality and capacity issues and which provide for the possibility of leveraging existing resources in order to make crit ical changes. I will use models currently being tested in Oregon, the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education (Gubrud-Howe et al., 2003; Tanner et al., 2008), as well as in Hawaii and regions of California as an exemplar of some of these recommendations. Recommendation 1: Create new nursing education systems which use existing resources in community colleges and universities and which provide for common prerequisites, a competency-based nursing curriculum and shared instructional resources. Rationale Entry into practice at the Bach elors Level, as recommended in the Carnegie report, has been on the profession's agenda since 1965. Few would argue against th e notion that more education is better, and there is growing evidence that the level of education is strongly correlated with patient outcomes. (Aiken et al., 2003, 2008; Esta brooks et al., 2005; Torang eau et al., 2007). Yet community colleges are a vital re source to meet educational capacity requirements. The roughly 1000 community college nursing programs (NLN, 2009) provide access to educ ation in rural and PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-54 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH underserved communities, educating approximately 60 percent of all new graduates each year (HRSA, 2004). The nearly 700 baccalaureate prog rams prepare approximately 31 percent of new graduates each year (AACN, 2009; HRSA, 2004) There are near ly 600 baccalaureate completion programs, many of which boast articulation agreem ents that smooth the transition from associate degree to the bachelors, yet onl y 20.6 percent of associate degr ee graduates continue for the bachelors' degree (HRSA, 2004). The net effect of a disproportionately small pool of bachelors' degree graduates is simply fewer nurses who are e ligible and likely to continue for the advanced education necessary to become faculty (Aiken et al., 2009) One approach to capitalizing on community co llege nursing program resources to increase the number of baccalaureate graduates is to allo w community colleges to offer the bachelors' degree. Sixteen states have changed regulati ons to allow community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees, and several have launc hed bachelors in nursing programs (Community College Baccalaureat e Association, 2008). The current patchwork of educational programs is inefficient. Community college 'two-year programs,' typically take 3 or more years to complete. Prerequisites vary widely across programs; students who may meet the course requirements for admission to one school's program do not meet those of another school. Nurs ing curricula, wh ile containing similar content and meeting similar accreditation standards, are also quite variable in terms of sequence and credit hour allocation; program f aculty varying in number from as few as 4 or 5 faculty in smaller programs to well over 50 each invest cons iderable time and resources in developing and maintaining their own program's curriculum and instructional resource s. The variation in curricula creates additional cha llenges in clinical education: st aff nurses who frequently provide supervision for students from multiple programs, at varying levels, and differing instructional goals, may end up very unclear about what students might be safely expected to do (MacIntyre et al., 2009). Exemplar One model for addressing these inefficienci es and for improving access to baccalaureate education is a partnership between community college and university programs. The Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education (OCNE) was designed to increase capacity for baccalaureate education by making best use of scarce facult y, classrooms and clinical education resources (Gubrud-Howe et al., 2003; Tanner et al., 2008) Eight community colleges and the 5 campuses of the public university school of nursing deve loped and implemented a shared, competency- based curriculum that culminates in a bachel ors degree. What sets this model apart from traditional articulation agreements is that the curri culum is standard across all partner campuses: nursing faculty from full partner schools de veloped and approved a common curriculum plan (including competencies, benchmar ks, course titles, descriptions , credit hour allocation and outcomes) as well as academic standards for student admission and progression. The potential for increasing faculty capacity and productivity is beginning to be realize d, as faculty from one campus can fill in and teach a course on another campus, and as instructional materials (such as examinations, case studies, scenarios for simula tions) are developed and made accessible to all faculty through a web-based searchable da ta base linked to the curriculum. OCNE admitted its first class of students in Fall of 2006, and is engaged in an Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)\u2014funded evaluatio n study of outcomes, including student performance measures and degree completion. Early results are enc ouraging, as roughly 40 percent of graduates from community college partner schools have en rolled in the courses PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Need for program improvements are being identified, including improved advisement and services for students transitioning from community college to the university, deve lopment and implementation of statewide interprofessional educational experiences, a nd provision for ongoing faculty development. Similar statewide or regional university-college part nerships are being planne d in at least 5 other states with the Hawaii statewide consortium positioned to implement in Fall 2010. Recommendation 2: Convene one or more expert panels to develop a model pre-licensure curriculum which: (1) can be used as a framework by faculty in community college-university partnershi ps for development of their local curriculum; (2) is based on emerging health care needs and widely accepted nursing competencies as interprete d for new care delivery models; (3) incorporates best practices in teaching and learning. Rationale Demands for a new kind of nurse have been ab undant for the last two decades, fueled, in part, by vast changes in the nursing practice envi ronment, including a tremendous increase in the complexity and acuity of patient care in the ho spital setting, decreased lengths of stay and the shift of care and recovery to the home and community, explosion of new technologies, exponential growth of information and knowledge, clear identification of the \"quality chasm\" (IOM, 2001) and the recognition of the significance of nursing in patient safety (IOM, 2004). New competencies have been prom ulgated to address the quality chasm and patient safety goals (IOM, 2003; Cronenwett et al., 2007), geriatric care (AACN, 1998), clin ical prevention and population-based care (Allan et al., 2005) among many other areas and incorporated into requirements for accreditation (Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 2009; National League for Nursing Accr editation Commission, 2009). Demographic changes alone demand different a different focus in pre-licensure programs. The number of older adults in the United State will almost double between 2005 and 2030, presenting multiple challenges for the health care sy stem (He et al., 2005). The majority of older adults suffer from at least one chronic health condition. The fastest growing segment growing segment of the population is th e \"over 85\" age group, and it is estimated that a minimum of 50 percent of this group will require help with ac tivities of daily living (He et al., 2005; IOM, 2008). Direct care workers are the primary providers of paid hands -on care to older adults, and together with families, provide the majority of care for adults in community based care settings. Registered nurses in community-based settings have responsibility for guiding, teaching and/or supervising these caregivers, yet have little trai ning or experience in how to work effectively with them. While the amount of geriatric/gerontologic content and experiences in pre-licensure programs has increased in the last decade, it is still uneven, and effective teaching is hampered by lack of faculty expertise (Berman et al., 2005 ; Gilje et al., 2007; Irons ide and Tagliareni, in press). Most curricula are orga nized around traditional nursing specialties (e.g., maternal-child, pediatrics, medical-surgical or some slight variation in name such as adult-health) and clinical experiences are largely centered in acute care settings (McNelis and Ironside, 2009). Clinical education which focuses geriatrics occurs prin cipally in nursing homes (with some noteworthy exceptions), and often in the first year of the nursing progr am when students may fail to appreciate the complexities of providing care to older adults (Ironside and Taglaireni, in press).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-56 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Interprofessional geriatrics education has been promoted (American Gerontological Society, 2006) and geriatrics competencies are similar acro ss disciplines (Mezey et al., 2008), most health profession education continues to oc cur in silos. (Barnsteiner, 2007) Curricular changes over the last decade have tended to be additive, rather than transformative, i.e. adding content or circumscri bed courses as new competencies appear in the literature (Ironside, 2003; NLN, 2003). The majority of nurse educat ors first learned to be nurses in content-laden, highly structured curricula, and few have received advanced formal preparation in curriculum development, instructional design or performance assessment. Faculty, tending to teach as they were taught, focus on covering content (Duchscher, 2003), a practice reflected more recently in the Carnegie study; they see curriculum mandates as a barrier to creating engaging, student-centered learni ng environments within their schools (Schaefer and Zygmont, 2003). O'Neil (2009) makes a compelling argument for a major overhaul of nursing curricula. He suggests that traditional nursing competencies such as care management, patient education, public health intervention and transitional care will dominate in a reformed health care system, as it inevitably moves toward emphasis on prev ention and management over acute care. But he points out that \"...these traditi onal competencies must be reinterpreted for students into the settings of the emergent care system, not the one that is being left behind. This will require faculty to not only teach to these competencies but also creatively apply them to health environments that are only now emerging\" (p. 318) . It is critical that we revisit possible and optimal expectations for entry level nurses, based on population needs and likely changes in care delivery models, then align pre-licensure and residency programs accordingly. Revamping curricula collaboratively with other health professions schools (Mezey et al., 2008) provides opportunity for meaningful inte r-professional collaboration. Advances in the science of learning also support curriculum overhaul. While nursing education research is sparse, a growing body of research on learning from a variety of other fields supports the need for activ e engagement of the learner, a nd a focus on deep learning of the discipline's most central concepts (Bransford et al., 2000; Weimer, 2002) As pointed out in the Carnegie study, the typically content-laden nursing curriculum results in s uperficial coverage of content, a failure to engage stude nts in rehearsing for clinical pr actice by grappling with real-life clinical situations, and a failure to integrate across knowledge, clinical reasoning, skilled know- how and ethical comportment. Faculty complain a bout the demand to cover content, fearing that students will not pass their li censure examination (Schaefer and Zygmont, 2003) and, as the Carnegie study suggests, faculty need guidance in what is essential content in the curriculum, as well as how to teach it in a wa y that engages students. Bain (2004), from his study of expert teachers describes this practice: Teachers in our study...believe that students must learn facts while learning to use them to make decisions about what they understand or what they should do. To them, \"learning\" makes little sense unless it has some sustained influence on the way the learner subsequently thinks, acts, or feels. So they teach the \"facts\" in a rich context of problems, i ssues and questions. (p. 29) The integrative teaching described in the Carnegie study is in st ark contrast to the belief and related practices that \"students cannot learn to think, to analyze, to sy nthesize, and to make judgments until they 'know' the basic facts\" (Bain, 2004, p. 29).

In se parate studies, Giddens (2007) and Secrest and colleagues (2005) showed that only one fourth to one thir d of approximately120 health assessment techniques typically ta ught in the standard health assessment course are used routinely by nurses in practice across settings. They suggest that this content could be significantly reduced, teaching fewer techniques well, and adding ot hers only as they relate to specific situations and can be ta ught in the context of clinical judgment. Changes like this could result in a significant reducti on of content, overall, providing opportunity for the integrative teaching and learning that is so aptly illustrated in th e Carnegie study. The content-laden curriculum, and resulting ine ffective teaching practic es is a long-standing problem which is likely to be exacerbated as practices change, and new competencies are mandated. It is a problem which is unlikely to be successfully resolved by the individual faculty in the over 1700 nursing programs across the county. Guidance from an expert panel, proposing curriculum models which meet the growing list of competencies, with processes for rapid cycle changes in curriculum content, will be necessary to lead essential ch anges in pre-licensure curricula. Exemplar The curriculum developed and implemented by OCNE partners is based on assumptions such as these above. Faculty assumed that their st udents would practice in an environment vastly different from the current one, one in which th ere would be fewer RNs; by equipping RNs with expanded skills related to delegation, coordina ting care, community-based and population-based practice, use of data to affect outcomes and co llaborative team manageme nt, better use can be made of RNs' full scope of practice, skills, and expertise. In this curriculum, fundamentals of nursing have been redefined as evidence-based pr actice, culturally sens itive and relationship- centered care, leadership and clin ical judgment, with these concep ts and others introduced early in the context of health promotion and spir aled throughout the curriculum. Through a 2-year faculty development program, facult y leaders in the OCNE partner programs applied advances in the science of learning by inte ntionally reducing content, to focus principally on the most prevalent health problems and practices. Instructi onal approaches have been dramatically altered toward case-based instruction, integrating si mulation, drawing on best practices in the development of these approaches. In this competency-based program , the faculty role is shifting from the delivery of content to the development of learning activities that will lead students to competent performance. The RWJF study of the OCNE program includes measures of classroom teaching fidelity which allow for study of t eaching practices linked wi th learning outcomes. Recommendation 3. Invest in a national initiative to develop and evaluate new approaches to pre-licensure clin ical education, including a required post-graduate residency under a restricted license.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-58 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Rationale Pre-licensure clinical education has remained essentially unchanged for at least 40 years (Tanner, 2006). As a derivation of hospital-based apprenticeships, st udents are placed in clinical settings, mostly acute care, and assigned to pr ovide care for one or more patients. They learn through providing care to these patients, while be ing supervised by clinical faculty, with varying degrees of support by staff nurses employed by the clinical agency. (McNelis and Ironside, 2009; Chappy and Stewart, 2004). Because the experi ence is organized around individual patients, students may be rarely engaged with the full sc ope of nursing decision-making, including linking patient outcomes with larger systems issues (M acIntyre et al., 2009) or population-based care management. The nature and quality of students' clinical experience is highly dependent on events that occur during the time of placemen t, leaving to chance such experiences as interdisciplinary teamwork, managing crisis situations, and working with families in the provision of care.(Gubrud-Howe and Schoessler, 2008). Because th e focus of learning is necessarily on acute care, there is little practical experience in strategies for management of chronic conditions, health behavior change, or coordinating care across settings. There is scant empirical literature supporting th e traditional model of clinical education; indeed, the evidence that graduates feel unprepared for practice (Benner et al., 2009) and that fi rst-line managers are dissatisfied with the level of pr eparation suggest that the model is not effective (Berkow et al., 2008). Importantly, the pervasive use of this appro ach as the primary clin ical education model results in limited capacity; the num ber clinical sites is cited as a major barrier to enrollment expansions (AACN, 2009b) and effective clinical teaching (M cNelis and Ironside, 2009).While the use of high-fidelity simulation has been proposed as a solution to these limitations in capacity, and early studies about its effectiveness are promising (Harder, 2010), there is little evidence that it expands faculty capacity, and lit tle guidance about what portion of clinical experience can be replaced with simulation. The required number of clinical hours varies wi dely from one program to another, and most state boards of nursing do not specify a minimum number of clinical hours in pre-licensure programs (NCSBN, 2008). It is likely that many of the clinical hours do not result in productive learning. Students spend much of their clinical time doing routine care tasks repeatedly, which may not contribute significantly to new learning. Faculty report spending most of their time supervising students in hands-on pr ocedures leaving little time focused on fostering development of clinical reasoning skills (McNelis and Ironside, 2009). There have been some advances in clinical education, resting on strong academic-service partnerships. Preceptorships are widely used, and a recent integrative review suggests that they are at least as effective as traditional appro aches (Udlis, 2006), while conserving scarce faculty resources. The Dedicated Education Unit (DEU) is receiving increasing at tention as a viable alternative for expanding clinical education capacity (Moscato et al., 2007). In this model, units are dedicated to instruction of students from one program. Staff nurses who want to teach as clinical instructors are prepared for this role, and faculty e xpertise is used to support the development and comfort of the staff nurse as c linical teacher. Early resu lts suggest the DEU can dramatically increase capacity and have a positive effect on student and nursing staff satisfaction; a multisite study funded by the RWJF is currently underway to evaluate outcomes of the DEU model. A variety of other clinical partne rships have been designed to increase capacity in the face of a nursing faculty shortage (B axter, 2007; DeLunas and COPY: UNCORRECTED Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-59 There is an expanding body of evidence suppor ting the cost-effectiven ess of postgraduate residencies. In 2002, the Joint Commission on Ac creditation of Healthcare Organizations, recommended the development of nurse-residency programs, a recommendation most recently endorsed by the Carnegie study. Successful progr ams have been launched by Versant (Beecroft et al., 2001, 2004, 2006); the AACN and University Health System Consortium developed a model for post-baccalaureate nur se residencies (Goode and W illiams, 2004; Krugman et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2007, and AACN recently adopted accreditation standards for these programs (AACN, 2008) The National Council of State Boards of Nursing has developed a regulatory model for transition to practice programs, recommendi ng that state boards of nursing enforce a transition program thr ough licensure (NCSBN, 2008a, 2009). Residency programs are predominantly supported in hospitals and larger health systems, with a focus on acute care. Indeed, this has been the ar ea of greatest need as most new graduates gain employment in acute care settings (Kovner, 2007) and the proportion of new hires (and nursing staff) that are new graduates is rapidly increasing. It is clear th at even the best nursing programs cannot adequately prepare new graduates to work in the current acute care environment (Goode et al., 2009). It is essential that programs out side of acute care settings be developed and evaluated. Given the demographic changes on the horizon, the shif t of care from hospital to community-based settings, the need for nursing expertise in chronic illness management, care of the older adults in home settings, and in transitional services, nurses need to be prepared for new roles outside of the acute care setting. It follows that new types of residency programs appropriate for these types of roles need to be developed and beco me part of the regulatory framework. In sum, in order to increase educational cap acity, improve educational outcomes, and better prepare graduates for the seismic shifts likely to occur in practice, there is an urgent need to develop and test new pre-licensure clinical education models incl uding postgraduate residencies. Exemplar One model is currently being implemented a nd evaluated by OCNE programs, funded by the Department of Education, Fund for Improvement of Postsecondary Education (Gubrud-Howe and Schoessler, 2009), which includes some of the following desired features (Tanner, 2006): Focus on learning outcomes, rather than on placements and completion of clock hours, considering essential competencies such as th e development of clinical judgment, ethical comportment, interprofessional teamwork, t echnical proficiency and new competencies required in contemporary professional practice. Contain a variety of learning activities, designed to achieve specific learning outcomes, and taking into account the level of the student , the acuity of the patient, the complexity of the desired learning, and the skill of the faculty. Incorporate research on learning and best practices identified by the Carnegie study pointing to: 1) the type of preparation the student would do in anticipation of the clinical learning; 2) the interaction between faculty and stude nt to support learning (e.g., questioning, guiding); 3) the type of debriefing used to help the student learn the major lessons of the activity; 4) a pproaches to assessing student learning; and 5) guidance provided to the student for reflecting on the activity.

Integrate simulation as a complement to \"h ands-on\" clinical e xperience using best available evidence to plan scenarios and incorporate into the clinical education curriculum (Harder, 2010). Recognize the need to vary student-faculty ratio and time on task, depending on the nature of the learning activity, the level of the student and the patient population. Support clinical nursing staff in clinical instructi on, without overtaxing c linical resources, and at a level appropriate for the level of the student and the patient population. SUMMARY Implicit in these recommendations is the need for significant investment in nursing education research and in faculty development. While th ere is obvious need for research in nursing pedagogies, there is also a critical need for evaluation of the multiple pathways to nursing licensure. For example, fast-tr ack curricula for students with second degrees have increased exponentially in the last five year s, with very little evidence of their effectiv eness, and virtually no study of curricular structures and instructional methods appr opriate for this population of students (Cangelosi and Whitt, 2005). Yonge and colleagues (2005) reviewing nursing education research spanning 1991 2000 found that 80 percent had no identified funding source. Broome (2009) in calling for investment in the science of nursing education, poin ts to the link between quality of research and funding. It seems implausible that the repl acement of half of the nursing workforce during the next decade can be eff ectively addressed without building a stronger scientific basis for nursing educatio n. Similarly, faculty development is critical in order to bring about the magnitude of changed recomme nded here and in the Carnegie study. Taken together, these recommendations echo thos e of the Carnegie Foundation study, calling for transformation of pre-licensure education. It will require partnership across all levels of nursing education and health sy stems, redirecting Medicare funding from hospital based pre- licensure programs to postgraduate residency an d advanced practice programs, expanding Title VIII funding, and other federal resources for su pport of educational reform. The return on investment would be improved educational capac ity and a better prepared nursing workforce, responsive to emerging health care needs and ra pidly changing health care delivery systems.

The current care systems cannot do the job. Trying harder wi ll not work. Changing systems of care will.\" (Committee on Quality of Health Care in Amer ica, 2001, p. 4) Since the publication of the IOM's quality chasm reports, numerous organizati ons have called for changing not only systems of care, but also systems of health professions education , realizing that it will be the clinicians of the future who can most effectively change how care is delivered. Health professions education has overall seen little fundamental change in the past 50 years and is in urgent need of new vision. New goals are needed to improve the degr ee to which the practice of graduates improves the health of the population; enhances the patient's experience of care; and reduces or controls the per capita cost of care. BACKGROUND Education in the health profe ssions is expected to produce gr aduates proficient in core competencies as specified by the Pe w Health Professions Commissions ( Recreating Health Professional Practice for a New Century , Pew, 1998) and the Institute of Medicine (Greiner and Knebel, 2003). These competencies focus on issu es of professional behavior (e.g., ethical standards, cultural competence) and focus of care (e.g., prevention, primary care) with the overarching intent to (1) provide patient-centered care, (2) apply quality improvement principles, (3) work in inter-professional teams, (4) use evidence-based practices, and (5) use health information technologies. Although there is wide agreement and support for these competencies, curricula have been slow to change. Faculty, them selves educated in past eras, laden curricula with factual content delivered in turgid lectur es, often portrayed in dense PowerPoint slides. Students graduate with ample factual knowledge but often with lit tle sense of integration and poor ability to function in inte r-professional teams or coordinate care effectively across the multiple care settings which most patients travel. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/ ) recommends innovations in teaching in nursing and medicine with three emphases\u2014 integration (students' ability to connect basic, clinical, and social science knowledge with clinical experience); systems improvement (student opportunities to improve the health care system); and professionalism (students' acquisition of the qualities of professionalism including the formation and ad option of the shared values, behaviors, and aspirations of the profe ssion). Its recent report, Educating Nurses: A Call for Radical Transformation (Benner et al., 2010), calls for teaching th at invites students to develop a sense of salience, clinical reasoning, and c linical imagination. To achieve this , the best teachers must teach well beyond disembodied content, te aching students instead \"how to be a nurse who uses evidenced-based knowledge and culti vates habits of thinking for c linical judgment and skilled know-how. Their (the best teachers') teaching is integrative and patient- centered...these teachers coach their students, engaging them in experienti al learning to develop si tuated knowledge, skills, and ethical comportment\" (p. 15).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-67 The looming workforce shortages in most clinic al disciplines demand that educators prepare graduates for greater flexibility across discip linary boundaries and le ss entrenched, siloed thinking. Many organizations speak to this. For example, the Asso ciation of Academic Health Centers cites decentralized decision-making in health workforce education and weak national health workforce policy as reasons for the grow ing crisis in the future supply of health professionals, and calls for urge nt corrective action to improve and finance training (AAHC, Out of Order/Out of Time, 2008). The national Phys icians Foundation recommends that physicians cede much clinical management \"downstream\" to nurse practitioners and physician assistants with the physician's consultative oversight ( Physicians and their Practices Under Health Care Reform , 2009, www.physiciansfoundation.org/F oundtionReportsDetails ). These positions by physicians indicate a greater accepta nce of nursing's key place on th e team in the care delivery enterprise. In the past few years, enlightened nursing education has been moving from content-based curricula taught within segregated compartments, such as care settings isolated from each other and isolated disease-based cont ent, to concept-based, integrated curricula that emphasize evidence-based care and clinical decision ma king across settings, ages, and diagnoses. New American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Essentials documents reflect these changes. While encouraging, this movement is slow and falls short of radical reform. Focus of the Paper This paper focuses on three target areas for emphasis in nursing education\u2014 interprofessional education , education for care coordination , and education for health policy\u2014each essential for a transformed health care system. In such a sy stem, nursing care must be recognized by the American public, policy makers, and others on the health care team as an indispensable ingredient to quality car e. Each of these targets for curric ular reform calls for pedagogy that emphasizes integration and hands-on application we ll beyond factual content. This will require faculty development so that teachers engage and excite students. Each of the targets should become fundamental content for baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral nursing education, with increasing levels of complexity and expectations for application and outcome. Together the three target areas could serve as pillars on which to structure the curriculum. Others will likely sele ct other targets for change, and th ere are many from which to choose. Increasing requirements for admissi on to nursing schools, training and recruiting a more diverse faculty, funding mechanisms for programs and students, improving mechanisms for assessing student performance, reducing and strengthenin g the myriad, often confusing pathways of nursing education, dealing with th e issue of minimum education for entry into practice, and achieving new standards for nursing education\u2014a ll are topics urgently needing new vision and bold change for the profession to receive the recognition and credit it deserves. A major barrier of nursing education for the ad vancement of the profession, and specifically for embracing the three target areas of this paper, is nursing edu cation at the community college level. Since 2006, the majority of new nurses w ho sit for the NCLEX-RN licensure exam each year are graduates of community college asso ciate degree programs. The nursing profession's inability to insist that professional nursing requires a minimum of a four-year baccalaureate degree gravely impedes the stature of the profe ssion. Because associate degree students are less likely to be educated in academic health cent ers, they have less proximity and exposure to students of medicine or most other health professions. Additionally, after graduation, other health professionals are disinc lined to welcome collaborative teamwork with nurses who do not PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-68 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH hold a baccalaureate degree. Further, the three topics of this paper vastly exceed community college curricula. Therefore, a premise of this author is that the nursing profession must require the BSN as minimum education for initial licensure for practice. It simply can no longer allow infighting and special interests to domina te. Doing so has resulted in an average lowering of education for nurses over the past 40 years, during a time in history when other health professions have been increasi ng their education requirements. INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION Medical errors and care fragmentation are ma jor problems that beg for change in health professions education. Poor comm unication among clinicians and resulting dispar ities in care priorities have been well documented. For exam ple, in one study of an inpatient unit, only 48 percent of physicians talked to the RN on thei r team, and in only 13 percent of cases did the MD and the RN have complete agreement on the car e priorities of the day (Evanoff et al., 2005). One outgrowth of this problem has been a move , primarily in England, Canada, and the U.S., to bring health professions students in academic health science universities and medical centers together for periods of interpro fessional education (IPE). Defined as \"occasions when two or more professions learn with, from and about each other to improve colla boration and the quality of care\" (Barr et al., 2005), such education is based on the pr emise that students' greater familiarity with each others' roles, competen cies, nomenclatures, and scopes of practice will result in more collaborative graduates. Graduate s from programs with IPE training will be ready to work effectively in patient-centered teams where miscommunication and undermining behaviors are minimized or eliminated, resulti ng in safer, more effective care and greater clinician and patient satisfaction. Specifically, IPE is t hought to achieve collaboration in implementing policies and improving services, prep are students to solve problems that exceed the capacity of any one profession, improve future job satisfaction, create a more flexible workforce, modify negative attitudes and pe rceptions, and remedy fa ilures in trust and communication (Barr, 2002). Efforts have been made to evaluate the effec tiveness of IPE in improving outcomes, typically including: increased student sa tisfaction; modified negative st ereotypes of other disciplines; increased collaborative behavior; and improved pa tient outcomes. However, IPE's effect is not easily verified since control group designs are expensive, reliable measures are few, and time lapses can be long between IPE and the behavior s of graduates. Barr and colleagues reviewed 107 evaluations of IPE in published reports, judg ed to be of sufficient quality for inclusion according to Cochrane review standards ( www.cochrane.org ), and found support for three outcomes: IPE creates positive interaction amon g students and faculty; encourages collaboration between professions; and improves aspects of pa tient care, such as more targeted health promotion advice, higher immunization rates, and reduced blood pressure for patients with chronic heart disease (Ba rr et al., 2005). In further work, Reeves et al. (2009) reviewed six later studies that met methodology in clusion criteria as randomized controlled trials, controlled before- and after-studies, and in terrupted time series design st udies. Four of the studies found that IPE improved aspects of how clinicians wo rked together, such as an improved working culture and decreased errors in an emerge ncy department, improved care management for domestic violence victims, and improved knowledge and skills of clinicians caring for mental health patients. The remaining two studies f ound that IPE had no eff ect at all. Although empirical evidence is mixed, there is wide-spread theoretical agreement and anecdotal evidence PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-69 that students who demonstrate teamwork skills in the simulation lab or at the bed- or chair-side with patients will apply them beyond the walls of their academic programs, particularly if valued and reinforced by the care environm ents in which they later work. In the early days of IPE, students graduated in to patient-care environments in which siloed and hierarchical systems predominated, thus creating a significant di sconnect between their college-based learning and post-graduation experience. Now, ten years into the widespread reforms triggered by the IOM's searing quality chasm reports, the practice environments students enter tend to reinforce rather than discourage cooperative behaviors and attitudes. This shift suggests a readiness for IPE and fuels the moment um among health science universities toward a growing acceptance of IPE in curricula. IPE goes well beyond classroom-type courses co mprised largely of didactic lectures, considered ineffective in cultivating team-based behaviors. Sitting side-b y-side in lecture halls produces little student engagement with either th e faculty or other students. From a pedagogical perspective, IPE learning come s from conjoint reflection, prob lem-solving, and experience. Effective IPE training produces much more than the sum of its parts, rather, it generates interprofessional discourse that shapes collaborative thinking and be havior. IPE typically takes one or more of three approaches : (1) clinical skills lab simula tion activities using manikins or standardized patients in case s cenarios often videotaped to facilitate review and reflection, (2) service learning projects that enhance student s' civic engagement often with diverse communities, and (3) specific patient group clinics su ch as in the care of geriatric or HIV/AIDS patients. Barriers to IPE exist (Gilbert , 2005) but are surmountable. Ju risdictions of faculty and professional organizations abound. Di fferent accrediting bodies are loath to yield control over traditional curricula and standards. Space in curr icula, with their emphasis on factual content over synthesis, integration, and cooperation, is limited. Relatively rigid academic calendars control course schedules. Other barriers pertain to motivating faculty. How to reward and give faculty credit for IPE when the traditional rewa rd systems such as promotion, tenure, and merit raises are governed within, not across, professions. Resources of the various deans to support IPE likely differ. Typically schools of nursing have smaller overall budgets than schools of medicine but a higher percent of funding that supports the education mission. Medical school faculty typically are expected to generate a la rger proportion of their salaries through clinical practice and/or research. When done well IPE can be expensive for many reasons, e.g., small groups with stability over time to allow for refl ection and the developmen t of trust, and/or expensive equipment for simulations. These budgetary issues can contribute to different levels of willingness of deans to support IPE. Recommendations 1. Students at all levels of nursing education, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral, must have exposure to IPE training and demons trate competence in interprofessional collaboration. 2. Since academic curricula tend to resist change unless pressured by external forces such as accreditation requirements and licensure/certif ying exam content, major education and standard-setting organizations must coope rate to bring about IPE. In addition, endorsement of IPE must come from the highest levels within academic settings, including presidents, provosts, and deans.

Nursing faculty need development in IPE teaching, which requires structure and funding. The traditional notion of \"teacher as expert\" urgently needs replacement with teacher as coach and facilitator. Faculty, whose average age nationally is in the mid-50s, need the tools to make this transition. In addition, si nce most nursing faculty are not active in practice, their own clinical experience is often dated and sometimes based on past unsatisfying interprofessional relationshi ps, making them poor champions for IPE. 4. The level and timing of bringing various stude nts together requires analysis and pilot testing because of students' varying educational pathways and readiness for IPE. For example, evaluate pairing senior medical stude nts with graduate nursing and allied health students, in an effort to ha ve students bring relatively comparable amounts of university education and clinical exposure to the experiences. 5. IPE should be structured around knowledge, skills and competencies to include: interpersonal and listening sk ills; techniques for constructiv e dialogue and di sagreements; how \"evidence\" in evidence-based practice is weighted; systems thinking and problem solving; engaging patients and families as active participants in care; verbal and non- verbal communication within the care team ; effective data reports and displays; stereotypes and prejudices; and appreciati ng alternative conceptual frameworks and points of view. EDUCATION IN CARE COORDINATION Both the health professions literature and the pop ular press note that fa ilures in patient care coordination are widespread in the United States . Indeed, fragmented care, lost records, hand- offs without full information, poor return of in formation from specialty care after referral, unnecessary and redundant procedures and services\u2014and the attendant patient fatigue, frustration, and costs\u2014are the very heart of the quality chasm. This problem is particularly acute for the 125 million people with chronic illness, di sability, or functional limitations, and for the elderly whose numbers will swell in the decades ahead. Short hospital stays have exacerbated the problem. Historically, primary care physic ians coordinated their own pa tients' care within and across settings, but this function has all but been lost for myriad re asons, including the growth in hospitalist care, patient self-referrals to specia lists, the breakdown in communication between primary care and specialty care, financing constraints on physician time, and overall uncoordinated systems of information technolog y. Failures in care coordination also can be traced to curricula where the competencies re quired are assumed to be intuitive and thus minimized or overlooked altogether. Serious consequences result from poor care coor dination. Especially worrisome is the post- hospital fate of patients. One study of care transitions found that 19 percent of patients experienced adverse events following discharge from a U.S. teaching hospital, most of which were avoidable and typically related to poor communication (Forster, et al., 2003). In another survey, 48 percent of newly discharged patients reported not receiving information about side effects of new prescriptions ordered at discharge (Schoen et al., 2005). In a study of urgent care patients, in 33 percent of cases information such as medical history a nd laboratory results was absent. In half the cases, the information was essential to patie nt care (Gandhi, 2005). As defined by the National Quality Forum ( http://www.cfmc.org/caretransitions ; 2006), care coordination should meet patients' needs and pr eferences for information and services across PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlTHE FUTURE OF NURSING EDUCATION I-71 settings over time. This facilitates beneficial, e fficient, safe, and high-quality patient experiences and improved healthcare outcomes. Qualities and principles of care coordination include an enduring patient relationship and an established and up-to-date care plan that anticipates routine needs, manages acute, episodic, and chronic care needs and tracks progress toward goals that are jointly set by the healthcare team and the pati ent/family. Care coordination ensures information flow to and from referrals to specialty care or community services; ensures that all team members, including the patient, are apprised of test s and services with results readily available; reconciles medication orders and educates pa tients and families about side-effects and medication management; and reduces opportuniti es for error. Care coordination requires linguistically and culturally competent communicat ion with the patient and family, and seeks and responds to patient/family questions and feedback. Yawning gaps in care coordina tion are rallying many health professions organizations to search for solutions. For example, the Amer ican Board of Internal Medicine Foundation structured its annual Forum on this topic in 2007, and later spearheaded a consortium, referred to as the SUTTP Alliance (Stepping Up to the Plate for Managing Transitions in Care) comprised of 10 medical specialty societie s, including the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Society of Hospital Medicine. Nurses are the logical and ideal clinicians to fill the role of care coordinator, yet a similar alliance among nursing organizations is absent. Germane to this paper, curricula in care coordination in nursing education are underdeveloped. Nursing research has produced important findings about advance prac tice nurses as care coordinators. Brooten's early work on care of lo w birth weight infants (Brooten et al., 1986) showed significant cost and qua lity improvement for early discharge and follow up home care by advance practice nurses (APNs). Naylor's (Naylor et al., 1999, 2004) studies of a transitional care model by APNs for older cardiac patients post-hospitalization also demonstrated positive effects of nurse-managed transitional care. In these models, APNs tailored post-discharge services to each patient's situation and fo llowed patients by telephone and home visits. The intervention emphasized patients' and caregivers' goals, individualized pl ans of care developed and implemented in collaboration with patients' physicians, educational and behavioral strategies to address needs, and coordination and continuity of care across se ttings. Overall outcomes were positive across a series of studies, showing lower re-hospitalization rates, fewer hospital days when re-admitted, substantial cost savings, and greater patient satisfaction with care. Another superlative example of care coordination is On Lok Senior Health Services for older adults living in San Francisco. For over 30 years, On Lok has used multidisciplinary teams, electronic medical records, capitated paymen t, and a full range of services (including transportation, housing, meals, adu lt day health services, and geri atric aides who make frequent home visits) to provide seamless transitions for nursing home-eligible frail elders at lower cost than usual care. On Lok became the model for similar institutions around the U.S. through the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) (Bodenheimer, 1999). Another care coordination m odel is Tom Bodenheimer's \"teamlet\" (Bodenheimer, 2007), dyads that are a subset of the larger health care team and comprised of a physician and, ideally, an experienced nurse or an APN. Patients ente r \"an expanded encounter,\" in which pre-visit, post-visit, and between-visit care is continua lly monitored and coor dinated by the nurse. Ingredients for success include making sure the patient understands advice and direction and agrees with the plan of care; communicating and interpreting laboratory and other diagnostic tests, and continually looping information between the patient and family, the physician, other PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Bodenheimer notes that ideally the coach would be an RN or an advanced practice nu rse, but in their absence, a medical assistant could be trained for the role. Thus, the role of care coordi nator as patient advocate, communicator, assessor, and intervener, ideally suited to what nurses do best, presents a huge opportunity for nursing education. But, as implied by Bodenheimer, the nursing profession will be by-passed if nurses fail to seize the opportunity. To do so, however, requires th at nursing school curricula incorporate not just the knowle dge underlying the competencies of the role but convey the importance of the role to students by threading the concept and competencies of care coordination throughout the curricul a. As already mentioned, most nursing curricula currently teach compartmentally, not across systems. Course s, particularly in the baccalaureate program where attitudes about nursing and nursing care ar e first formed, focus on content and skills in specific discrete clinical settings. Faculty genera lly teach within, not across, settings of care. Often the master's level Clinical Nurse Specialist program is the only track with a course or parts of courses that address care tr ansitions and care coordination, and this content may be confused with case management, the latter being a more limited concept usually applied to containing costs within reimbursement systems. Interprofessional education discussed above will by itself, improve graduates' competence in care coordination because many of the competen cies students learn in IPE are relevant. However, there is a body of knowledge and sets of skills, attitudes, and role-related behaviors specific to care coordination that should be inte grated throughout the leve ls of nursing education rather than confined to episodic IPE training. Recommendations 1. BSN students should be placed for clinical training in new models of integrated care that require care coordination, such as accountable care organizations within universities or medical homes. 2. MSN students should study the research cited above that shows the effectiveness of APN transitional care. Components of MSN clinical training shou ld include the care coordination role. 3. Across education levels of nursing educati on, care coordination s hould be structured around knowledge, skills and competencies to include: advanced assessment skills appropriate for senior baccalaureate and ma ster's/DNP students; interpersonal and communication skills necessary for the ability to communicate with patients and families with a high degree of sensitivity and cultural competence, as well as the science-based skills necessary to communicate e ffectively with physicians and others on the health care team; competencies in care planning th at integrate the biological, social, and psychological needs of patients; understanding of and ability to seek and apply evidence- based protocols and national standards for patient conditi ons; and payment and social services systems to better address the full range of patients' and families' needs.

This makes sense for an applied discipline whose goal is the prevention or amelioration of illness and the improvement in the wellbeing of patients, families, and communities. However, a major lesson of the past 20 years is the degree to which health systems and policy shape the health both of populations and individual patients. Yet nursing students gain only a glimmer that health policy at multiple levels, from the hospital unit to the federal government, affects not only their practice but ultimately the fate of patients. Few educational programs include more than a token course on health policy, typically only at th e graduate level. Since nursi ng education curricula generally treat health policy as extra rather than core, the naivet\u00e9 of graduates, is no surprise. With few exceptions, nurses generally view themselves as being shaped by, not shaping , policy. Since nurses largely take a back seat to policy processes, th e profession's input has been relatively invisible, certainly compared to that of medicine (Mechanic and Reinhard, 2002). Few nurses, when asked, \"What is nu rsing\" include health policy as a component of what nurses do (Gebbie et al., 2000). Missed opportunities for nu rsing to shape legisl ation or wade into legislative debates are all too common. One exam ple is the recent Cent ers for Medicare and Medical Services (CMS) rule that restricts reim bursement for such \"never events\" as pressure ulcers, certain catheter-related in fections and injuries, and certain surgical site infections. The majority of these conditions can be prevented by excellent nursing care, yet the nursing profession has not effectively convinced the Congress or the American public that nursing care is the key ingredient safeguarding the public from these problems (Leavitt, 2009). Another example is the \"kill ing grandma\" and \"death panel\" controversy, sparked by wording in the August 2009 Congressional healthcar e reform bills. Thousands of nurses across the country have daily, intimate contact with pati ents and families in the throes of decision- making about DNR orders, advance directives, and other end-of-life issues. Nurses have close personal knowledge about how they and other clinic ians facilitate discussions and considerations about palliative care a nd life-extending treatments. Despite this , nurses were largely silent in the face of widespread public misunderstanding and resulting acrimonious outcry over what is intended in counseling patients faci ng such decisions. This silence is surely an outgrowth of the inattention of nursing curricula to health policy. The Healthy People Curriculum Task Force, convened by the Association of Academic Health Centers and the Associat ion of Teachers of Preventive Me dicine, with representatives from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and physician assistants, as well as their educational associations recommended the following four domains fundamental to health professions curricula on health policy ( http://www.atpm.org/CPPH_Framework/index.html ). Organization of clinical and public health systems (connectin g the pieces of the system; connecting clinical care to public health structures) Health services financing (underlying determinants of cost and options for payment and cost containment; comparison to health systems of other countries) Health workforce (understanding the roles and responsibilities of other health professionals) Health policy process (introducti on to the impact of policy on health and clinical care, the processes involved in developing policies, and opportunities to participate in those processes, whether within a local institu tion or state or fe deral legislation) PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlI-74 THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEAD ING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH Medicine has advocated the inclusion of th ese domains in all medical school curricula (Riegelman, 2006). Nursing curricula should do no less. As emphasized above, health policy curricula are needed at the baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral levels of nursing education, with in creasing scope and complexity as the student advances. Political competence requires continuing skill development that begins early in students' education, thus setti ng the course toward the gradua te's life-long engagement. Baccalaureate students need to understand the role of policies at the unit level that shape the environment in which they will eventually wo rk. Workplace policies (e.g., mandatory overtime, nurses' authority to close beds to new admissions based on prof essional judgment of adequate staffing, school nurses' authorit y to teach reproductive information) lend themselves for students' analysis and can help students clarify their own biases and poten tial ethical conflicts. Another example of the type of policy work ideal for analysis by baccalaureate, and even graduate, nursing students pertains to The R obert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement project, Transforming Care at the Bedside (www.ihi.org/IHI/Programs/TransformingCareAtTheBedside/ ). TCAB is an excellent teaching- learning vehicle for students to gain understanding of local policy and how it is shaped. Originally designed as a way to improve hospital work environments so that more nurses would seek (and stay) in positions on medical-surgical units, TCAB also addresses care improvement processes, such as rapid PDSA (plan-do-study-act) cycles for gathering data to influence patient care policies. Faculty should engage baccalaureat e students in this TCAB literature, with application in clinical assignments and an em phasis on policy implications and processes. In addition, baccalaureate students need an understa nding of the important role that nursing organizations can play so as to encourage their involvement both as studen ts and as graduates. Graduate education in nursing, both at the ma ster's and doctoral leve ls, should be infused with multiple learning experiences in health policy, including both explication and hands-on experience. Building on the foundation from the h ealth policy curriculum at the baccalaureate level, APN students need to be actively involved in political processes that affect the care they will deliver in the future. At this stage of their education, they should be expected to understand the link between evidence and polic y, i.e., the role that data ca n play in illuminating problems and capturing the attention of po licy makers. IPE can provide collabo rative efficiencies so that interprofessional student groups engage together in policy projects. AACN's DNP Essentials (www.aacn.nche/DNP/pdf/Essentials.pdf ) includes \"Health Care Policy for Advocacy in Health Care (Essential V), which expects DNP graduates to engage in the health policy process, whether through institutional decision-m aking, influencing organizational standards, or governmental actions. It is expected that students will be oriented to the principles of social justice, particul arly in advocating for the unde rserved. Examples of hands-on assignments include: preparing and presenting a po licy brief analyzing a state or national health policy issue or problem related to access, utilization, cost, or qua lity; writing a letter (not to be sent) to an editor or an elected official on a health issue; and educating the lay public through speaking at local Rotary or other civic organization. At the PhD level, student understanding of how to impact health policy moves specifically to the role of research. The focus at this level should be on advanced knowledge of political processes within the state and federal government and on the competencies needed to articulate research findings persuasively. Students should understand how to plan their doctoral studies and related work, such as scholarly projects and the dissertation, toward the end-goal of becoming PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many authorities (e.g., McBride et al., 2008) urge researchers to engage end users when framing research since t hose in position to make policy fr equently complain that the research they need is rarely available. A useful exercise for PhD student s early in their program is to meet with a state or federal elected member to discuss topics of mutual interest in improving health or healthcare and determining what evid ence may be useful in future policy agenda. Linking research findings to health policy formul ation requires a set of specific skills which should be core to PhD education. These range from the concrete, for example, selecting a title for a policy brief or media report th at reflects the key take-away me ssage (since busy policy makers will overlook material that does not draw them in quickly), to the more conceptual, e.g., learning the separate perspectives of legislators who make policy and researchers who study health problems, which Hinshaw refers to as \"m oving between two cultu res\" (Hinshaw, 2008). Recommendations 1. In addition to health policy courses at bacca laureate, master's, and doctoral levels, health policy objectives should be threaded throughout the curr iculum, ideally embedded in every course and reflected in course assi gnments. Using probing questions that invite student reflection, synthesis, integration, and deduction, facu lty should lead students to articulate the policy implications in everything they study. 2. Accreditation and licensure/certifying examina tions must ramp up their expectations for student competencies related to health policy. 3. Health policy education should be structured around knowledge, skills and competencies to include: policy-related relationship buildi ng skills; techniques for crafting testimony and writing effective white papers and position statements; effective use of numeric and narrative data to emphasize evidence-based information; working with the media; critiquing the ethical aspects of health policy in terms of vulnerable populations; mastering health policy terminology; understand ing legislators' pers pectives; techniques for policy analysis; legislative processes in policy development; roles of stakeholders and special interest groups; and advocacy and strategies to influence policy. EPILOGUE The RWJF/IOM Initiative on the Future of Nursing will yield transformational recommendations for the nursing profession at a critical time in history for nursing and for America's healthcare syst em. There is much to reform in nursing education, from agreement about the minimum degree for entry into practic e to producing graduate s with the requisite knowledge, skills, and interprofessional competenci es they will need. This paper has reviewed the rationale for and curricular implications of three target areas\u2014 interprofessional education , education for care coordination , and education for health policy\u2014around which to restructure education at the baccalaureat e, master's and doctoral leve ls. The author acknowledges the difficulties in changing entrenched curricula and habits of faculty educated in past eras. But one remains optimistic, given the many examples of pr ogress already made (Benner et al., 2010) that an enlightened profession with a will for change can bring about a re freshing new future for nursing education.

Nichols, D.H.L., M.S., R.N., FAAN Richardson, J.D., R.N. CGFNS International EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS The future of nursing in the United States will be shaped by an array of factors and forces\u2014 and each of these, in turn, will be shaped by the myriad international factors and forces created by globalization. This paper describes general trends and broad themes in globalization and international nurse migration, profiles nursing ed ucation, regulation and ut ilization in various countries, and relates them to th e future of nursing, both in the United States and globally. It describes foreign-educated nurses in the United States workforce within the context of global variances in nursing education programs, creden tialing mechanisms, and employment practices. It also provides a global snaps hot of education and re gulation in historic and emerging countries that have supplied migrant nurses to the U.S. wo rkforce and describes their migration patterns. The paper envisions a future with internati onal models of nursing education, regulation and practice. Thus, the impact of in ternational and regional trade agr eements is described as they serve as catalysts for these international models . The paper asserts that nursing reform in the United States must be understood and envisioned within an international and historical context that integrates global trends and issues. Against this backdrop, th e implications of migration and globalization for education, service delivery and health policy in th e United States are identified and discussed. Trends in International Migration Worldwide, demand for nurses exceeds supply and chronic shortages are ch aracteristic of the current global nurse workforce. The 2006 Wo rld Health Report (W HO, 2006) identified shortages of human resources as a critical obs tacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for improving the health of global populations.2 Moreover, the report identifies the importanc e of nursing as an integral element of health systems' infrastructure. 1 The responsibility for the content of this article rests w ith the authors and does not n ecessarily represent the views of the Institute of Medicine or its committees and convening bodies. 2 WHO estimates that the world needs to increase the numb er of health workers by more than four million. WHO defines health workers to be all people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health, such as doctors, nurses, midwives and others.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-2 Various studies also have documented the im portant link between nur se staffing levels, service delivery and health outcomes, suggesting th at important issues exist with respect to how the nursing health workforce is managed. One impor tant factor that has received considerable attention is the mobility and migration of nurses and their impact on the global delivery of health services (Kingma, 2006). Globalization of the nursing workforce must be viewed within the context of the worldwide development of the knowledge economy. This phenomenon identifies in tellectual capital as a valuable asset and encourages the export of e ducation and knowledge wo rkers as significant contributors to a country's economy. For example, national policies in th e Philippines and India support the export of nurses (H ealy, 2006; Thomas, 2006) with China and Korea beginning to follow a similar path (Fang, 2007). The importance of the nurse export business is reflected in the explodi ng growth of nursing schools in the Philippines and India, and in the large sums of money received through remittances.3 Many countries, such as India and China, see the current demand for nurses as a business opportunity. Khadria (2007) describes the process in India as \"business process outsourcing\" (BPO). It includes comprehensive training, recruitment and placement programs for popular destinations, like the Un ited States and the United Kingdom. It is assumed that these growing markets facilitate ca re as a global product deli vered by migrating nurses. Worldwide, the education and re gulation of nurses is highly di verse and varies considerably in scope and complexity. Despite these intern ational differences, a number of factors allow nurses to migrate throughout the world, creating continuous challenges to the maintenance of nursing education, practice and regula tory standards. For example, the United States is unique in having created CGFNS Internationa l to address these issues, thus creating a comprehensive data base on variances in nursing, education, regula tion and practice worldw ide, making it a global resource. A major challenge for all countries is to es tablish workforce planning mechanisms that effectively meet nursing resource requirements in terms of supply and demand. In that regard, nursing shortages in the United States mirror th e growing interdependency of labor markets throughout the world and the need for national a nd international nursing wo rkforce policies. The challenge for workforce planning re lated to the global migration of nurses, however, is to focus not only on the number of nurses entering the coun try, but also on the number of nurses leaving the country, the number of new nurse graduates and the effect of internal migration, such as the movement of nurses from state to state and from rural to urban areas. Also essential is an understanding of the education and licensure systems of migrating nurses to en sure a proper skill mix for the nursing workforce of a country (Kingma, 2006). Thus, the global nurse workforce must be viewe d, not only within the context of the health status of nations, government investment in health budgets, nurse/health care migration, economic realities, and working conditions but also within the context of the diverse preparation and practice of its practitioners. 3 The World Bank defines remittances as the personal earni ngs international migrants send back to their family and friends. Remittances represent an important source of added income and stability for individuals, families and communities. Remittances play a signif icant role in reducing the level and severity of poverty (each social determinants of health) and contribute to the economic development in many low and middle income countries.

Such an agenda requires reliable, stable and competent nurses functioning at all levels of health care systems. The authors have provided specific recommendations for your consideration, and pres ent them within a contextual framework that acknowledges the historic and cu rrent leadership role U.S. nur sing plays in the international nursing community. That framework suggests that the Committee's recommendations will have dramatic domestic and global implications. The au thors have identified six recommendations for action: 1. Promote targeted educational investment in foreign-educated nurses in the U.S. nursing workforce. 2. Promote baccalaureate education for entry into nursing practice in the United States. 3. Harmonize nursing curricula. 4. Add global health as subject matter to undergraduate and graduate nursing curricula. 5. Establish a national system that monitors and tracks the inflow of foreign-educated nurses, their countries of orig in, the settings in which they work, and their education and licensure to ensure a proper skill mix for the U.S. nursing workforce. 6. Create an international body to coordinate and recommend nationa l and international workforce policies. Recommendation 1: Promote Targeted Educational Investment in Foreign-Educated Nurses in the U.S. Nursing Workforce One response to the global shortage of nurses is to increase the numb er of nurses produced. Scaling up the health workforce is on the globa l agenda (Vujicic et al., 2009). Likewise, the growing demand in the United States for nurses a nd the predicted nursing shortfall require that the United States increase its number of nurse s and nurse faculty (B uerhaus et al., 2009). The clear linkage between quali ty nursing education and health outcomes identifies that nursing education and continuing pr ofessional development are essential elements when tackling nursing workforce challenges for the future deliver y of care. Moreover, there is a clear linkage between quality nursing education and health ou tcomes. Since substantial numbers of foreign- educated nurses hold baccalaureate degrees, targ eted opportunities for education should be directed at encouraging them to complete masters and doctoral nursing programs as preparation for clinical and faculty leadership roles. This approach would increase the applicant pool for graduate study and enlarge faculty numbers. In addition, it would prepare foreign-educated nurses with graduate degrees to serve in faculty and leadership roles in their home countries when they return\u2014an approach used in many pr ofessions to upgrade a country's knowledge and skill base by profession. CGFNS data identify that many foreign-educated nurses have completed master's degree programs but are hi red to only work in staff nurse positions, suggesting underutilization or lack of consider ation for other nursing or faculty roles (CGFNS, 2002).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-4 Recommendation 2: Promote Baccalaureate Education for Entry into Practice in the United States Baccalaureate programs are on the rise intern ationally. In most cases, the rise of baccalaureate nursing programs represents a focused, often mandated, policy agenda\u2014without the complex history that has framed baccalau reate education in the United States. The Philippines moved to the baccalaureate for entry into the profession in the mid-1980s. Canada also requires the baccalaureate for entry for new graduates in most provinces. The United Kingdom has moved to university preparation of fi rst level nurses. Mexico and India are phasing out their non-baccalaureate nursing programs. Th e Ukraine has scaled up its nursing programs, as well, in order to enhance the profession in th e country and to increase the global marketability of its nurses. This international trend toward ma ndated baccalaureate education for entry into the profession places the United States in a less pr ogressive and less competitive position in the global nursing community. Although the Bologna Process 4 directly concerns Europe a nd its immediate neighbors, it has generated global attentio n because harmonization of nursing standards in this large geographical area will have worldwide implications (Zadalegui et al, 2006). It has heightened awareness in many countries of the need for baccalaureate education in nursing, motivating them to move toward the baccalaureate as the entry into practice credential.5 Because the requirements and competencies of the Bologna Process and the Tuning Project6 identify the need to address educational equiva lences and differences in nursing education and qualifications worldwide, careful comparisons between education systems will be necessary for the foreseeable future. For example, competencies and hours of instruction of clinical practice will need to continue to be asse ssed when countries import nurses 7. Although baccalaureate education for entry into U.S. nursing has been controversial since 1965 (ANA, 1965), the present complexity and high technology used to practice nursing in all settings requires now and in the future that nurses be grounded in scien ce and critical thinking. The rise of baccalaureate education globally, coupled with the Bologna Process, suggests that the United States must upgrade its educational standa rds for entry into the profession. The profession needs to muster the political will to make this unrealized goa l a reality\u2014not only to address quality gaps in educational prepar ation, but also to be a credible player in the future domestic and global health care labor market. 4 The Bologna Process creates the European Higher Education Area by making academic degree and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible th roughout Europe. The Bologna Process currently has 46 participating countries committed to \"Harmonizing the Arch itecture of the European Higher Education System.\" It is named after the place it was proposed, th e University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. 5 Canada, India, and the United King dom are examples of countries impl ementing baccalaureate education for nursing . 6 The \"Tuning Process\" is a methodology utilized with th e Bologna Process that establishes reference points and builds templates for learning outcomes and co mpetencies for specific academic disciplines. 7 U.S. immigration law requires that foreign-educated nu rses seeking U.S. employment must have their credentials evaluated in terms of comparability of education, En glish language proficiency, and licensure validity.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-5 Recommendation 3: Harmonize Nursing Curricula U.S. nurse educators should form strategi c partnerships to share nursing knowledge and exchange information and best practices state-to -state and regionally. Th e U.S. nursing education community should promote sustainable global k nowledge networks and the open exchange of tools that promote curricula innovation based on learning outcomes. Sustained investment in nursing education must become a national and world priority. Recommendation 4: Add Global Health as Subject Matter to Undergraduate and Graduate Nursing Curricula To better prepare nurses to work within a globalized health system, U.S. nursing programs should include courses on global health. Such courses would focus on th e characteristics of health systems world wide with course c ontent including, for example, high exposure to infectious diseases, underinvestment in health system infrastructure, deteriorating working conditions and acceleration of hea lth professional migration. This would prepare U.S. students to better deal with the migrating nurse workforce and its future demographic characteristics. Recommendation 5: Establish a National System that Monitors and Tracks the Inflow of Foreign Nurses, Their Countri es of Origin, the Settings in Which They Work, and Their Education and Licensure A comprehensive data base that collects, monitors, and tracks information about foreign- educated nurses in the U.S. workforce would play a significant role in formulating health care policy. Such a data base would assist governmental and private agencies regarding the education, skill mix, practice and immigration patterns of immigrant nurses, all necessary data to intelligently inform health planning and policy decisions. Recommendation 6: Create an Intern ational Body to Coordinate and Recommend National and International Workforce Policies Globalization has created a world market for a globalized nursing workforce. For nurses to take advantage of these opport unities, mechanisms ar e needed that compare the education and qualifications of applicants ag ainst global standards. Such an entity would acknowledge that mobility is a core element of globalization and re cognize the need for inte rnational standards of minimal competence. The United States should wo rk closely with the In ternational Council of Nurses (ICN) in pursuing this goal. The 2006 World Health Report (WHO, 2006) focused on health and human resources and identified the central role regul ators play in the protection of the public. It also acknowledged that factors such as migration are placing exis ting approaches to regul ating professionals under considerable strain. While regulat ors generally have we ll established standards and processes for initial registration, this is not usually the cas e for determining continuing competence. Ensuring the competence of health professionals remains an important regulatory i ssue that is now being framed in the broader context of promoting patient safety and advancing the quality of health care services. Ensuring the competency of hea lth professionals entering the United States remains an important priority\u2014as it is for other countries.

This new standard must, at a minimum, measur e the aptitude, knowledge and skills of nurses around the world and predict their ability to succeed in patient care in global health care environments. The challenge is to incorporat e into workforce planning, the development of appropriate quality assurance processes and mech anisms that encompass foreign providers and educational programs in such a way as to ensure predictability and competence in the workforce (Aiken et al., 2004; Kingma, 2006; Little and Buchan, 2007). OVERVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL NURS ING EDUCATION AND REGULATION Key Issues and Challenges in Nursing Education Although nurses share a common professional hi story, internationally their educational preparation, regulation, and pract ice patterns are highly diverse and vary considerably in complexity and scope. There are differences in credentialing requirements that include professional licensure, use of titles, and accreditation of educationa l programs (ICN, 2003). Because of these world-wide differences, the ski ll mix of the nursing workforce also is diverse. Thus, the globalization of the nursing workforce mu st be viewed not only within the context of the health status of nations, government inve stment in health budgets, nurse/health care migration, economic realities, and working conditi ons but also within the context of the diverse preparation and practice of its practitioners. Achieving global standards for the educati on of nurses is a vision of many nursing professionals, and has been promoted by the In ternational Council of Nurses (ICN) for over a century. However, achieving that goal remains unr ealized and is complicated by the variations in nursing education throughout the world. Many countri es specify university-lev el education as the minimum entry requirement for nursing\u2014but th e idea of university education for nursing remains challenging, with disparities being co mmon in the programs currently offered in different parts of the world. Compounding the issue is the number of countries that still consider initial nursing education at the secondary school level to be adequate. Educational programs also vary in type, number, size, and degrees offered. For example, all nurses from the Philippines complete a bacca laureate degree. Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and Spain also have single pr ograms for qualifying as a nurse. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, nurses receive either a nursing diploma or a degree. In the United States there are three educational pathways to become a register ed nurse: a 2-year asso ciate degree, a 3-year diploma program, or a baccalaureate degree. Also in the United States the model of nurse- midwife is common, for other coun tries midwifery is considered a profession separate from nursing. In short, universal nursing educa tion standards have not been achieved. Entry-level professional nursing programs are designated as diploma, associate degree or baccalaureate. Diploma programs are the most prevalent, worldwide, with baccalaureate programs on the rise. However, many countries are experiencing faculty shortages, which substantially impacts the number of nurse graduates from all programs. For instance, schools in Vietnam and Eastern Europe still operate under the practice of physic ians serving as the majority of nursing faculty. Other countri es, such as those in the Middle East, do not have the infrastructure to support higher ed ucation and nurses must travel abroad to be educated as faculty. In many countries shorta ges of nursing faculty relate to cultural, social and economic norms about the education, status and role of wo men. In many instances most patient care jobs PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-7 are held by female nurses while administrative and faculty jobs are he ld by male nurses or doctors. The shortage of experi enced nursing faculty, worldwide, adds to the challenge of establishing and maintaining stan dards (Blythe and Baumann, 2008). Action by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2001 included the development of global standards for the initia l education of nurses. This was followed in 2006 by the World Health Organization (WHO) Task Force on Global Standards in Nursing and Midwifery Education and in 2009 by the WHO publication , Human Resource for Health: Global Standards for the Initial Education of Professional Nurses and Midwives. The WHO goal of global standards is to establish educational criteria and ensure outcomes that (1) are based on evidence and competency; (2) promote the progressive natu re of education and lifelong learning; and (3) ensure the employment of practitioners who are competen t and who, by providing quality care, promote positive health outcomes in the populations they serve (WHO, 2009). Many source and recipient countries have established educational programs to ease the transition of migrant nurses. For example, colle ges and universities in Canada have created courses to respond to knowledge deficiencies. Canada also has created prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) initia tives that provide practical validation of immigrant nurse competencies in lieu of and/or in conjunction with course work (Hendrickson and Nordstrom, 2007). Because there can be language and cultural adaptation issues, countries like the United Kingdom require foreign nurses to undergo orientat ion to the local culture of health care upon their arrival in the Unit ed Kingdom (Kingma, 2006). Blythe and Bauman (2008) state, \"While international and national nursing bodies are focusing on international standards for nurses, more inclusive movements for educational harmonization that involve nationa l governments are underway. One of the most significant is the Bologna Process.\" The purpose of the Bologna Process is to make academic degree standards and quality assurance standards comp arable and compatible throughout Europe. The process extends beyond the EU to include some 46 countries. Global standards continue to be a goal of the fu ture. In the meantime, countries must work to ensure an adequate source of h ealth professionals to provide care for current and future patient needs. Ideally, global standards wi ll be guidelines that serve as benchmarks for the profession. The commitment of the United States to pursue th is goal would have a significant impact on its realization. Key Issues and Challenges in Nursing Regulation Regulatory Structure In addition to differences in education, the nursi ng profession varies by country in how it is regulated. Many countries have had statutory nursing regulation for years, regulation that ensures a safe and competent nursing workforce. Howeve r, there are still countries with no nursing regulation, rules, or other regulatory mechanisms that emanate from the government. In still other countries there is provision for nursing regulation, either in st atute or in other systems of rules, however, for various reasons no mechanisms exist that establish a legal framework for nursing as an autonomous regulated profession (ICN, 2009a). Some examples of regulatory systems include: A single regulatory authority, such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in the United Kingdom.

Regions acting as autonomous units with th e government setting standards for only some of the jurisdictions, for example, Spain (ICN, 2009a). Therefore, as nurse migration accelerates, it should be recognized that the standards, competencies and qualifications required to practice as a nurse vary globally. Licensure All countries do not license nurse s. Some countries require nurs es to pass an examination after completion of their nursing ed ucation before they can practice. Nurses in the Philippines, Australia, Thailand, Japan, Singapore, the Camer oons, Korea, and Poland take a licensing exam that provides national licensur e and registration as a first level (registered) nurse. Other countries, such as Nepal and Mexico, do not re quire a post-graduation examination. The nursing schools administer an exit or qu alifying examination and upon passa ge, the student is granted a diploma. The diploma allows the graduate to practice as a nurse. While some countries provide national licensu re, still others license nurses by province or state. Countries such as India only allow nurses to be licensed in one state at a time. In Canada, nurses are licensed by the individual provinces. E ach province has its own educational structure and regulatory authority; however, nurses license d in one province can achieve licensure by endorsement in another province. In the United States nursing licensure is at the state rather than the national level. The United States does not offer a single nursing license that is recognized and valid in all states and territories within the Unit ed States. Instead, each st ate controls the practice of nursing within its borders. The nurse must be licensed in the state in which he/she is employed. The United States does offer the mutual r ecognition model of nur se licensure, which allows a nurse to hold a license in his or her state of residency and to practice in other states, subject to each state's practice law and re gulation. Under mutual recognition, a nurse may practice across state lines unless ot herwise restricted (NCSBN, 2009). As part of emerging practices around increa sed migration, some countries test nurses' competencies before they leave their country of origin. For example, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing administers the U.S. Nurse Licensure Examinations (NCLEX-RN\u00ae and NCLEX-PN\u00ae) in major cities around the world to test the competencies of nurses who desire to migrate to the United States to work. Pass rates of foreign-educated nurses on the NCLEX-RN examination are generally in the 48 52 percent range but vary by country of education and experience with multip le-choice testing. A number of U.S. states requi re that foreign-educated nur ses take the CGFNS Qualifying Exam\u00ae as a prerequisite for licensure. Annual CGFN S Validity Studies over the last 5 years indicate that foreign-educated nurses who pass the CGFNS Qualifying Exam on the first attempt have an 88 92 percent chance of passing the NCLEX-R N examination on the first attempt, which is comparable to, and in some cases high er than, the pass rates of U.S. graduates taking the NCLEX for the first time. Table J-1 de picts the 2007 NCLEX pass rates of U.S. and internationally educated nurses as well as nurses educated in the c ountries that are historical and emerging suppliers of registered nurses to the U. S. workforce. Statistics for foreign educated nurses who sat for the NCLEX-PN examination al so are provided because many registered nurses who are unable to pass the RN examinati on go on to take the PN licensure examination.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emir ates give licensure examinations in the Philippines and India for potential immigrants to their countries. St ill other countries ensure a supply of foreign-educated nurses by establishing agreements with governments, where nurses are comparably educated to supply quotas of nurses for defined periods (Kingma, 2006). Both the United Kingdom and Japan have such arrangements with the Philippines. Registration Registration of nurses is an administrative process that allows the government agency responsible for health and safety to track and monitor health care professionals. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, registration is the recognition by the professional regulation body that the nurse has completed all educational require ments to practice as a nurse. In countries in which licensure by examination is required, registration by the regulatory body documents that the nurse has passed the examinati on and met all requirements to be listed on the registry. Registration requi res an initial fee, and in most count ries, periodic payment of fees to maintain that registration. Graduates of nursing programs in such countries as Peru, Colu mbia, the Dominican Republic, the Ukraine, Armenia, Russia, and othe r Eastern European countries are not required to hold licenses. The graduate nurse's diploma se rves as the permit to practice the profession of nursing. The nurse's professional standing is mainta ined by the school of nursing, the Ministry of Health, or the profe ssional association. With the trend of increasing globalization and mobility of the nursing workforce, regulators are under increasing pressure to d eal with the myriad number of nurses who wish to move from their country of origin to work in new jurisdic tions. Because regulations vary considerably in complexity and scope, not all countries or jurisd ictions are able to abso rb these mobile nurses into their workforce. In general, countries that receive significant numbe rs of foreign-educated nurses employ a variety of regulatory approaches to ensure that migrating nurses are prepared to PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, in the United States foreign-educated nurses must meet federal requirements for obtaining an occupational visa and then state requirements for licensure before they can be employed as a nurse. Nursing Titles Titles are used to inform the public of the scope of practice and the professional identity of a health care worker. Titles may di ffer by country. The nurse's role and responsibilities also may differ by country, although the titles may be the same. Commonly, there are four categories of titles: first level or registered nurse; second le vel or practical nurse; specialty-midwife; and non- professional level. In the United Kingdom and its former colonies, as well as in South Africa, the registered or first level nurse may have a diploma or baccalaureate in nursing. The enrolled nurse is considered a second level nurse, has 1 2 years of education, and reports to a registered nurse or doctor. In some countries, midwives and nurses whose initial education was in a specialty, such as entry-level psychiatric nurses, are only licensed to practice their specialty. Some countries have community health nurses who are neither re gistered nor enrolled. Table J-2 presents the education and title variations in select countries. These countries repres ent diversity geographically, culturally and deve lopmentally. They also are count ries from which we expect increasing numbers of nurses who are interested in migration.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-11 INTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING All countries, including the Unite d States, require that professionals who enter the country to work meet certain educational and/or licensure requirements. Those seeking to practice nursing are no exception. Although there are no universal standards of education, the nursing profession, through international health care and nursing bod ies and catalyzed by the International Council of Nurses (ICN), has established baseline sta ndards for entry into nursing education programs. These standards posit that professional nursing is an entry level profession whose education begins upon completion of secondary school (high school). Vocational or second level nursing education is conducted either before or after second ary school or is a program that is part of the secondary school curriculum. In most instances, entry into higher education requires completion of secondary education. Initial e ducation is the first program of education required to qualify as a professional nurse. First Level Nurses ICN has established guidelines and advocates for educational standards fo r first level, general nurses. The ICN Guidelines for National Nurses Associat ions on Development of Standards for Nursing Education and Practice and Competencies for the Generalist Nurse are used by countries as a benchmark to set their curri cula and to measure their comparability to recommended standards. ICN has described the sc ope of preparation and practice to enable the generalist nurse to have the capacity and author ity to competently practice primary, secondary and tertiary health care in all se ttings and branches of nursing. Completion of a country's initial nursing education identifies one as a registered nurse (RN, licensed nurse, professional, or qualified nurse). An RN is defined as one who (a) has successfully completed a program of education approved by the nursing bo ard/council, (b) has passed the examination established by the nursing board/council (if appropriate), and (c) continues to meet the standards of the nursing board (ICN, 2003). Second Level Nurses The defining factors differentiating professi onal nursing from vocational/practical nursing are the educational requirements for admission to the nursing program, the educational program requirements, the curriculum, and the standards and scope of practice for the discipline. Often, nurses who are considered as firs t level in some countries (i.e., Germany, former Yugoslavia, Taiwan and Mexico) do not meet the criteria for such a designation in the United States. In the United States and many other countries a student pursuing education as a professional nurse must have completed secondary school (high school). This means that the student has completed 1112 years of elementary (primary), middle an d secondary school. Candidates for vocational nursing programs in other countries may enter those education programs after completing only 89 years of elementary/primary or middle school . In some instances, the nursing program is combined with secondary education. The Unite d States meets and exceeds the ICN Guidelines for admission to nursing programs; however, nurse s migrating to the United States present a variety of educational backgrounds.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-12 Vocational Nursing Programs Vocational programs consist of theoretical courses in science and nursing competencies along with clinical experience. The length of the program varies from 12 to 18 months. Vocational education has a greater concentrati on on clinical experien ce than professional nursing. It does not incorporate the social sciences, research, management and autonomy of practice that professional nursing programs include. Not all countries recognize vocational nursing or have a licensure or re gistration process for such graduates. Ironically, some countries that have labeled their nurses as first level have educational programs that are quantified by the Un ited States and other countries as second level (vocational) because they do not occur post-seconda ry or their curriculum is not comparable to that of a first level nurse. When graduates of these programs immi grate to other countries, such as the United States, they are deemed to be practical or vocational nurses. This has been a frequent occurrence for nurses educated in Mexico, Eastern Eu rope and Taiwan. Professional Nursing Programs Professional nursing education programs are c onducted at the post-secondary level. The students' nursing education is conducted after the 11t h or 12th grade. Nursing courses are separate from the secondary or high school curriculum, which is documented by a diploma, certificate or examination. Use of these three te rms varies depending on the country of education and language. Associate degree (AD) nursing programs are c onducted at the community college level. The AD nurse is primarily a wester n phenomenon, with very few AD programs located outside the United States. Korea has an associate degree progra m that is 3 years in length. China uses the title \"associate degree\" for programs that would be considered diploma programs elsewhere. Several AD programs have begun in the Philippines; however, like practical nursing programs, they have not been accredited by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) or approved by the Professional Regulation Commi ssion (PRC). A number of the AD programs in the Philippines have sought affiliations or partnerships with U.S. community colleges or accredited AD programs to ensure recognition of their nurse graduates. One such program started in 2009 as a partnership with Fres no City College in California. After completing a year of study in the Philippines, the nurs e attends Fresno's AD program and earns a dual diploma. Prior to 2000 most nursing programs in Mexico we re considered to be comparable to second level U.S. programs. Since then, the nursing prof ession and academic and health officials in Mexico have worked to scale up nursing educat ion and the nursing workforce in that country. The ultimate goal is baccalaureate prepared nurses. However, many of its existing nursing programs are 2 3 years plus one year of community serv ice. Those programs are seeking to be recognized as comparable to the U.S. associate degree. Professional nursing programs ma y differ in the theoretical and clinical courses that are taught. In certain provinces in India male nursing students are not permitted to provide maternal/infant care (obstetrics). This effectively is a barrier to migration as obstetrics is considered a cornerstone of basic nursing educat ion, and a receiving country such as the United States would find the education deficient. The male would have to return to school to acquire the requisite education to be eligible to be licensed as a nurse in the United States. Certain countries in the Middle East have prohibited women from attending nursing school, so their graduates are PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-13 men. The result is that a significant number of male nurses from those countries have migrated to the United States. Recently, women-only nursing schools have been started in Jordan. Community/Military Service In a number of countries, service requirements must be met before a nurse's education is considered complete and a license is granted. Such program requirements are considered as a citizenship responsibility. In some countries, th at service is payback fo r the student's public funding of education. Nurses in Mexico must comp lete a 1-year community service before they are granted licensure. Other countries, such as E gypt, Eritrea, and Israel, may require a period of military service before the nurse's education is deemed complete. The nurse will not be registered until service requirements are fulfilled. Alternate Educational Pathways Historically, the United Kingdom and its former colonies (e.g., Nigeria) allowed alternative education paths for those wanting to be nurses. A student could enroll in a generalist program, either diploma or university based, and upon completion of the program be eligible to provide general nursing care to patients ac ross the continuum of life. A second alternative was the specialist path, th rough which the student chose to be educated as a psychiatric or pediatric nurse or a midwif e. Students received li ttle or no education in general nursing or in the areas outside their chosen specialty. Upon graduation, the student was licensed and registered as a specialist. If the student desired to be a generali st (first level) nurse, additional education and licensure were required. In some count ries these alternative programs are on the decline, in part as a response to the ICN Guidelines and the expectations of the global nursing community. It should be noted that in the United States speci alization in nursing is at the graduate level rather than at entry level programs. Some countries have combined nursing specialist programs w ith general nursing. In addition to the specialist courses in pediat ric, psychiatric/mental health or community health nursing or midwifery, the student is required to take general nursing courses in addition to, and concomitantly with, their specialty courses. Graduates of the pr ogram can practice as general, first level nurses and/or as specialists. Severa l nursing schools in Germany have combined their pediatric nursing specialist progr am with general nursing. Gradua tes meet the requirements to practice as first level nurses as well as pediat ric nurses. The Ukraine has established midwifery programs that incorporate general nursing courses in medical, surg ical, pediatric and psychiatric nursing. Graduates are midwives but are not limited to just providi ng care to pregnant women. Physician to Registered Nurse Programs The worldwide nursing shortage, demand for firs t level nurses, and recruitment of foreign- educated nurses have spawned a recent phenom enon\u2014physician to registered nurse programs. In some countries many physicians are unemployed or underemployed and may work alternatively as nurses. One such country is Kazakhstan. A graduate of a medical colleg e in that country who is granted the qualification of obstetrician will al so be allowed to be employed as a Registered Nurse of General Practice. Physicians who want to find employment overseas often discover that their medical education does not meet the criteria for medical practice in the country of intended migration.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-14 For this reason many physicians have sought to be recognized or licensed as nurses in countries experiencing nursing shortages. Although physicia ns and nurses may take the same science courses and have similar clinical exposure, medicine and nursing are distinct disciplines with different orientations and cultures. In most countries, including the United States, the physician cannot become a nurse de-facto as desired wit hout supplemental educat ion. The distinct and different regulatory expectations of the two disciplines in the United States increase this complexity. Typically, the physician will need 12 to 18 mont hs to complete nursing science and clinical courses. In the United States these programs are modeled after the accelera ted RN to BSN tract. Other models are specific to physicians. Physicia n-to-RN programs tend to be located in states with large, recent-immigrant popu lations. Immigrant physicians who have not met the criteria to practice medicine in the United States have been viewed as excellent candidates for accelerated nursing programs, which increases nursi ng numbers and diversity representation. St. Petersburg University in Russia has a specific Physician-to-RN program that is marketed internationally as a way to facilitate migrati on and with the promise of economic security. The courses are taught in English. In the Philippi nes a large number of nursing schools now offer nursing programs for physicians with the physicia n being given transfer credit for previous education. The Philippines has significant unem ployment of nurses which suggests that the incentive for these programs is migration. Mexican physicians have been attracted to Physician-to-RN nursing programs developed by U.S. recruiters affiliated with hospitals in Southwest Border States. Health care professionals who are bilingual and have cultural competency skills are aggressively recruited by employers where there are significant Spanish speaking pop ulations. Reportedly, there is underemployment of physicians in Mexico\u2014and nursing offers ec onomic security and migration opportunities. Because Mexico is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), visa quotas do not limit nurses and this provides an added in centive for physicians to pursue the nursing profession. Two Physician-to-RN programs that have been successful in the United States are conducted by Lehman College in New York, part of the St ate University of New York (SUNY) system, and Florida International University, in Miami, Flor ida. Programs such as these demonstrate unique responses to the global nursing shortage. Because these programs are a new phenomenon, there has been no measurement to date of the integratio n of these graduates into the culture of nursing in the United States. MIGRATION AND THE GLOBAL NURSING WORKFORCE Globalization of Nursing Migration is the movement of people across bo rders, usually for the purpose of acquiring a new residence and employment. It can occur with in countries (internal) or across national borders (external)\u2014through daily commuting, seasonal relocation, pa rticularly from colder to warmer climates, rural/urban shifts, and internat ionally (Davis and Richardson, 2009). The annual flow of international migr ation has continued to increase over the past decades\u2014to the point that in the early 21s t century it is estimated that 1 out of every 35 individuals worldwide is an international migr ant (Kingma, 2006). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-15 U.S. immigration policy is shaped by both poli tical factors and the c oncerns of the health care community. It has evolved over time to resp ond to the country's need not only for various labor skills but also for health care delivery. Foreign-educated nur ses have been a part of the U.S. workforce since World War II.8 However, their recruitment has ebbed and waned as the health care system has been challenged by demo graphic, economic and workforce changes, as well as changing immigration laws (Nichols et al., 2009). Thus, the flow of foreign-educated nurses into the U.S. workforce is unpredicta ble and shaped by multiple, dynamic international and national forces. The absence of a national system to monitor inflow patterns further complicates the understanding of the impact of foreign-educated nurses on the U.S. health care workforce. Cumulative CGFNS data from 1978 to 2000 indicat e that the majority of foreign-educated nurses seeking to migrate to the United States we re educated in the Philippines (73%), followed by the United Kingdom (4%), India (3%), Nigeria (3%), and Ireland (3%). That profile has now changed. Although nurses educated in the Philippi nes continued to be in the majority in 2008, their overall percentage declined from 73 percent to 59 percent\u2014 while the percentage of nurses educated in India increased fr om 3 percent to 19 percent. Canada (5%) and the Republic of Korea (3%) are now among the top countries of education of nurses seeking an occupational visa, while the number of nurses coming from the United Kingdom and Ireland has declined (Nichols et al., 2009). Factors Affecting Migration Nurses and other allied health professiona ls have many reasons for migrating\u2014reasons usually identified as push factors (reasons for leaving their own country) and pull factors (reasons for choosing a host country). Push factors may include such things as poor wages and working conditions, poverty, civil war, little oppor tunity for advancement, and other factors that make living and working in a country difficult. Pull factors are those th at make a host country desirable and include such thi ngs as better living conditions, hi gher wages, greater professional opportunities, and better work enviro nments (Davis and Richardson, 2009). In a CGFNS survey (2007), foreign-educated nu rses in the United States most frequently cited poor wages and few jobs (due to the nu rsing shortage, underut ilization of nurses and maldistribution of nurses) as the primary reasons for leaving their home countries (push factors). The United States was identified as the destinati on country of choice because of such pull factors as better wages and working conditions, an im proved way of life, and greater opportunity for advancement. Many of the nurses had friends and family members living in the United States, another pull factor. The world is seeing a sharp increase in the number of highly skilled workers moving across international borders (Kingma, 2006). Health care professionals, including nurses, make up a significant portion of that increas e. Workforce planning is essent ial if the global migration of nurses is to be addressed effectively. Such workforce planning, however, requires not only data on the number of nurses entering a country, but also on the number of nurses leaving the country, the number of new nurse graduates, and the effect of internal migration, su ch as the movement of nurses from state to state and from rural to urban areas (Buchin and Sochalski, 2004). 8 In 1977 the United States Departments of State, Labo r, Health Education and Welfare, and the Immigration Service mandated that CGFNS be created to assess the ed ucation and licensure credentials of foreign-educated nurses seeking employment in the United States.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-16 The 2004 National Sample Survey of Register ed Nurses (BHP, 2004) indicated that the number of RNs who received their education outs ide of the United States increased by about 1.3 percent between 2000 and 2004. Nearly 90 percen t (89,860) of foreign-educated RNs were employed in nursing, with the majority concentrated in a handful of states in 2004. Almost 70 percent of foreign-educated RNs worked in six states: California (28.6%), Florida (10.7%), New York (10.4%), Texas (7.5%), New Jersey (6 .9%), and Illinois (5.6%). The survey also found that foreign-educated RN s (64.7%) are more likely than the U.S. registered nurse population overall (56.2%) to be em ployed in hospitals and more likely to be staff nurses (72.6 versus 59.1 percent of em ployed RNs overall). CGFNS International (2002) conduc ted a survey of foreign-edu cated nurses to generate baseline data that might better guide policy and inform both the pr ofession and the public about the trends in nurse migration to the United States. The findings from this study are summarized below and place the nurse immigrating to the Un ited States within the larger framework of global migration. Results were based on a sample of 789 foreign-educated nurses (461 U.S. registered and 328 non-U.S. registered) through a 76-question telephone in terview. The survey revealed pertinent data on the immigration, e ducation, licensure, and em ployment characteristics of foreign-educated nurses in th e United States and provides one of the few such data bases in the United States. Foreign-Educated Nurses in the U.S. Workforce Registered nurses entering the United States fo r purposes of employment tend to be female, younger than their U.S. counterparts, and educated in either diploma or baccalaureate programs in their home countries. They are generally license d in their home countries and have worked for a number of years before migrating to the United States (CGFNS, 2002). Nearly two thirds of those who responded to the survey worked for some time as nurses in their home countries and most continued to hold a current foreign nursing license after entering the United States. Work experience ranged from a low of 1 to 5 years to a high of 16 years and longer\u2014but did not figure into job placemen t or promotion in the United States. The overwhelming majority worked as staff nurse s in a hospital setting in the United States, with the most common specialty areas being adult health and critical care. Seventy percent of the employed registered nurses worked in hospital se ttings, and 15 percent worked in nursing homes or extended care facilities. Less than 5 percent worked in commun ity health despite the emphasis on that area in many nursing programs internationally. This may be due to the fact that community health nursing in the United Stat es requires that the nurse function more independently than in a hospital setting; have an in-dep th understanding of the U.S. health care system; have the communication skills necessary to bridge diverse populations; and be well acclimated to U.S. nursing practice. Since it takes foreign-educated nurses approximately 12 months to become fully acclimated, most tend to work in hospital and long term care facilities. Eighty-one percent of the employed registered nurse respondents reported feeling moderately or extremely satisfied with their jobs as regist ered nurses, with most reporting that their nursing experience in the United States had met their ex pectations. The overwhelming majority indicated that it was certain or likely that they would be employed in nursi ng 5 years from the date of the survey. Since graduating from their basic nursing education programs, 188 of the 789 survey participants, or 24 percent, had gone on to complete a formal academic program\u2014161 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-17 completing a program in nursing. Forty percent of the 188 respondents obta ined a baccalaureate degree, 26 percent an associate degree , and 13 percent a master's degree. Most of the participants spoke at least one language in addition to English. Overall, 15 percent reported using a non-English language on the job, with Spanish being the most common. The majority indicated that they had experienced no difficulty speaking or understanding English in their work setting. Of those who did experience difficulty, telephone situations presented the greatest challenge. Almost two thirds of those who noted difficulty in speaking or understanding English had taken st eps to improve their language proficiency. Transitioning to the United States workforce pr esented numerous challenges for respondents, particularly related to immigra tion, licensure and entry into pr actice. Information on the U.S. health care system and on nursing in the United States, facilitation of the immigration process, and an in-depth, culturally sensitive orientat ion were methods suggested by respondents for easing their transition. Comparison to the 2000 National Samp le Survey of Registered Nurses Overall foreign-educated nurses in the CGFN S sample were approximately 10 years younger than participants in the 2000 National Sample Survey. A higher percentage of U.S. licensed foreign nurse graduates were educated in diploma (43.4%) and baccalaureate programs (38.8%) than in the NSSRN, in which 29.6 percent of re gistered nurses were educated at the diploma level and 29.3 percent in baccalaureate program s. Although associate degree programs are not common internationally, 12.6 percen t of respondents in the CGFNS survey did indicate that they completed a two-year nursing program. This is far less than the 40.3 pe rcent of nurses in the NSSRN. Foreign nurse graduates were more likel y to hold a baccalaureate degree as their basic nursing preparation than th eir U.S. counterparts. Registered nurse participants in the CGFNS survey tended to have a higher employment rate overall (87.5%) compared to participants in the National Sample Survey (81.7%). A greater percentage of foreign nurse graduates worked full time as registered nurses as compared to the NSSRN, while the rate of part -time employment was higher among participants in the NSSRN. The most common work setting for nurses in both samples was the hospital. A greater percentage of foreign-educated nurses worked in long term care settings co mpared to nurses in the National Sample Survey. Interestingly, fewer foreign-e ducated nurses reported working in a community health setting in the United States than respondent s in the NSSRN, despite the fact that much of nursing practice internationally tends to be in the community. Participants in the CGFNS survey (30%) were more likely to complete additional academic nursing or nursing-related preparation following th eir basic nursing educa tion than participants in the NSSRN (18.6%). As in the NSSRN, the hi ghest level of academic preparation most often achieved by foreign nurse graduates was the b accalaureate degree. Wh en these data were categorized by ethnic/raci al group, those who identified themselv es as Asians and Hispanics in the CGFNS survey were more likely to hold a baccalaureate degree than those who identified themselves as Black/African and Caucasian. In the NSSRN, Asians and Black/African Americans were more likely than Hispanics and white (non-Hispanics) to hold a bachelor's degree (CGFNS, 2002). There are no data documenting the number of U.S. born nurses who attend nursing schools outside the United States. CGFNS is aware of nurses who were educated in countries such as Germany because their parents were military or government employees. Those nurses are treated as foreign-educated nurses who were born outside the United States and must go through an PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A positive bonus is that they are English proficient and often multilingual. A recent phenomenon is the establishment of off s hore schools, such as St. Kitts International School of Nursing, which are recruiting U.S. student s who have not been able to enroll in U.S. nursing programs because of the shortage of faculty and seats. Reportedly, there are Filipino students who are U.S. born or permanent resident s who are returning to their parents' country where there are an abundance of nur sing schools to enroll in a nursi ng program with the intent of returning to the United States to be licensed and to practice. Enrollment data also show that there are significant numbers of nursing students who ar e immigrants enrolled in U.S. nursing schools. This is especially reflected in schools that have a high number of international students. Howard University's nursing school reportedly has had en rollments of over 50% of its students who were immigrants. Transition to U.S. Practice In an effort to augment descriptive data about foreign-educated nurses in the United States, CGFNS International investigated challenges th e nurses confront in th eir transition to U.S. practice by surveying members of the Ameri can Organization of Nurse Executives who employed foreign-educated nurses. The study's outc omes indicated that employers recognize the need to address the transition issues of foreign-educated nurses. Precepting, clinical assessment, and a more extensive orientation were the most common measures put in place by nurse executives working in hospitals that employe d foreign-educated nurses. Precepting was the measure identified by nurse executives as the most critical to a successful transition (Davis and Kritek, 2005). Additional services provided to aid in th e transition were English language classes, temporary housing assistance, classes on medical slang and idioms, and assertiveness training. Cultural workshops for staff, orientation to the U. S. health care system, and cultural and regional socialization activities, such as welcome and support groups, also were cited as measures introduced to facilitate transition to practi ce (Davis and Kritek, 2005) . Many nurse executives indicated that personal interaction with the nurse prior to coming to work in the hospital helped to make the foreign-educated nurse more co mfortable in the new surroundings. Personal interaction included formal \"buddy\" and pen pal programs through which staff corresponded with foreign-educated nurses prior to their arrival. The cost of orienting a foreign educated nurse is generally comparable to that of a new graduate but is influenced by a number of factors: the similarity of the health care system in the nurse's home country to that of the United States; the similarity of the nurse's scope of practice to that of U.S. nurses; the nurse's command of the English language; th e amount of clinical experience the nurse had prior to entering pract ice in the United States; and the amount of orientation to the United States a nd its health care system by the recruiting firm, if one is used.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-19 Challenges During Transition to Practice Although most foreign-educated nurses look forw ard to working in the United States, their adjustment to practice can be affected by several factors, such as the health care system of the nurse's home country, language competence, knowledge of medications a nd their administration, and familiarity with technology (Edwards and Davis, 2006). Variations in Health Care Systems: The more similar a nurse's health care system is to that of the United States, the easier the transi tion and the more comfortable the nurse is in the clinical setting, focusing more on specific practice needs than on the transition process itself. Foreign nurse graduates cons ider receiving information about the U.S. health care system as the most necessary component of clinical orientation. Because health care systems vary greatly from country to country, they believe it is essential to have an understanding of how the U.S. syst em works in order to function competently within that system. Orientation to the health care system should include a description of the health team, its members, and their roles. Information on how the system is accessed by patients and the nurse's role in management of care also should be included. Although nurses educated outside the country will not come to understand the system thoroughly until they work within it, preliminary knowledge he lps to make the transition to U.S. practice less stressful (Davis and Kritek, 2005). Language Competency: Nurses for whom English is a second language have repeatedly indicated to CGFNS that per ception of their nursing compet ence by patients and health care personnel is tied to their ability to speak English as a native English speaker. Employers cite language competence as the mo st critical skill th at foreign-educated nurses need during their first year of pract ice in the United States (Davis and Kritek, 2005). Knowledge of Medications and Pharmacology: Western medicine relies heavily on drugs to treat patient illness, many of whic h are not used in other countries. Some of these medications are available internationally but have different trade names, while others are not yet known internationally, maki ng it difficult for the nurse entering U.S. nursing practice. Medication ad ministration can be intimida ting, mainly because of the volume of medications given on a daily basi s in the United States and the various medication routes. Most of the errors made by foreign-educated nurses in their first year of practice are related to medication administration (Davis and Kritek, 2005). Proficiency in Technology: The U.S. health care system relies heavily on technology for diagnostic, preventive, and palliative care\u2014 much more so than other countries around the world. Because foreign-educated nurses tend to work in adult health and critical care units in hospitals, they are c onfronted with technology on a da ily basis as they transition to U.S. practice. However, foreign-edu cated nurses participating in a joint CGFNS/Excelsior College study on their perc eption of readiness for practice in the United States indicated that technology was one of the areas in which they felt least prepared (Edwards and Davis, 2006).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-20 Acculturation to the United States Acculturation\u2014the process of adapting or learning to take on the behaviors and attitudes of another group or culture\u2014is an essential as pect of working in a host country. For nurses transitioning to practice in the United States, it generally takes 4 to 6 months to become fully productive and 12 months to feel fully acclimated to the new setting (Adeniran et al., 2005). Acculturation can be divided into four phases: acquaintance, indignation, conflict resolution, and integration. Familiarity with the process of acculturation helps foreign-educated nurses know what to expect within their firs t year of practice in a new cultur e and new work environment. It also helps employers to plan an orientation that a ddresses the foreign nurse graduate's needs when entering practice in a host country. The acquaintance phase of acculturation occurs from entry in to the culture to 3 months post arrival. It is the stage of init ial contact, during which time ther e is excitement about the new life and new place of employment. This is the time that foreign-educat ed nurses become oriented not just to the practice environment but also to the comm unity\u2014the time during which they begin to develop a supportive social netw ork of both colleagues and frie nds (Adeniran et al., 2005). The indignation phase occurs 3 to 6 months after arrivi ng in a host country. The feelings of excitement about the new position and the new e nvironment give way to feelings of anxiety, which can lead to a sense of isolation and ps ychological discomfort. Understanding the U.S. health care system and their role in it, and determ ining what is expected of them and how quickly it is expected, can become overwhelming for foreign- educated nurses. It is during this time that a preceptor is critical. The support that preceptors provide is invaluable because they have knowledge of the system and contacts within and outside of the system. This also is the time that the foreign-educated nurse needs to rely on fam ily, friends and colleagues for support, especially those who have been through a similar experience (Adeniran et al., 2005). Now also is the time for foreign-educated nurses to seek out regional support groups designed to help immigrants adap t to their new life. Such support groups are generally comprised of individuals with the same ethnic background who have been through the same immigration and transition processes and are willing to share their experiences with those who are new to this country (Nichols, et al., 2009). The conflict resolution phase generally occurs 6 to 9 months after arrival in a host country. This is the time when foreign-educated nurses need to clarify their new roles, gain insight into problem solving, and make personal and profe ssional decisions about their new workplace and community. During this phase they may feel that they are a part of two cultures\u2014their native culture and its work values and the culture of the U.S. health care system and U.S. nursing (Adeniran et al., 2005). It is in this phase that preceptors and colleagues should help foreign-educated nurses determine what values and beliefs are essential to them. What values and knowledge from their own culture make them comfortable as a nurse in the United States? Which of the values of the new culture and the new workplace can they inco rporate into their prac tice as a nurse? What aspects of nursing practice in the United Stat es do they find difficult to adopt\u2014and why? Exploring these issues with a preceptor, or someone familiar with the process of adapting to a new culture and work environment, will be invaluab le to the adjustment of the foreign-educated nurse (Nichols et al., 2009). The integration phase of acculturation occurs 9 to 12 mont hs after arrival. Foreign-educated nurses now experience renewed enthusiasm fo r their work and their new country, have reconciled the differences between their native culture and their host culture, and are confident in PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-21 their ability to practice as a nurse in the new cu lture. It is a time when foreign-educated nurses know they made the right decision to migrate\u2014a time when they will have a sense of belonging to the new culture and, most importantly, a sense of the skills and knowledge that they bring to the profession (Nichols et al., 2009). Because ac culturation can take up to a year, preceptors should be available to foreign-educated nurses during that entire time. Foreign-Educated Nurses and Safe Practice Foreign-educated nurses genera lly demonstrate safe practice within 6 months of entering practice. Employers report that there are few, if any, differences in practice after that time. Most errors made by foreign-educated nurses occur duri ng the first 6 months of practice. They usually are errors in medication administration, and te nd to occur after pr eceptorship has been concluded. Nurse executives report that the error ra te of foreign-educated nurses is comparable to that of new U.S. graduates. Overall, the experiences of hiring foreign nurse graduates are viewed as positive\u2014mainly due to the characte ristics of the nurses themselves (Davis and Kritek, 2005). Summary During the last ten years CGFNS International ha s conducted studies in an effort to provide data that may assist the U.S. health care commun ity with integrating the foreign-educated nurse into the health care delivery system. These stud ies provide a glimpse of the overriding concerns and issues that have particular impact on recruitment and utili zation best practices. The findings, however, are best understood within the context of the diverse e ducation and licensure systems of foreign-educated nurses, since this diversity has significant imp act on the skill mix of the U.S. nursing workforce. The following sections of the paper provide an overview of the education (entry level) and regulatory systems in two groups of countries: th ose that traditionally have provided registered nurses to the U.S. nursing workforce and those countries that are emerging as sources of migrating nurses. Summary tables are provided to better make comparisons among the supplier countries. HISTORIC SUPPLIERS OF REGISTERED NURSES TO THE U.S. WORKFORCE Nurses entering the United States for purpos es of employment must undergo a federal screening program as part of the visa process to ensure that thei r credentials are valid, that their education and licensure is comparable to that of a nurse educated in the United States, and that they are proficient in written and spoken E nglish. CGFNS International was named in the 1996 immigration law as an agency to provide such screening, thus, the CGFNS VisaScreen Program is one of the requirements for nurses seeking an occupational visa to work in this country. CGFNS is an immigration neutral organizati on and does not make decisions on who actually receives a visa nor does it have oversight of foreign-educated nurses entering the country (See Appendix A, About CGFNS Interna tional, Inc.). CGFNS VisaScreen\u00ae data indicate that from 2005 to 2009, the top countries of education of app licants were the Philippines, India, Canada, the Republic of Korea and nurses born outside of, but educated in, the United States (CGFNS, 2010a).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-22 Philippines Overview The Philippines has traditionally been considered a source country, one that prepares nurses for the global market. Filipino nurses can be found in almost all countries around the world. However, the majority of nurses educated in the Philippines have usually migrated to the Middle East, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, an d the United States. CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005-2009, indicate that nurses educated in the Philippines and seeking an occupational visa to practice in the United States most frequently id entified their intended st ates of practice as California, New York, Texas, Flor ida, Illinois, and Vermont (CGF NS, 2010b). It should be noted that some states, such as Vermont and California, are considered \"gateway\" states. Nurses often obtain licensure in these states because require ments are viewed as less burdensome and then endorse into the actual st ate of intended practice. Nursing Education Prior to 1984, nursing education in the Philippines was at the diploma and baccalaureate level. Currently, there is only one type of nursing education progr am, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which is housed in colleges and univers ities and is 4 years in length. Candidates can apply after completion of 10 years of primary (6 years) and secondary (4 years) education. Nursing education in the Philippines is modelled after that of the United States and includes courses in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in mathematics and the natural sciences. Nursing content focuses on the four major ar eas of nursing (adult health, maternal/infant, psychiatric/mental health nursing and nursing of children), as well as community health, nursing research and nursing administration. Nursing courses contain both theory and clinical content, with clinicals being termed \"related learning experiences\" (CGFNS, 2009). The number of clinical hours may vary from sc hool to school. Some schools have integrated courses so that certain areas such as psychiatric/mental health nursing and adult health nursing are not individual tracts\u2014a prac tice in U.S. programs as well. With the advent of technology more programs are integrating simulation to prov ide clinical experience. Because of the nursing shortage some facilities cannot accommodate stude nts, and those that do, often are unable to accommodate all the students in the clinical ar eas. Consequently, more and more programs are using simulations to meet the objectives of the related learning experiences. Accreditation Education in the Philippines is oversee n by two agencies: the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), which is responsible for b accalaureate and higher ed ucation programs, and the Technical Education and Skills Developm ent Authority (TESDA), which oversees any program below the baccalaureate level. The Phi lippine government is promoting the concept of \"ladderization\" of education. The ladder c oncept would apply to nursing in the following manner: If an individual entered a nursing program and left at any given point in that education, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-23 they would be employable based on the most recen t semester completed and certificate achieved according to the following schema: At completion of first semester: caregiver cert ificate. Graduates are able to provide basic care to children, the elderly and the disabl ed in the home or in an institution\u2014may include course in home management. At completion of second semester: nurse aide certificate. Gradua tes function under the supervision of a registered nurse. Job skills are comparable to nurse aides in the United States. At completion of third semester: nursing assi stant certificate. Gra duates function under the supervision of a registered nurse. Job skills are comparable to a certified nursing assistant in the United States. At completion of fourth semester: practi cal nurse certificate (certified by TESDA). Graduates are able to assist physicians and nurses and are re sponsible for direct patient care in hospitals, nursing homes, physician offices, clinics and community agencies. At completion of third year: midwifery certific ate. Graduates are certified as midwives rather than nurse midwives. Midwives are re sponsible for the health of both mother and child, only referring to obstetricians if there are medical comp lications. By law they must have a named supervisor of midwives to ensure safe practice. Midwives work in multidisciplinary teams in both hospital a nd, increasingly, community health care settings. At completion of fourth year: professional nu rse degree (must complete Board of Nursing examination given by the Professional Regula tion Commission). Four year education is under the oversight of CHED. If a school is ladderized, both TESDA and CHED are involved in the educational oversight; if the school is not ladderize d, only CHED has oversight. Schools have the option of ladderizing\u2014as of September 2008, 40 percen t of schools were ladderized (Personal communication between Nona Ricafort, PhD, O fficer-in-Charge, CHED and Barbara Nichols and Catherine Davis, CGFNS, September 17, 2008). There has been a moratorium on opening profe ssional nursing programs in the Philippines, due primarily to (1) the prolif eration of poor quality nursing programs whose graduates are not able to pass the Philippine licen sure examination; (2) the high unemployment rate of nurses in the Philippines\u2014it is estimated that over 400,000 Ph ilippine nurses are not able to find jobs; and (3) U.S. immigration retrogression, which has ma de it more difficult for Philippine nurses to obtain U.S. visas. 9 In an effort to bolster Philippine nursing education, CHED, in June 2008, mandated a new, 5- year baccalaureate curriculum that would in crease both theory and clinical throughout the program. The schools were to implement the cu rriculum, which is competency based and introduces nursing in the first semester, by the end of 2009 (Personal communication between Hon. Eufemia F. Octaviano, RN, EdD, Chairper son, Philippine Board of Nursing and Barbara Nichols and Catherine Davis, CGFNS, Septem ber 17, 2008). Because of opposition to the 5-year 9 Immigration retrogression is a U.S. State Department pr ocess that limits the number of visas issued when the number of applicants exceeds th e number of available visas.

Regulation Once the nursing program is completed, the baccal aureate graduate is allowed to sit for the nurse licensure examination, which is administ ered by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). The examination is given two times a year and consists of five parts: Community Nursing; Maternal and Child Nursing; Medical Su rgical Nursing; Fundame ntals of Nursing; and Psychiatric Nursing. Questions for the examin ation are written by the Board of Nursing. Passing the licensure examination enables the gr aduate to take the nursing oath, which is required to enter work as a registered nurse in the Philippines. The oath ceremony occurs after successful completion of the licensure examination and is administered by the Board of Nursing or a government official authori zed to administer oaths. The nur sing license is national in scope and allows the holder to work in all provinces in the Philippines. The PRC does not recognize or regulate vocational nursing progr ams, practice or graduates (Personal communication between Hon. Ruth Padilla, Chai rperson, Professional Regulation Commission and Barbara Nic hols and Catherine Davis, CGFNS, September, 17, 2008). Licensure Renewal Prior to 2000, registered nurses were required to renew their licenses every three years. As of 2000, registered nurse licensure is valid until eith er revoked or suspended and does not have to be renewed. However, renewal f ees will accrue. Should the nurse require license validation at some time, such as when applying for a visa, he /she must satisfy those back fees before the validation will be performed by the PRC (CGFNS, 2009). Nurses who leave practice and who wish to re-enter may do so by paying back fees. Scope of Practice According to Philippine law, a person shall be deemed to be practicing nursing when he/she \"singly or in collaboration with another, initiates and performs nursing services to individuals, families and communities in any health care setting and across the life span. As independent practitioners, nurses are primarily responsible fo r the promotion of health and prevention of illness. As members of the health team, nurses collaborate with other health care providers for the curative, preventive, and rehabilitative aspects of care, restoration of health, alleviation of suffering, and when recovery is not possible, towards a peaceful death\" (Congress of the Philippines, 2002). Nurses are expected to provi de care through use of the nur sing process. Nursing care includes, but is not limited to, \"traditional and innovative approaches, th erapeutic use of self, executing health care techniques and procedures, essential primary health care, comfort measures, health teachings, and administration of written prescription for treatment, therapies, oral, topical and parenteral me dications, internal examination during labor in the absence of antenatal bleeding and delivery\" (C ongress of the Philippines, 2002). The scope of practice further allows nurses to \"establish linkages with community resources and coordination with the health team and provide health education to individuals, families and communities. They may undertake c onsultation services; engage in such activities that require PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The nurse is duty-bound to observe the Philippine Code of Ethics for Nurses and uphold the standards of safe nursing practice. The nurse also is required to maintain competence through continued professional education to be provided by the accredite d professional organization or any recognized professional nursing organization. Supply and Demand in the Philippines Supply exceeds demand for nurses in the Phili ppines, with over 400,000 registered nurses unable to find employment in their home country as there were only 60,000 nursing jobs available (Philippine Star, 2008). The recent immigra tion restrictions in the United States and the United Kingdom, two of the choice destination countries for Philippine nurses, have further exacerbated the numbers of unemployed nurses in the Philippines. Compounding that problem is the graduation of approximately 100,000 nurses each year, over 40 percen t of whom, in recent years, have been unable to pass the Philippine li censure examination. Pass rates have declined from 54 percent in December of 2005 to 39.7 percent in November of 2009. Issues and Challenges Employment Patterns: To be eligible to leave the Philippines for employment overseas, nurses must have at least two years of work experience in a tertiary hospital. Because of the oversupply of nurses, these types of clinical experiences are not always available to those who seek overseas employment. C onsequently, many volunteer to work for experience rather than pay\u2014and still others take non-nursing positions in such areas as call centers and medical transcri ption. Still others enter fa mily businesses (Mateo, 2008). Physician Retraining: A phenomena that has emerged in recent years is the retraining of physicians to become nurses so that they can emigrate under the Philippine government's export policy. Government-regulated health care salaries are so low that it is estimated that 100,000 nurses work outside the profession or migrate to increase their earning capacity (Gorman, 2007). For the same reason physicians are now retraining to become nurses so that they can migrat e to countries in which health care salaries are higher. Remittances: The remittances sent back home by nur ses who have migrated to countries in which the salaries are higher than in the Philippines have had a substantive effect on the Philippine economy and have supported th e local population. Remittance refers to the portion of migrant income that, in the form of either funds or goods, goes back into the home country, primarily to support families back home, to cut poverty, and to improve education and health within the family (F ocus Migration, 2006). Until 5 years ago, this transfer of funds was thought to be minor. However, nurse remittances alone increased from less than $2 billion in 1970 to over $70 billion in 1995 (Seago, 2008). Practical Nurse Programs: Because of the moratorium on baccalaureate programs, practical nurse programs have proliferated in the Philippines\u2014with one estimate being as high as 200 programs. Practical nurse programs can be part of the four year baccalaureate curriculum (ladderized) or can stand alone. The stand alone pr ograms must show that the graduate is eligible to matriculate to a four year program or that there is an affiliation PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Practical nurses are not licensed under the PRC but are certified by TESDA. As of 2008 there was no standardized curri culum for practical nurse programs and considerable use of simulation to meet cl inical assignments (P ersonal communication between Nona Ricafort, PhD, Officer-in- Charge, CHED and Barbara Nichols and Catherine Davis, CGFNS, September 17, 2008). Graduates of these Philippine practical nurse programs, for the most part, do not meet U.S. state requirements for practical nurses and would most likely be identified as nursing assistants or home health aides in most states. However, each state makes th is determination based on their rules and regulations for licensure. Presently, the Professional Regulation Commission, which regulates health care professions in the Philippines, does not recogn ize, license or regulate practical nursing. It has not established standards for practical nursing education or licensure, nor does the PRC approve practical nursing schools. The major nursing organizations and the Board of Nursing are opposed to the practical nurse programs as well as to ladderization. They have opposed all attempts to change the la w regulating nursing to include practical nurses, mainly because of the high unemployment rate of registered nurses in that country (Personal communication between Hon. Ruth Padilla, Chairperson, Professional Regulation Commission and Barbara Nichols and Catherine Davis, CGFNS, September 17, 2008). India Overview India, in recent years, has been considered a source country for migration, supplying nurses to the workforces of countries such as the Unit ed States and the United Kingdom, as well as to the Middle East. Nurses educat ed in India form the second la rgest cohort of nurses seeking occupational visas to practice in the United States (CGFNS, 2010a). Data from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) also indicate that India is second to the Philippines in the number of nurses taking th e U.S. licensure examination, although the numbers are much smaller. Fr om January through September of 2009, 11,854 nurses educated in the Philippines sat for the NCLEX-RN \u00ae examination compared to 1,086 educated in India (NCSBN, 2009). CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005-2009, indicate that nurses educated in India and seeking an occupational visa to practice in the United States most frequently identified their intende d states of practice as Vermont, Florida, California, New York, and Texas (CGFNS, 2010b). Nursing Education Nursing education in India is at both the dipl oma and baccalaureate leve l. Diploma programs, housed in schools of nursing affiliated with teac hing hospitals, are generally 3-3 1/2 years in length and post-secondary in nature, following co mpletion of 12 years of primary and secondary education. Graduates are awarded a Diploma in General Nursing and Midwifery. This enables the graduate to sit for the State Nursing Council Examination and to become registered as a nurse and midwife in India. Three Board examinations are conducted, one at the end of each year. The PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The course in general nursing and midwifer y consists of two years general nursing, one year in community health nursing and midwifer y, and a six month internship that includes courses in nursing administrati on and nursing research. India is in the process of phasing out these programs and replacing them with baccal aureate programs. This modelling after the western hemisphere is not limited to nursing but is also being experienced in the allied health fields such as physical and occupational therapy. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a gene ric, 4-year, university-based program entered after completion of 12 years of primary and seco ndary education. Successful completion of the program allows the graduate to sit for the University Examination and, ultimately, apply for registration with the State Nursing Council. The 4-year program includes courses in the hum anities and social sciences, as well as the physical and biological sciences . Nursing content focuses on the four major areas of nursing (adult health, maternal/in fant, psychiatric/mental health a nd nursing of children), community health, nursing research, administration and teaching. The Bachelor of Nursing (post-basic) is a 2 year RN to BSN program for those holding a Diploma in General Nursing and Midwifery. Th e goal of the program, which leads to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, is the prepar ation of a generalist nur se. Candidates for the program must be registered nurses who have 2 years of experience and a working knowledge of English (Indian Nursing Council, 2009a). Accreditation The Indian Nursing Council is the accrediti ng body for nursing education in India. The Council is an autonomous governmental body constitu ted by law in 1947 to establish uniform standards of training for nurses, midwives a nd health visitors. The Council approves nursing programs and is advisory to th e individual state nursing council s and examining boards (Indian Nursing Council, 2009b). Regulation Nursing registration in India varies from state to state. Each state has a nursing council comparable to a state board of nursing in the United States, which is responsible for the registration of its nurses. Most Indian states do not require registration re newal. Those that do, require renewal every 3 5 years. Scope of Practice India subscribes to the International Council of Nu rses (ICN) definition of nursing, viewing nurses as qualified and authorized to provide nursing se rvices for the promo tion of health, the prevention of illness and the care of the sick. The entitlement to practice as a nurse and/or midwife is determined by the law for nursing and midwifery; that is, th e Indian Nursing Council Act of 1947 (ANMC, 2009). The Bachelor of Science in Nursing Syllabus a nd Regulations of the Indian Nursing Council, established in 1981, defines the esse ntial elements of nursing practi ce in India as those that are related to \"maintaining or restoring life functions, assessing the physical and emotional state of PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Supply and Demand India has experienced what has been termed a significant drain on its nursing labor force due to circular migration. Circular migration is a term used to descri be a phenomenon whereby nurses, motivated by higher salaries and better wo rking conditions work abroad temporarily then return to their country of origi n. It should be noted that circular migration often is mandated in agreements between the host and source countries. For example, Cuba allows its nurses to go to Trinidad/Tobago for a period of 2 years af ter which time they must return home. Circular migration also may be a matter of public policy to ensu re that there is a continuous feed of health care professionals to provide ca re to the country's ci tizens or it can be an agreement negotiated by r ecruiters with a country in order to function in that country. Some utilize such a policy as an edu cational development model so that the professional returns with international experience, which is then shared wi th his/her colleagues at home and enhances the quality of education. Hawkes and colleagues (2009) found that Indian nurses who engaged in circular migration tended to be female and older than the nursing av erage, with more work experience and greater seniority than the general nursing population in India. It has been argued that circular migration does not produce the same degree of loss to a country's skilled labor force as permanent migration. However, the Hawkes and colleagues ( 2009) study indicated that the collective labor time spent outside of the country suggests temporary migration may have a profound and underestimated impact on the Indian nursing work force. They found that the median time of working outside of India was 6 years, a period of time that allowed the nurses to sufficiently increase their incomes. Hawkes and colleagues ( 2009) further estimated that up to one-fifth of the nursing labor force in India may be lost to wealthier countries th rough circular migration. Issues and Challenges Recruitment of Nurses: As the demand for nurses rises worldwide, commercial recruiters have become increas ingly interested in exporting nu rses from India to countries experiencing shortages. At present India does not have enough pr ofessional nurses to meet its own domestic needs and has a lowe r ratio than the recommended international norm of 2:1 to 3:1 for nurse/phys ician ratios. Shortages in rura l areas are the most urgent (Khadria, 2007). Recruitment has focused on Indian nurses be cause of their education and their ability to speak English. Delhi-based agencies tend to focus on the U.S. market while those in Kochi and Bangalore mainly facilitate the mi gration of nurses to the Gulf countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Ireland. Thus, India is faced with the double challenge of producing more nurses for immi gration and at the same time filling more vacancies within India (Khadria, 2007).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-29 Canada Overview Canada is considered both a source and a hos t country for migration. Many Canadian nurses choose to work in the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Trade NAFTA), either living in Canada and crossing the border daily or moving to the United States temporarily. Canada also may be considered a ho st country, receiving nurses from such countries as the Philippines, India, Russia and the Caribbean to mitigate its own nursing shortage. Approximately 10 percent of Canadian nurses seeking entry into the United States under Trade NAFTA are nurses born outside of Cana da (CGFNS, 2007). CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005-2009, indicate that nurses educated in Canada and seeking to practice in the United States most frequently identified their intended states of practice as Californi a, Michigan, New York, Texas and Arizona (CGFNS, 2010b). Education Education and health care ar e provincial responsibilities unde r the Canadian constitution. Thus the systems of education are ones in wh ich the decision-making au thority is provincial; however, through organizations such as the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA), national coordination is achieved through pr omulgation of guidelines and st andards. CNA is a federation of 11 provincial and territorial nurses' associations and colleges representing more than 136,200 registered nurse and nurse practitioner members, which is approximately 53 percent of employed nurses. Quebec is not a member of CNA. Nursing education programs in Canada requi re completion of 12 years of primary and secondary education for entry. Th ere are three types of programs for registered nurses: 3 year diploma programs, which are being phased out, 4 year generic baccalaureate programs and post-basic baccalaureate programs for nurses holding a di ploma in nursing that are 2-3 years in length. Alberta and British Columbia also offer entry le vel psychiatric nursing diploma, certificate and degree programs. Graduates of these programs are not considered general nurses, are licensed under a college or association sepa rate from nursing, and are prepar ed to work only in the field of mental health. CNA began advocating for degree preparation of nurses in 1982 and has worked with the provinces to achieve that goal. In 2004 the Canadian Associati on of Schools of Nursing (CASN) and CNA issued a joint position paper that r ecommended a baccalaureate degree in nursing as the educational entry-to-practice standard for registered nurses in Canada (CASN and CNA, 2004). Today, the majority of provinces require th e baccalaureate for entry into the profession. Students in Alberta, Manitoba, Qu ebec, and the Territories can sti ll choose either a diploma or a degree program to prepare for a career in nursing but they must be aware of the trend toward a university level of educa tion. In all other provinces students must obtain a baccalaureate degree in nursing to prepare for a nursing career. In all provinces the cha nge to the degree as a minimum requirement for entry into pract ice applies only to new entran ts and has no effect on the eligibility of currently registered diploma nurses for continuing registration (CNA, 2009).

Accreditation in Canada is a voluntary process, co mparable to that of the United St ates in that it requires a self evaluation report (including in formation on the nursing progra m, administration, faculty, students, curriculum, learning reso urces and graduates) as well as an on-site visit (CASN, 2009). In addition to profession-specific accreditation processes, nursi ng programs may be reviewed as part of periodic quality review processes established by provincia l authorities for universities and colleges. Regulation The regulatory system for nur sing in Canada reflects the country's federal and provincial/territorial government structure. Health-care deli very is the responsibility of the provincial and territorial governme nts, as is the regulation of all health-care professions. Provinces and territories grant responsibility for nursing regula tion to professional colleges and/or nursing associations. Therefore, a nurse seeking to practice nursing in a specific province or territory must apply to be licensed and registered by the colle ge and/or association in that province or territory. There is no national license in Canada; each provinc e or territory licenses nurses within the individual ju risdiction (CNA, 2010). The licensu re fee, except in Ontario and Quebec, includes both licensure registration and membership in the provincial and national nurses association. All provinces, with the exception of Quebec, require licensure candidates to take the Canadian Registered Nurse Examination (CRNE) developed by CNA. The CRNE is a multiple choice examination that is competency based a nd reflects a primary health care nursing model. The examination consists of approximately 300 multiple-choice questions, about 40 percent of which are independent questions and 60 percent are case based. The framework developed to identify and organize the competencies in the CRNE is designed to assess Professional Practice (accountability for safe , competent and ethical nursing practice); Nurse-Person Relationship (therapeutic partnerships esta blished to promote the health of the person); Nursing Practice: Health a nd Wellness (recognizing and valuing health and wellness as a resource); and Nursin g Practice: Alterations in Hea lth (care across the lifespan for the person experiencing alterations in health that require acute , chronic, rehabilitative or palliative (OIIQ) grants licensure to nurses in Quebec. Two components must be met to obtai n a registered nurse lice nse in that province: Successful completion of a licensure exam ination. The Quebec licensure examination, offered twice a year, is a comprehensive ex amination that includes a written section (short answer) and an obj ective, structured clin ical evaluation section. Proof of proficiency in the French language . Quebec law requires that candidates possess a working knowledge of the French language and have proficiency in verbal and written French. Candidates are required to pass a la nguage examination unless they can show completion of 3 years of full-time instruc tion in a French, COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Most provinces have continued competency requirement s that must be met annually for registration renewal. The Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the jurisdic tion form the basis of continued competency programs and are the framework that nurses use to reflect on their practice in order to maintain competen ce throughout their ca reers (CNA, 2000). For example, when nurses apply to the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA) for a registered nurse practice permit, they must a ssess their practice by reflecting on the CARNA Nursing Practice Stan dards (NPS), collect fe edback about their practice, identify their learning pr iorities and report th e NPS indicator(s) that they will focus on for the coming year or remainder of the curr ent practice year. Conti nuing Competence Program (CCP) activities are reported annually. Competence conditions are imposed on a member's practice if the member does not provide evid ence of having met the continuing competence program requirements. Members applying for, or renewing, RN practice permits report selected indicators for professional deve lopment for the upcoming practice year. At registration/renewal for the subsequent practice year, members report on the implementation of the completed year's learning plan(s) and any influence the learning had on their nursing practice (CARNA, 2009). Scope of Practice The activities that registered nurses are authorized to perfor m are set out in legislation by each province/territory and based on the definition of nursing within that ju risdiction. While each scope of practice is specific to the respective province/territory, there are similarities. Most address health promotion, illness prevention, an d provision of care\u2014with many also focusing on teaching and coordination of care. Ontario's scope of practice statement, for exampl e, indicates that the \"practice of nursing is the promotion of health and the assessment of, th e provision of care for, and the treatment of health conditions by supportive, preventive, therapeutic, palliative and rehabilitative means in order to attain or maintain optimal function (C NO, 2009). Nova Scotia's definition of practice, contained within the Registered Nurses A ssociation Act of 1985, also addresses health promotion, illness prevention and the provision of care. It defines nursing as \"the application of professional nursing knowledge or services for compensation or th e purpose of assisting a person to achieve and maintain optimal health through (1) promoting, maintaini ng and restoring health; (2) preventing illness, injury or disability; (3) caring for the sick and dying; (4) health teaching and health counseling; or (5) co ordinating care (CRNNS, 2009). Supply and Demand The Canadian Nurses Association estimates th at there was a shortage of nearly 11,000 full- time equivalent (FTE) registered nurses in Cana da in 2007, a shortage that is expected to increase to almost 60,000 FTEs by 2022 if no policy interventions are implemented. CNA identified short term policy solutions to address the shortage that include increasing registered nurse productivity and reducing absenteeism. L ong term solutions focus on reducing registered nurse exit rates, reducing attrition rates in entry level educati on programs, increasing enrollment in registered nurse programs, and reducing inte rnational in-mig ration.

Issues and Challenges Aging Nursing Workforce: Canada, like the United States, is experiencing an aging of its nursing workforce. Recent figures from Cana da reveal that registered nurses between age 50 and 54 years make up 17 percent of th e workforce, compared to 11 percent in 1994 (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2008). Over the next 10 15 years both Canada and the United States will experi ence a large exodus of nurses from their workforces as nurses retire\u2014at a time when demand for nursing and health care is on the rise due to the growth in the older population. This trend, if left unaddressed, is set to deepen the current sh ortage of employed nurses, especially if there continues to be a shortfall of new nurses entering the labor market. It also will affect developing count ries where the age profile is often very different but where aggressive international recr uitment efforts may drain the supply of nurses in active practice (ICN, 2008). CNA, as noted previously, has taken the lead in recommending short and long term policy solu tions for eliminating the nursing shortage in Canada within 15 years. United Kingdom Overview The United Kingdom has served as both a sour ce and host country for migration. As a host country, the United Kingdom experienced an in crease in in-migration in the last decade, particularly from India, Australia, the Philippines and sub-Saharan Africa, so that in the early to mid-2000s, there were more overseas nurses ente ring the country than nurses graduating from U.K. schools. Nurses educated in the United Kingdom have tr aditionally migrated to Australia, the United States, New Zealand and the Republ ic of Ireland, and also have been recruited to the Caribbean. CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005 2009, indicate that nurses educat ed in the United Kingdom and seeking an occupational visa to practice in the United States mo st frequently identified their intended states of practice as Ca lifornia, Arizona, Florida, Ne w Mexico and New York (CGFNS, 2010b). Today, the United Kingdom does not consider nurs ing a shortage profession and has, in fact, tightened its immigration requirements for overs eas nurses. Nurses from the European Union countries may enter the UK for purposes of employ ment. While their numbers are not large, they are rising, with most nurses coming from Pola nd, Romania, Bulgaria and Germany (NMC, 2009a). The Nursing and Midwifery Council (2009) report s that the number of overseas nurses entering the Register (excluding nurses from the EU countries ) declined significantly from 14,122 overseas entries in 2004 to 2309 overseas entries in 2008. There was a small corresponding increase in the number of EU edu cated nurses entering the Register during that same time period\u2014from 1033 entries in 2004 to 1872 entries in 2008 (NMC, 2009a).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-33 Prior to the early 1990s, nursing education progr ams in the United Kingdom were 3 years in length and located in hospital-based schools. Currently, all nursi ng programs are located in, or affiliated with, university settings. This transitio n from hospital setting to university began with Project 2000, an initiativ e to make nursing a more professional career and to move nursing education into higher education. Education programs are comprised of a 12-month Common Foundati on Programme (CFP) and a 2-year Branch Program in one of the following specialty areas: adult nursing, mental health nursing, learning disability nursing or children's nursing. All stude nts are required to take the Common Foundation Programme for 12 months and then select one of the Branch Programs. Both the CFP and Branch Programs contain 50 percent clinical and 50 percent theory. The Branch Program also allows a period of clinical practice of at least three months towards the end of the program to enable students to consolidate their education and competence in practice. At completion of the program the graduate is awar ded a Diploma of Higher Education in Nursing or, if they have completed a degree program, a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (NMC, 2009b). Regulation The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) was established under the Nursing and Midwifery Order of 2001 as the successor to th e United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visitors (UKCC) and the four National Boards for Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors for England, Northern Irela nd, Scotland and Wales. The NMC registers all nurses, midwives and specialty community public health nurses and ensures that they are properly qualified and competent to practice in the United Kingdom. The NMC also establishes the standards of proficiency to be met by applicants to differe nt parts of the register, the standards it considers necessary for safe and effective practice. By law (Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001), the Regi ster is divided into individual sections with each section having a designated title indi cative of different quali fications and education. The registrant is entitled to use the title correspo nding to that part of the NMC Register in which he/she is listed. Currently, there are three parts to the Register: Nurses, Midwives, and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses. Each profe ssion has its own education, registration and practice standards (Statu tory Instruments 2002). To become a registered nurse, an applicant mu st complete a 3-year program at a school or college of nursing approved by the NMC and linked to a university. Once completed, the graduate must apply for the NMC registry. The NMC evaluates the graduate's credentials and if approved, the graduate may practice as a nurse. Under the Nurse's pa rt of the register the nurse selects the field of practice that corresponds to the Branch Program chosen: adult nurse, mental health nurse, learning disabilities nur se or children's nurse (NMC, 2009c). Midwifery programs are 3 years in length, unl ess the applicant is already on the NMC Register as a registered (adul t) nurse, in which case the pr ogram is 18 months in length. Midwifery programs also are linked to universit ies. Specialist community public health nurse programs are 52 weeks in length beyond initial re gistration as a nurse or midwife. The NMC established a part of the Register for specia list community public health nurses because it believed that this form of practice has distinct characteristics that require public protection. These characteristics include working with bot h individuals and a population, which may mean making decisions on behalf of a community or p opulation without having direct contact with every individual in that commun ity. Specialist community public he alth nursing aims to reduce health inequalities by working with individuals , families, and communities promoting health, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The emphasis is on \"partnerships that cut across disciplinary, professional and organizationa l boundaries that impact on organized social and political policy to influence the determinants of health a nd promote the health of whole populations\" (NMC, 2009d). Renewal Registration must be renewed every 3 years a nd a retention-of-registra tion fee paid annually. Those seeking renewal also must submit a signe d Notification of Practice form, through which they attest that they have met the Post-Regis tration Education and Pract ice (PREP) requirements and are of good health and good character. PREP is a set of Nursing & Midwifery Council standards that are designed to he lp nurses keep up to date with new developments in practice and encourage them to reflect on their practice. PREP also provides a framework for continuing professional development (CPD), which, although not a guarantee of competence, is a key component of clinical governance in the United Kingdom (NMC, 2009e). There are two separate PREP standards that must be met for registration renewal: Practice and Continuing Education. To meet the PREP Pr actice Standard, nurses must have worked in some nursing capacity for a minimum of 450 hour s, or have successfully taken an approved return to practice course, within the preced ing 3 years. To meet the PREP Continuing Professional Development Standard, nurses must have undertaken and recorded continuing professional development related to their practice over the 3 years prior to registration renewal (NMC, 2009e). Scope of Practice The Royal College of Nursing defines nursing as \"the use of clini cal judgment in the provision of care to enable people to improve, maintain, or recover health, to cope with health problems, and to achieve the best possible quality of life, whatever their disease or disability, until death\" (RCN, 2009). The NMC, which develops the standards of proficiency, recognizes that there is comparability between the standard s achieved by all nursing students, and that it is through the application of these standards to practice within the different contexts of nursing that defines the scope of professional practice. Th e standards of proficiency define the overarching principles of being able to practice as a nurse ; the context in which they ar e achieved defines the scope of professional practice. Applicants for entry to the nurses' part of the register must achieve the standards of proficiency in their chosen specialty area (NMC, 2009b). For example, adult nursing standa rds of proficiency require the care of adults, from 18 year olds to elder people, in a variety of settings for patients with wide ranging levels of dependency. Adult nursing is patient centered and acknowledg es the differing needs, values and beliefs of people from ethnically diverse communities. Adu lt nurses engage in and develop therapeutic relationships that involve patient s and their care givers in on-goi ng decision-making that informs nursing care. They also must have the skills to meet the physi cal, psychological, spiritual and social needs of patients, suppor ting them through care pathways a nd working with other health and social care professionals to maximize opportunities for recovery, rehabilitation, adaptation to ongoing disease and disability, health edu cation and health promotion (NMC, 2009b).

At the same time the government implemented a points-based system for assessi ng immigration applications, whic h changed the way individuals from outside the European Union and the Eur opean Economic Area can work, train or study in the United Kingdom. The points based system has five tiers ranging from highly skilled individuals who contribute to growth and produ ctivity to youth mobility and temporary workers (UKBA, 2009). Issues and Challenges Immigration Reform: Individuals immigrating to the Un ited Kingdom must gain points to qualify for a specific tier before they can apply for permission to enter or to remain in the country. The number of points required a nd the way the points are awarded depend on the tier the migrant is applying under and wi ll reflect his/her qualifications, experience, age, previous earnings and language competence. Under the points based system the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) decides who is admitted to or allowed to stay in the United Kingdom. In or der to assess this, the migrant nurse will need to provide evidence of a sponsor in the United Kingdom who is licensed by the UKBA. If an overseas qualif ied nurse has a job offer from a U.K. employer, he or she may be able to apply to work in the United Kingdom as a sponsored skilled worker (UKBA, 2009). Aging Nursing Workforce: The United Kingdom, along with Canada, the United States, and a number of European States, is facing the challenge of an aging nursing workforce and an aging population. In the United Kingdom an estimated 180,000 nurses will reach retirement age over the next decade (RCN, 2006 ). In the European Union, concerns about the sustainability of pensions, economic growth and the future labor supply have stimulated a range of policy recommendati ons to promote the health and working capacity of workers as they age; to develop the skills and employabili ty of older workers; to examine raising the pension age; and to provi de suitable working conditions as well as employment opportunities for an aging workforce (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2007). Summary The historic suppliers of nurses to the United States\u2014the Philippines, India, Canada and the United Kingdom\u2014generally have education a nd regulatory systems comparable, but not equivalent to, that of the United States. For th e most part, they have moved nursing education into institutions of higher learning, have formal licensure and/or registration systems in place, and have scopes of practice that focus on health promotion and maintenance and the provision of care to the sick.

However, because nurses educated in secondary school nur sing programs make up the majority of nurses in the workforce in China, they do not easily meet licensure requirements in many host countries. The international migration of Chinese nurses began in the early 1990s when the government organized groups of English speaking nurses to work in Singapore and Saudi Arabia. Today, hundreds of Chinese nurses work in these countries every year under a government arranged contract. The Chinese government charges 10 15 percent of the nurse s' annual salary as a handling fee for such an arrangement. These contracts usua lly last about 2 3 years, and then most nurses return to work in their original hospitals. In many cases, returning is required and clearly stated in their contracts (Fang, 2007). There has been a similar increase in the numbe r of nurses migrating to Australia, with lesser numbers going to the United Stat es. CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005 2009, indicate that nurses educated in China and seeking to practice in the United States most frequently identified their intended states of practice as California, New Mexico, New Yo rk, Michigan and Pennsylvania (CGFNS, 2010b). Education Nursing education programs in China are at the certificate (mid-associat e degree), associate degree, and baccalaureate levels and are approved by the Ministry of Education in that country. Mid-associate degree programs are 2 3 years in length and admini stered by secondary nursing schools that accept candidates who have completed 6 years of primary education and 3 years of junior middle education, usually at 15 16 years of age. The majority of new recruits to nursing enter at this level. However, nurses graduating from these programs would not meet entry requirements to practice nursing in most develope d countries unless they completed a separate secondary school education or its equivalent (Fang, 2007). Associate degree programs are generally 3 years in length and post-secondary in nature. These programs accept candidates who completed 6 years of primary education, 3 years of junior middle education and 3 years of senior middl e education. At completion of the program, graduates are awarded a diploma comparable to a nursing diploma in the United States. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a 4 5 year degree program entered after completion of 12 years of primary and secondary education. These programs are administered by medical universities and colleges and government approved. The national basic nursing education curriculum includes courses in Chinese medicine (i.e., acupuncture), mathematics, Chinese and foreign languages as well as the p hysical and biological sciences. Nursing content includes pediatric, obste tric and adult health nursing and infectious diseases. Psychiatric nursing became part of the curriculum in the mid-1990s (Fang, 2007). Future trends in nursing indicate an increase in overall enroll ments, particularly in those types of programs that produce nurses who qua lify for employment outside of China (Fang, 2007).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-39 Regulation Since 1994, first level nurses who graduate from mid-associate and associate degree programs are all required to pass a national re gistration examination to become licensed. Graduates of baccalaureate programs, until recentl y, were exempt from this requirement and were granted an automatic licen se. However, in 2007 the Ministry of Education reviewed this process and determined that graduates of all programs should take the licensure examination. The directive was implemented in May, 2009 (P ersonal communication between Dr. Feng Li, Director, Health and Human Resources Develo pment and Training, Ministry of Health and Barbara Nichols, CGFNS, December, 10, 2007). Renewal All nurses must renew their license every 2 year s. Continuing education courses are required for renewal. Scope of Practice China's 1994 Nurses Act described nursing prac tice as including care that focuses on clinical observation; assisting physicians to complete treatment and administer drugs; implementing care plans through use of the nursing process; patient rehabilitatio n and education; and quality assurance. Nurses working in public health area s have responsibility for health management along with general practitioners in the community and public health education. Nursing education, administration and research also ar e nursing functions allowed under the 1994 Act (ANMC, 2009). Supply and Demand There is a nursing shortage as well as a high level of unemployment and underemployment of nurses in China. Overall, China has not invested in nurses to meet the health care needs of the public. In fact, the supply of physic ians exceeds that of nurses. There is approximately one nurse for every thousand people in China compared to one nurse for every one hundred people in the United States (Fang, 2007). As more funds are invest ed in health services in China, the health care system will require more nurses and a closer look at their distribution. Issues and Challenges Enhancement of the Profession: As a result of limited job opportunities, low salary, and low job satisfaction, many Chinese nurses in tend to leave nursing or work outside China (Fang, 2007). Commercial recruite rs have expressed a strong interest in recruitment of nurses in China, but to date there are few examples of successful ventures. Fang (2007) suggests that even if the Chinese government were to implement health care financing reforms that led to an increase in nursing j obs and improved work conditions, some level of surplus will remain. China's nursing education system is huge in size (about 500,000 nursing students in 2005), but weak in quality and career devel opment (Fang, 2007). In addition, nurses in China have to carry a heavy workload and are faced with 10 times the population responsibility compared to U.S. nurses. Ho spital demand is for younger nurses, as they PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As a result, age discrimination is a problem\u2014and it is not unusual to find hospitals dismissing most nurses older than 45 years of age (Fang, 2007). Future issues for nursing in China incl ude the upgrading of education and the requiring of a baccalaureate degree for entr y into the profession; expanding nursing's research base; increasing the globalization of nursing; and creating new cooperative programs worldwide (Smith and Tang, 2004). Sub-Saharan Africa Overview Sub-Saharan Africa is a geographica l term used to describe the area of Africa that lies south of the Sahara. Many of the countries in sub- Saharan Africa are consid ered sources for the migration of nurses, particularly Nigeria in the West, Kenya and Ethiopia in the East, and South Africa. During the nursing shortage in the United Kingdom in the last decade, nurses from sub- Saharan Africa provided a significant increas e in that country's nursing workforce. Nurses educated in sub-Saharan Africa also mi grate to the United States to improve their working conditions and salaries. Using Nigeri a as a prototype, CGFN S VisaScreen data, 2005 2009, indicate that nurses educat ed in that country and seek ing an occupational visa to practice in the United States most frequently identif ied their intended states of practice as Texas, California, New York, Maryland, Illi nois and Pennsylvania (CGFNS, 2010b). Education Most formal nursing education programs began in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1900s. Initial nursing programs educated auxiliar y or enrolled nurses, a classifi cation that is comparable to practical nurses in the United States. Entran ce requirements generally included 9 years of primary and middle school education. Many countr ies in sub-Saharan Africa have phased out these enrolled nurse programs; however, faith-bas ed hospitals in some countries have kept enrolled as well as hospital-based professi onal nurses (Munjana et al., 2005). Generally, countries that eliminate the posi tion of enrolled nurse offer bridge programs for those individuals who seek to transition to professional nursing. In dividuals who do not transition often work as nurse aides or health aides. Professional nurse (RN) edu cation requires completion of a full primary and secondary education (12 years) and 3 years of nursing education. Most schools are hospital based and federally or state funded. There al so are university based programs in sub-Saharan Africa: 4 year generic programs that lead to a Bachelor of Nursing degree and 2 3 year post-basic RN to BSN programs. Post-basic programs require 2 ye ars of work experience prior to entry. The nursing curriculum in many parts of sub- Saharan Africa is framed around the medical model, which is considered by some as too we sternized for nursing a nd midwifery requirements in Africa. Opponents of the medical model belie ve that there should be a greater focus on community nursing and primary h ealth care\u2014and that the curriculum should be more culturally sensitive (Munjana et al., 2005). Th ere also is a need for facult y with higher qualifications to teach in the programs, since many of the highe r educated nurses leave the country through migration.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-41 Regulation The Nursing Councils of each country are the statutory bodies that develop standards for the profession and regulate the practice of nurses and midwives in their respective countries. They also license and regist er those nurses who meet the edu cational requirements, with some countries, such as Nigeria, requiring licensure by national examination. Licensure Renewal Licensure renewal is determined by the individual country. Not all count ries require renewal of registration; however, when countries do require renewal, it is on an annua l or biennial basis. Scope of Practice The scope of nursing practice varies by country. In Nigeria, for example, a nurse is a person who has received authorized education, acquired specialized knowledge, skill s and attitudes, and is registered and licensed with the Nursing and Midwifery Council to \"provide promotive, preventive, supportive and restorative care to individuals, families and communities, independently, and in collaborati on with other members of the health team. The nurse must provide care in such a manner as to enhance the integrity of the profession, safeguard the health of the individual client/patient and protect the interest of the society\" (NNMC, 2009). In South Africa, the scope of practice is info rmed by a competency framework that supports an outcomes-based approach to nursing education and training\u2014rather than a listing of activities that nurses are allowed to perform (South African Nursing Council, 2004). The Acts governing nursing in several African countries, for exampl e Zambia, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria, allow nurses to enter private practice, with each country setting its own requirements and standards for such practice (Munjana et al., 2005). Supply and Demand Sub-Saharan Africa has a smaller number of nurses per population compared to other continents\u2014and these small numbers are inadequate to meet the health needs of the population (see Table J-3). Nursing is predominantly a fe male profession at the caregiver level but disproportionately male at the ad ministration level. With the epidemic nature of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa there has been an increased lo ss of nurses due to illn ess and a loss of nurses who, as females, provide care to their own fa milies that have been ravaged by AIDS. The absenteeism caused by the AIDS epidemic, c oupled with the nursing shortage caused by migration and the under-funding of the health sector , has led to an overwhelming increase in the workload of those nurses who continue w ithin the profession (Munjana et al., 2005). Issues and Challenges Shortage of Health Professionals: The most significant factor affecting the nursing workforce of sub-Saharan Africa is the shor tage of health professionals, especially nurses. This is due in part to a number of factors: migration; the limited supply of new graduates; under-funding of the health sector ; attrition due to HIV/AIDS; limited career opportunities; and inefficiencies in the recruitment and rete ntion of nurses. The decision PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Caribbean Overview Generally the Caribbean has been both a source and host country for migration. Because most nurses are educated in Eng lish and proficient in spoken English, they have been recruited for positions in both the United States and Ca nada. To remedy this loss of nurses, many Caribbean countries have had to recru it nurses, primarily from Cuba, Nigeria, the United Kingdom and other English speaking countries. So me have resurrected long disbanded diploma programs that subscribed to a traditional dipl oma curriculum. Using Jamaica as a prototype, CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005 2009, indicate that nurses educated in that country and seeking an occupational visa to practice in the United States most frequently identified their intended states of practice as Arizona, New Yo rk, Florida and Geor gia (CGFNS, 2010b). Education Nursing education programs are approved/accre dited by the government, the Ministry of Education. Accreditation is a two-part process that consists of a se lf evaluation report and a site visit. There are three types of entry level nursing programs in th e Caribbean: diploma, associate degree and baccalaureate. However, not all Cari bbean countries have nursing schools nor do all schools have each type of program. Bermuda is one such country without a nursing program on the island; however, the Nursing Council of Berm uda is currently in c onsultation with various nursing organizations regarding development (P ersonal communication between Gaylia Landry, Chief Nursing Office Bermuda Nursing Council and Donna Richardson, CGFNS, by conference call on Oct. 23, 2009). Diploma programs are 3 years in length and hospital based. In some Caribbean countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, these had been replaced by associate degree programs. However, because of the severe shortage of nurses, they were re-opened and the education funded by the government in an effort to produce more nurses. Associate degree programs are 2 3 years in length, with th e third year being devoted primarily to clinical experiences. Baccalaureat e degree programs are 4 years in length. One such baccalaureate program, the International University of Nursing in St. Kitts, includes 6 semesters of education in St. Kitts and 2 semesters at an affiliated school in either the United States or Canada. Graduates of the programs earn a dual de gree that allows them to take licensure examinations in two countries, provided that st ate/provincial/territorial requirements are met. Regulation The Nursing Council of the individual country is responsible for conducti ng site visits at schools of nursing for quality checks and to verify the curriculum, including clinical hours, as well as for the licensure and registration of regist ered nurses and midwives. It serves as the gate keeper to the Caribbean Regional Licensure Examination. Passing the 2-day regional examination permits nurses to practice in any of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-43 countries, which include Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Sa int Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago (Reid, 2000). The examination allows for standardization of nursing education and reciprocity for nurses among the countries in the region. Guyana, although a member of CARICOM, does not require the regional examination for registration. Countri es that are not members of CARICOM have their own processes for the registration of nurses and midwives (World Bank, 2009). Scope of Practice The Nursing Councils in the individual Caribbean countries set the standards for nursing practice. The Regional Examination for Nurse Regi stration in the Caribbean is based on mutually agreed upon competencies for the registered nurse to practice in the region. The treatment of test items, assembling and conducting of the examinati ons, scoring of the examination, and student notification of results is the responsibility of each General Nursing Council. The 13 General Nursing Councils with responsibility for School s of Nursing meet annually as a regional committee to prepare the ex aminations (Reid, 2000). Supply and Demand Although the countries of the Caribbean have a similar history and culture and share common socio-economic goals, they are highly diverse w ith respect to health care delivery. The vast majority of nurses work in the public sector (World Bank, 2009). The Caribbean is in the midst of a critical nursing shortage due primarily to the out-migration of its nurses. On average 42 percent of nursing positions in the Caribbean countries are vacant. Low pay, poor career prospects, and lack of educational opportunities are among the reasons nurses resign (Salmon et al., 2007). Many of these nurses look outside the region for job opportunities in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. Compounding the situation is the lack of resources to prepare nurses to fill the vacancies. To remedy this situation, nursing and other leaders in the Caribbean created regional strategies for addressing the challenges they face in delivering basic health care within their countries. The region-wide Managed Migration Program, a multilateral, cross-sector, multi- interventional, long-term strategy for developing and maintaining an adequate supply of nurses for the region, is one of the results of that effort (Salmon et al., 2007). Issues and Challenges Nursing Shortage: The worldwide AIDS epidemic has taken its toll in the Caribbean, increasing the need for health professionals, es pecially nurses. This coupled with the loss of nurses to migration has caused a severe shortage of nurses in the Caribbean. While most nurses who have left the country to work in the United States and Canada have traditionally stayed there permanently, some Caribbean countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, are seeing more circular migration, with nurses returning home after several years abroad. Jamaica has been able to make up for some loss of its nurses by recruiting skilled nurses from inside the region, for example from Cuba and Guyana, as well as outside the Caribbean from such countries as India, Ghana, Burma, Russia, and Nigeria (Salmon et al., 2007).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-44 The Managed Migration Program discusse d previously allows governments and stakeholders to work together to ensure th at migration is managed so that costs are minimized and benefits maximized to the countries and to the nursing professionals. There are now several models of migrati on management in place in the Caribbean: Educating for Export: Nurses are hired by U.S. partners and the government of the Caribbean country is reimbursed for each nurse. The funds received are to be reinvested in upgrading nursing ed ucation (St. Vincent Model). Temporary Migration: Nurses work for a portion of the time in the host country and the remainder of the time in the Ca ribbean country. Because nurses pay their own travel costs, the host country is usually close by. For example, Jamaican nurses work for 2 weeks per month in Miami and 2 weeks in Jamaica, gaining additional skills and increasing their earni ngs while at the same time meeting Jamaican staffing needs. Regional Cooperation: Countries with the capacity to absorb additional students into their nursing education system have reached agreement with countries that either do not have schools of nursing or the capacity to educate the needed number of nurses. Grenada and Antigua entered into such an agreement through which students from Antigua go through nursing education in Grenada at a minimal cost. The Regional Examination for Nurses Registration and the Common Nursing Education Standards in the Caribbean allow the Grenadian educated nurse to then return and practice in Antigua. International Partnerships: These partnerships include establishment of an off shore school of nursing to meet the needs of the global market . The International University of Nursing is one such sch ool, originally established to meet the worldwide need for baccalaureate-prepared nurses. Homecoming Programs: These programs are designed for nurses who have emigrated to give back to their home c ountries (brain gain) in the Caribbean by working and sharing their nursing expert ise. For example, a team from the Guyana Nurses Association in the United Kingdom runs a yearly screening test for hearing in Guyana. The Caribbean Over seas Nurses Association works closely with national nurses associat ions to explore possibilitie s for joint programs in developing nursing edu cation and practice. Health and Tourism Model: In this model, nurses w ould be recruited from developed countries, such as Canada and the United States, and invited to work in the Caribbean for 6 12 months\u2014with the advertised goal of achieving greater work-life balance. Temporary Movement of Ski lled Nursing Professionals: Bilateral proposals are created to provide incentives for nur ses to return to the Caribbean and disincentives to overstay in the host country. These types of proposals would address the nursing shortage through regional and national socioeconomic development agreements and promote nursi ng as an independen t service activity (Salmon et al, 2007). Practical Nurse Programs: Graduates of Jamaican pr actical nurse programs are being considered by the Canadi an government for a recrui tment initiative to address its shortage of Practical Nurses in th e face of an aging population. The Canadian proposal requires the Jamaican educated practical nurse to pa ss its licensing exam. PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Mexico Overview Mexico is seen as a source country for migra tion, primarily supplying nurses to the United States to meet shortages. They have especially been recruited to Southwestern Border States. However, because many of the nurses had their nu rsing education at the secondary school level and in Spanish, they have found it challeng ing to pass both the CGFNS Qualifying Exam\u00ae (a prerequisite for licensure in a number of states) and/or the U.S. licensure examination, the NCLEX-RN\u00ae examination. Consequently, a number of in itiatives were put in place by schools and recruiters that assist the nurses in language development and in the knowledge of nursing as it is practiced in the United St ates. CGFNS VisaScreen data, 2005 2009, indicate that nurses educated in Mexico and seeking to practice in th e United States most frequently identified their intended states of practice as Texas, California and New Mexico (CGFNS, 2010b). Education Formal nursing education in Mexico began in the early 1900s with hospital-based programs whose curricula were validated by medical schools. Physicians were in charge of determining the duration of the education, the curriculum, and the admission requirements (CGFNS, 1996). Today, the nursing profession is taking a more activ e role in self-regulati on and standard setting. As nursing education progressed, two types of pr ograms emerged: diploma and baccalaureate programs. Diploma programs were combined wi th secondary school, which the individual entered after 9 years of primary and middle school education. Graduates were considered to be first level nurses in Mexico and were given the title of Technical Nurse; however, they were viewed as second level or practical nurses by institutions in the Unite d States and Canada (CGFNS, 1996). The majority of nurses in Me xico were educated in these programs. Baccalaureate programs emerged at a later date, are post-secondary in nature, and 4 years in length. Graduates also are considered first leve l nurses in Mexico, a nd their education is considered comparable to registered nurses in the United States and Canada. Today there are still two type s of nursing programs in Mexico: 3 year diploma programs and 4 year degree programs. However, both are now pos t-secondary in nature and require 12 years of primary and secondary education for entry. One y ear of community service must be completed before graduates are eligible to be licensed. Regulation Students graduating from 3 and 4 year programs must show evidence of having completed all subjects successfully, of havi ng completed their community serv ice, and of having passed their school-administered, professional examination to be licensed. The examination can be taken in groups or independently upon completion of community service. Students choosing to take an individual examin ation must prepare a thesis under the guidance of an advisor. Their examination consists of tw o sections, one oral and one practical. The oral examination is taken before three examiners appointed by the academic department. The PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-46 practical examination is taken at a hospital, with the department and patient chosen by the examiners. The group examination, prepared by f aculty in the nursing schools, consists of a written exam whose content is divided into area s of knowledge. It consis ts of 1000 questions and students are allotted 8 hours for completion (CGFNS, 1996). Once candidates are successful on their chosen ex amination, they are awarded their degree or diploma. They may then apply for a license ( c\u00e9dula) to practice nursing in Mexico, which is issued by the federal government. The General Professions Directorate (DGP), a branch of the Public Education Secretariat (SEP) is in char ge of regulating the practice of profession. The profession of nursing in Mexico is not self-regulating (CGFNS, 1996). License Renewal A nursing license in Mexico is good for life a nd does not have to be renewed. Licenses are granted once and can be cancelled only if the licensee breaches a ny law regulating the profession. Scope of Practice Legislation regulating professi onal nursing practice in Mexico is by means of general professional legislation. The ICN Code of Ethics and the Code adopted by the Pan American Federation of Nursing Professiona ls are frameworks recognized by nurses in Mexico and other Latin American countries (Malvarez and Agudelo, 2005). Supply and Demand Approximately 65.1 percent of the nursing workforce in Mexico consists of registered nurses (graduates of diploma and baccalaureate programs). The remainder are considered Auxiliary Nurses, a title that is comparable to that of a nurse aide in the United St ates. Mexico does have some maldistribution of nurses, with fewer working in rural th an urban areas (Siantz, 2008). Mexican officials have sought to upgrade nursing education by requiring completion of a full primary and secondary education prior to ente ring any nursing program , thus making Mexican- educated nurses more competitive in the global mark et than they had been when the majority of nurses were educated at the sec ondary school level. The United St ates, in particular, recruits Mexican nurses to meet the health and comm unication needs of its la rge Hispanic patient population. Issues and Challenges Nursing Autonomy: For many years, nursing associati ons and organizations in Mexico have worked internally and through international organizations and processes, for example ICN, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) a nd the Trilateral Initiative for North American Nursing, to establish the autonomy of nursing over its educational and practice st andards and regulation. Studies show that nursing is a human resour ce in high demand in developed countries in Latin America, yet, at the same time, suffers from a reduction in collective bargaining power, reduced salaries, cuts in overtim e pay, closure of government-level nursing departments, the absence of safety measur es in the workplace, loss of professional PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Consequently, to improve their working conditions and th eir salaries, many nurses educ ated in Mexico leave to obtain positions in the United States.

Generally, nursing e ducation is in institutions of higher learning, formal licensure and/or registra tion systems are in place, and scopes of practice focus on health promotion and mainte nance in the provision of care. The overview of both historic and emerging count ries supplying nurses to the U.S. workforce provides a kaleidoscope of compelling issues that must be addressed to successfully integrate foreign-educated nurses into the U.S. nursing wo rkforce. The capacity of the United States to deal with issues associated with this migration will have signifi cant impact on nursing education, nursing practice, service delivery and health policy. In particular , the need to recognize the positive contribution of the migrating nurse to patients who share with the nurse a country, language or culture of origin is relevant. The rapid emergence of trade and mutual recognition agreements must be taken into account, as th ey directly affect nurse migration patterns, possibilities and challenges. TRADE AND MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS The migration of nurses in many parts of the wo rld has been influenced by the development of regional and international tr ade and mutual recognition agreem ents. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (OTR) reports that the inte rnational mobility of business professionals providing services has become an important aspect of competitive markets for both suppliers and consumers. Trade agreements that provide for the movement of goods and services across country boundaries have facilitated the migratio n of nurses for decades. The Agreement that has most affected the nursing profession in the United States is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). North American Free Trade Agreement (Trade NAFTA) Trade NAFTA provides for the movement of goods and services across the borders of Canada, Mexico and the United States. The h ealth professions liste d under NAFTA include nurses, clinical laboratory sc ientists, physical therapists and occupational therapists. In 1994, Trade NAFTA eased immigr ation requirements for nurses educated in Canada and Mexico, allowing them to more easily cross the borders of the United States for purposes of employment. There was no restric tion on the number of Canadian nurses who could enter. The number of Mexican nurses, however, was capped at 5500 per year for 10 years. Trade NAFTA was renewed in 2004 and the cap lifted. To enter the country under Trade NAFTA status th e nurse must be a citizen of either Canada or Mexico, have a written job offer from a U.S. employer, and hold a nursing license in Canada or Mexico as well as in the U.S. state of intended practice. Nurses who migrated to either Canada or Mexico from such countries as India, Jama ica, the Philippines a nd the United Kingdom and became citizens of either country are eligible fo r TN status if they meet the qualifications (Richardson and Davis, 2009).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-50 Canadian Nurses The majority of nurses holding TN status are fro m Canada and are not required to have a visa to enter the United States. Many TN nurses co mmute between Canada and the states of Michigan, Maine, and Minnesota on a daily basis. The Canadian nurse only needs to show proof of citizenship, a letter of intended employment, the requi red licenses, and the CGFNS VisaScreen Certificate at the Canadian port of en try, which can be at a border crossing or an airport. Mexican Nurses The TN process for Mexican nurses is more co mplex. It requires a visa, consular processing, a labor certification filed by th e employer, and an I-129 petition for nonimmigrant workers. Mexican nurses also must present a CGFNS VisaScreen Certificate as part of the visa process. The educational comparability requirement of the VisaScreen Program has been difficult to meet for Mexican-educated nurses because nurse educat ors in the United States and Canada consider the majority of nursing education programs in Me xico to be at the voca tional level (Richardson and Davis, 2009). Since 2005, CGFNS and the International Bilingual Nurses Alliance have worked with the Mexican nursing community, the Mexican consul ate, the Mexican Overseas Program, and the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (SEP\u2014Public E ducation Secretariat) to develop consistent nursing education standards and ensure licensure validation processes in an effort to minimize the challenges for Mexican nurses who wish to mi grate. Mexican nurses also have the challenge of English language proficiency, which is gene rally not an issue for Canadians entering under TN status (Richardson and Davis, 2009). Duration of Trade NAFTA Status Initially, TN status duration was for a 1-year period and nurses were required to renew it annually. In October 2008, the Depa rtment of Homeland Security ex tended the duration for up to 3 years. The number of renewals that a nurse may apply for is currently unlimited; however, opponents to Trade NAFTA believe that renewal of TN status should be limited and not be used as a permanent form of temporary status. A benef it of TN status is that it is not affected by external factors such as immigra tion retrogression, whic h limits the num ber of visas issued when the number of applicants exceeds the number of available visas (Richardson and Davis, 2009). Trilateral Initiative for North American Nursing The 1995 1996 Trilateral Initiativ e for North American Nursing, funded by a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, was the first effort by the nurs ing profession to systematically compare and contrast nursing standards across North America. It came as a response to Trade NAFTA, which specifically urged the professions \u2014including nursing\u2014to develop mu tually acceptable standards for licensing and certification that would permit greater mobility of professionals across the borders of Canada, Mexico and the United States. NAFTA offered tremendous opportunity for nurses from the three countries to collaborate on education, research and practice across borders . The hope was that by strengthening the nursing PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-51 profession through cross border co llaboration and exchange, nursi ng and health care also would be strengthened. The goals of the Trilateral were: To encourage the developmen t of mutually acceptable standards for education, program approval and accreditation, licensure/registr ation and specialty certification among Canada, Mexico and the US in order to advance the nursing profession across North America. To establish a lasting, viable network of key nursing orga nizations and professionals across North America. To create a methodology that would demonstr ate how other professional groups in the three countries could consult, develop goals and programs, and institute policies to increase cross border co operation (CGFNS, 1996). An in-depth analysis was considered crucial by the 40 key nursing organizations participating in the project because not only did the educati onal standards vary among the three countries but also the level of autonomy in standards development. For example, in Canada, nursing has autonomy in the development of education st andards and the approval of nursing education programs. In the United States this is a governme nt function that is delegated to the profession. In Mexico, the standards that gove rn nursing education are general st andards, that is, they are not specific to nursing, but rather govern education as a whole. They are developed by the government and the schools. There also were differences in accreditation systems and pa thways into practice among the countries. The accreditation systems in Canada and the United States were considered comparable while nursing in Mexico was in th e process of developing an accreditation system. In each of the three countries there were various pathways to entry into nursing practice and different competencies associated with each pathway. Regulatory systems and nursing specialty certification were more comparable in th e United States and Canada (CGFNS, 1996). Because of the variance among the three countries, participants recognized the need for more in-depth understanding of the programs and sy stems operating in the three countries. While Phase II of the Trilateral did not come to fruiti on due to lack of funding for the project, a number of nursing organizations and researchers since then have examined the effect of regulation and specialty certification on health outcomes and have attempted to coordinate trilateral research efforts. Mexican nursing organizations have used the preliminary work of the Trilateral to upgrade nursing and to increase participation in st andard setting for the profession in Mexico (CGFNS, 1996). General Agreement in Trad e and Services (GATS) The General Agreement of Trade in Services (GATS), established in January 1995, addresses the areas of service delivery that are considered barriers to trade. GATS is a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement among 140 countries, the goal of which is to remove restrictions and governmental regulations in agreements cove ring international trade in services. The GATS has two parts: (1) general rules and disciplines and (2) specific commitments on access to individual countries' domestic markets by foreign suppliers. Each country decides which services are to be included and the degree of ope ration. There are four methods of service trade: PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This \"movement of natural persons\" would include professionals in specialty occupations, nurses and other health care workers. Governments that make commitments to allow foreign suppliers to provide education or health services in their markets can enforce the same standards for the protection of the public on foreign suppliers as on nationals, and can ind eed impose additional requi rements if they so choose. GATS supports utilization of professional standards of licensure. There is no exemption from regulations that are required of a country 's citizens. Licensing requirements are not considered burdensome in the provision of qua lity service or a restri ction on the supply of service, if they are based on objective and transpar ent criteria such as competency and capability (WTO, 2010). Singapore/Chile Agreement The Free Trade Accords of the Americas (F TAA), initiated between 2002 and 2005, involve 34 western hemisphere countries. The United Stat es has signed agreements with Singapore and Chile with the goal of lowering perceived trade barriers, such as visas, licensing, testing and intellectual property rights\u2014even though th e general philosophy of GATS regarding professional standards and licensure does not support the percei ved contention that they are barriers to trade (B runo et al., 2004). Mutual Recognition Agreements Mutual recognition agreements exist within th e larger context of gl obalization to address barriers to mobility, such as the differences between the standards and procedures imposed by national regulatory authorities in different countries. The pro cess of mutual recognition is complex and requires a comparison of frameworks developed in different cultural, social and economic contexts. The greater the degree of di fferences between the parties to a mutual recognition agreement (e.g. educatio nal systems, standards, appro aches to regulation, level of development, etc), the more challenging it is to achieve success in the process (ICN, 2009b). Mutual recognition requires that the countries in question have in place a system for regulating professionals. It is based on the notion of equivalence or co mparability, through which it is understood that the host c ountry's regulatory goals also are addressed by home country regulation. When aspects of the host country's regulation are not met (e.g., differences in nursing knowledge, differences in scope of practice), th e host country is permitted to set additional requirements for recognition (ICN, 2009b). There ar e several mutual recognition agreements in nursing: The European Union (EU): There has been a recipro cal recognition of nursing qualifications designed to facilitate the m obility of nurses in the European Community for over 30 years. Through the 2007 Directive on Mutual R ecognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) , the EU reformed its system for recognition of professional qualifications in order to make labor mark ets more flexible, further liberalize the PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-53 provision of services, encourage more au tomatic recognition of qualifications, and simplify administrative procedures (European Commission, 2009a). Seven professions were covered by a seri es of \"sectoral\" directives: physician, general nurse, midwife, veterinary surgeon, de ntal surgeon, pharmacist and architect. The resulting directives provide for the harmoni zation of minimum training requirements and the automatic recognition of professional qualifications for these professions (European Commission, 2009b). The directive for general nurses sets out the minimal competency requirements that nurses must meet before they can practice acr oss the borders of Europe's member states. It also stipulates that programs lead ing to registration as a nurse should be at least 3 years in length or of 4600 hours duration (Hakesley-Brown, 2009). These directives on nursing education re flect the ongoing work of the Bologna Process in Europe. The education of nurses in Europe varies by country, ranging from vocational education and training, which is no t part of higher education, to baccalaureate education for nurses. Most nurses in Europe are educated at the diploma level (Hakesley- Brown, 2009). To carry out the policies of the Bologna Pr ocess, Europe launched the Tuning Project in 2000. The Nursing Project Group was one of th e first health care re lated groups to be set up, with the task of faci litating the desi gn/redesign, developmen t, implementation and evaluation of nursing education programs for each of the Bologna cycles: undergraduate, graduate and doctoral level work. In an atte mpt to preserve the uniqueness and diversity of European education, the group examined the comparability of coursework, expressed in terms of learning outcomes and competen cies. Today, developing a European model of nursing education remains a work in progress (Hakesley-Brown, 2009). Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement (TTMRA): MRA that applies to New Zealand and all Australian states and territo ries, except Western Australia. It recognizes equivalent nursing registrati on and provides a streamlined re gistration process for nurses migrating between the countries. The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM): Created Regional Examination Nurse Registration (RENR), which has enabled the movement of registered nurses among signatory countries of the region. Internal Mutual Recognition Agreements: In-country agreements between states, provinces and territories that provide for th e mobility of the nursing workforce in that country. The Nurse Licensure Compact in the Un ited States and the Mutual Recognition Agreement of the Registration Bodies for Regi stered Nurses in Canada are two examples (ICN, 2009b). The Eastern, Central and Southern African College of Nursing (ECSACON): Agreement on scopes of practice, standards for practice, competencies and core content and standards for education among 14 countries in east, central and southern Africa. The focus is on health policy, nursing and midw ifery practices, and health care delivery (Ndlovu et al., 2003). PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, the emergence of such agreements also raises such questions as: How will the scope of nursing practice in a global marketplace be defined and determined? Is global licensure for nurses inevitable? How will the cooperation and recognition needed to ensure competency of nurses across borders be gained? Who will bear the cost? How will disciplinary actions be addressed? Educational Agreements In addition to trade and mutual recognition agreements, agreements also have been negotiated between foreign and U.S. nursing school s to provide clinical experience, internships and language proficiency programs. For example th e International University of Nursing in St. Kitts attracts international student s for nursing. It uses U.S. faculty in its program and has signed agreements with universities in the United States and Canada to provide part of the student's theory and clinical education, thus giving the graduate a dual degree. In 2005 more than 40,000 qualified students were turned away from U.S. nursing schools because of capacity limitations. At that time , through an agreement between agencies in the Ukraine and South Carolina, nursi ng schools in the Ukraine agreed to educate U.S. students in English. The education was to be subsidized by hosp itals in South Carolina with the intent that the graduating nurses would return to South Caro lina to enter practice. Implementation of the program has stalled. Schools of nursing in Korea have negotiated in ternships with U.S. schools of nursing and U.S. hospitals are working with schools of nursing in Mexico to provide clinical and language orientation for nursing students. La Universidad Autonomade in Guadalajara, Mexico provides bilingual nursing programs\u2014program s in Spanish for those staying in Mexico and in English for nurses intending to migrate. Summary Nursing in the United States has been a l eader in internationa l nursing and thus any initiatives made by nursing leadership to shape th e future of nursing in the United States has a disproportionate impact on the global nursing community. This paper has documented several current challenges that globalization has crea ted for nursing interna tionally. It also has documented the complexity of those challe nges. As the Committee moves towards its recommendations, accelerating globalization makes it clear that these recommendations must be framed within an understanding of their international implications and imp act. The authors of this paper have identified some key intern ational issues that might influence domestic deliberations and planning.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-55 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES NURSE WORK FORCE The Global Nursing Shortage \"The issues surrounding nursing sh ortages and global nurse migra tion are inextricably linked. Global nurse migration has become a major phe nomenon impacting health service delivery in both developed and developing countries. The ph enomenon has created a global labor market for health professionals and has fueled internati onal recruitment. Intern ational migration and recruitment have become dominant features of th e international health policy debate\" (Nichols, 2007). The global nurse shortage is supported by the escalating demands from developed countries, such as the United States, to meet patient care ne eds. International nurse recruits are viewed as options to balance a country's national nursing supply and demand. The dependence of hospitals and health systems in developed countries on nurses educated outside of their borders is substantive and enduring. With th e aging of populations in deve loped countries, the need for health care services is increasing. Moreove r, changing technology and rising consumer expectations place further demand on health care systems. Since the domestic source of nurses in many developed countries is not keeping up with the increased demand fo r nurses, the gap has been, and will continue to be, filled by foreign-educated nurses. In short, for myriad reasons, in both developed and developing countries there is increasing difficulty in attracting and retaining nurses. The Immigration Policy Center of the Ameri can Immigration Council notes that immigrants comprise more than one-quarter of all physicians and surgeons in the United States, and roughly one-fifth of all nursing, psychiat ric and home-health aides. In the case of doctors and nurses, recent projections indicate that even if medical school and nur sing school rates rise among the native populations, this will not be sufficient to pr event shortages, at least in the near term (Immigration Policy Center, 2009). The flow of foreign-educated nurses has remained constant, affected only by immigration policies, which are being reconsidered in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy because of high rates of unempl oyment, political opposition and the economy. The number of migrating nurses gene rally increases in re sponse to the demands from health care employers. Other external factors appear to have little or no influence. Experience has shown that even when natural disasters have occurred, such as in India, Indonesia, and Haiti, nurses from those countries continue to pursue migration. After the events of September 11, 2001, some assumed and worried that the fear of terroris m and conflict in the United States would reduce the interest of fore ign-educated nurses in coming to this country. Quite the contrary\u2014CGFNS, which screens fore ign-educated nurses fo r immigration purposes, saw only a handful of nurses cancel their plans. Indeed, what th e nurses shared was that they were not strangers to such in stances of violence and upheaval . Although the size and impact of 9/11 was horrific, the nurses saw it as a rarity compared to the mo re frequent conflicts they were exposed to in their home countries. Nursing in the United States remains attractive to foreign- educated nurses personally, professionally a nd economically because of the opportunities and quality of life it provides. The United States has the largest professional nurs e workforce in the world; yet, according to a study by Buerhaus et al (2009) there will be a projected shortfall of nurses developing around 2018. As a result of these projections, it is likely that the demand for registered nurses educated PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-56 in other countries will increase. In other words, foreign-educated nurses will be a permanent feature of the U.S. nursing workforce for the foreseeable future. It should be noted that the downturn in the world economy in 2009 has affected the health care workforce internationally. Hospitals have re vised plans to expand their facilities, have closed beds and units that were not producing revenue, and have restructured their workforce. Those that have collective bargaining agreements are seeking to revise salaries and benefits. These changes, for example, meant that in 2009 large urban hospitals in Philadelphia, PA reported having no vacancies for new graduate nurs es; however, hospitals in smaller cities in the northeastern part of the state did have vacanci es and were actively seeking nurses. The demand for experienced, specialty nurses continues to increase. Critical care, emergency care and the operating room are areas for wh ich hospitals are recruiting. Despite the downturn in the economy, the migrati on of nurses across inte rnational borders is expected to be on-going. Therefore, the successful adjustment of foreign-educated nurses to U.S. practice is critical. The 2004 Nati onal Sample Survey of Registered Nurses estimated that, in terms of workforce diversity, 82 percent of U.S. nurses are white (non-Hispanic), and blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in relation to their proportion to the U.S. population. Foreign- educated nurses, however, are more likely to be Asian. Hence, the inte rnational migration of nurses to the United States, historically, ha s not mirrored the under-represented minority populations of black and Hispanic. The cultural lack of fit between patient and provider has been adequately documented and is germane to this issue. Health Policy Workforce Planning Issues Good workforce planning should focus on increas ing investment in the supply of nurses and other health professionals to meet the demands of all countries. A major challenge for all countries is to establish workforce planning mech anisms that effectively address the demands for health care and provide workforce stability. In 2004, when examining the policy implications of nurse migration, Aiken and colleagues highlighted that, \"The most promising strategy for achieving international balance and health workforce resources is for each country to have an adequate and sustainabl e source of health professionals,\" which includes the need for developed count ries to be more diligent in exploring actions to stabilize and increas e the domestic supply of nurses (Aiken et al., 2004, p. 75). They go on to add that, \" Developed countries growing indepe ndence on foreign-trained nurses is largely a system of failed policies and underinvestment in nursing.\" Similar arguments were noted in the conclusions from a research and policy retreat entitled, Human Resources for Health: National Needs and Global Concerns , which identified national self sufficiency as a goal. Attaining self suffi ciency also was noted in two key international policy documents: The Joint Learning Initiative Report and the ICN report: The Global Nursing Shortage: Priority Areas for Intervention. The ICN Report (2006, p. 12) notes that building national self sufficiency to manage domestic issues of supply and demand, in rich and poor countries alike, is critical. Planning efforts should require that the United States establish a national system that monitors the inflow of foreign nurses, their countries of origin, the states and settings in which they work, and their impact on the nursing shorta ge. In order to ensure that the nursing care needs of the public are met, a broader workforce policy is needed that balances foreign nurse recruitment and domestic needs.

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.htmlINTERNATIONAL MODELS OF NURSING J-57 Much of the work done on workforce planning has yet to be fully integr ated with emergent technologies, in particular, te lehealth and tele-education. While countries work to establish, maintain and improve regulatory practices a nd policies, upgrade educational programs and improve patient care, health ca re and health care education ar e systematically transcending national and international boundari es, creating global communities. These technologies have the potential to create new appro aches to harmonizing curricula, c oordinating international policy, and tracking migrating nurses throughout the world. Experts in these technologies will be essential resources for the future of nursing in the United States. Ethical and Moral Challenges Perhaps the most daunting aspect of creating a plan for the future of nursing in the United States, shaped by a deep unders tanding of globalization, involves the ethics of choice. Many issues surrounding the global nu rsing shortage, the impact of globalization, the goal of international standards, and th e establishment of diverse trad e and related agreements have ethical and moral dilemmas imbedded within them. It requires that the Committee examine human rights issues and issues of equity. Because globalization and migration have dramatically increased the multi-cultural characteristics of the health workforce, in genera l, and the nursing workforce, in particular, this country will, more and more, consist of people fr om different ethnic backgrounds who need to be fully integrated into the workplace in a way that respects diversity. As has been noted by current studies on immigra tion, our present patterns of immigration in the United States are different from the past. The United States, built largely on immigrants from European countries, now attracts immigrants from the African, Arab and Asian nations\u2014a much more diverse array of cultures and countries. As the United States increasingly becomes a more multi-ethnic, pluralistic and linguistically diverse society, the possibilities for misunderstandings, mixed messages and errors in communication are inevitable. To address and/or prevent the disruptiveness of thes e factors while deli vering care, cultural competence and cultural sensitivity must be ad ded to the knowledge and skills needed for nursing practice in the future. C ontinuing health policy should be developed that pro-actively manages a well-prepared, multicultural, multilingua l, multiethnic, and multireligious workforce and fosters the development of intercultural wor kplaces. Such policies will need to address not only the challenges associated w ith integrating the foreign-educated nurse into the U.S. workforce, but also the challenges faced by co-workers experiencing the introduction of new cultures. As the population ages, a greater demand for nurses with the skills necessary to provide safe, effective care to the elderly, as we ll as the ability to apply new t echnologies, also will be needed. In short, changing U.S. demographics will requi re that nurses have knowledge and skill in cultural competence, care of the elderly, and use of technology. As competition and demand for skilled nurses in crease, ethical recruitment practices must balance the rights of individuals to migrate and at the same time prevent adverse effects on source countries' health systems. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (1948) underscores that point. There has been considerable critique of the migration of nurses from less developed to developed countries as irresponsible brain drain. Ho wever, numerous factors relate to the migration of health workers from developing countries resulting in insufficient numbers in the source country's workforce. These include in-country weakness in po licies and restrictions related to wages, recruitment, deployment, tr ansfer, and promotion (V ujicic et al., 2009).

All rights reserved.The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12956.html THE FUTURE OF NURSING: LEADING CHANGE, ADVANCING HEALTH J-58 Kingma (2006) notes that since mo st nurses work in the public sector, failure of governments to fill vacant positions may cause in-country unemployment and encourage migration. Governmental policies on remittances and return migration also are factors that encourage nurses to seek employment in other countries. As this paper demonstrates, th e brain drain assumption can be an over-simplification of a profoundl y complex issue. While developed countries continuing to recruit professional workers from de veloping countries is a serious ethical issue, the rights of professionals to fi nd a better life in another countr y is equally compelling as an ethical issue. Efforts have emerged to address the dilemma of balancing the rights of individuals to migrate with the potential loss of esse ntial health care services in source countries. In 2004 the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a resolution urging member stat es to develop strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of international mi gration and develop an international code of practice. The International C ouncil of Nurses, Sigma Theta Tau International, and the Commonwealth Secretariat have issued codes th at provide guidelines and methods to improve the ethical recruitment and treatm ent of health care workers. The United States, in 2009, issued The Ethical Code for Recru itment of Foreign-Educated Nurses , a voluntary code for ethica l recruitment practices devel oped by an Advisory Council of stakeholders that was convened by AcademyHealt h, a private sector heal th policy organization. The stakeholders were composed of representa tives of unions, hospitals , nursing organizations, regulatory bodies, credentials eval uators, recruiters, staffing agencies and immigration attorneys. The goal was to reduce the harm and increase the benefits of internationa l nurse recruitment for source countries, host countries, U.S. patients, and migrant nurses. The task force has evolved into the Allia nce for Ethical International Recruitment Practices. Subscribers to the Code will agree to ab ide by it. Nurses will be able to refer possible violations of the Code to the Alliance, which w ill then assist in resolution of the infractions or refer to advocacy or government bodies. This work is essential as it focuses on the actual practices of greatest concern\u2014agg ressive, predatory recruitment pr actices that are abusive to nurses seeking a better life for themselves and th eir families. U.S. nursing leaders will need to pro-actively implement these guidelines and cont inue to monitor abuses that may emerge. The WHO Code of Practice on the Internationa l Recruitment of Health Personnel will be presented for discussion and/or adoption at the 63rd World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland in May, 2010. The Code is voluntary, global in scope, and directed at health workers, recruiters, employers, health professional organizations and re levant regional and/or global entities. The Code provides principles applicable to the inte rnational recruitment of health personnel in a manner that promotes an equitable balance of interests among health workers in source and destination (host) countries (WHO, 2010). In conclusion, it is the hope of the authors th at this paper provides helpful information to guide the Committee's deliberations and decisions. Our effort to synthesize a massive amount of information demonstrates an honest endeavor to place the future of nursing in the United States within an international context, sensitive to the impact of escal ating globalization. U.S. nurse leaders will continue to play a central role in the future of nursing internationa lly. It is our hope that the work of this Committee will encourage their collaborative endeavors with international governments, communities, nursing organizations and nurses to enhance the profession of nursing worldwide.
