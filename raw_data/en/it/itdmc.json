Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate. I was recently proscribed 'homeopathic granules' to treat a chest infection by my french doctor, and I'm think about changing doctor now because I've lost all faith in him and his methods. All the studies I've read say that any effect from homeopathic medecine is just the placebo / therapeutic effect (i.e. that going to see a doctor and the act of taking pills and thinking that they work, as well as having someone take an interest in your health is what causes the effect, not the pills or the treatment in any way. Moreover, the idea of 'strengthening by dilution' and 'a little bit of the bad stuff = opposite effect' don't sway me at all, and I'm really interested to hear why people still believe this (beyond anecdotal evidence that can be put down to the therapeutic and placebo effects). I'm a rational science person so I'd appreciate a rational explanation, or at least observable results proving that it works, as we have to most 'regular' allopathic medicine. "}
