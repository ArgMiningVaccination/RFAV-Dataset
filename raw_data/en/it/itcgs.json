It also helps cleanse and detoxify the blood and body as a whole. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR HEALTH PRACTITIONER PRIOR TO BEGINNING TREATMENT. PRACTITIONERS MAY ALSO CALL US FOR MORE PRODUCT INFORMATION. Depending on the condition of your system, you may experience toxins being released, or a healing response. Healing is good, but to minimize any discomfort, we suggest that you begin with the MILD PROTOCOL. Those with HIGH SENSITIVITY (High toxic load, toxic metals, pesticide residues, Candidiasis, Multiple chemical hypersensitivity, Hyperacidity, Chronic inflammation, Auto-immune ailments, etc.) should start with just 3-5 drops once a day, building up over 5 weeks to 10ml twice daily. A: MILD DETOXIFICATION Week 1: 2.5 ml in the morning Week 2: 2.5 ml morning & evening Week 3: 5 ml morning & evening Week 4+: 10 ml morning and evening (5 ml = 1 tsp.) Duration: 3 bottles (9-10 weeks) B: MODERATE DETOXIFICATION 10 mL Regulat\u00ae in the morning and evening Duration: 3 bottles (6-7 weeks) or 6 bottles (12-14 weeks) NOTE: - A dose of two (2) teaspoons per day (10mL) is the recommended long-term dosage for moderate detoxification and for strengthening and bringing more balance to the physiology. - There is generally no negative effect on long-term therapy from occasionally reducing the dosage (e.g., two teaspoons per day for 3 weeks followed by one teaspoon per day for 2 weeks). C: DYNAMIC DETOXIFICATION THERAPY We use this therapy especially for those who are of normal health, or may have evidence of an ailment building up, as a preventive detoxification and deacidification program. So it is for those who are not in the High or Moderate Sensitivity category: Day 1-3 5 mL (1 tsp) Regulat in the morning (before breakfast) Day 4-7 5 mL (1 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Week 2 10 mL (2 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Week 3 20 mL (4 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Week 4 20 mL (4 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Week 5 20 mL (4 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Week 6 10 mL (2 tsp) Regulat in the morning and evening Duration: 3-4 bottles (6 weeks) GENERAL CLEANSING GUIDELINES If detoxification and/or discomfort is strong due to toxins being released - skin outbreaks, mucous, muscle pain, etc. - then simply halve the dosage or stop taking Regulat\u00ae for 1-2 days until healing actions subside. - In the beginning, you may wish to take chelating agents such as Slippery Elm, Chlorella, Spirulina or Zeolite powder. - Proper hydration of 1-2 liters of water a day is required to facilitate maximum elimination of toxins mobilized by Regulat\u00ae. - In addition, high-water content foods (fruits and vegetables) will support this effect. Take enough rest so that the body has the foundation for healing itself. - Use the supplied plastic measure cup, not a metal spoon- Regulat\u00ae may be diluted with water or red grape juice according to personal taste. PRACTITIONER TESTIMONIALS I use Regulat\u00ae to help detoxify the body during Ayurveda treatments. It is excellent to help cleanse the body in a natural way. Prakash R.E. Madari , MD, Ayurveda. Lelystad, The Netherlands We intensively use Regulat\u00ae for acid base regulation, which result occurs due to Regulat\u00ae stimulating the anaerobic intestinal flora and improving deacidification and detoxification. Dr. Thomas Rau, MD, Paracelsus Clinic, Switzerland This simple drink has been extremely effective in eradicating mycoplasma and other cell walldeficient microbes. Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt, MD, PhD Removing acids from the body with Regulat\u00ae is an important first step in re-establishing normal, effective metabolism as part of the anti-aging process. Dr. Byron Braid, MD I have been using Regulat\u00ae in my practice for about 1 year with great satisfaction of my patients. I use it as a free radical neutralizer for cancer and autoimmune system diseases. After using Regulat\u00ae for about 1 week many patients are noticing increased energy and a sense of well-being. I am pleased to have the opportunity to add this wonderful phytonutrient to my practice. H.
