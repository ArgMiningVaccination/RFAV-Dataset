As individuals, we may be attracted to different yoga styles, different teachers, different experiences, and different ways of learning. Our natures, personalities, and preferences suggest that we may each need a unique approach to answer the eternal questions: Who am I? Who do I want to be? How can I live a more skillful, meaningful, and fulfilling life? Kripalu celebrates these differences and welcomes all seekers in a way that meets each individual exactly where they are. Rather than adopt a dogmatic, single-view approach to yoga and experiential learning, we offer a wide array of programs and experiences to serve the highest needs of everyone open to finding meaning and purpose in life. While each Kripalu experience is unique to the guest or student, the result is often the same\u2014an inspiring sense of self-compassion and joyful wonder as people rediscover the truth that we are all brilliantly special and unique, all profoundly connected to every other living being, and all fully empowered to live the life we want to live. I invite you to find a program that is right for you, exactly as you are, in this time and place. At Kripalu, you will be welcomed with open arms, warm hearts, and friendly smiles. We've been waiting for you, and we're glad you found us as you follow your own path to self-discovery and skillful living.

As a Kripalu Yoga teacher, he's giving them the tools to change the course of their lives. \"From my many years as a prosecutor, I know that a key to preventing recurring criminal behavior is altering some of the internal forces and disconnects that drive criminal and other antisocial behavior,\" Carl says. \"From my training and research, I know that yoga has been proven to be able to do just that.\" A graduate of Kripalu Yoga Teacher Training and the Kripalu Yoga in the Schools (KYIS) Teacher Training (which he attended with the help of a Kripalu scholarship), Carl has created an ongoing yoga program in a residential facility for adolescents in Social Services custody, sharing yoga techniques to reduce stress and self-regulate their behavior. Every week, the kids share with him how a breathing or relaxation technique they learned in class helped them stay calm in a difficult moment. Research shows that yoga and other contemplative practices can help young people better regulate their emotions and actions in healthy ways. Findings from studies initiated by the Kripalu Institute for Extraordinary Living indicate that students who have been exposed to the evidence-based KYIS curriculum are less reactive, more optimistic, and better able to manage their own behavior. \"Multiple studies on yoga's impact on adolescents show that regular practice increases self-esteem and mental and physical well-being, strengthens coping mechanisms, reduces anxiety, and improves mood and the ability to self-regulate emotions,\" says Sat Bir S. Khalsa, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Research Director for Kripalu. \"Qualitative data collection reveals that adolescents' self-awareness and ease in their body increase [with regular yoga practice], and their worldview begins to shift toward a more positive alignment.\" We're investing in positive change. You can help.Making an Impact Providing Adolescents with Powerful T ools for a Happier, Healthier LifeKripalu Y oga teachers are bringing the benefits of regular practice to at-risk kids. The true measure of our mission is the impact we have on people's lives, at our retreat center and in the world.Our mission in action Aron Steward is a Kripalu Y oga teacher and assistant director of the Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center in Colchester, V ermont, the only locked facility in the state, with 30 beds for kids ages 10 to 18. Since graduating from Kripalu Y oga T eacher T raining last year, she has sent nine Woodside staff members to Kripalu to attend the Kripalu Approach to Healthy Living program, with the support of Kripalu scholarships. \"They've come back not only with tools for taking better care of themselves, but also with a whole new perspective on how to work with the kids,\" Aron says. \"They're using breathing techniques, meditation, and mindfulness to intervene when there's a crisis. My mission is to build a strength-based treatment program out of what has historically been a detention center, and Kripalu Y oga is a fundamental supporting element of this transformation.\" How important is yoga for adolescents in general, and particularly for those who are at risk? Says Carl, whose vision is for yoga to ultimately become part of the rehabilitative process statewide, \"If yoga can teach them to self-regulate\u2014and we know that it can, from personal experience and from the science\u2014it's possible that this could be the most important thing that could happen to them.\" Find out about the Kripalu Yoga in the Schools (KYIS) program and the KYIS Teacher Training kripalu.org/kyis Support our mission-driven initiatives, including the Kripalu Scholarship Program and KYIS kripalu.org/makeagift800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 29 Kripalu | PRESENTERS AND PROGRAMS Our programs are now categorized by theme so that you can easily find the programs that interest you.

We choose a time right after Christmas so we can start off the year feeling happy and healthy. We call it our annual yoga and knitting retreat, because during the day we do lots of yoga, take R&R Retreat workshops, go on walks, and get massages, and at night we sit together and knit and catch up. We've been coming to Kripalu together for eight years. It's so peaceful and nurturing here\u2014when you walk in the door, it's like a warm blanket settling around your shoulders. It's a time for us to get completely nourished, slow down, and take stock. It's a time to reconnect\u2014so much laughter when we're together! Last fall, we lost our mom, so our time at Kripalu this year was also about healing. She and our dad were very health con- scious; they raised us on organic food that we grew in our own garden, way before organic gardening was popular. We've always been aware of living a healthy lifestyle, and being here has given us so many more practices that we can use every day.

Fall Food and Fitness Retreat p. 52 How can we incorporate mindfulness and contemplation into outdoor activities? When you're physically active outdoors, it naturally enlivens your focus and mindfulness. If you're climbing over rocks or roots, walking on slippery or rough terrain, you have to pay attention. I like to take cues from the environment; if I hear a brook rushing or wind blowing, I'll stop and listen. Y ou never know what you're going to find, and that reinforces the feeling of being part of something bigger. Any suggestions on how to keep enjoying nature as the temperature turns cooler? Make sure you have the proper gear for staying dry and warm, but don't overdress, and vent your heat as needed. T ry drinking warm tea with a dash of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, or even some ghee (clarified butter) before or after heading outdoors. How can I get the benefits of nature while living in the city? Connecting with nature is about being nourished by the elements\u2014ether, air, fire, water, and earth, according to Ayurveda. T o connect with the ether element, find wide-open spaces\u2014parks or rooftops. T o absorb the air element, walk a few blocks instead of taking the subway, and take deep, full breaths. For fire, celebrate light, warmth, and radiance by lighting a candle, or a fireplace if you have one. Y ou can experience the water element year-round, by walking in the rain, building a snowman, or taking a bath. For the earth element, spend some time every day walking barefoot around your home.

Are you eating just because it's a habit, or are you craving something else, like emotional sustenance? What will truly satisfy you right now? Bring this level of consciousness and focus into your decision about what to eat. CLEAR A SPACE\u2014BOTH EMOTIONALL Y AND PHYSICALL Y Make time for your meal so that you don't feel rushed, and set an attractive place at the table, even if you're eating alone. T urn off the radio, television, and digital devices, and remove books, magazines, and newspapers, so you can be in the moment and focus on savoring your meal. SLOW DOWN AND GIVE THANKS T ake a few breaths before you begin. Y ou can use these moments to bring yourself fully to the table, acknowledging your gratitude to the earth, the sun, the plants, the farmers, and everything else involved in delivering this food to your table. CHEW IT OVER Digestion begins with the act of chewing; saliva con- tains enzymes that chemically break down food. The more you chew, the more efficiently you absorb nutrients. Slow yourself down by placing your utensils on the table between bites\u2014or try chopsticks. ENGAGE ALL YOUR SENSES Appreciate not only the taste of your food, but also how it looks on your plate and how good it smells. Consider the nutrients you're receiving. Appre- ciate every aspect of what you're eating before you take the next bite. TAKE A BREAK FROM THE MENTAL CHATTER See if you can allow your mental commentary to take a backseat as you let the sensual act of eating fully occupy your mind. When you inevitably hear the commentary starting up, refocus on the taste, aroma, and experience of eating. T ry out these steps while eating something simple\u2014a few nuts that need to be shelled, or a piece of fruit. Applying these concepts to a modest snack is a great way to start your mindful-eating practice.

Refrigerate or freeze until set. Place a round of wax paper or parchment paper over crust, including the rim, and weight bottom and sides with dried beans. Bake until crust starts to firm, about 15 minutes. Remove paper and beans. Place pan over a square of aluminum foil; bring foil up over crust edges to keep crust from browning too much.

Presenter IndexOff the Mat What brought you to your current role at Kripalu? I had a midlife cooking crisis, and decided I really wanted to cook food that was healthy and nutritious. I started at Kripalu as Chef de Cuisine, and became Executive Chef in 2013. What inspires and motivates you? I love feeding and teaching the guests at Kripalu. When returning guests tell me, \"I think about you every time I chop cilantro\" or \"Y ou totally changed my world with that garlic trick,\" I realize how much of an impact my team and I can make. The things I know about cooking can help others better nourish themselves and their loved ones. What's the perfect fall harvest meal? Roasted butternut squash soup with ch\u00e8vre, cider-glazed chicken (or tofu or tempeh for a vegetarian meal), roasted root vegetables, maple Brussels sprouts, wild mushroom risotto with black truffle oil, and pumpkin pie with cardamom whipped cream. (For the soup, risotto, and pie recipes, see page 56.) What do you like to cook at home? I like cooking traditional dishes from different cuisines. The success of classic recipes often relies on a simple technique and a few high-quality ingredients. These days, there are so many options available to us that it can be overwhelming. Cooking simple, delicious food helps me decompress. How do you get your kids (that's them in the photo!) to eat their vegetables? I give them options, and I let them be. I like them to taste vegetables simply prepared first and, if they don't like them, then I'm willing to dress them up\u2014 like adding maple syrup to Brussels sprouts. Some- times we have to remind them to try something on their plate, or tell them they can't have cookies for breakfast, but on some mornings, they do get whipped cream on a waffle, because everybody likes a treat!with Kripalu Executive Chef Jeremy Rock Smith Find programs with Jeremy Rock Smith on pages 52 and 59.A Albert, Lee 38, 70 Alden, Susan 65Alsdorf, Stephen 49Atkinson, Phoebe 25 B Bagnulo, John 11, 52, 64Barnett, Libby 37Barry, Bill 96Becker, Michelle P. 53, 69Burgess, Sandra 49Buttenheim, Megha Nancy 25, 63, 95 C Cappy, Peggy 86Carlson, Larissa Hall 9, 10, 20, 21, 33 Carmel, Gretchen 96Carroll, Y oganand Michael 10, 21, 53, 96 Alexandria 9Cullen, Dalbec, Michelle 10, 46, 49, 96 Dansby, Binnie A. 53 Das, Balarama Chandra Panache 80Dibb, Jessica Matthew 10 E Eccleston, T racey 70 Edmunds, Jashoda 65, 87 Emerson, David 68Ewing, Jim PathFinder 35 F Farmer, Angela 93Faulds, Richard 87Feldman, Kate and Joel 72Fields, Susannah 47Gangadhar, B.
