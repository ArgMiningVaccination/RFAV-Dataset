When we talk about doing a detox we are normally referring to an age old naturopathic process of cleaning the blood. There are various detox programs that help the body's natural cleaning process, that involves resting the organs through fasting; stimulating the liver to expel toxins from the body while also promoting elimination through the intestines, kidneys and skin. Toxins get deposited in various parts of the body hence the idea is to improve circulation of the blood, releasing stagnation, refuelling the body with healthy nutrients and recharging the body. Detoxifying to me means to expel all the toxins that are clinging onto us at all levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. We all need to absorb what is good and strong, while discard what makes us weak. As one positive charge leads to the influx of many positive charges or one negative charge leads to a stream of negative charges. It is important to focus and absorb all goodness and strength while rejecting all stresses, fear, evil and weakness. As technology is improving and life getting more modern, human health is deteriorating and that's what needs to be addressed by each one of us in this New Year. We are reservoirs of infinite energy and each one of is a dynamite capable of lighting up the whole city provided we put our energy in the right direction. It is time for the man kind to take a gigantic leap and emerge stronger than ever before. There is evidence that stress leads to various diseases and the stress/panic caused by the pandemic has affected the mental well being of many across the globe. Perhaps, it is time for us to step back, reflect on our life-style and exercise and emerge stronger on all levels. Life is all about exercising and training muscles slowly. Disconnect from activities, thoughts, places, and people that disturb your peace of mind as they are noisy. Walk towards what makes you stronger! The year 2020 has been a rollercoaster year for many. As we step into January 2021, there is a greater need for each one of us to detoxify and get rid of all the toxins and allow the energy within to flow to the maximum. There are various ways of detoxing. Following naturopathic diet is one way. In this article we will focus on detoxing with Homeopathy, restore balance and achieve optimum health. Homeopathic remedies for detoxification: Homeopathy is a form of holistic medicine as it takes into consideration all the symptoms that a person is suffering from and targets to heal the person as a whole. It is based on the principle of \"like cures like\", in which a substance given in small doses will cure the same symptoms of illness they are known to cause in high doses. The Homeopathic approach believes that the disease is a deranged state of body caused due to stress, chronic illness, mental or emotional disturbance, poor diet, consumption of chemicals in food, drugs etc. Homeopathy offers support in the detoxing process, as the remedies stimulate the body's own natural elimination. The remedies are also capable of promoting healing of damaged systems and restoration of proper functioning to sluggish or overactive systems, enabling the body to a state of balance and optimum health. There are three ways in which remedies are prescribed and can detoxify the body: constitutional, psychosomatic and organ specific. Constitutional Prescribing: It involves considering the whole person and treating the person on all levels-physical, mental and emotional. The expression 'treat the person, not the disease' applies to this mode of prescribing. A single and specific tailor made remedy is selected after extensive case taking. This constitutional remedy alone may be all that is required to bring about the body's innate ability to heal, repair, cleanse and restore. Psychosomatic Prescribing: In this method a person is perceived to be dis-eased on a spiritual or mental/emotional level first, and this imbalance pervades the immaterial vital body and finally culminates on the physical level and shows physical disease symptoms. Hence the prescription is aimed towards the innermost mental and emotional state rather than the outward physical symptoms and this alone will heal the entire body. Organ Prescribing: Organ remedies are prescribed to target individual organs aiming to restore the disturbed organ to health and hence cure the person. The following is a list of organ specific remedies that are commonly prescribed in a detox program. - Berberis: is a powerful remedy to achieve kidney and liver drainage detoxification; lowers uric acid levels and dissolves uric acid stones. - Chelidonium: a reliable liver and gall bladder drainer; especially useful in thick gall bladder secretions and gallstones. This is suitable particularly when there is inflammation of liver and a person aggravates after eating rich foods, alcohol and drug/artificial medicines abuse - Hydrastis: drains the liver, gall bladder and the intestines; helps the body get rid of excess mucus. - Phytolacca: is useful for drainage of the lymphatic system especially in the case of glandular swelling during and after illness; benign breast lumps; fatty lipomas; cellulite. - Ruta Graveolens: a for colon drainage. - Berberis Aquifolium or Calendula: is an excellent remedy for skin drainage; to enhance the healing of many chronic skin disorders including spots and pimples, acne, eczema, psoriasis and dermatitis. - Phosphorus: to encourage drainage of the pancreas and improve sugar regulation disorders. - Spongia or Lobelia Inflata: for lung drainage especially whilst using an asthma inhaler; beneficial for smokers or ex-smokers; helpful during and after any lung disorder. - Thlaspi Bursa: for drainage of the uterus and urinary/bladder disorders including fibroids, endometriosis, menstrual disorders and infertility, and incontinence. - Nux Vomica: is the number one remedy for general toxicity especially resulting after over-indulgence in stimulants, rich foods, coffee, cigarettes and alcohol. It improves detoxification of the liver and intestines. An excellent hangover remedy! I have mentioned only a few remedies but going to a qualified homeopath for a detailed consultation is required which will help to detoxify (the list can be obtained from the SOH website). Summary: The overriding definition of detoxification is removing toxins from the body. Detoxification to me implies to expelling the toxins which are stuck within us on various levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Homeopathy offers enhancement to detoxification by optimizing elimination of toxins along with stimulating the healing pathways to a restored state of well-being. These remedies help to unleash, unravel and unwind anything unwanted that is trapped within us. It is only when these toxins are released from all levels that a complete "}
