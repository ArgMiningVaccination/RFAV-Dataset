These are not random words to pass time, but well-thought phrases with a strong meaning and immense benefits. Although mantras can be incorporated in any type of meditation practice, they were traditionally used in metta and transcendental meditations ( [6](https://www.mettainstitute.org/mettameditation.html)) ( [12](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320392)). Here is you need to know about meditation mantras for beginners. What is a mantra? With origin from the classical language of Indian and the liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism known as Sanskrit, the word mantra is coined from 'manas' or 'man' which means 'a linear thinking mind' and 'tra' which means 'release' ( [3](https://www.healthline.com/health/mantra-meditation)). It is an equipment for the mind designed to help practitioners obtain a higher power and their true natures. So, what does mantra mean? Simply put, mantras are short or long words, sounds, syllables, or phrases that are repeated over and over again during a meditation or a yoga session. Mantras create sound waves and frequencies that take you through or beyond the intellectual faculties straight into deeper consciousness and energy states. However, nowadays they are equated to repeated affirmations or spiritual aphorisms. What Is The Purpose Of The Mantra During Meditation? Meditation mantras are intersections between all the tangible energy of the body, and the intangible energy of sound i.e. vehicles for the brain to connect the physical world with insight. The purpose is to help you attain a state of deeper presence and awareness. In other words, the purpose of a mantra during meditation is to shut out the outside world so that you can concentrate on what you are feeling in the moment. They alter your consciousness, evoke positivity, and have the ability to transform the reality of your perception.
