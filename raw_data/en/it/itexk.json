In solution-focused therapy, the therapy does not emphasize the problem at all; it stresses and highlights the solution. The client is the expert and not the therapist. The experiential approach is often used to facilitate meaningful changes in individuals. SFBT several similarities, as Another exercise that client use is self-compassion. Self-compassion involves the client talking kindly whenever they have a sense of suffering. Self-compassion isn't specifically a tool for cognitive restructuring just like mindfulness, but has shown some effect. CBT goal is to change patterns of thinking or behavior. Humanistic therapy aims to help client develop a stronger, and healthier sense of self. It Task 3 In contemporary society modern medicine usually takes on a curative role, it attempts to cure. Complementary therapy however takes on a very different role; it is used to maintain wellbeing and health as well as a helping to restore wellbeing to before illness or poor health. These therapies are usually used in conjunction with modern medicine. This is usually to relieve symptoms that traditional medicine fails to help with or to boost a person's emotional or physical health. A holistic approach is important in managing pain and discomfort as it covers all aspects of a person's well-being. Pain and discomfort affects a person not only physically but also emotionally, socially and mentally. Addressing all these needs with this approach helps the person to manage pain a little better. This I have integrated various holistic practices into my treatment plans including acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation and prayer. I also discuss and recommend the importance of balance in our lives, which is a major philosophy of Ayurvedic Medicine, \"balance between body, mind and spirit\" (What is the philosophy, n.d.). I stress how healthy choices regarding diet, exercise and relationships can impact a patient's physical, emotional and spiritual balance in their life.

Therapies There are various therapies that are being used by the therapists and counselors to deal with individuals There are many ways to define evidence-based practice (EBP). In the most common sense of the term, it combines clinical expertise with external scientific evidence that helps make the best decisions about the patient's care in accordance with the patients' needs and preferences. Evidence-based treatments require expertise, clinical judgment, and skill from practitioners (Brown, 2013, para.14). Frequently, these treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (\"Evidence-based Therapies,\" 2017, n.p.). Different Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. The \"HCAP\" approach is one of the theories that are linked by other common factors, this kind of therapeutic approach encompasses the amalgamation of theories (the ones that work best together), it is a blended therapy with an emphasis on the therapist being more like a mentor, positioned to solidify The theory of strategic therapy states that the patient's symptoms are a result of attempts of the family to correct what they consider \"problem\" behavior. Haley's strategic therapy focuses on short-term, targeted efforts to solve a specific problem (Haley, 2011). His approach to strategic therapy is closely modeled after the therapy developed by Milton H. Erickson MD who is considered one of the world's leading hypnotists and psychiatrists. Erickson felt as though everyone has the power to heal him or herself within their own consciousness (Haley, 2011). Erickson's ideas and methods have greatly influenced therapists and many models (Haley, 2011). Throughout the years Erickson's ideas have been studied and three models were born; MRI's brief therapy model, Haley and Madanes' strategic therapy, and Milan's systemic therapy. Midwives and obstetricians recommend that pregnant women take extreme precautions when taking medications. Although seemingly harmless, natural products such as eucalyptus oil can cause unforeseen side effects during pregnancy . However, these home remedies pose a number of theoretical risks to the mother and developing fetus. Consult your doctor before Holistic therapy addresses underlying causes so the therapist helps the clients on a far deeper level. This treatment is more effective due to long term issues which are deeply rooted and more serious in nature. Due to the expense, this would normally have to be self-funded privately. Introduction In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in complementary medicine, and indeed alternative medicine (Lee-Treweek 2002, Andrews 2004, Barry 2006). Moreover the number of professionally trained therapist and practitioners has increased giving the patient/client a better choice and at more competitive rates (Smallwood, 2005). These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
