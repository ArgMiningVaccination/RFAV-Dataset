Wellbeing and healing are complete only when the needs of all three parts of the constitution are satisfied. it recognizes the deep connection that exists between the human being and nature. It takes into account the individual destiny that shapes each one's life, and leads both to challenges and to their overcoming. It is practiced by conventionally trained medical doctors who combine orthodox medical treatment with breakthrough practices that include novel potentized remedies (partially used also in homeopathy) and new forms of extractions from mineral and herbal materials. Therapies also include health promotion through new diet principles, life style attitudes, and new movement exercises (therapeutic eurythmy), new massage forms, and other artistic therapies like painting, etc. It always keeps in mind the importance of the care for soul and spirit which are weaving through the physical processes together shaping the Destiny in health and illness.
