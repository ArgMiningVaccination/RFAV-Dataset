Established in 2002. Started informally in 1998 after Seann Xenja's first Feng Shui teaching and consulting trip to Brazil. In August, 2002, Seann visited crystal mines near Diamantina, Brazil, and was inspired to create a new business - Dynamic Energy Crystals - and it was an instant success. First located in the ICB Artist Building in north Sausalito, the business soon outgrew the space and moved next to Avatar's Restaurant on Bridgeway. Over the next few years Luz Elena and Daniel came to play key roles. In March of 2011, we moved into our current, dream location at 21 Princess Street in downtown Sausalito. In 2017, Luz Elena became the owner of this location, while Seann and Daniel opened a wholesale storefront in Sebastopol, California under the name Treasure Crystals. Our Sausalito crystal gallery is an incredibly beautiful, magic place filled with wonder and delight.", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2021-10-17", "cleaned_text": "Review Highlights \" [Luz](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=GlsyIXL2ijreRevbnUz_og&rh_ident=luz&rh_type=phrase) spent a lot of time with me and had a plethora of knowledge she imparted on this \"beginner\".\" [ in 4 reviews](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=GlsyIXL2ijreRevbnUz_og&rh_ident=luz&rh_type=phrase) \"The owner was very helpful and sincere and gave me some great [information](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=ATmktApUts-vhQlBtbPbLA&rh_ident=information&rh_type=phrase) about local psychics and scientists.\" [ in 5 reviews](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=ATmktApUts-vhQlBtbPbLA&rh_ident=information&rh_type=phrase) \"It was nice when I shared this effect with [Courtney](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=A8dSQ-vMpNux1df-Vgs-gQ&rh_ident=courtney&rh_type=phrase) that she confirmed that selenite is used to clean even other stones.\" [ in 3 reviews](/biz/dynamic-energy-crystals-sausalito?hrid=A8dSQ-vMpNux1df-Vgs-gQ&rh_ident=courtney&rh_type=phrase) Location & Hours Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri |Open now| Sat Sun Other Jewelry Nearby [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=CljPlquZ0wtIsZjIyKc5FQ&campaign_id=j8IEQGdGfWCdOXFLO95XLA&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fshreve-and-co-san-francisco-2%3Fhrid%3DfepDLPhUnn_xubunOKhnJg&request_id=8a8d3d8880b207b9&signature=ec8af520493520e6146709698bb92a76eae7baa0d62d7ec04b20ed9b30efd0ba&slot=0) in Watches, Jewelry Repair, Jewelry [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=jj-m6afE08h7Q8YsxOQKlg&campaign_id=cbsE1OHGrMQN4oWZhlAx_g&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fpadis-jewelry-the-jewelry-center-san-francisco%3Fhrid%3DeyGNQiyBkMLdJLDqgOvgfQ&request_id=8a8d3d8880b207b9&signature=15bc123ac1830e62872df2f54ea43860ba1cdd66ba712ddf04fe4d8b6647c00a&slot=1) in Jewelry [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=4toG_uMeulf-qMhzRe3cEQ&campaign_id=zQMzZhzaxRtgahVDg7cXDQ&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fla-bijouterie-san-francisco%3Fhrid%3DW7IgeD2m5UjJmr5vT5rEeA&request_id=8a8d3d8880b207b9&signature=cc28916dace238ea6b1a556d53faa7529b4d52cac9e40662cf315a004214552e&slot=2) in Jewelry Amenities and More About the Business Business owner information Luz Elena C.

The woman working today was super helpful, too. Bonus points because they care a lot about keeping the community healthy-strict about wearing a mask and having a vaccine before entering the store, as well as limiting the number of customers at any given time. They are awesome! - 1/18/2023 Loved their inventory! Great place to buy crystals. And they have decent sales too. I'd would go back. - 2/8/2020 I stopped by Dynamic Energy Crystals after my friend decided she wanted to check out their selection of different crystals available. We walked in are we received a very friendly greeting by the owner. We arrived literally at closing and she was so nice to allow us to shop around without and pressure or rushing us out the door. While walking around I really enjoyed the wide selection of loose crystals and gems as well as jewelry such as bracelets, earrings, necklaces and rings. While I was walking around I loved all the many crystal etc they offer. There is a section of necklaces, I was so focused on a particular section of some beautiful necklaces that stood out from the rest. I was stuck between 2 necklaces and the first one I liked a lot, but the second one I fell in love with and had to have it no question about it, so I went with it. The owner explained the gems and the energy each one provides and for 2020 all I want is positive energy hands down. The owner rings up my necklace and and boy, I sometimes never think to ask how much things are, but I wanted the necklace and bought it without hesitation. My friend looked at me like I was nuts lol. I'd definitely come back for more jewelry pieces to match the necklace I got. I received the best service by the owner that I look forward to going back in the near future not to mention I prefer to support small business. If you're ever in Sausalito please stop by Dynamic Energy Crystals. You won't be disappointed. Thank you for reading. SYOY! :) - 1/25/2020 What a wonderful experience . I truly enjoyed walking around reading about each crystal and purchasing the ones I felt would fit nicely in my home and office . I felt like I spend over 30 minutes just walking around, reading and picking my crystals. The lady working there waa s very nice and helpful. Such a great experience - 9/13/2021 I popped in for a visit yesterday and could've stayed all day! What a beautiful collection of crystals! I really appreciate the fact that they require folks to be vaccinated. It made me feel much more comfortable to browse for a while. I wish I'd caught the name of the young lady who was working - she was delightful and handled the comings and goings like a champ. Not easy to maintain a calm and kind presence when people are so fired up about the vaccine requirement. - 10/20/2020 The BEST! Very knowledgeable and helpful toward suggesting the correct gems minerals or crystals toward your spiritual needs. Very zen and pleasant energy, owner is AHHHHMAZING! Fair prices for good quality! Love them! First time I visited I couldn't leave before I had spent a few hundred! Check em out! - 11/25/2019 Leaving negative feedback is not how I like to spend my time, so I will be brief. Simply put, avoid Dynamic Energy Crystals in Sausalito. Make the trek to Spirit Matters in Fairfax, where you have a lovely experience feeling valued and browse amongst a wonderful selection of crystals or Stone Room in Berkeley, where you will find a huge selection crystals and knowledgeable and friendly staff. We live in Belvedere, so it's not convenient to drive all that way, but well worth it! In a nutshell, my daughter and I walked into the store where two employees were chatting with one another. Neither of them greeted us, nor asked if we needed help. And not that it should ever matter, but it's worth mentioning, that my daughter and I were both well dressed and I was even carrying one of my favorite Chanel bags. But my point here, is that there was zero acknowledgment whatsoever. We walked around the store in search of nine specific crystals, when I finally interrupted the conversation by inquiring about one of many crystals on my list. The older of the two women came over and condescendingly pointed out that I was standing next to the crystal. I then pulled out my list of the nine crystals I was in search of and what a game changer that was!! All of a sudden there was some interest in providing some moderate service, well no thank you rude woman! But besides the overwhelmingly rude and incompetent staff, the crystal selection was very limited and overpriced as well. Do yourself a favor and scratch this store off your list. - 8/28/2018 I cannot remember the lovely ladies name working the store this past Friday, 8/24, but she was such a delight. Warm, friendly, inviting with outstanding energy and light around her. I showed my partner a lovely oil they had that smelled amazing, but also had a wonderful purpose. She chimed in with more information in regard to it and how to us it, and even demonstrated how she goes about using it with her chant. I instantly felted loved and enlightened by the whole experience. Please stop in. Even if you have no interest in crystals or intentions on purchasing - just for the energy and love you feel upon entering. - 5/10/2020 I live in Sausalito and was new to the study of crystals and herbs. Another psychic that I had worked with recommended doing a sage clearing of my home to remove negative energy but we needed to have a special white sage grown in California. I was amazed at the beautiful crystals and jewelry in the store. One could spend hours in here looking and learning from the owner who made some recommendations about certain crystals that would help me in various ways. I did also find my white sage and got information on how to use it in my home. Very interesting shop with many beautiful items! The owner was very helpful and sincere and gave me some great information about local psychics and scientists. Loved this shop! Of course we wore our masks and were the only two people in the store for health and safety reasons (CV19).
