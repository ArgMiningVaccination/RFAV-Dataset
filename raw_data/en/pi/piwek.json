When unbalanced, however, Vatas have a hard time focusing that energy and they can become anxious and restless. That's where aromatherapy comes in. Not a Vata? The energy and information you take in through your senses influence the quality of your thoughts and emotions. Smell is the most primitive of the senses, triggering a strong connection between aromas and your memories, emotions, and instincts. When you smell something, you actually absorb some of its molecules. Because of this, aromatherapy can be an effective form of natural medicine. Many people have experienced powerful results using this ancient practice, including relief from migraine headaches, joint pain, skin rashes, anxiety, insomnia, and many other physical and emotional conditions.

One way to use aromatherapy is to place about 10 drops of an essential oil in hot water and allow the scent to fill the room for a half hour. You can also use an electric aromatherapy diffuser or a candle-powered aroma pot. Portable diffusers that you can plug into USB ports are now available, so you can use them at your desk. And if you have a USB port in your car, you can transform your daily commute from a dreaded event to a healing experience. Aromatic oils are also used in Ayurveda as part of steam therapy. You can try this at home by placing a few drops of oil on a towel in a hot shower and spending a few minutes bathing your body in the aromatic steam. You can carry a scent with you by placing a drop of the oil on the back of your hand or wrist and inhaling the scent periodically. The pure oil itself can be diluted with carrier oils such as olive oil, jojoba, or grape seed oil. Experiment with the combinations and create your own essential oil mixtures for your daily Abhy or [self-massage](http://www.chopra.com/ccl/the-benefits-of-ayurveda-self-massage-abhyanga).
