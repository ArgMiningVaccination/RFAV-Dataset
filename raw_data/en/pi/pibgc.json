We seek to gather and unify Christian Doctors of Chiropractic around the essentials of the Christian faith, leaving minor points of doctrine to the conscience of the individual believer. Personal faith in Jesus Christ and His Word is the basis of our fellowship. THE CHRISTIAN CHIROPRACTORS ASSOCIATION places world missions at the heart of its program. Now contributing to several different mission fields, we look forward to a constantly enlarging vision of missions that will assist in sending Christian Chiropractors to many whitened harvest fields with the Gospel of Christ and chiropractic before Jesus returns. Statement of Faith: THE CHRISTIAN CHIROPRACTORS ASSOCIATION is conservative in theology; believing the Bible to be inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God; believing in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, eternal, coequal with the Father, in His virgin birth, in His vicarious and atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father and in His personal return in power and glory, believing that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential and is effectual by grace through faith alone.

Families staying warm together in the cellar of Andriy's home. Dr. Andriy's family at graduation from chiropractic school (2009) The CCA has had a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Under the direction of Rev. Jim Weber, we began organizing short-term mission trips to Ukraine shortly after they became an independent country (1991). There were many trips in those early days to places like Kiev, Mariupol, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and others - names that are unfortunately all too familiar to us now. On a trip to Ukraine in 1993, Dr. Jim Spertzel went to the city of Cherkassy. While there, he met the Yevtushenko family, a pastor and his nine children. Their second son, Andriy, was his first interpreter, and they began a momentous journey together. As a pastor's son, he could not attend any schooling past 10th grade during the Soviet years. He was a brilliant young man who wanted to be a doctor. Long story short, Andriy went on to complete his medical training in Ukraine and to graduate from the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic in England at the top of his class and as the first Ukrainian-born chiropractor. He has been practicing for over 12 years, and his sister Valentina followed in his footsteps. The invasion of the Russians into Crimea 8 years ago prompted most of Andriy's family to move to a small village an hour west of the city. There they made provision for what they expected to happen on February 24, 2022. At this writing, they are providing for 20+ refugee families from the city; they believe this is where the Lord wants them to remain. Dr. Jim Spertzel last visited them in August 2021 and had to cancel a planned trip for January 2022 in light of the impending invasion. Dr. Jim has made over 40 trips to Ukraine and has plans to move there in his retirement. We must continue to lift Dr. Andriy and his family in prayer, encourage them, and support them during this trial. The CCA will forward any gifts directly to Dr. Andriy for the refugees he is helping.

WILLARD SMITH LEAVES A LEGACY IN CHIROPRACTIC: Long-time CCA member and past President and board member, Dr. Willard Smith was welcomed to his heavenly home on Wednesday March 15th, '23. Dr. Smith, who turned 97 this past December, had been a Palmer faculty member for 40 years, spending most of his time teaching technique. Dr. Smith has been an active CCA member serving as President of the Association in the early 1970's. He joined many CCA missions teams, going on thirty-plus trips to countries like Ethiopia, Jamaica, Brazil and Bolivia. With Palmer University, Dr. Smith served on many Palmer Abroad Teams as a faculty advisor. Dr. Smith attended many CCA Annual Conventions and was chosen Christian Chiropractor of the Year in 1970. Dr. Smith was instrumental in the beginnings of the CCA and the first mission projects set forth to educate foreign nationals to return to their country as chiropractors. He was recognized by Palmer University for his generosity in providing a scholarship fund for Christian Palmer students. For over 47 years, Dr. Willard has awarded annual scholarships through a fund he and his wife began in 1974. After the home-going of his wife, Marguerite, he named the scholarship after her.
