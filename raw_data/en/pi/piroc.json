It is therefore non-toxic, unlike some herbal remedies. The effectivity comes from the method of preparation (succussion). Why use Homeopathy? Homeopathy is the second most widely used system of medicine in the world. Its growth in popularity in the United States has been around 25 to 50 percent a year throughout the last decade. It is widely used in pharmacies throughout France and Germany and thousands of people in India are treated every month with homeopathic medicines. Homeopathy is now a rapidly growing practice in China. Homeopathic remedies can also be taken alongside other medication without producing unwanted side effects. Homeopathic remedies are not addictive - once relief is felt, you should stop taking them. Homeopathy is holistic. According to homeopathic principples it treats all the symptoms as one, which in practical terms means that it addresses the cause, not the symptoms. This often means that symptoms tackled with homeopathy do not recur. HOWEVER ! Homeopathy is a rational form of medicine. If the body's defences are handicapped by poor lifestyle, diet, destructive emotions and environmental stresses it will suffer. My homeopathic appointments involve help in this area and nutritional advice is a part of the service. There is no such thing as a disease purely of the mind or body. Mind and body are one. Homeopathy takes full account of the physical and the mental / emotional side of people. "}
