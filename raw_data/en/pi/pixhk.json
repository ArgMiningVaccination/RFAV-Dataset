The treatment possibilities available to those with difficulty conceiving vary in price and efficacy. There are many fertility supplements women can take as a non-invasive method to increase the chances of conception. Below are the best supplements to ensure a woman gets the proper amount of nutrients necessary to support a healthy pregnancy and a fortified reproductive system. With each supplement, there's an explanation of the benefits and usage, side effects, cost, various brands, and more. Finally, additional questions related to fertility vitamins and costs, who should take these supplements, and the science behind fertility boosters will be addressed to provide further clarity for potential consumers. 1. Vitamin D Vitamin D is amongst the most important female fertility supplements that are necessary for healthy hormones related to a woman's menstrual cycle and creating balance during pregnancy. This vitamin also acts on the endometrium and the ovary, which is critical to fertility. Vitamin D stimulates the ovaries and enhances ovulation, working at a cellular level through increased progesterone production, more follicle-stimulating hormone sensitivity, and better Anti-Mullerian hormone signaling. Substantial research has concluded that deficient vitamin D levels can cause infertility among men and women. To help support conception, doses between 50-100 mg each day are effective and safe to support a viable pregnancy. Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, it's best to consume these ovulation supplements with a meal containing healthy fats, which aids absorption. Vitamin D can cause weakness, vomiting, kidney problems, frequent urination, calcium stones, nausea, and more. The supplement can range in price from around $8 for 30 capsules/tablets to nearly $20 for the same supply amount, depending on the brand, the form, and any added ingredients. The [best supplement for Vitamin D](https://www.athleticinsight.com/supplements/vitamin-d) is Thorne's Vitamin D, as well as NOW Vitamin D-3, Nature Made D3, and Doctor's Best Vitamin D3 which are also suitable options in various doses and forms, and each choice is budget-friendly. 2. Selenium Selenium is a trace mineral necessary for selenoprotein and hormone production, which are critical players in reproductive health. If one has low selenium levels, not only does that affect fertility, but there's also an increased chance of pregnancy complications and miscarriage. Selenium encourages healthy follicles within the ovaries, where a woman releases eggs. This essential antioxidant also helps to protect against DNA damage to the fetus, which results in congenital disabilities. It's essential to note that there's a fine line between taking the correct amount of selenium daily and selenium toxicity. Women trying to conceive should consume around 60 mg each day. However, do not exceed 400 mg of selenium fertility supplements in 24 hours. Too much selenium leads to skin rashes, nausea, a metallic taste in the mouth, irritability, diarrhea, brittle nails and hair, and hair loss. The best brands of selenium fertility capsules are Thorne Research Selenomethionine, Pure Encapsulations Selenium, and NOW Selenium. The mineral costs $4-$25 on average for most brands. 3. Calcium Calcium is an essential mineral that serves as an excellent accompaniment to any fertility treatment. Within the reproductive tract, minerals help to establish an alkaline environment. Sperm will absorb calcium, which propels it toward the egg, making it a crucial conception factor. Calcium is also critical for healthy blood vessels, heart, and bone development for mom and baby. A woman trying to conceive should consume 1000 mg of calcium per day. People can usually get this amount from a balanced diet consisting of cheese, yogurt, milk, spinach, and so on. However, if someone is deficient, calcium supplements for fertility would be beneficial. Note that too much calcium in the blood can weaken bones, create kidney stones, and interfere with how the heart and brain work. Women fertility supplements containing calcium range between $4-$20 on average, depending on the form, dosage amount, and brand. Some top brands are Care/of Calcium Plus, Garden of Life Raw Calcium, and Persona Nutrition Calcium Citrate. 4. Vitamin E Vitamin E is a powerful nutrient and antioxidant known for its anti-aging properties and healthy hair and nails. However, additional benefits include boosting cervical mucus, which makes it easier for the male sperm to remain alive longer in search of an egg. This action increases a couple's chance to conceive and supports a healthy pregnancy. Vitamin E is one of the supplements for egg quality that can also help the egg stay attached to the uterine wall. The recommended dosage is 15 mg per day, and exceeding this dosage for an extended period can lead to diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, headaches, rash, blurred vision, weakness, intestinal cramps, and more. The [best supplement for vitamin E](https://www.athleticinsight.com/supplements/vitamin-e) is Thorne Health, which is the perfect dosage of 15 mg without added vitamins. Two additional fertility supplements for women that contain vitamin E are the multivitamins: Kaged Multivitamin and Olly Coq10, or Coenzyme Q10, is a compound that naturally occurs within the body but decreases with age. For women over 40 years old, Coq10 can have a significant impact on fertility. This vitamin is amongst the best natural fertility supplements available, as the compound can thicken the uterus lining and optimize egg quality. Additionally, Coq10 is an excellent supplement for those undergoing in vitro fertilization. The correct dosage will vary depending on the person's specific needs; therefore, it is necessary to speak with a primary care physician before taking vitamins to help get pregnant. Anywhere from 100 to 600 mg will be helpful toward boosting fertility. Coq10 consumption can result in fatigue, dizziness, headaches, rashes, itching, insomnia, irritability, and more. Taking Coq10 for fertility can cost anywhere from around $11 per bottle to nearly $60, depending on the brand, dosage, and if other vitamins and minerals are added. Garden of Life Raw CoQ10, Kirkland Maximum Potency, and Puritan's Pride Q-Sorb 600mg are the best supplements to increase fertility with the proper amounts of coenzyme Q10. 6. Evening Primrose Oil Evening primrose oil contains omega-6 fatty acids\u2014a promising ingredient used to help improve fertility in similar ways to that of fish and flax oils. However, due to how evening primrose oil can affect the uterus, supplements for ovulation such as this must be taken before and not during ovulation. To make this easier, begin tracking the menstrual cycle to take the supplement at the precise time to maximize its effects. The best way to take evening primrose oil if the goal is to promote natural pregnancy is to start by administering precise dosages in capsule form on the first day of the cycle. Continue taking evening primrose oil until the first day of ovulation. Ovulation refers to the release of the egg from the ovaries. Generally speaking, no evening primrose should be taken one to two times daily at 1500 to 3000 mg, beginning on day 1 and ending on day 14 of the cycle. Side effects of evening primrose oil include upset stomach, headache, diarrhea, and nausea, depending on the person. The best brands of evening primrose oil fertility supplements are BioLife Evening Primrose Oil, NOW Super Primrose, and Source Naturals Evening Primrose Oil. 7. Folic Acid Folic acid is one of the B vitamins. Many people know about the powerful effects on pregnancy because most often folic acid gets prescribed as a prenatal vitamin for women. However, there are studies that show how useful the supplement can be for women that are trying to conceive. Folic acid helps to prevent neural tube defects in early pregnancy as well as miscarriages. Before that point, this vitamin encourages cell metabolism within the ovaries. Women that are undergoing in vitro fertilization treatments found that they had a higher chance of becoming pregnant because the folic acid optimized the uterine environment for egg implantation. Folic acid also reduces inflammation throughout the body, as well as stress. Experts recommend taking 400 mg of folic acid per day to boost reproductive health and to aid fertility treatments. Nutricost Folic Acid Supplement, Nature Made Folic Acid Supplement, and Nature's Bounty Folic Acid Supplement are the best brands available. This supplement costs around $10-$12 on average, per bottle, for a one to two month supply. 8. Vitex or Chasteberry Made from a brown berry from a chaste tree, Chasteberry is a herbal extract; it's a flowering shrub indigenous to the Mediterranean, Asia, and North America. Chasteberry also has a botanical name, vitex agnus-castus, often called vitex for short. Vitex raises progesterone levels and elongates cycles which are shortened because of luteal phase deficiency, a prominent cause of infertility in women. Since Chasteberry reduces prolactin, using it as a supplement to reduce the quantity of prolactin is excellent, which increases in people experiencing stress. After using the supplement for three months, one study showed that people are twice as likely to get pregnant. The recommended daily dose of chasteberry is 500 to 1000 mg of dried berries or one to four mL tincture to improve ovulatory factors affecting fertility. Side effects of Chasteberry are usually mild, causing headache, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, and itching. Nature's Way Vitex Fruit, Nature's Answer Chasteberry, and Morphogen Chasteberry are three reputable brands that carry the correct dosages of the herbal extract to impact fertility positively. 9. Omega-3 Omega-3 fats are an essential family of polyunsaturated fats. Here are the three main omega-3s: DHA, ALA, and EPA. These healthy fats promote ovulation, regulate hormones and increase cervical mucus. Additionally, omega-3s encourage blood flow to the reproductive organs, which improves the uterus overall. Studies conducted have demonstrated that fats can help regulate menstruation. Moreover, the previous factors combined serve as evidence that omega-3 fatty acid improves fertility. Omega 3 fatty acids can also lower inflammation throughout the body and improve egg quality, improving overall chances of conception and a healthier pregnancy. Side effects of consuming fish oil are typically mild, such as nausea, heartburn, rash, diarrhea, or bad breath. However, in high doses over an extended period, high blood sugar, strike, vitamin A toxicity, or excessive bleeding can also occur. Women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should take at least 650 mg of fatty acid each day, being sure not to exceed 1000 mg. As always, consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplement. Thorne Health, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, Amazon Elements Super Omega-3 with Lemon Flavor, and Life Extension Super Omega-3 are the best brands for omega-3 fatty acids. The price ranges from $18 to around $60 per month supply of omega-3 fatty acids in both oil and capsule form. 10. Acetyl l-carnitine Acetyl L-carnitine (ALC) derives from the amino acid L-carnitine; this amino acid converts fat into energy, and the body naturally produces the amino acid L-carnitine. ALC can help to slow down the aging process of the female reproductive system while also improving symptoms of PCOS and endometriosis. Women should take between 1000-2000 mg daily. When the supplement is taken orally, ALC is innocuous for most people. On the other hand, if someone has hypothyroidism or a history of seizures, do not use this supplement. Some side effects of ALC include dry mouth, headache, upset stomach, nausea, restlessness, and vomiting. Additionally, breath, sweat, and urine with a \"fishy\" odor can also occur. Divine Bounty Acetyl-L-Carnitine, NOW Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and Jacked Factory Acetyl-L-Carnitine are three top brands when using acetyl-l-carnitine fertility pills for women. Without health insurance, the average cash price of L-Carnitine is $28.75 for 30 tablets. What Are the Purposes of Fertility Supplements? The purposes of fertility supplements are to support ovarian health, ovarian reserve, egg quality, immune system health, endometrial lining development, and overall health. Who Can Use Fertility Supplements? Women and men who want to support or improve egg, ovulatory, sperm, or reproductive health, in general, should consider using fertility supplements. Typically, fertility supplements are used as the primary treatment for infertile women because of ovulation disorders. Fertility drugs, for the most part, work like natural hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to induce ovulation. Women generally take the pill on the third, fourth, or fifth day after the menstrual cycle has started. Seven days after taking the last dose, ovulation should occur. However, usage depends on the type of supplement, as some vitamins are meant to be taken daily. It is up to the discretion of the primary care physician as to the best course of action for each individual based on the need for certain nutrients. What Is the Evidence That Supplements Aid Fertility? The evidence that supplements aid fertility is based on numerous studies involving women trying to conceive while undergoing multiple treatments. There's evidence that DHEA supplements for fertility increase pregnancy rates for women struggling with low ovarian reserve. Consuming diminished ovarian reserve supplements can aid in a better quality egg supply. Additional studies display how various fertility vitamins for women contribute to a healthier female reproductive system, a better quality egg supply, and the necessary hormone signaling that assists with preparing the body for egg fertilization and implantation. It's essential to choose fertility supplements that work based on promising evidence and clinical trials. How Much Does a Fertility Supplement Cost? Fertility supplements to help get pregnant can range from inexpensive to expensive. None of the supplements on this list require a doctor's prescription. Though it's easy to purchase pills to get pregnant faster over the counter, it is wise to consult a medical professional before starting treatment with any supplement to ensure the correct dosage. Are Fertility Supplements Safe for your Health? Yes, fertility supplements are safe to take for your health. However, the safety and effectiveness of these supplements are not well-regulated or well-understood which is why you should consult with your doctor before taking them. Some fertility supplements may contain high doses of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds that can potentially affect a person's health if taken in excess.
