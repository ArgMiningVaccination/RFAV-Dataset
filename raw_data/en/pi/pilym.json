Modern medicine largely uses pharmaceuticals to address the health concerns of the population. These medicines are valuable, effective, and can be life saving. However, they are aimed at controlling and eliminating symptoms and do not address the cause of the symptoms, therefore they cannot provide a person with a true cure. Symptoms are the body's way of telling us something is out of balance, something is wrong. When we suppress these symptoms we are not listening to our bodies call for help and the underlying problem that is causing the symptoms continues to worsen, while the body is kept silent. For example, a person with high blood pressure may be prescribed medication to maintain their blood pressure below a certain number. While on paper, the blood pressure looks to be in a healthy range, the underlying reason that it was elevated to begin with is not addressed and will continue to exist and create dis-ease in the patient. Here at Stowe Natural Family Wellness we strive to look beyond simple symptom management and, in keeping with naturopathic philosophy, toward a complete cure for each patient. We understand however that symptoms are indeed uncomfortable and sometimes even life-threatening. To ensure patient safety and comfort along the path to optimal wellness, we will palliate symptoms when necessary. Naturopathic Principles First Do No Harm: Naturopaths prefer non-invasive treatments that minimize the risk of harmful side effects. Identify and Treat the Cause: Every illness has an underlying cause. True healing is only possible when the deepest roots of imbalance are addressed. Treat the Whole Person: Optimal health is achieved by supporting the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of each individual's life. The Healing Power of Nature: Naturopathic physicians believe that the body is physiologically designed to be in a state of health, and will always return to health if given the correct stimuli to set the healing process in motion or when obstacles to health are removed. Doctor As Teacher: The primary goal of the naturopathic physician is to practice, teach, and inspire patients to embrace the principles of healthy lifestyle choices, thereby establishing a strong foundation of balance and wellness. Prevention is the True Cure: The highest level of health care is aimed at preventing imbalances, which, when left unchecked, can eventually manifest as chronic, degenerative disease. Therapies Used Our providers use a combination of herbal medicine, homeopathy, clinical nutrition, lifestyle guidance, counseling, acupuncture, energy work, and body work to assist you on your path to wellness. Physician Training Naturopathic physicians (NDs) are family practice trained primary care doctors. Their training consists of matriculation at a four year, graduate level, accredited naturopathic medical school. There are currently five accredited naturopathic schools in the U.S. and one in Canada. They are accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, a specialized accreditor recognized by the United Stated Department of Education. Similar to the training of conventional medical doctors (MDs), the first two years of school consist of training in the basic sciences such as anatomy, biochemistry, pathology, histology, etc. The next two to four years classes are focused on body systems, such as gastroenterology, cardiology, gynecology, etc as well as naturopathic therapeutics (herbal medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine...) These years are also filled with clinical encounters in a medical facility where students have real hands on training in diagnosis and treatment of patients in a variety of primary care settings. Upon completion of the required coursework and clinical hours, NDs must pass a national board exam to be licensed to practice medicine. Conditions Treated Here at Stowe Natural Family Wellness, our goal is to assist each individual on their path to wellness, not to treat each person's individual disease. Disease is nothing but a grouping of symptoms and if we were to only treat the symptoms (disease) the body would not heal and real cure cannot take place. Symptoms clear on their own once homeostasis or balance is achieved by the body. Symptoms are only the body's warning to us that something is wrong or out of balance. Below is an incomplete list of conditions (symptoms) that are seen in our clinic. "}
