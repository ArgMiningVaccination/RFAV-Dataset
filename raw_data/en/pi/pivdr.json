Based on this and with World Bank-led technical and financial support under the Strengthening the Public Health Car e System Project, the health care staff training plan is being implemented, along with the promotion, education, and dissemination of natural medicine, research, and the strengthening of complementary therapy and holistic pain management in clinics nationwide. Program s rolled out between 2016 and 2019 a) Health Staff Capacity Building Starting in 2015 and continuing from January 2016 through December 2019, the Institute of Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies rolled out the health care staff training plan . Academic activities included workshops, basic training, and specialized and diploma courses under three modalities: classroom- based, blended, and online sessions. They were attended by BSN graduates, nursing assistant graduates, general practitioners, residents , and in-service practitioners, physiatrists, physical therapist s, psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical bio analysts , anesthesiologists , and dentists. KEY MESSA GES The Institute of Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies, as the benchmark in the intercultural health approach, implements capacity -building processes in natural medicine and complementary therapies. The institute has 16 subsidiaries offices and 258 clinics, including natural medi cine and complementary therapy clinics (188), and holistic pain management clinics (70) , where physiotherapists and phytotherapists provide care in natural medicine and complementary therapies under a holistic approach (body, mind , and spirit). Natural medicine education, promotion, and dissemination activities strengthened the capacities of the community health network, while research and systematization were adopted as practices for rescuing traditional ancestral medicine experiences. The institute is reviving ancestral knowledge and systematizing the grievance redress mechanism (GRM) on the implementation of plans that integrat e traditional ancestral medicine of Indigenous Peoples and Afro- descendants .

The different activities conducted by the institute and its offices involve the active engagement of community network members and different ethnic communities in the country: Departmental congress with healers/ethnic and social identity/validati on process Discussion on critical and complementarity paths Workshop on culture- bound syndromes Exchanges between dermatologists and healers Participation in the systematization of culture- bound syndrome experiences Informed consent of W orld Bank Social Safeguards and Indigenous Peoples Plan under the Integrated Public Provision of Health Care Services Project Participatory construction of the Grisi Siknis, Pauka Alkan, Muih Bubulwa Guide Summar y of Training Subjects Training activities Trainee's profile Workshops for offices and clinics Clinical phytotherapists Induction workshops Resident s bioanalysts , anesthesiologists , and physical therapists Basic training courses : Introduction to Traditional Ancestral Medicine: An Integral and Intercultural Approach Clinical phytotherapists Courses on syndromic diagnoses Clinical phytotherapists Thalassotherapy Nurses Refresher training in clinical phytotherapy and foot reflexology Clinical phytotherapists Tai chi and Qi gong course Phytotherapists massage course Clinical phytotherapists Phytotherapy , moxabustion massage, therapy Clinical phytotherapists Course Clinical phytotherapists How to harmonize \"Body, Mind , and Spirit\" Psychologists and psychiatrists Diploma in Clinical Phytotherapy New phytotherapists Diploma in Acupuncture Doctors, licensed nurses , and nursing assistants Holistic Pain Management Diploma Phytotherapists, physiatrists, physical therapists Induc and physiot herapists (IMNTC June 2019) Health Care Staff Trained by Ethnicity Page 3 HNPGP Knowledge Brief c) Strengthening 188 IMNTC Natural Medicine Clinics , 70 Holistic Pain Management Clinics , and 16 Subsidiaries Offices In this reporting period, the Ministry of Health has created physical premises for 16 subsidiaries offices , 9 of which are located in departments across the country with i ndigenous and Afro- descendant populations. All clinics and offices carry out activities aimed to strengthen the C ommunity Health Network by promoting and disseminating natural and traditional medicine and complementary therapies. Until December 2019, 188 natural medicine clinics had been built nationwide to provide medical care, integrating natural medicine and complementary therapies into primary health care ( PHC ), incorporating complementary care management in the therapeutic care for patients with common respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, nervous, gynecological , and skin conditions, as well as chronic noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs ), based on plants, natural medicinal products , and complementary therapies. Additionally, 70 holistic pain management clinics were established, where patients suffering from acute and chronic painful pathologies are treated. Here, complementary therapies take place (mainly moxibustion, anma massages, shiatsu, cupping) , focusing on faster and more effective pain rel ief and decreasing consumption of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and early integration into day -to-day activities. Between 2016 and 2019, these 258 clinics (188 natural medicine and 70 holistic pain management clinics) have provided 547,095 treatments, including 418,136 complementary therapies . The country has participated in six international events to share advances and learning on mainstreaming natural medicine in Western medicine: United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), held in N ew York City, April 2018, and attended by representatives from Sub- Saharan and Central Africa, Panama, and El Salvador . Sixth International Congress of the Cuban Society of Bioenergetic and Naturalistic Medi cine (BIONAT) , held in Cuba, September 2018. Three International Congresses on Natural Medicine, held in Managua, Nicaragua. These events were conducted over the past three years (Oct. 2017, Oct. 2018 , and Oct. 2019) , and topics revolved around sharing experiences on mainstreaming traditional, ancest ral, and integrative medicinal practices in intercultural health care models. National and international lecturers from Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Central America, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States have attended these events. National i ntercultural meetings hosted by formal, traditional , and territorial authorities and traditional and/or ancestral understanding agents to inform the Indigenous Peoples Safeguard Policy targeting Indigenous Peoples and Afro- descendants , implemented under the W orld Bank-funded project conducted in September 2017. This resulted in their consent to implement the Integrated Public Provision of Health Care Services Project (P164452) and its lines of wo rk. Day-to-day activities carried out by the Institute of Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies: 1. Comprehensive Scientific Research Strategy The IMNTC researches three lines of study: ( 1) Traditional ancestral medicine, (2) Medicinal plants , (3) Clinical and practice- based research. In this regard, the following activities have been undertaken: a) Systematization of experiences in integrating traditional ancestral medicine with Western medicine, including the characterization of the traditional ancestral system in the treatment of culture- bound syndromes, such as Grisi Sikni s. The participation of national delegates in international events facilitates knowledge and exchange, and encourages learning from experiences in other countries for potential adaptation to the domestic context.

Development of Teaching Materials and Promotional Activities Translation of Laws 759 and 774 and regulations thereunder from Spanish to Mayagna, Miskitu, and Creole; these documents have been published for dissemination in health centers and health posts, and maternity waiting homes. These materials also serve as training resources. Workshops to promote natural and complementary medicine among teachers and students . Establishment of harmonic gardens in Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies clinics and offices. Promotion and dissemination of traditional, natural , and complementary medicine through radio shows and fairs. Statistical forms for recording Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies consultations and training were standardized nationwide, including the holistic pain management and natural medicine clinical record form . Work Plan 2020- 2023: 1. Continu e implementing staff training and research processes through different modalities. 2. Keep strengthening c omplementary therapy and holistic pain management clinics . 3. Formulate medicine integration plans through territorial -based intercultural dialogues to reinforce intercultural community health networks by acknowledging and profiling speci alists and/or traditional agents. Each plan will be culturally sensitive and culturally aware of Indigenous Peoples and Afro- descendants . 4. Validate and implement the grievance redress mechanism (GRM) of the Indigenous Peoples Plan to be developed under the Traditional Ancestral Medicine Integration Plans. This GRM will be sustained by Free, Prior , and Informed Consent (FPIC) of Indigenous Peoples , aimed to establish a mechanism that allows Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants to raise their grievances, concerns, and suggestions on the implementation of their Traditional Ancestral Medicine Integration Plans that strengthen the Community an d Family Health Model . The activities promoted by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health ((Ministerio de Salud de Rep\u00fablica de Nicaragua, MINSA ) through the Institute of Natural Medicine and Complementary Therapies are conducted in conformance with the Constitution and Convention N\u00ba 169 of the International Labor Organization on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which clearly recognizes their rights .
