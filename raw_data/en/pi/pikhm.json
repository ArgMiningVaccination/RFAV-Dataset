April 2018: 2018 ASLMS Research Grant Award Congratulations to Leon Leanse, PhD along with his mentor Tianhong Dai, PhD on receiving the 2018 ASLMS Research Grant Award. Project Title: Elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial blue light (aBL) therapy and its synergistic action within quinine. Source and type of award: American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) Research Grant Brief summary of specific aims: With the rise in antimicrobial resistance, it is essential that we look to other, 'non-antibiotic' strategies, e.g. antimicrobial blue light (aBL), as alternative methods to treat infections. aBL therapy is a novel and effective approach for the treatment of infections caused by different pathogens. Although aBL has been shown to be highly effective in inactivating pathogens, varied sensitivities are often observed between microbial species, with some eliciting significantly high relative resistances. Therefore, it is vital that approaches, such as aBL combination therapies, are investigated, so we may improve microbial inactivation while simultaneously providing safer and more timely care to patients. This proposal represents the first instance where the synergistic effect of aBL and quinine will be investigated. Our hypotheses are (1): aBL-quinine therapy will offer an improved inactivation efficacy of numerous microbial species; (2): elucidating the transcriptional portrait of bacteria exposed to aBL or aBL-quinine will reveal novel mediators of their respective activities. Therefore, the following aims will be completed: Aim 1: Investigate the synergistic effect of aBL-Q-HCL therapy against numerous bacteria: in vitro and in vivo. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria will be treated with aBL-Q-HCL to determine whether any improvement in the antimicrobial efficacy is observed (against aBL or Q-HCL alone). Inactivatoon of planktonic cells and cells within biofilms (monomicrobial and polymicrobial) will be tested, with different aBL irradiances and Q-HCL concentrations. Superficial mouse skin infections caused by different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria will be treated (after a 3 or 24-hour incubation) with aBL-Q-HCL to establish any improvement in the treatment efficacy (against aBL or Q-HCL alone). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy will be performed on cells treated with aBL-QHCL to predict the mechanism of action. Any cytotoxic effect of aBL-Q-HCL therapy to host cells will be determined using the MTT tetrazolium assay. Aim 2: Elucidate the transcriptional portrait of P. aeruginosa, when exposed to aBL or aBL-Q-HCL, in vitro, using RNA-seq. We will elucidate the transcriptional portrait of, P. aeruginosa, when exposed to aBL or aBL-Q-HCL, in vitro. Highly differentially expressed genes will be targets of defined mutagenesis. Up-regulated genes will be deleted from the chromosome, using a sacB markerless mutation strategy. Mutants found to be significantly more resistant/sensitive to aBL or aBL-Q-HCL will be heterologously complemented with the native gene using pUCP19. Complemented strains that regain wild-type sensitivity to aBL aBL-QHCL activity. Congratualtion Leon!

The award was presented to Dr. Hasan by Maryellen L. Giger, Ph.D., SPIE President, at the SPIE Photonics West meeting on January 27th in San Francisco, CA. January 2018: SPIE-Franz Hillenkamp Fellowship Award Congratulations to Haley L. Marks, PhD Research Fellow in Evans Research Laboratory on receiving The Inaugural SPIE-Franz Hillenkamp Postdoctoral Fellowship Award. ABSTRACT: Dr. Marks will continue her work to further develop a luminescent bandage material capable of assessing local tissue oxygenation to alert physicians of tissue viability and allow for more accurate dispensing of therapeutic molecules on demand through the dressing into open or weeping wounds. The proposed bandage incorporates a clinically validated phosphorescent oxygen-sensing dye into a second generation drug-releasing polymer matrix to provide clinicians with visual feedback of overall tissue health and improve treatment efficacy in dermal wound monitoring. The bandage, called SMART for Sensing, Monitoring, And Release of Therapeutics, tracks tissue oxygenation by changing color and is designed to even administer drugs. The award supports interdisciplinary problem-driven research and provides opportunities for translating new technologies into clinical practice for improving human health. Dr. Marks will have the benefit of co-mentorship under this grant from both Dr. Evans, for research, and Dr. Gabriela Apiou, for translational sciences. The award will be presented to Marks during the [BiOS Hot Topics](http://spie.org/PWb/special-events/Plenary-Event) event, part of [SPIE Photonics West](http://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west?wt.mc_id=rpw18gb&utm_id=rpw18gb&SSO=1), on Saturday, 27 of January.

January 2018: Chairing an OSA Technical Group Congratulations to Amira Eltony, PhD for being elected Chair of the [Microscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography (BM)](https://www.osa.org/en-us/get_involved/technical_groups/bmo/microscopy_and_optical_coherence_tomography_(bm)/) technical group within the Optical Society of America. This group has 2,042 members and Dr. Eltony will be chairing this committee for a term of 3 years. Congratulations Amira! January 2018: 2018 Bullock Postdoctoral Fellowship Award recipients Congratulations to Kwon-Hyeon Kim, Ph.D. along with his mentors Andy Yun, PhD and Peng Yin, PhD as well as Matthias M\u00fcller, Ph.D. along with his mentors Martin Purschke, PhD and Kathryn D. Held, PhD on receiving the 2018 Bullock Postdoctoral Fellowship Award. Dr. Kim's submitted title and abstract was: Project title: Organic semiconductor micro-laser particles The broad goal of this proposed research is to develop microscopic laser particles as novel probes in biomedical imaging and assays. The stimulated emission characteristics of laser particles are quite different from fluorescence. Their narrow linewidth (<0.5 nm) and high brightness make them attractive for multi-channel cytometry, histopathology, and deep-tissue animal imaging. To realize lasers in small dimension, high-gain optical materials are critical. The concentra-tion quenching of organic dyes limits the maximum achievable gain coefficient to typically <100 cm-1. Here, I propose to investigate solid-state organic semiconductor gain materials. I will investigate two candidate materials, organoboron (TPEQBN) and platinum complex (Pt(fppz)2), which I believe may avoid concentration quenching via their large steric hin-drance and stokes shifts and can produce efficient excimer emission and high quantum yield. I expect to obtain a gain coefficient of >1,000 cm-1, an order of magnitude higher than the best organic dyes known to date. Next, I will integrate the organic semiconductor gain media with dielectric micro-cavities to demonstrate laser particles with submicron sizes. If successful, the expected results will establish organic semiconductors as promising gain materials for laser particles and will demonstrate the first submicron-laser particles ever built with such materials, which have potential as novel bright, multi-color optical probes. Dr. M\u00fcller's submitted title and abstract was: Project title: Targeting hypoxic cancer cells with UVC emitting nanoparticles Cancer is a major cause of worldwide mortality. In 2012, 14 million new cancer diseases and 8 million deaths attributed to cancer occurred. Radiation therapy is the gold standard treatment for inoperable malignant tumors, which is very effective but still requires multiple treatments with surrounding tissue damage. The irradiation of normal tissue can lead to deleterious side effects such as fibrosis. One reason for the suboptimal efficacy is the heterogenicity of the tumor tissue, in particular the variation of the O2 concentration within a tumor. Hypoxic areas, mainly located towards the center of the tumor are up to 3 times more radioresistant compared to normoxic areas. To increase the efficiency of radiation therapy, we propose combining traditional X-ray treatment with tumor-localized UVC emitting LuPO4:Pr3+ nanoparticles (NPs). Using the combined treatment, X-rays are converted by the NPs into UVC radiation inside the tumor. UVC damages the DNA via an oxygen-independent mechanism that could improve treatment efficacy. Especially within hypoxic tumor areas, an increased efficacy is expected. In addition, due to the limited penetration depth of UVC radiation, only tumor tissue will be affected by local UVC exposure, while normal surrounding tissue will be spared. The inorganic compound LuPO4:Pr3+ is a scintillating material. Under excitation with X-rays, LuPO4:Pr3+ emits UVC radiation in the range from 225 to 290 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum. Interaction between radiation with these wavelengths and the DNA leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers as well as 6-4 photoproducts and eventually to cell death. Further, absorption of X-rays by LuPO4:Pr3+ also produces lower energy X-rays and electrons with higher energy deposition rates. The research project will focus on the application of the UV emitting NPs to prove the concept of the project idea. For this purpose, a cancer cell line will be treated with the NPs and subsequently irradiated with X-rays. After the combined treatment, the viability of the cells will be measured. In addition, the unselective toxicity of the nanoparticles will be evaluated. In a further step, the experiments will be conducted in absence of oxygen to investigate the impact of the combined treatment under hypoxic circumstances. Congratulations to you all! October 2017: 2017 Clinical Research Day Award We are delighted to announce this year's winner of the Clinical Research Day Award for the Department of Dermatology.

This award is given to investogators who are conducting impressive work that is both challenging and inspiring. The title of Andy's application is \"Barcoding cells with laser mitochondria.\" Congratulations Andy! March 2016: National Institutes of Health RO1Research Grant Congratulations to Tianhong Dai , PhD for being selected as this year's grant recipient from the Smith Infections Disease Foundation. The title of his grant submission was \"Antimicrobial blue light therapy against infectious Keratitis.\" Brief Summary: Infectious keratitis is a potentially blinding ocular condition of the cornea. Treatment of infectious keratitis must be rapidly instituted to minimize the destruction of corneal tissue, limit the extent of corneal scarring and prevent vision loss. A novel light-based antimicrobial approach, antimicrobial blue light (aBL) therapy, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the involvement of exogenous photosensitizers. The corneal transparency and the superficial nature of keratitis make keratitis an ideal candidate for aBL therapy. In this study, we will investigate the effectiveness of aBL (415 nm) therapy against infectious keratitis using an ex vivo rabbit model and an in vivo mouse model. A bioluminescent strain of P. aeruginosa was used as the causative pathogen, allowing noninvasive monitoring of the extent of infection in real time. March 2016: Orthopaedic Trauma Association, Member Research Grant Award Congratulations to Tianhong Dai , PhD for being selected as this year's Orthopaedic Trauma Association's Member Research Grant Award recipient. The title of his grant submission was \"Antimicrobial blue light therapy for treatment of post-traumatic implant-related infections in orthopaedics.\" Brief summary: The treatment of an implant-related infection is exceedingly difficult. Bacteria form biofilms on implanted materials that block penetration of immune cells and antibiotics, promoting bacterial survival. Continued emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has further complicated treatment. Using murine models, this proposal is to investigate the utility of a novel non-antibiotic approach, antimicrobial blue light, for treatment of posttraumatic implant-related infections in orthopeadics, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. March 2016: National Institutes of Health RO1Research Grant Congratulations to Tianhong Dai , PhD for being awarded a RO1 grant from the National Institutes of Health. The title of his grant submission was \"Antimicrobial Blue Light Inactivation of Pathogenic Microbes.\" Brief Summary: Drug resistance of pathogenic microbes in healthcare and community settings is a quickly growing and extremely dangerous health threat. There is consequently a critical need for the development of alternative therapeutics to tackle drug resistance. The objective of this ROl application is to investigate a novel non-antibiotic approach, antimicrobial blue light (aBL), to target/treat microbes including drug-resistant strains.

Her grant applicationwas on \"Antimicrobial blue light inactivation of biofilms: in vitro and in vivo studies\". Abstract: Biofilms affect more than 80% of bacterial infections in human, with urinary catheter use associated with up to 90% of these infections. Biofilm-related infections are commonly persistent. The situation is exacerbated by the increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. New approaches are required to tackle biofilm-related infections. The goal of this proposed research is to investigate the utility of a novel non-antibiotic approach, antimicrobial blue light (aBL), for inactivation of biofilms. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of aBL inactivation of a wide range of clinically important bacterial pathogens in biofilms in vitro. Aim 2: To evaluate the potential side effects of aBL on relevant host cells. Aim 3: To determine the efficacy of aBL inactivation of biofilms in a mouse model of urinary tract infection.

March 2014: 2014 ASLMS Research Grant Congratulations to Co-PIs Tianhong Dai, PhD and Seok-Hyun (Andy) Yun, PhD on their 2014 ASLMS Research Grant! Dr. Dai and Dr. Yun won the 2014 ASLMS Research Grant for their research proposal \"Interstitial delivery of antimicrobial blue light to deeply-seated soft tissue infections using a novel fiber-optic micro-needle array bandage.\" Brief summary of specific aims: Antimicrobial blue light therapy has been attracting increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the involvement of exogenous photosensitizer. However, due to the limit of blue light penetration inside tissue, topical light delivery may not be able to reach deeply-seated infections. In this project, we will investigate the use of a novel fiber-optic micro-needle array bandage for interstitial delivery of antimicrobial blue light to deeply-seated infections. March 2014: Award from the Harvard Catalyst Reactor Program Giuliano Scarcelli, PhD, a member of Seok-Hyun (Andy) Yun's team has recently received an award from the Harvard Catalyst Reactor Program. Dr. Scarcelli's submitted a projected titled \"Diagnosis of keratoconus using biomechanical metrics via Brillouin microscopy\". Here is a brief abstract of this project and its specific aim(s): Despite the importance of corneal biomechanical properties in the development and progression of keratoconus, current diagnostic techniques rely on corneal morphology. Irregular morphologic patterns often precede vision impairment and can be detected by topography and pachymetry. However, morphological signs are not necessarily correlated with the biomechanical stability of the cornea. As a result, a major clinical need remains outstanding, i.e. a reliable and early diagnosis of keratoconus and of its rate of progression. To address this need, during a pilot clinical study funded by Harvard Catalyst, we have developed a clinical instrument based on Brillouin microscopy, which can measure corneal elasticity with 3D resolution without contacting or perturbing the eye. Leveraging on this novel technology, the overall goal of this research program is introduce elasticity-based metrics for keratoconus diagnosis and CXL therapy monitoring. Our central hypothesis, based on human data we collected during the pilot keratoconus study, is that Brillouin-measured stiffness is a suitable indicator of corneal biomechanical stability and thus can serve for early diagnosis of keratoconus progression and for evaluation of CXL treatment outcome. March 2014: Partners In Excellence award 2014 Congratulations to Pinar Avci, PhD and Bernadette Vijayakanthan for receiving a Partners in Excellence award this year.

Of all primary malignant gliomas and tumors of the central nervous system diagnosed, the most common (54.4%) and deadliest form is GBM. Five-year survival rates of GBM do not exceed 5% and the median patient survival rates are 12-15 months.1-3 Front-line treatments for GBM including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however their effect on prognosis of aggressive gliomas such as GBM remains modest.1 The research plan proposes to utilize powerful imaging techniques to probe the outcome of a PDT-based combination treatment aimed at simultaneously controlling angiogenesis, a major factor in GBM related mortality. References: |Toshihiko Oki, MD, PhD|| | Project Title: Defining the relationship of microanatomic location, quiescence and drug resistance in AML Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common adult acute leukemia with a high relapse rate. Treatment-resistant AML is uniformly fatal and to overcome drug resistance to prevent relapse is indispensable for improving long term outcome of the disease. Several reports have indicated that the quiescent, non cycling, population of AML cells is drug resistant and that the external supports from the bone marrow microenvironment (niche) are important for the maintenance of quiescence (G0 phase) of AML cells. However, the localization of their niche and how the niche regulates the cell cycle and drug resistance of AML cells have not been clearly shown, especially by using syngeneic immunocompetent mice. The goal of this proposal is to clarify the link between AML drug resistance and cell cycle and to understand which interactions between AML cells and their microenvironment influence their cell cycle status. We have developed a novel realtime cycle indicator system for quiescent cells. Our novel indicator system does not require fixation of the cells or long-term chasing periods as the other methods to detect quiescent cells and it effectively labels Ki-67 negative quiescent cells. In this proposal, we will investigate localization, cell cycle status, and drug response of AML cells by using the novel realtime cell cycle indicator system in combination with state-of-art in vivo imaging, live cell sorting and immunohistochemistry. This work will be conducted with collaborations between laboratories of Dr. Charles P Lin and my mentor Dr. Scadden. |Giovanni Ughi, PhD|| | Project Title: Clinical translation of dual modality intravascular imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease: combination of optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) with near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both women and men >35 years old in the United States of America. Direct and indirect costs were estimated to be >300 billion dollars per year in the United States only and constantly increasing. Intravascular OFDI is rapidly becoming the method of choice for the investigation of atherosclerosis, which is the main cause of heart attack, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Although intravascular OFDI is capable of visualizing vessel wall microstructure and intraluminal objects (e.g., stent struts and intracoronary thrombus) in great detail, the combination with near infrared fluorescence (NIRF), enabling for the simultaneous acquisition of complementary cellular and molecular functional information, may greatly enhance its clinical utility. As a matter of fact, dual-modality OFDI-NIRF may allow for the first time to simultaneously acquire co-localized information of vessel wall microstructure, composition and functionality (e.g., inflammatory activity) in vivo, holding an enormous potential for an improved understanding and management of the coronary artery disease. The focus of this project is the development and the clinical translation of catheters and systems for dual modality OFDI-NIRF intravascular imaging performing the first-in-human pilot study.

September 2012: CIMIT Innovation Grant Award Tianhong Dai, PhD, from Dr. Michael Hamblin's team recently won the CIMIT Innovation Grant award for his project titled \"Ultraviolet-C Light for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Multi-Drug Resistant Infections Associated with Burns in the Combat Casualty\". Part of the overview is of this project is as follows: Thermal injury is common to all military conflicts, and burns have comprised 5% to 20% of all combat casualties. Despite advances in military wound care and management, infections remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in wounded service members. The administration of topical antibiotics at the time of injury is considered standard of care. However, current evidence strongly suggests that the massive use of antibiotics may be an important factor in building resistant bacterial strains, causing the infections that cannot be treated with existing antibiotics. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of alternative treatment regimens. Congratulations Tianhong!

Award Period: 4/11/2012 - 04/10/13 Project Title: \"Live Tissue Copying\" Project Overview: The practical goal of this project is to replace missing or dead tissue in wounds suffered by warfighters, in a way that allows very rapid healing with little or no scarring, by harvesting and assembling thousands to millions of microscopic autografts into a \"copy\" of living tissue. The copy and the donor sites heal by remodeling, a fast microscopic form of natural tissue repair, rather than by scarring. Tissue copying is a new paradigm that could potentially speed up wound healing by more than an order of magnitude. Congratulations Rox! June 2012: NIH R01 grant award Benjamin Vakoc, PhD recently received an NIH R01 grant. Award Period: May 2012 - May 2017 Project Title: \"Development of a preclinical optical frequency domain angiography instrument.\" Project Overview: Tumor-induced angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of tumors to malignancy, provides the critical transport of blood-born therapies into the tumor space, and supplies oxygen to effectuate oxygen-dependent radiological and light-based therapies. Pre-clinical research in tumor angiogenesis and tumor microvascular function has traditionally relied on histological methods, which suffer from well-known limitations, or fluorescence-based confocal and multiphoton microscopy, which provide high- resolution three-dimensional mapping of multiple parameters but support imaging over limited fields of view and depths of penetration. By contrast, optical coherence tomography approaches support a relatively larger field of view and depth of penetration and have the potential, if translated into the biological laboratory, to reveal critical and previously hidden aspects of the tumor microvasculature. In our laboratory, we have demonstrated the principles of a unique preclinical optical imaging technology that will be a powerful tool for investigating blood vessels and the biological microenvironment in vivo. The technology, optical frequency domain angiography (OFDA), supports high- resolution three-dimensional imaging similar to multiphoton and confocal microscopy. In this proposal, we propose optical, engineering, computational, and software solutions that will be required to realize a practical and robust OFDA instrument for translation into the biological laboratory. Our approach will unite investigators and resources at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Physical Sciences, Incorporated (PSI). Innovations to the OFDA instrumentation and core algorithms will be performed by the MGH team, while construction of the computational hardware and software that is needed to improve processing will be performed by the PSI team. Our goal is to move OFDA technology from the engineering to the biological laboratory, which may catalyze research into basic cancer biology and cancer therapeutics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In nearly all aspects of cancer biology and cancer therapeutics, the tumor microvasculature plays a significant role, and preclinical imaging tools are invaluable in investigations of the tumor microvasculature. In this grant, we propose to develop a preclinical optical frequency domain angiography instrument and deliver it to the biological investigator. Congratulations Ben!

This award was given to Dr. Anderson on behalf of the Students of the Biomedical Enterprise Program. Congratulations Rox! May 2012: Harvard Catalyst Advanced Imaging Pilot Grant Giuliano Scarcelli, PhD was awarded the Harvard Catalyst Advanced Imaging Pilot Grant for his proposal \"Early detection of corneal ectasia with in vivo Brillouin optical imaging of corneal biomechanical properties.\" Co-Principal Investigators are [Seok-Hyun (Andy) Yun, PhD](faculty-yun-pi.htm) and Roberto Pineda MD, assistant professor ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The abstract to his proposal is as follows: The biomechanical properties of the cornea are essential for its function. Corneal collagen fibers provide the mechanical strength to withstand the intraocular pressure; if corneal tissue becomes abnormally weak, corneal ectasia (i.e. thinning and bulging) ensues, causing severe vision degradation. Abnormal weakening of the cornea occurs due to degenerative ocular conditions, e.g. keratoconus, affecting ~1/2000 of the general population or as a complication of LASIK surgery. Concerns about post-LASIK ectasia prevent about 15% of prospective patients from benefitting from laser vision correction. When clinical symptoms manifest, corneal ectasia is often at an advanced stage that leads to corneal transplant. If inherent corneal weakness were detected early, corneal collagen crosslinking could stop the degenerative bulging and at-risk subjects could be consulted to avoid LASIK surgery. Early detection requires an imaging technique that uses elasticity as a contrast mechanism; current clinical instruments only provide morphological information. This proposal addresses this need by bringing Brillouin imaging to corneal applications. Brillouin imaging can map the elastic modulus of material without contact and with 3D resolution. A pilot clinical study will be performed to compare normal to keratoconus corneas (Aim 1) and normal to post-LASIK ectasia corneas (Aim 2). This proposal is the result of collaboration between the inventors of Brillouin imaging and an expert in ophthalmology and corneal refractive surgery. Congratulations Giuliano! May 2012: 2012 MGH Research Scholars It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2012 MGH Research Scholars.

Selecting from among so many outstanding investigators doing impressive work was both challenging and inspiring. April 2012: ASLMS Research Grant Award Giuliano Scarcelli, PhD was selected by the ASLMS Research Committee to receive funding for his proposal \"A pilot study to identify \"at-risk\" subjects for post-LASIK ectasia using Brillouin microscopy.\" The abstract to his proposal is as follows: The biomechanical properties of the cornea are essential for its function. Corneal collagen fibers provide the mechanical strength to withstand the intraocular pressure; if corneal tissue becomes abnormally weak, corneal ectasia (i.e. thinning and bulging) ensues, causing severe vision degradation. Abnormal weakening of the cornea is a dreaded complication of LASIK surgery. When clinical symptoms manifest, corneal ectasia is often at an advanced stage that leads to corneal transplant. If inherent corneal weakness were detected early, at-risk subjects could be consulted to avoid LASIK surgery; however, current clinical instruments only provide morphological information. This proposal addresses this need through Brillouin microscopy, a novel imaging technology that maps the elastic modulus of material without contact and with 3D resolution. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that low Brillouin elastic modulus is a predictor of post-LASIK ectasia. A pilot clinical study will be performed to compare normal, post-LASIK normal and post-LASIK ectasia corneas in vivo. Introducing elasticity-based risk factors is likely to change the current paradigm for LASIK pre-operative screenings and enable proper identification of at-risk candidates. Congratulations Giuliano!

July 2009: Dr. Michael Hamblin's article \"Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with intra-gastric violet light phototherapy: a pilot clinical trial.\" (Lasers Surg Med, 2009 Jul) has been selected for Faculty of 1000 Medicine. [Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection with intra-gastric violet light pilot clinical trial.](http://f1000medicine.com/article/57x0gx1wqbwjsm1/id/1161533) Lembo AJ, Ganz RA, Sheth S, Cave D, Kelly C, Levin P, Kazlas PT, Baldwin PC 3rd, Lindmark WR, McGrath JR, BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori infects the mucus layer of the human stomach and causes peptic ulcers and adenocarcinoma. We have previously shown that H. pylori accumulates photoactive porphyrins making the organism susceptible to inactivation by light, and that small spot endoscopic illumination with violet light reduced bacterial load in human stomachs. This study assessed the feasibility and safety of whole-stomach intra-gastric violet phototherapy for the treatment of H. pylori infection. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled, prospective pilot trial was conducted using a novel light source consisting of laser diodes and diffusing fibers to deliver 408-nm illumination at escalating total fluences to the whole stomach. Eighteen adults (10 female) with H. pylori infection were treated at three U.S. academic endoscopy centers. Quantitative bacterial counts were obtained from biopsies taken from the antrum, body, and fundus, and serial urea breath tests. RESULTS: The largest reduction in bacterial load was in the antrum (>97%), followed by body (>95%) and fundus (>86%). There was a correlation between log reduction and initial bacterial load in the antrum. There was no dose-response seen with increasing illumination times. The urea breath test results indicated that the bacteria repopulated in days following illumination. CONCLUSION: Intra-gastric violet light phototherapy is feasible and safe and may represent a novel approach to eradication of H. pylori, particularly in patients who have failed standard antibiotic treatment. This was a pilot study involving a small number of patients. Further research is needed to determine if phototherapy can be effective for eradicating H. pylori.
