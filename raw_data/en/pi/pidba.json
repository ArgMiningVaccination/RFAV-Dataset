You open the door and a receptionist smiles and asks why you have come in this morning. You tell her it's because you have an unknown rash spreading on the surface of your arm. After waiting patiently with Sports Illustrated and Us Weekly magazines, you proceed to the back of the office to have a doctor in a white lab coat listen to your deep breathing through an ice-cold stethoscope. The fluorescent lights brighten the pea green walls and a distinctly sterile smell lingers in the air. The doctor examines your rash and prescribes an antihistamine drug and a steroidal cream to treat your symptoms. But now let's say that you live in Ethiopia where [90% ](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/617459/)of the country uses herbal remedies as their primary healthcare. You visit the village healer. In the hot sun, you wait for shelter in the healer's thatched hut. It's finally your turn and you sit amidst herbs, bones, and remedies kept safely in mason jars and clay pots. The healer identifies your rash and, instead, attempts to find the underlying cause of the peculiar pattern. The healer determines it is due to a pitta (an ancient medicinal term for the cause of heat) imbalance and gives you sweet, cooling herbs to reduce the inflammation. This situation is resolved by two differing methods. Neither approach is necessarily wrong nor right in its way of healing. Instead, two different perspectives utilize a particular type of medicine that complies with their healthcare beliefs. Modern medicine is aimed at suppressing symptoms in one isolated area, while traditional medicine attempts to identify and restore the underlying imbalance of the body. Throughout recent years, the debate between the use of conventional medical techniques and the use of alternative, traditional medicines has been strongly weighed. On the modern side of medicine, medication is made from industrialized substances with the involvement of intensive and reliant scientific research. On the other hand, traditional practices are not nearly as tested but aim at utilizing natural substances to return the body to homeostasis. Conventional and traditional medicine remain two separate entities of healthcare and hardly cross paths with one another despite their overarching similarities in health and wellness. What is traditional medicine? According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/traditional-medicine), traditional medicine is defined as \"the knowledge, skills, and practices based on theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, used in the maintenance of health and in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement of the treatment of physical and mental illness.\" In this lengthy definition lies the basis of traditional medicine: a focus on the prevention of disease and illness through the introduction of natural practices or substances. Practices in traditional medicine rely heavily on the interconnectedness of the mind and body and the unification of all functioning systems. Which countries use traditional medicine? Today, in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, roughly [70-95%](https://www.scidev.net/global/medicine/feature/traditional-medicine-modern-times-facts-figures.html) of the population uses traditional medicine as primary healthcare. Even in the United States, traditional medicine is slowly gaining popularity as individuals are becoming more conscious of what substances are placed into their bodies. However, compared to investments in the pharmaceutical industry, interest and efforts towards traditional medicine remains rather modest. Types of traditional medicine One of the world's oldest holistic or \"whole-body\" healing systems, Ayurveda, was developed over 3,000 years ago in India and is still practiced today. The rooted belief in Ayurveda relies on the delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Here are some practices you might be familiar with: - Yoga - Tongue scraping - Rising with the sun - Holy basil (remedy for colds and flu) - Boswellia (anti-inflammatory herb) In ancient China, traces of therapeutic activities date back to the 14th-11th centuries BCE. Traditional practitioners used herbal medicines and various mind and body activities, such as: - Acupuncture - Cupping - Tai chi The Dilemma While modern medicine thrives in urgent situations, such as heart attacks, strokes, and sudden organ failures, it falls short in its ability to treat chronic illnesses that rely on medical treatment for extended periods of time. This is where traditional or alternative medicine steps in. The treatment of chronic illnesses, such as Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Lupus, Arthritis, cancer, etc., has assisted in making huge strides in unconventional medicine. For example, a naturopathic medicine, [LDI (low dose immunotherapy)](https://www.holtorfmed.com/low-dose-immunotherapy-ldi/), which is a liquid consisting of Mycobacterium, is introduced to a patient's immune system to restore proper balance through the reduction of inflammation that is caused by pathogens. In less technical terms, LDI antigens fight off the \"not so good\" cells that are causing the inflammation and sickness, ultimately suppressing the immune system's over-reaction. In this case, natural medicine has proven to be a competitor with other conventional practices. However, 75.5% of western healthcare professionals who participated in an online survey on [Drug and Therapeutic Bulletin](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/04/alternative-medicine-taught-doctors-medical-school.html) stated that their profession was poorly informed about herbal and traditional medicines, indicating that while both forms of medicine are aimed at healing, education systems separate the two practices. With potential advances in medicine rooted deeply in the past, doctors may be missing out on potential cures by only focusing on the advancements in the westernized future.
