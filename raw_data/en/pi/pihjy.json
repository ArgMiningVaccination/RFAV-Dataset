The council includes tribal leaders, urban Indian health leaders, representatives of the Governor's office, state agency leaders, and legislators to address issues in Washington State's Indian health care delivery system. Th e council convened on July 16, November 7 and 8, and December 11 and 20, and approved this report to the Governor and the Legislature during the December 20 meeting. As specified in the proviso, this report provides the following recommendations for the state: A. Establish the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council to : Adopt a biennial Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan; Address issues with tribal implications that are not able to be resolved at the agency level; and Provide oversight of the Indian Health Improvement Reinvestment Account . B. Establish an Indian Health Improvement Reinvestment Account into which the new state savings due to the new 100 percent Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ( FMAP ), less agreed upon administrative costs to maintain fiscal neutrality , will be appropriated and deposited (subject to federal appropriations). C. Appropriate sufficient funding for five full -time equivalent (FTE) Health Care Authority (HCA) staff (approximately $500,000 in salaries and benefits, as included in HCA decision package #37 and the Governor's 2019 -2021 proposed bud get) to partner with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal governments to meet federal requirements that allow the state to receive the 100 percent FMAP on services currently provided to American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) Medicaid enrollees at st andard FMAP rates. D. Partner with tribes to cover the expenses for meetings and related costs for the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council to complete the first Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan by November 1, 2019, which will include all of the analyses described in section 213(mmm) of ESSB 6032 . Fiscal budget estimates and draft legislation to support the recommendations are in the appendices to this report. 3 Background Health Disparities American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in Washington State suffer some of the greatest health disparities of any racial/ethnic group.1 Using state and tribal data, the Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (NWTEC) determined that the overall premature mortality rate for AI/AN for 2006 through 2010 was 71 perc ent higher than for non- Hispanic whites. 2 NWTEC also prepared Chart 1 with the top five premature mortality rates for AI/AN and non -Hispanic whites.2 As shown in Chart 1, AI/ANs have significantly higher rates of premature death due to heart disease (67 percent higher), cancer (18 percent higher), unintentional injury (126 percent higher), chronic lower respiratory disease (41 percent higher), and diabetes (186 percent higher). Due to the complex analysis required to prepare these more complete data, the most recent NWTEC report is based on 2014 data. More recent state -only premature mortality data , as published in the 2018 Washington State Health Assessment , reflect similarly significant premature mortality rates 1 Note s on Data : (a) There is no single source of h ealth data on AI/ANs. Each tribe has its own data, which are reported to the Indian Health Service (IHS). Separately, the Washington Department of Health maintains vital statistics data , as well as sample -based data, such as the Healthy Youth Survey (HYS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . A complete picture requires knowledge of, and work with, these diverse data sets . (b) There is no single policy on how to identify AI/AN individuals. While tribes identify individuals as AI/AN even if they self -identify as two or more races, the state categorizes individuals who self - identify as two or more races into a separate \"Two or Mor e Races\" category, leaving in the AI/AN category only those individuals who self -identify as AI/AN only. As a result, the state's data on the AI/AN population reflects less than half of the state's total AI/AN population. 2 Northwest Tribal Epidemiology C enter (NWTEC). (2014).

Completed suicide rate for AI/AN is much higher than for any other race (Chart 3). Drug overdose mortality rate for AI/AN is more than twice the rate for non - Hispanic whites (Chart 4). The disparities continue across the spectrum of chronic diseases an d mental illnesses. Compared to non -Hispanic whites, AI/ANs have significantly higher rates of: Asthma ; Coronary heart disease and hypertension; Diabetes , pre-diabetes, and obesity; Dental caries in third grade ; Poor mental health and youth depressive feelings; Adult and youth cigarette smoking and vaping; Adult and y outh cannabis use ; and Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder . 3 3 Department of Health publication 78945, available at http:// www.doh.wa.gov/healthassessment Chart 2: Infant Mortality by Maternal Race Washington State DOH , 2013 -2015 0 3 6 9 Rate per 1,000 Live Births Chart 3: Suicide Washington State DOH , 2011 -2015 0 10 20 30 Age-Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Chart 4: Drug Overdose Washington State DOH , 2012 -2016 Age-Adjusted Rate per 100,000 5 Adverse Childhood Experiences and Historical Trauma Higher rates of poor health and poor health outcomes \u2014 as reflected in the health disparities data \u2014 have been associated with higher rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).4 When ACEs disrupt neuro - development and impair social, emotional, and cognitive growth, individuals adopt health -risk behavior s that lead to disease, dis - ability, and social problems \u2014 resulting in premature mortality; see Diagram 1 for a visual representation. 4 Measured by a 10 question screening tool, ACEs are various forms of childhood trauma in the home, including emotional , physical, or sexual abuse ; neglect; and other household challenges during childhood . The ACE s score has been used as a measure of cumulative exposure to traumatic stress in childhood. As shown in Chart 5, AI/AN adults reported nearly twice the rate of 3+ ACEs compared to non -Hispanic white adults. 5 These data mean that between 39 percent and 54 percent of AI/AN adults reported childhood exposure to 3 or more traumatic family stressors, compared to 26 percent of non -Hispanic white adults. In AI/AN communi ties, these disparately high rates of adverse childhood experiences are a direct result of historical trauma, which becomes intergenerational trauma through repeating cycles of ACEs over generations. Historical trauma refers to situations where a community experienced traumatic events, the events generated high levels of collective distress, and the events were 4 Felitti, V. J., Anda, R.

The effects of historical trauma , however, manifest in the everyday experience of AI/AN communities today \u2014 in the ways they relate to one another, in their bodies, and in their daily thoughts. First studied in World War II holocaust survivors, historical trauma in AI/AN communities resulted from the legacy of genocide, a century of socio - cultural destruction through forced relocation and boarding schools, and continuing racial discrimination and socio -economic poverty.7 Responses to historical trauma at the individual level may include post -traumatic stress disorder, guilt, anxiety, grief, and depression . Responses at the familial level may include impaired family communication and stress around parenting.8 The burdens of historical trauma weigh heavily on AI/AN youth , with 1 in 6 thinking daily or several times a day about loss of trust, family, and respect .9 More recently, historical trauma has been found to have epigenetic impacts across generations , as historical trauma and ACEs alter gene expression that is then epigenetically transmitted to future generations .10 Limitations of Evidence -Based Practices In the face of this historical/intergenerational traum a, adverse childhood experiences, and resulting health disparities, the quality of care that AI/ANs receive is \"that much more important .\"11 Yet, few research -based and evidence -based practices (EBPs) have been tested in tribal communities. Those that have been developed from AI/AN communities can be expensive to implement and maintain. Moreover , the diversity of tribal communities can limit the efficacy of EBPs, particularly if they were normed in such a way as to be particular to some tribal communities and cultures but not others. 6 Evans -Campbell, T.

Available at https://wahealthalliance.org/alliance -reports -websites/alliance -reports/ 7 Due to this diversity of tribal communities and cultures, the only way to ensure a high quality of services is through direct interaction with tribes and AI/AN communities to ensure the practices are culturally appropriate .12 This is true whether the practices are EBPs or promising practices, because culture mediates health care.13 For example, AI/AN cultures have a holistic and relationship -oriented view of health and well -being. As a result, treatments that focu s only on parts of the individual without working on healing the family and the spirit will likely not be successful \u2014 even when they are evidence- based. 14 Without the flexibility to adapt EBPs or to implement promising practices, EBPs are likely to result in poor health outcomes . The only EBPs that are likely to result in better health outcomes are those based on the specific tribal community. Examples of Proven Practices Family Spirit15 is a culturally tailored, evidence -based home -visiting model used by more than 100 tribal communities across the nation. This model addresses intergenerational behavioral health problems, applies local cultural assets, and overcomes deficits in the profess ional healthcare workforce in low -resource communities. Designed for, by, and with AI/AN families, community - based paraprofessionals deliver culturally appropriate , behaviorally -focused interventions to support young parents from pregnancy through three ye ars post -partum. A tribal community can link this program to other programs, such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), behavioral health, Head Start, Indian Child Welfare, domestic violence intervention, and substance use disorder programs. Pulling Together for Wellness 16 is a comprehensive, culturally -grounded prevention framework based on a policy, systems, and environmental change approach. The framework was co -designed through the guidance of Washington tribal and urban Indian leaders with input f rom elders, youth, students, communit ies, program staff, and public health specialists. It adapts evidence- based practice by integrating western science and n ative ways of thinking . The approach uses th e medicine wheel model \u2014 a holistic view of health inc luding emotional, social, physical, and spiritual health. It honors the native values of the particular community seeking change, using a culturally appropriate and community -specific process to engage multiple sectors, including community members, in deci sion making. The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe adopted this framework to improve the health of tribal members for seven generations by embracing the traditions of their ancestors to 12 Woolf, S., Grol, R., Hutchinson, A., Eccles, M., & Grimshaw, J.

In recognition of their successful implementation, the Trib e received the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health prize in 2016. The Healing of the Canoe Project17 is a collaborative project between the Suquamish Tribe, the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe , and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute at the Univer sity of Washington. Suquamish and Port Gamble S'Klallam both identified the prevention of youth substance abuse and the need for a sense of cultural belonging and cultural revitalization among youth as primary issues of community concern. The Healing of th e Canoe partnership has sought to address these issues through a community based, culturally grounded prevention and intervention life skills curriculum for tribal youth that builds on the community's strengths and resources The Culturally Grounded Life Sk ills for Youth Curriculum uses the Canoe Journey as a metaphor, providing youth the skills needed to navigate their journey through life without being pulled off course by alcohol or drugs \u2014 with tribal culture, tradition , and values as a compass to guide them, and an anchor to ground them . One key element of this program's success is the ability to adapt the Healing of the Canoe Project to different tribal communities and cultures. Nuka System of Care 18 is a whole health care system (medical, dental, behavioral, traditional , and health care support services ) based on the recognition that the relationship between the primary care team and the client (also known as the customer -owner) a s the single most important tool in managing chronic disease, control ling health care costs, and improving the overall wellness of a population . Recognizing that individuals are ultimately in control of their own lifestyle choices and health care decisions, Nuka focuses on understanding each customer -owner's unique story, values , and influencers , in an effort to engage them in their care and support long -term behavior change. Nuka also focuses on growing health professionals \u2014 encouraging medical assistants to become registered nurses, nurses to become advanced registered nu rse practitioners (ARNPs), and ARNPs to become physicians through education scholarships. In recognition of their success with Nuka , the Southcentral Foundation received the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award in 2011 and 2017 . Wisdom Warriors19 is a c hronic disease prevention and control program that provides tribal elders education and tools to make healthier lifestyle choices. The Northwest Regional Council and the Administration for Community Living partnered with Washington tribes to locally adapt the Minnesota tribes' Wisdom Steps program. 20 It incorporates the Stanford chronic disease self - management model using culturally appropriate incentives for making positive lifestyle changes. Tribal elders practice good preventive health by having health sc reenings and participating in healthy living activities. The National Indian Health Board has recognized this program, and the Department of Health has stated that it has been instrumental to falls prevention. 17 Healing of the Canoe. (2018).

Mental health providers of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and the Upper Skagit Tribe cooperatively developed the program with input from tribal elders. This counseling mod el draws from traditional Indian healing. Barriers Tribes and other Indian health care providers experience many barriers to providing culturally appropriate care. Burdensome reporting requirements and reimbursement processes impose administrative hurdles to financing and sustainability. Poor access to broadband internet and outdated computer and information systems interfere with the ability to use technology to improve care and to remotely report home care treatment hours on -site. All tribes and other In dian health care providers are considered health professional shortage areas, reflecting the challenges of recruiting and retaining health care professionals. Various loan repayment and forgiveness programs for health care professionals have mitigated \u2014 but not solved \u2014 the shortage of health care professionals at tribes and other Indian health care providers. A bigger barrier \u2014 perhaps the biggest barrier \u2014 is the chronic underfunding of Indian health care nationwide. Federal Funding Deficiencies for Indian Health Care The health care delivery system for AI/ANs in the United States is complex and unique, resulting from treaty obligations, federal court cases, and federal laws.22 Since 1955, Congress has funded health care delivery through the IHS, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Originally an agency that provided health care and related services, IHS has only three service units remaining today in Washington State. The IHS service units provide health care services on three Indian reservations in eastern Washington. Under the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, every tribe in Washington State has contracted to administer some or all of their health care programs funded through IHS. In addition, under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Congress authorized the establishment of urban Indian health programs to serve AI/ANs in metropolitan areas to fulfill the sp ecial trust responsibility to AI/ANs who could not access health care from an IHS or tribal facility; the urban Indian health programs in Washington operate in Seattle and Spokane. In 2018, Congress appropriated approximately $5.5 billion for all IHS -funde d projects and programs. 21 Swinomish Tribal Mental Health Project. (2002).

(2014). American Indian h ealth policy: Historical trends and c ontemporary issues. American Journal of Public Health , 104(Suppl 3), S263 -S267 . Available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl Yet, Congress persistently underfunds health care for AI/ANs. For example, as shown in Chart 6, IHS per capita funding for health care delivery increased minimally from $ 2,741 in 2010 to $ 2,834 in 2016 . With the growth in overall health care spending per capita from $8,411 to $10,410, the ratio of IHS spending to overall spending actually declined from 33 percent in 2010 to 27 percent in 2016. In its December 20, 2018 publication,23 the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described oth er aspects of this underfunding, including IHS funding being subject to full sequestration and IHS budgets not receiving advance appropriations, both of which impede any planning for the future . Data Sources: National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) Table 1 for All Health Care Spending per capita and Table 21 for Medicare and Medicaid Spending per enrollee; National Congress of American Indians Fiscal Year Indian Country Budget Requests: Healthcare for IHS Spending per user. In June 2018, the IHS Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup issued an interim report on their attempt to establish a methodology for estimating the percentage of need currently met by IHS appropriations;24 see Table 1 for data drawn from that report. Using the per capita amou nts from that report , along with the numbers of AI/AN Medicaid enrollees and AI/AN individuals in Washington State, we estimate in the last two lines of Table 1 the total amounts of funding needed in Washington State to bring spending for AI/AN health care up to the average spent nationwide on health care for both populations \u2014 by category of services. As shown in Table 1, approximately $898 million per year of additional funding would be necessary to bring health care spending on all AI/ANs in the state up to the same level as what is spent on health care for all U.S. residents. These estimates do not take into account any additional funding that would be necessary to address the severe health disparities reflected above. 23 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. (2018).

These payments result from federal requirements, particularly Medicaid requirements, to ensure payments to IHS and tribal health programs for services. In addition, under federal law, AI/ANs are required to apply for and use Medicaid and other coverage, when eligible, for care received outside of IHS -funded health programs . IHS is a payer of last resort, last in line even after Veterans Affairs health car e payments. Consequently , tribes need the state as a partner to help fulfill the special trust responsibility.

With 100 percent FMAP, the state incurs no expense to the General Fund - State for Medicaid payments for services provided to AI/AN Medicaid enrollees by tribal and IHS facilit ies. In February 2016, CMS issued a State Health Official (SHO) letter27 announcing a regulatory change of interpretation. The SHO letter explained that the state can now receive 100 percent FMAP for Medicaid payments to non- IHS, non -tribal providers for he alth care services to AI/AN Medicaid clients. This 100 percent FMAP is only permitted if t he services are covered by a written care coordination agreement between an IHS or tribal facility and a non- IHS, non -tribal provider, under which the IHS or tribal facility practitioner remains responsible for overseeing his or her AI/AN patient's care and the IHS or tribal facility retains control of the patient's medical record. To be eligible for 100 pe rcent FMAP, a service must meet the following requirements: 1. The IHS or t ribal facility practitioner provides a request for specific services (by electronic or other verifiable means) and relevant information about his or her AI/AN patient to the non- IHS/ non-tribal provider; 2. The non -IHS, non -tribal provider sends information about the care it provides to the AI/AN patient, including the res ults of any screening; diagnostic; or treatment procedures, to the IHS or t ribal facility practitioner; 3. The IHS or tribal f acility practitioner continues to assume responsibility for the patient's care by assessing the information and taking appropriate action, including, when necessary, furnishing , or requesting additional services; and 4. The IHS or tribal facility incor porates the patient's information in to the medical record through the Health Information Exchange or other agreed -upon means. According to CMS, the purpose of the new 100 percent FMAP policy is to help states, IHS, and tribes to improve delivery systems fo r AI/ANs by increasing access to care, strengthening continuity of care, and improving population health. In January 2017, CMS issued frequently asked questions28 on the SHO letter. In the FAQ, CMS explained that the rate paid for the service provided under the care coordination agreement by the non- IHS, non -tribal facility must be the standard rate applicable to the service as billed. CMS also explained that a tribe's health clinic can be automatically considered a Medicaid federally qualified health center (FQHC) if the tribe opts for that designation. As an FQHC, the tribal clinic may contract with non- IHS, non -tribal providers to provide services outside the clinic's four walls. 27 State Health Official Letter # 16-002, Federal Funding for Services \"Received Through\" an IHS/Tribal Facility and Furnished to Medicaid- Eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives , dated February 26, 2016. 28 Frequently -Asked Questions (FAQs) on Federal Funding for Services \"Received Th rough\" an IHS/Tribal Facility and Furnished to Medicaid- Eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (SHO #16 -002) dated January 18, 2017 . 13 While the savings achieved from the new 100 percent FMAP interpretation accru e to the state, the required care coordination activities incur administrative costs to the IHS or tribal facility. Moreover, the SHO letter explicitly states that the state may not require tribes or IHS facilities to enter into such care coordination agre ements or incur the administrative costs required to comply with the requirements for the new 100 percent FMAP. Hypothetical Comparison to Illustrate Shift in Source of Funds Without New 100 Percent FMAP: Tribal clinic refers AI/AN Medicaid -enrolled patient to non -tribal specialist. Specialist assesses patient and bills HCA for $100. If the patient is covered by a C lassic Medicaid program with 50 percent FMAP, the sources of funds for the $100 are: State general fund: $50. Federal government: $50. With New 100 Percent FMAP: Tribal clinic enters into care coordination agreement with non -tribal specialist. Tribal clinic refers AI/AN Medicaid -enrolled patient to non -tribal specialist. Specialist assesses patient and sends medical records to tribal clinic. Specialist bills HCA for $100. Even i f the patient is covered by a Classic Medicaid program with 50 percent FMAP, the new 100 percent FMAP would now apply, and the sources of funds for the $100 are: State general fund: $ \u2014. Federal government: $ 100. Compliance with the requirements for the new CMS policy for the new 100 percent FMAP results in a transfer of $50 in Medicaid costs from the state general fund to the federal government. Estimates for Potential Savings to State General Fund Using Washing ton State Medicaid data, HCA has prepared three projection scenarios \u2014 pessimistic, baseline, and optimistic \u2014 in Chart 2 of the amounts of new savings to the state general fund that may be achieved as a result of the new 100 percent FMAP. To achieve these savings to the state general fund, tribes and IHS facilities will need to: Enter into an estimated 300 care coordination agreements with non -tribal, non -IHS providers ; Develop processes and staffing to refer clients to non -tribal, non- IHS providers under these care coordination agreements; Develop processes and staffing to receive medical records from non -tribal, non- IHS providers and incorporate those records into the client medical records; and Ensure action is taken on the health information received fr om the non -tribal, non- IHS providers . 14 2019 -20 2017 HCA Medicaid claims applied to three penetration rate models. As explained above, the state may not require tribes or IHS facilities to engage in these activities that would generate savings to the state general fund \u2014 even as a condition for participating in the Medicaid program. More detailed information on the fiscal estima tes are provided in Appendix A. To encourage tribes and other providers to enter into these arrangements, HCA c ould provide technical assistance to increase understanding of the benefits to the state and to the patients from entering into care coordination agreements with IHS facilities and tribal facilities. The savings set forth in Chart 2, therefore, reflect two minimum investments out of the new savings to the state general fund to achieve the three scenarios shown: 1. The state appropriates sufficient funding (estimated at $366,000 per state fiscal year) begi nning in July 2019 for HCA to hire four regional tribal liaisons 29 to provide technical assistance to tribes, IHS facilities, and other providers throughout the state on the CMS requirements for the new 100 percent FMAP and monitoring for compliance with CM S requirements; and 2. The state provides a sufficient portion of the savings achieved from the new 100 percent FMAP to tribes and IHS facilities to cover their administrative costs for complying with the requirements for the new 100 percent FMAP (subject to federal appropriations). 29 See HCA decision package #37; during the tribal consultation with HCA on April 30, 2018, HCA and the tribes agreed for HCA to seek legislative approval for hiring four regional to State General Fund by Year Pessimistic Scenario Baseline Scenario Optimistic Scenario 15 More significantly, as CMS wrote in the SHO letter, the new 100 percent FMAP is intended to help states, IHS, and t ribes to improve delivery systems for AI/ANs by increasing access to care, strengthening continuity of care, and improving population health. With so many AI/AN health disparities, the need to cover the administrative costs of IHS facilities and tribes, and ranges of potential new savings to the state general fund between $455,095 and $1,820,381 in state fiscal year 2020 -2021 and between $2,785,534 and $16,626,635 in state fiscal year 2024 -2025, this is an opportune moment for the state focus on improving AI/AN health and health care, including creat ing a mechanism to capture the savings to the state general fund due to the new 100 percent FMAP . These savings could then be reinvested to increase access to care, strengthen continuity of care, and improve population health for AI/ANs throughout the state, and, in some cases, coordinating these efforts with tribes and urban Indian organizations and health programs in border states . To achieve these goals, the state should establish the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council, which will have the following roles: Serving as the principal advisory body to HCA and the De partment of Health on issues related to health and health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives ; Adopting a biennial Indian Health Advisory Plan, developed by the Reinvestment Committee of the Advisory Council comprised of Advisory Council members r epresenting tribes and urban Indian organizations; Addressing issues with tribal implications that are not able to be resolved at the agency level; and Provide oversight of the Indian Health Improvement Reinvestment Account. The Indian Health Advisory Plan will include the following: An assessment of Indian health and Indian health care in the state; Specific recommendations for programs, projects, or activities, along with recommended reinvestment account expenditure amounts and priorities for expenditure s, for the next two state fiscal bienniums; and A review of how programs, projects, or activities that have received investments from the reinvestment account have or have not achieved the objectives and why. In addition , the State Treasurer, in consultati on with the Office of Financial Management, should establish the Indian Health Improvement Reinvestment Account. Savings from the new 100 percent FMAP, less administrative costs agreed upon by the state and tribes and urban Indian organizations and health programs, would be appropriated and deposited into this reinvestment account. 16 Recommendations To improve Indian health care outcomes and begin to remedy long -standing health disparities, the Council makes the following recommendations: A. Establish the Gove rnor's Indian Health Advisory Council. The state should establish the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council, consisting of: Voting members representing the tribes, urban Indian organizations and health programs, the governor's office, and the majority and minority caucuses of the House of Representatives and the Senate; and Non -voting members representing the American Indian Health Commission for Washington State, the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, the IHS Portland Area Office and Service Units, and the state agencies involved in health care. The Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council will: Adopt a biennial Indian H ealth Improvement Advisory Plan, developed by the reinvestment committee; Address issues with tribal implications that are not able to be resolved at the agency level; and Provide oversight of the Indian H ealth Improvement Reinvestment Account. The Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan will include the following: An assessment of Indian health and Indian health care in the s tate; Specific recommendations for programs, projects, or activities, along with recommended reinvestment account expenditure amounts and priorities for expenditures, for the next two state fiscal bienniums; and A review of the successes and challenges of previously funded programs, projects, and activities. In addition, the state should establish the Reinvestment Committee of the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council, consisting of the members of the Advisory Council representing the tribes and urban Indian organizations and health programs. The Reinvestment Committee will prepare and amend the Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan, which will include recommendations for projects, programs, and activities and for amounts from the reinvestment account to improve the health and health care of American Indians and Alaska Natives . B. Establish the Indian Health Improvement Reinvestment Account for Appropriations of New State Savings while Maintaining Fiscal Neutrality. The state should establish the Indian H ealth Improvement Reinvestment Account and appropriate and deposit into the account all of the savings due to the new 100 percent FMAP , subject to federal appropriations. To maintain fiscal neutrality to the state general fund , the administrative costs agr eed upon by the state and the Reinvestment Committee of the Governor's Indian 17 Health Advisory Council will be deducted from s uch appropriations and retained in the state general fund to cover such administrative costs. With input from the Reinvestment Comm ittee, t he state will develop a s ystem to track and report on new state savings achieved due to the new 100 percent FMAP, administrative costs to support the achievement of the new state savings due to the new 100 percent FMAP, and expenditures from the Re investment Account for the projects and purposes determined by the Reinvestment Committee . The funds in the Reinvestment Account may only be spent on costs for projects, programs, and activities included in the Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan . C. Appropriate Proposed Budget Amount for HCA Staff . The state should appropriate sufficient funding for five FTE HCA staff (approximately $500,000 in salaries and benefits as included in HCA decision package #37 and the Governor's 2019 -2021 proposed budget) to partner with the Indian Health Service and tribal governments to meet federal requirements that allow the state to receive the 100 percent FMAP on services which are currently provided to AI/AN Medicaid enrollees at standard FMAP rates . D. Partner With Tr ibes to Cover Expenses for the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council to Complete the First Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan . The state and tribes should work together to complete the first Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan, which will incl ude all of the analyses described in section 213(mmm) of ES SB 6032 , including covering meeting expenses for the Governor's Indian Health Advisory Council to adopt the first Indian Health Improvement Advisory Plan. 18 Appendix A: Fiscal Estimates Table 1: Providers (by Tax Identification Number), Contracts (Referrals Between IHS or Tribal Facilities and Non -IHS, Non -Tribal Providers), and State General Fund Amounts by Region # of TINs # of Contracts 2017 GF-S Amounts Region: Central West (King, Kitsap, Jefferson, GF-S $200,000+ 5 GF-S 1,085,279 Total 70 347 $ 4,687,616 Region: East (Spokane, Greater Columbia, and North Central regions) GF-S $200,000+ 9 25 $ 3,663,791 GF-S $50,000-$200,000 1,997,521 GF-S $10,000-$50,000 $ 259,439 Total 45 117 $ 5,920,752 Region: North Sound (North Sound region) GF-S $200,000+ 4 1,693,558 GF-S $50,000-$200,000 1,364,530 GF-S $10,000-$50,000 $ 1,222,107 Total 74 335 $ 4,280,194 Region: Southwest (Pierce, Great Rivers, and Thurston-Mason regions) GF-S $200,000+ 5 34 1,835,161 GF-S $10,000-$50,000 85 $ 1,810,347 Total 111 3,862,772 Statewide GF-S Total GF-S $200,000+ GF-S $ 4,377,172 Total 300 1286 $ 18,751,334 19 Table 2: Estimated Savings to State General Fund \u2014 Optimistic Scenario 20 Table 3: Estimated Savings to State General Fund \u2014 Baseline Scenario 21 Table 4: Estimated Savings to State General Fund \u2014 Pessimistic Scenario 22 Appendix B: Proposed Legislation Washington Indian Health Improvement Act AN ACT Relating to establishing the governor's Indian health advisory council and the Indian health improvement reinvestment account; reenacting and amending RCW 43.84.092; and adding a new chapter to Title 43 RCW. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON: NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that: (a) As set forth in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1602, it is the policy of the nation, in fulfillment of its special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to American Indians and Alaska Natives, to: (i) Ensure the highest possible health status for American Indians and Alaska Natives and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy; (ii) Raise the health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives to at least the levels set forth in the goals contained within the Healthy People 2020 initiative or successor objectives; and (iii) Ensure tribal self-determination and maximum participation by American Indians and Alaska Natives in the direction of health care services so as to render the persons administering such services and the services themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of tribes and American Indian and Alaska Native communities; (b) According to the northwest tribal epidemiology center and the department of health, American Indians and Alaska Natives in the state experience some of the greatest health disparities compared to other groups, including excessively high rates of: (i) Premature mortality due to suicide, overdose, unintentional injury, and various chronic diseases; and (ii) Asthma, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, pre-diabetes, obesity, dental caries, poor mental health, youth 23 depressive feelings, cigarette smoking and vaping, and cannabis use; (c) These health disparities are a direct result of both historical trauma, leading to adverse childhood experiences across multiple generations, and inadequate levels of federal funding to the Indian health service; (d) Under a 2016 update in payment policy from the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the state has the opportunity to shift more of the cost of care for American Indian and Alaska Native medicaid enrollees from the state general fund to the federal government if all of the federal requirements are met; (e) Because the federal requirements to achieve this cost shift and obtain the new federal funds place significant administrative burdens on Indian health service and tribal health facilities, the state has no way to shift these costs of care to the federal government unless the state provides incentives for tribes to take on these administrative burdens; and (f) The federal government's intent for this update in payment policy is to help states, the Indian health service, and tribes to improve delivery systems for American Indians and Alaska Natives by increasing access to care, strengthening continuity of care, and improving population health. (2) The legislature, therefore, intends to: (a) Establish that it is the policy of this state and the intent of this chapter, in fulfillment of the state's unique relationships and shared respect between sovereign governments, to: (i) Recognize the United States' special trust responsibility to provide quality health care and allied health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, including those individuals who are residents of this state; and (ii) Implement the national policies of Indian self- determination and achieving the h ighest possible health status for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the state; and 24 (b) Establish the governor's Indian health advisory council to: (i) Adopt a biennial Indian health improvement advisory plan, developed by the reinvestment committee; (ii) Address issues with tribal implications that are not able to be resolved at the agency level; and (iii) Provide oversight of the Indian health improvement reinvestment account; (c) Adopt a biennial Indian health improvement advisory plan; (d) Establish the Indian health improvement reinvestment account in order to provide incentives for tribes to assume the administrative burdens created by the federal requirements for the state to shift health care costs to the federal government; (e) Appropriate and deposit into the account all of the new state savings, subject to federal appropriations and less agreed upon administrative costs to maintain fiscal neutrality to the state general fund; and (f) Require the funds in the Indian health improvement reinvestment account to be spent only on costs for projects, programs, or activities identified in the Indian health improvement advisory plan.
