Could a few coins here or a few dollars there promote sustained weight loss? A new study suggests a monitory incentive could be the ticket to getting in the gym (and ultimately losing weight). Is This the Adele Weight Loss Diet? No. This is not the Adele weight loss diet. In fact, there is no Adele weight loss program. And furthermore, 'diets' set you up for failure. Just think about it. Diets are a billion-dollar industry primarily because they don't work. Even when they do work initially, the vast majority of people who lose weight dieting put the weight back on. A meta-analysis of 29 long-term weight loss studies revealed that within two years, more than half of those who had lost weight regained it all. [Scarier is that the analysis also found that after five years, this percentage rose to a staggering 80%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764193/) [Call 707.888.4191 to Schedule a Consultation](tel:17078884191) A Lifestyle Change is the Key to Losing Weight and Keeping It Off It's not the diet that will keep the weight off. It's finding a 'sustainable healthy lifestyle change,' as Monique Tello, MD, MPH explained in her 2018 article, ['Which diet is best for long-term weight loss?' published on Harvard Health Publishing.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weight-loss-for-life-the-dietfits-study-2018040913595) This is a strategy that's been supported by doctors, weight loss professionals, and weight loss success stories for decades. The New York Times Personal Health columnist, Jane E. Brody, is a walking (or shall we say writing) example. In her personal essay, ['Jane Brody's Personal Secrets to Lasting Weight Loss,'](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/well/jane-brodys-personal-secrets-to-lasting-weight-loss.html) she admits to having been a 40-pound overweight yo-yo dieter when she was hired by The New York Times. She describes how she changed her lifestyle and lost the weight: I finally regained control when I stopped dieting. I decided that if I was going to be fat, at least I could be healthy. I made a plan to eat three nutritious, satisfying meals every day with one small snack, which helped me overcome the temptation to binge in response to deprivation. Incentives Can Encourage Lifestyle Changes In December of 2021, Nature published a new megastudy study involving 61,293 American gym members, 30 prominent scientists working at 15 universities, and more than 50 different motivational programs. [The results show that offering just a 9 cent financial reward for something as simple as showing up to the gym after missing a planned workout increased gym visits by 16%!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04128-4) The effectiveness of incentives is relatively universal. For example, teaching individuals about the reward of compound interest can help them save for retirement. That being said, effective incentives don't have to be based on money. The key to finding a good weight loss incentive is identifying something that motivates the individual trying to lose weight. 53 Good Weight Loss Incentives that Don't Involve Food Each individual is unique, so too are their motivations. It may be that a weight loss patient could benefit from using some (or all) of the following ideas. - Get a Message - Take a Nap (And don't feel bad about it.) - Savor a Bubble Bath - Document Your Progress with a Selfie - Treat Yourself to a New, Fragrant Candle - Try a New Workout Class - Invest in a Fitness Tracker - Share Your Success with Family and Friends (Or post it on Social Media and watch the likes roll in.) - Buy Tickets to Concert Featuring Your Favorite Artist - Attend a Sporting Event - Sign Up for a 5K Supporting a Charity You Care About - Schedule a Professional Photo Shoot to Show Off Your Curves - Pick up a Bouquet of Fresh Flowers - Take Time to Read a New Book - Get an Adult Coloring Book (Or a kids one because they're pretty cool too.) - Buy Yourself a Special Piece of Jewelry that Reminds You of Your Commitment to Your Health - Get a Manicure - Sport Some New Sunglasses - Add a New Piece of Equipment to Your Home Gym (This can be a great way to mix things up and keep things fresh.) - Start a Daily 'Tip' Jar (more on this below) - Sleep In - Take the Day Off and DO NOTHING (Or do what you want. It's your day!) - Watch a Movie - Sample Some New Makeup - Do a Hobby You've Been Missing - Buy New Headphones for Your Workouts - Listen to a New Podcast - Host a Game Night - Play Tourist in Your City - Get Involved in the Kids' Activities (No one said you need to sit on the sidelines.) - Get a New Kitchen Gadget - Schedule a Walking Date with a Friend - Explore a New hiking Trail - Get a New Set of Matching Workout Gear - Go Dancing (Or have a dance party at home. Nothing says you can't dance like no one's watching \u2014 when no one is watching.) - Pour a Cup of Tea - Call a Friend to Catch Up - Treat Your Feet to New Shoes - Get a New Water Bottle - Hire a House Cleaner - Purchase Personal Training Sessions - Paint - Plant a Garden - Go for a Bike rIDE - Subscribe to a Healthy Meal Service - Take a Cooking Class - Plan a Dream Vacation (And then take it when you've achieved your goal!) - Get a Fun Lunch Box - Go to a Comedy Show - Buy a Standing Desk - Go to Bed Early - Get a Facial - Treat Yourself to New Bed Linens How to Start a Daily 'Tip' Jar Sometimes little rewards that lead to a bigger payoff can offer more motivation, which is what a daily 'tip' jar can do for you. The key is to set a realistic daily goal that supports your overall health and wellness. These are a few suggestions: - Choosing fruit when you're craving sweets - Workout out for 30 minutes - Drinking 16 ounces of water before every meal - Packing your lunch - Making dinner at home Each day you achieve this goal, you place a small 'tip' for yourself in your tip jar. The tip doesn't have to be huge. Even a dollar a day could be enough. At the end of each month, you then use your 'tip' to treat yourself. Or you could keep on saving it towards a bigger reward in the future. It's all up to you! 4 Lifestyle & Environmental Changes to Promote Long-Term Weight Loss As Albert Einstein said, \"Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\" Making lifestyle and environmental changes not only helps jumpstart weight loss, it helps sustain it. The following strategies have been utilized with success by individuals who have achieved long-term weight loss success. 1. Keep Fruits and Veggies Accessible and Visible In a 2020 study published in the Wiley Online Library, researchers found that the easier it was for individuals to see and access nourishing fruits and vegetables, the more likely they were to eat them. Frequently we hear about placing a bowl of apples or grapes on your counter. But for many, leaving food out isn't always a great option. (Hello fruit flies!) Instead, consider placing those items front and center in your refrigerator. And make them as easy to grab and go as possible. One great way to do so is to prep servings in their own reusable Tupperware containers. Heading to a meeting? Grab a container of carrots for the road. Is it time to pick the kids up from school? Grapes can be a great pick-me-up on your drive. 2. Keep a Food Diary Research has found that simply recording what you eat can help you lose weight. [In a study of nearly 1,700 participants, those who kept a daily journal lost twice as much weight as those who didn't track their consumption. ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18617080/) One of the easiest ways to maintain a food journal is with an app. The two most popular food journal apps are [LoseIt!](https://www.loseit.com/) and [Noom](https://www.noom.com/). 3. Weigh Yourself Daily & Record It In a two-year study conducted at Cornell University, researchers found that those who tracked their weight daily were more effective at losing weight and keeping it off. [The study, published in the Journal of Obesity, didn't require participants to lose weight in a prescribed way.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2015/763680/) Rather, participants were asked to lose 1% of their body weight and maintain that weight loss for 10 days before attempting to lose another 1%. And of course, they were asked to weigh and record daily. 4. Move Daily Popular wisdom is that you can't outrun a bad diet. And for the most part, popular wisdom is right. It takes a lot of miles to counteract a burger and fries \u2014 let alone lose weight too. But while you aren't likely to achieve a healthy weight with exercise alone, moving daily can help you shed those excess pounds and keep them off. How Could a Weight Loss Clinic Near Me Help?
