A virus is an ultramicroscopic infectious organism that, having no independent metabolic activity, can replicate only within a cell of another host organism. A virus consists of a core of nucleic acid, either RNA or DNA, surrounded by a coating of antigenic protein and sometimes a lipid layer surrounds it as well. The viral genome provides the genetic code for replication, and the host cell provides the necessary energy and raw materials. To fight viruses, we use vaccines. While some may infect a broad range, other viruses can only infect certain kinds of cells. Vaccines are made of inactive, dead or weakened virus cells or protein antigens that can no longer infect Today, vaccines are very common when needing to treat a disease. A vaccine is a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or more several diseases. A vaccine is acted as an antigen without inducing the disease. The most known vaccines are the DTaP vaccine, polio vaccine, MMR vaccine, and the influenza vaccine. Thesis: Immunizations are one of the most important medical advances in history. They have severely reduced the effects of dozens of viral infections and everyone should consider getting immunized. Through the understanding of infectious diseases, researchers have been able to create several types of vaccines to help prevent a variety of life-threatening illnesses. Scientists develop immunizations using different techniques to treat diseases. These types include: live, killed, toxoids, subunit, and conjugate vaccines. Vaccinations that are the live type use a specific process which when administered will expose the patient to the actual disease, but in a much a) Phage therapy involves the use of bacteriophages to treat specific pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriophages infect or kill pathogenic bacteria upon encounter with them. In 1915, Frederick Twort discovered the viruses of bacteria (Abedon, 2011). The bacteriophage era began when Felix d'H\u00e9relle published a seminal publication that demonstrated \"un bact\u00e9riophage obligatoire\" (Abedon, 2011) Soon after, microbiologists began to include the phages idea into their ideas. Novel therapies are needed to kill pathogenic bacteria. Phage therapy offers an alternative to the antibiotic treatment of bacteria. Even though bacteria can gradually resist phage, the resistance will not be as pronounced as the resistance to bacteria. Phage therapy is specific A vaccine is a weak or inactive form of a pathogen (something that causes disease). When the vaccine is injected into a person, it stimulates the production of antibodies to destroy the vaccine. Certain cells remember how to produce the A vaccine is a preparation of dead or weakened pathogens that reintroduced into the body to stimulate an immune response. Vaccines are administered by medical professionals, usually as an injection but sometimes as a nasal spray or oral medicine. There are many different types of vaccines which are the following live-virus vaccines, killed-virus vaccines, Toxoids, and other types. Whilst the study of Phage therapy was temporarily abandoned by the US and some European nations (due to the discovery of antibiotics) in Russia, Phage therapy is mainly used to fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria. They are also used for identifying bacteria ( a process known as Phage typing). It can also be used to prolong the freshness of food, as bacteria causes food to spoil faster. They can also be used as vehicles for vaccine delivery carrying vaccine antigens and reacting with their specific bacteria. This means that scientists are also trying to use Phages to combat cancerous diseases, modifying the biosynthetic machinery so that they target the mutated cancer Although I understand the science behind why bacteriophage is an ideal for treatment especially with the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria, but my concerns are the pro and cons of this type of therapy. Is there a possibility of further infection or even worse will that infection cause a fatal result. According to an article in U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, that clinical trials show promising results, but that the treatments are not completely effective. (Nilsson, 2014) This is due to studies being done with few phages and with limited experimental groups and therapy has limitations. This therapy can only be effective with large amount of groups so that comparisons can be made between he different Questions for 1. What is a vaccine? A vaccine is a weakened or dead germ that is injected into the body to prevent a disease. The small amount that is injected allows the immune system to fight back and develops memory cells so it is ready to fight the actual disease. There are several advantages to phage therapy with target specificity being one of the main ones. Most phages will only lyse bacteria of a particular species or a specific strain meaning that the human microbiota should not be affected. In contrast, antibiotics are less specific and so treatment usually disrupts this flora, allowing opportunistic bacteria to thrive. This specificity is also a limitation as the bacteria causing the infection needs to be determined otherwise the treatment is likely to be useless. Such problems can however be addressed with the use of phage combinations like 'cocktails' used in the above study. The rise of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria have been appearing across the globe resulting in the Center for Disease control to classify it as an urgent threat. The cause of the multidrug resistance has related to the overuse of antibiotics. There are a limited number of antibiotics on the market 1. There are many differences between bacteriophages and bacterium. Bacteriophages (also known as phages) are viruses that are obligate intracellular parasites, therefore, need a specific host in order to for this virion to leave its dormant state. The bacterium serves as the host in which the virus inhabits, allowing for it to grow and replicate. According to the case study by Kari Mergenhagen, the virus also obtains and enormous size compared to the bacterium. It has special structures, such as, a protein coat (capsid) which is a nucleic acid genome. On the other hand, bacterium is not simply defined as being a host for phages. Bacterium is a microorganism which is unicellular, has cell walls, lacks of organelles and nucleus, and can reproduce The Australian Government reserves the right to cease family benefit payments to parents who do not vaccinate their children. Some parents refuse to vaccinate their children. Is that the right thing to do? Or are parent's neglecting the welfare of their children, and possibly, the general population? Before answering this Vaccination is the organization of antigenic material (an immunization) to fortify an individual 's resistant framework to create versatile safety to a pathogen. Over several years' vaccination has helped us to eradicate several diseases and control many crucial diseases. This research paper generally deals with history of vaccine, their development and mechanism of vaccine, types of vaccine and why it is necessary. "}
