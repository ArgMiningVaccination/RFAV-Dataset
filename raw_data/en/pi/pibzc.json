What is lymphoma? Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the immune system. It specifically affects white [blood cells](/understanding-blood-cancer/blood-cells/) called lymphocytes, which are an important part of your [immune system](/understanding-blood-cancer/immune-lymphatic-systems/). Lymphoma is also called a cancer of the [lymphatic system](/understanding-blood-cancer/immune-lymphatic-systems/), or lymphatic cancer. In lymphoma, something goes wrong with the development of your lymphocytes. The lymphocytes don't work properly and can multiply out of control. There are two main types of lymphoma - [Hodgkin lymphoma](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/hodgkin-lymphoma/) and [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/). Both types affect your lymphocytes. Over 14,000 people are diagnosed with lymphoma each year in the UK, making it the most common blood cancer. Lymphoma causes In most cases we don't know what causes lymphoma, but there are some things which can make the risk of developing the disease slightly higher: - age - sex - family history - lowered immunity - infections. Lymphoma symptoms A common [lymphoma symptom](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/lymphoma-symptoms-signs/) is lumps. These are swollen lymph nodes (glands). You may get painless swellings in your neck, collarbone, armpit, groin or other parts of your body. Some swollen lymph nodes can press on organs and cause pain in your chest, coughing, breathlessness, or pain in your stomach area. Other lymphoma symptoms include: - fever (high temperature) - weight loss that is unexplained - night sweats that soak your clothes and bedding. We have more detailed information about [lymphoma symptoms](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/lymphoma-symptoms-signs/) in general, and for specific types of lymphoma - see Lymphoma types below. Lymphoma types There are different types of lymphoma depending on how the cells are affected and how the lymphoma behaves. We have more detailed information on different types of lymphoma: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that [Tests for lymphoma](/understanding-blood-cancer/tests-diagnosis/) can help your doctor diagnose you. These include blood tests, lymph node biopsies, scans, and general health and infection screening.

It gives you clear and simple information, practical tips and advice from others with blood cancer, to help during the first few weeks and months after diagnosis. Lymphoma treatment [Lymphoma treatments](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/treatments-for-lymphoma/) can vary depending on the type of lymphoma you have, how far it has spread (its stage) and whether you have symptoms. Lymphoma treatments include: - chemotherapy - radiotherapy - targeted therapies. If you have a slow-growing lymphoma, you may not need treatment straight away, and some people never need it. This is called being on [watch and wait](/understanding-blood-cancer/watch-wait/). Lymphoma treatments can have [side effects](/understanding-blood-cancer/lymphoma/side-effects-of-lymphoma-treatment/). Some people experience some of these effects as a result of the lymphoma itself, even if they aren't having treatment.

Lymphoma prognosis Some people will want to know how lymphoma will affect their future - this is known as your prognosis. Your prognosis is individual to you and depends the type of lymphoma you have, what treatments you can have, and other things like your general fitness. People often want to know about survival rates for lymphoma. Survival rates are statistics that show how many people in a large group survive lymphoma for a certain period of time. These are only averages that can't tell you what will happen to you personally so many people find them unhelpful to focus on. Ask [your medical team](/understanding-blood-cancer/treatment/blood-cancer-treatment-planning/) about your prognosis if you want to know, because everyone is different. Your medical team know you and your individual situation. Remember, your prognosis can also change over time, for example if you respond well to lymphoma treatment. Read our general information about [things that might affect your prognosis](/understanding-blood-cancer/prognosis/). You might find it difficult understanding or thinking about prognosis. Our [Support Service](/support-for-you/talk-blood-cancer/) is here to talk you through it, offer support, or simply listen.
