There are four basic types of aid. Grants: Federal, state and institutional grants do not require repayment. Loans: Must be repaid, generally beginning six months after a student graduates or leaves school. Loans require repayment with interest charges of approximately 8 percent (depending on the program) accruing during the repayment period. Work-Study: Students can be employed either on or off campus, with the primary focus being that students enhance their field of study by working part-time in a career-related position. Scholarships and Tuition Waivers: Awards are based on financial need, academic achievement and in some cases the quality of the personal essay that is submitted as part of the scholarship application process. What is Financial Need? For most aid programs, financial need is defined as the difference between what it costs to attend school and what the student can afford to pay. The amount a student should be able to pay is determined by a standard, federally mandated need-analysis method. The method establishes whether a student is financially independent (unmarried students under the age of 24 years may be considered dependent and in that case must provide parent information) or financially dependent on his or her parents and takes into account past earnings and benefits, a percentage of net assets and all other sources of support. There is no income standard or other simple method of determining whether a student will qualify for need-based financial aid. Any student who thinks he or she needs help should apply.If a student has additional medical, transportation, child-care, or other unusual expenses not covered by the living allowance, the student may, by submitting a revision request with documentation (physician's statement, child-care, or baby-sitter bills, etc.), ask the Office of Student Financial Aid to consider the additional costs in his or her budget. Eligibility for Financial Aid To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen Be admitted to the university in an approved program and meet minimum enrollment requirements (most distance learning, correspond-ence and nonmatriculated students are not eligible for financial aid) Not be in default on a previous student loan or owe a repayment on a grant or loan for which the student was not eligible Be registered with the Selective Service (if required) Be making satisfactory academic progress (The definition of satisfactory progress differs with different kinds of aid. In general, undergraduate students are required to register for and complete 12 credits per quarter; graduate students, 10 credits per quarter. Check with the financial aid staff for detailed information.) Provide financial information (including parents' information, where required) Be free of any federal or state drug- related convictions while you were receiving federal student aidEligible students are considered for funding based on three things: need, class level and state residency status. Need determines priority for those programs within the class level. Students with the fewest resources are given first priority for all aid funds. Application and Important Dates The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the basic application for most types of financial aid. Students must complete and submit their FAFSA information directly to the federal processor online. Students must apply for a personal identification number (PIN) in order to complete the online FAFSA. PINs can be obtained by registering through www. pin.ed.gov. To access FAFSA on the Web, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov . Applications are also available from the Office of Enrollment Services. Students should complete their FAFSA for the upcoming year (defined as summer through spring quarters) beginning in mid-December or early January. A student who wishes to apply for financial aid to support study during summer quarter must submit a separate application. Priority dates For priority consideration, the FAFSA must be dated as received by the federal application processor by Feb. 28 of each year. Students are encouraged to mail the FAFSA no sooner than Jan. 1 and no later than Feb. 15 before the upcoming academic year. Students who submit their FAFSAs after the priority date, fifth-year students and part-time students may be eligible to borrow funds through the Federal Stafford Loan or the Federal PLUS/Federal Supplemental Loan programs. Undergraduates may qualify for a Federal Pell Grant. Because the priority date falls before the income tax deadline, students and parents can use estimated income figures if their tax information is not prepared. Tax and asset Financial Aid9 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma documents may be requested at a later date to verify information provided on the initial application. Students who apply for financial aid should remember to keep copies of financial documents used in completing the FAFSA, should stay in touch with the financial aid counselor and should notify the Office of Enrollment Services of any change in address. Consortium Agreements UW Tacoma students will occasionally need to enroll at a community college to complete admission deficiencies. The credits at the community college may be counted toward the student's total quarter enrollment credits using a financial aid consortium agreement. Both UW Tacoma and the community college must approve consortium agreements. If approved, consortium agreements enable the student to receive financial aid based on the total credits being taken at both institutions. Agreements must be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid no later than three weeks prior to the start of the quarter.Scholarships Consideration for need-based scholarships is given based on information received on the FAFSA (on-time applicants only). Scholarship lists are available through the Office of Student Financial Aid and at websites listed later in this section. UW Tacoma offers several scholarships available to fund study only at UW Tacoma. For information on scholarship opportunities, contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at 253-692-4400 or check online at www.tacoma. washington.edu/finaid .

This information includes data for use in claiming educational tax credits and deductions that you have paid for tuition and fees. In addition, the UW provides information to help you determine if your scholarships, fellowships, grants or tuition reductions are taxable. The UW cannot provide individual tax advice. If you have questions, you should consult your tax adviser about your specific circumstances. Scholarships, fellowships, grants and tuition reductions are not considered taxable income if they are used solely for qualified educational expenses. Any amount used for personal or non-qualified expenses are subject to tax. For more details refer to the IRS Publication 970: Scholarships and Fellowships. Washington State's Guaranteed Education Tuition (GET) program is a 529-qualified tuition program according to IRS regulations. This program allows individuals to prepay for students' college educational expenses. Funds from the GET program are used to reduce qualified educational expenses. The amounts used to pay these expenses are not taxable or reported to the IRS on the 1098T forms that the UW provides students for filing their tax returns. Go to f2.washington.edu/fm/sfs/tax to find links to the following topics: Education tax credits and tax deduc - tions (IRS Form 1098T) Print your 1098T information Nonresident alien student tax (IRS Form 1042S) Employees' tuition exemption tax with - holding Canadian tax information For questions, please email taxquest@u. washington.edu or call 206-221-2609 for assistance. Financial Aid10 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Tuition and Fees The cost of a student's education at the university varies with individual circumstances. The amount charged for resident undergraduate tuition and fees is set by the state and is indexed to the cost of instruction. Tuition and fees for non- residents and graduate students are set by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Because inflation increases costs, tuition rates generally increase each year. Since university costs are supported by the state, the rates charged to students who are not residents of Washington state are higher than the rates for residents. Please refer to the Registration, Academic and University Policies sections for information regarding residency classification. Tuition charges are based on the student's classification (undergraduate or graduate) rather than on course level. See chart on next page for tuition rates. Rates are subject to change without notice. Tuition and Fee Payment Students incur an obligation to pay tuition and fees in U.S. dollars when they register. Students receive email notification once tuition charges are available on MyUW . No matter which payment option the student chooses, payment in full of tuition is due by 5 p.m. on the third Friday of the quarter. Nonpayment of tuition and fees by the due date results in a charge of $50 for balances of $50 to $250 and $120 for balances in excess of $250. Students with an overdue balance will not be allowed to register for the next quarter. Options for Tuition Payment Web check Tuition and related charges may be paid online by web check from a checking or savings account. This service is accessible from the Tuition Charge Statement on MyUW . A bank routing number, account number and UW student ID number are required to complete the transaction. Payments post immediately and there is no fee for this service.Check or money order (in-person) Payment may be made by personal check or money order to the UW Tacoma Cashier or mailed to the UW Tacoma Cashier's Office, Campus Box 358433, 1900 Commerce Street, Tacoma, WA 98402. Payment may also be placed in the drop box located down the hallway to the right of the Cashier's Office. Checks should be payable to \"UWT\" and include either the student's ID number or Social Security number in the memo field. Credit card Credit card payments may be made online only through MyUW . Sign in at MyUW and select the \"Credit Card Payment\" option. Credit cards cannot be used to pay tuition in person at the Cashier's Office. There is a significant convenience charge assessed when using this option. Tuition installment plan The tuition payment plan allows students to pay their quarterly tuition in three installments. There is a $10 service fee for participating that is due with the first payment. Students must enroll for this option each quarter with the UW Tacoma Cashier during the first week of the quarter. One third of the tuition plus the $10 service charge is due by the first Friday of the quarter. The remaining balance of tuition is due in two equal payments on the third and fifth Fridays of the quarter. To qualify for the installment plan all payments must be made on time. The second and third payments are subject to late fees as shown on page 11. Payments must be made by check or money order to the UW Tacoma Cashier in person on through the drop box outside the Cashier's Office. Specifying Payments When the payment received is not in conformance with the tuition and fee billing, specific instructions on how the payment is to be applied must accompany the payment. In the absence of instructions, the university makes a reasoned interpretation of the student's intent and accounts for the funds accordingly. The student number or Social Security number must be specified on all payments. Tuition Forfeiture When students drop or withdraw from courses after the first week of the quarter and the drop results in lower tuition, the university reserves the right to collect one- half the tuition through the 30th calendar day of the quarter for the dropped course or courses and full tuition after the 30th calendar day of the quarter. In some circumstances students may petition the registrar to have the tuition forfeiture waived. Details are available in the Office of the Registrar (see Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees, this page). Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees If a student feels that he or she has been charged a tuition forfeiture or registration fee in error or wishes to contest a forfeiture or fee, he or she may complete a request to waive tuition forfeiture or registration fees form. Failure to check your tuition balance on MyUW does not nullify a student's responsibility for payment by the tuition due date and is not an acceptable justification for a waiver. Please refer to the form for appropriate guidelines for granting these requests. Petitions must be received by the UW Tacoma registrar no later than the last day of instruction. Tuition and Fee Refund When a fee payment is made by check, a waiting period is required before a refund can be authorized. An application for refund may be refused unless it is made during the quarter in which the fees apply. A student who withdraws for disciplinary reasons forfeits all rights to refund or cancellation of any portion of his or her fees.

There is no charge prior to or during the first week of classes. Duplicate diploma with paper cover ............................................. $ 10 Replacement of Student ID Card ........ $ 10 Transcript (Official) ............................... $ 9 Special Course and Laboratory Fees Some courses have extraordinary expenses associated with them and, in such cases, the university may charge additional fees in amounts that approximate the added instructional or laboratory costs.Technology Fee This fee is to recover, in whole or in part, the costs of providing and maintaining services to students that include, but are not limited to, the following: access to the Internet, email, computer and multimedia workstations and laboratories, computer software and dial-up telephone services. Part-time students (those paying less than full-time tuition) are charged on a prorated basis. The fee is included on the quarterly tuition billing. Financial Obligations The Office of Student Fiscal Services is authorized to place an administrative hold on the records of any student who fails to pay amounts due to the university. Until this hold is cleared, the university does not release the student's record or any information based on the record, does not prepare transcripts or certified statements, and denies registration as well as graduation from the university. Tuition and fees (including parking and library fines) not paid by the end of the academic quarter are subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof (12 percent APR), beginning the month following the end of the quarter. An administrative hold also may occur when a student has not complied with university rules, followed university procedures or satisfied student obligations. The hold may be placed on the student's record by the authorized university office responsible for enforcement of the rule, procedure or obligation involved. The student is not permitted to register for any subsequent quarter or to obtain a transcript of his or her record or a certified statement except on the written release of the office that placed the hold. Tuition Exemption Eligible university and state of Washington employees may enroll for and receive a tuition exemption for up to six credits each quarter, provided they enroll on a space- available basis. Eligible students are allowed to enroll for more than six credits and will be charged tuition accordingly for the additional credits. All students participating in the tuition-exemption program will be assessed a quarterly $30 registration fee and must pay other applicable fees, including the technology fee. A participating student may not register for any course, including the credits beyond six that the student will be paying for, prior to the student's assigned space-available registration day, or the exemption will be canceled. Matriculated students desiring a higher registration priority to facilitate course enrollment may choose to cancel their exemption for the quarter, register early and pay regular tuition rates. Space availability applies to degree programs as well as courses, and fully enrolled programs may not have space to accommodate students using the tuition exemption. Eligible students must hold one of the following statuses on the day the exemption form is approved, and must be in that status on the first day of the quarter for which the exemption was granted. To be eligible a student must be: A University of Washington employee: permanent classified or contract classified staff who are employed half-time or more with six months or more of continuous service prior to the first day of the quarter and faculty/ professional staff employed half-time or more on the first day of class. A non-University of Washington permanent classified or contract State of Washington employee employed half- time or more. A permanent classified or exempt paraprofessional employee of a technical college employed half-time or more. A non-academic employee or member of the faculty or instructional staff employed half-time or more at a state institution of higher education other than the University of Washington. A note of caution: A UW employee pursuing a graduate program or graduate-level course work claims the amount of the quarterly exemption as income on the federal income tax return unless his or her supervisor has certified that the program or course work is job related. If it is determined that the course is not job related, the value of the exemption will be considered income and subject to withholding. Qualifying Courses Courses that involve intensive one-on-one interaction between faculty member and student (such as independent study, research and some fieldwork courses) do not qualify under the definition of \"space available.\" Tuition-exempt students may be required to pay full tuition to enroll in these courses. See the quarterly Registration Guide for details. All 600- and 700-level courses are excluded from the tuition exemption program. Tuition and Fees13 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Admission Status Individuals who wish to participate in the tuition exemption program must apply for admission to the University of Washington Tacoma. Applicants are subject to the same priority application dates as other new students. Individuals wishing to apply as matriculated students or as graduate nonmatriculated students to a UW Tacoma academic program, should contact the specific program office for details regarding the application process and space availability in the program. New nonmatriculated students should submit applications for admission to the Office of Admissions Processing. Because tuition exempt paperwork must be received no later than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter, new applicants are encouraged to submit their tuition exemption paperwork regardless of their pending application status. Program participants who are former UW Tacoma students returning in the same classification or as nonmatriculated students should submit their application for admission to the Office of Admissions Processing. Tuition and FeesRegistration and fees The Office of the Registrar accepts tuition exempt paperwork for the next quarter beginning the Monday after the 10th day of the current quarter. Paperwork must be submitted each quarter and must be received no later than two weeks prior to the first day of the quarter in which attendance is planned. UW Tacoma strictly adheres to this deadline. Paperwork must be complete, including required signatures, or it will be returned. Paperwork that has been returned must be completed by the same deadline noted above. Actual registration for courses begins through MyUW on or after the appropriate eligibility dates. Registration dates are posted on the Registration Guide website at www.tacoma. washington.edu/register . Under the tuition exemption program, tuition-exempt students must pay the quarterly technology fee. They will be billed this fee, and any other applicable fees, plus the $30 tuition exemption registration fee once they have registered for a course. UW faculty/staff ID cards may be used for library services. Participating state of Washington employees may obtain student ID cards for library services from the Office of Enrollment Services. More information and the quarterly required tuition exemption form are available on our website or in the Office of Enrollment Services.14 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Registration Registration Eligibility Continuing University of Washington Tacoma students who remain in good scholastic standing are guaranteed the opportunity to register each quarter at UW Tacoma as long as they maintain continuous enrollment (excluding summer quarter) or satisfy the guidelines of the quarter-off policy. Continuation must be in the same classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) and at the same campus. After a student has earned a baccalaureate degree, he or she must apply for readmission as a postbaccalaureate, nonmatriculated or graduate student before being allowed to register. Newly admitted students and students readmitted to the same or a new classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) or admitted to a different university campus are eligible to register during a specified time period. See Registration Periods on page 15. Exceptions to the guarantee of registration eligibility include students under disciplinary action, students with a financial hold on their records and students failing to meet conditions of admission or not meeting program or university satisfactory progress policies. Additionally, continuing students who withdraw during the first week of two consecutive quarters (summer quarter not included) will not be eligible to register as continuing students for the third quarter and must reapply as former students returning to the university. If an undergraduate does not enroll for two or more quarters (not including summer quarter), he or she must file a returning student application for readmission with the Office of Enrollment Services. Quarter-Off Policy Undergraduate students who have completed a quarter at the University of Washington Tacoma, may take the following quarter off and remain eligible to register during Registration Period I for the subsequent quarter without reapplying as a returning student. Any quarter from which a student has completely withdrawn does not constitute a completed quarter. Summer quarter enrollment is not required to maintain continuous registration eligibility. The quarter-off policy is not available for graduate students; please see Graduate Student On-Leave Status. Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or postbaccalaureate students who have submitted a graduation application may register on the first day of Period I for their final two quarters. Students who postpone their graduation may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular senior or postbaccalaureate priority day. When students have used their graduating senior priority for two quarters, their registration priority reverts to the regular senior or postbaccalaureate schedule. Students may not register for classes in any quarter beyond the quarter for which they have applied to graduate (except summer quarter). Registering at Other UW Campuses Undergraduate students who have completed at least 15 credits and freshmen who have completed at least 25 credits at the Tacoma campus are eligible to register for up to five credits per quarter at one of the other UW campuses during Registration Period II. Eligible students may register cross-campus using MyUW. Undergraduate students are limited to a total of 45 credits through cross- campus registration. For more information on cross-campus registration, please go online to: www. washington.edu/uaa/gateway/advising/ registration/ccregi.php Dropping a Course Students dropping a course during the first two weeks of a quarter shall have no entry on their permanent academic transcript unless they do a complete withdrawal from the university. If a student drops all his or her courses, a complete withdrawal date is recorded on the transcript. A course drop made during the third through the seventh week of the quarter will be recorded on an undergraduate student's transcript with a W grade and a number designating the week of the quarter in which the course was dropped. Students may drop only one course each academic year (autumn through summer quarters) from the third through the seventh week of the quarter. This is referred to as the \"annual drop\" To drop a course officially, a student must complete the transaction electronically using MyUW or submit a drop card in the Office of the Registrar. A student who drops a course unofficially (only through the instructor or adviser, for example) is given a grade of 0.0. Students receiving or applying for financial aid should check with the financial aid counselor before dropping a class because it may affect financial aid eligibility. Students should be aware that dropping a course may affect their student account. Please see the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog. During summer quarter, the timeline for dropping a course is abbreviated due to the shortened session. Please consult the Important Dates page on the Registration website for specific dates at www.tacoma. uw.edu/register . Hardship Withdrawal Policy Students may petition the UW Tacoma registrar in writing for a hardship withdrawal if they are unable to complete a course due to physical or mental debilitation or unusual or extenuating circumstances beyond their control that may have arisen and prevented them from dropping the course by the seventh week. Petitions must be filed promptly after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the need for dropping, preferably prior to the end of the quarter. Only in rare circumstances will petitions be accepted after the close of the quarter in which the withdrawal is being petitioned. Students who have completed the requirements for the course are generally not eligible for a hardship withdrawal. The petition for hardship withdrawal should be completed by the student and submitted to the UW Tacoma registrar. Supporting documentation as detailed on the petition form must accompany the petition. The Registration15 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma UW Tacoma registrar reserves the right to verify the authenticity and details of the documentation. Complete Withdrawal from the University for a Registered Quarter (dropping all courses for the quarter) It is the student's responsibility to withdraw from all courses if he or she is unable to attend. Students may withdraw using the electronic registration systems through the unrestricted drop period. Beginning with the third week of the quarter, official withdrawals must be submitted to the UW Tacoma registrar and must include the signature of the program adviser. An official withdrawal is effective the date of the last drop made electronically, the date it is received in the Office of the Registrar, or if submitted by mail, the date of the postmark. Tuition owed will be based on the date the complete withdrawal is received. Withdrawals are NOT accepted after the last day of instruction for the quarter. The tuition forfeiture schedule for complete withdrawal from the university is as follows: Students who withdraw on or before the seventh calendar day of the quarter do not pay tuition. Students who withdraw after the seventh calendar day through the 30th calendar day continue to owe one half of their tuition. Students who withdraw after the 30th calendar day continue to owe full tuition. The following principles apply to complete withdrawal from the university: Courses dropped as part of a complete withdrawal from the university during the first two weeks of a quarter are not recorded on the student's UW transcript; however, the date of the complete withdrawal is recorded. A recipient of veterans benefits should immediately notify the veterans benefits coordinator of withdrawal. A student with a scholarship or loan awarded through the university should notify the financial aid counselor of withdrawal.Withdrawal for Military Service Students who are conscripted into the U.S. armed forces or called to active military duty may withdraw through the end of the seventh week of instruction and receive a full refund but no academic credit. A copy of the student's military orders is required. If a student withdraws after that date, the student may receive either a full refund or academic credit and no refund. Students who withdraw for military reasons will be allowed to return to the university without having to pay another application fee. Documentation in the form of military orders will be required. Please consult with the Office of the Registrar for complete details. Important Dates Each quarter, the Office of the Registrar publishes a list of important dates for the upcoming quarter online on the Registration website at www.tacoma.washington.edu/ register. This page contains links to the schedule of classes, academic calendar, final examination schedule, registration period dates, deadlines (including graduation application deadlines), information about tuition and fees, and registration and withdrawal procedures. It is the responsibility of the student to know and understand these procedures and deadlines. Registering for Classes Students register for classes online using MyUW .

Permission to audit is granted by the course instructor and is generally allowed only for lecture classes. Auditors may not participate in discussion or laboratory work. Summer Quarter Students should note that due to the shortened session, deadlines for fee payment and registration transactions may vary from those of the regular academic year. See the important dates page on the registration website for specific dates each summer. Registration17 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Academic and University Policies Academic Policies UW Tacoma uses a numerical grading system. Instructors may report grades from 4.0 to 0.7 in 0.1 increments and the grade 0.0. The number 0.0 is assigned for failing work or unofficial withdrawal. Grades in the range 0.6 to 0.1 may not be assigned. Grades reported in this range are converted by the registrar to 0.0. Numerical grades may be considered equivalent to letter grades as shown in the chart at right. The following letter grades may also be used: CR: Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The minimum performance level required for a CR grade is determined, and the grade is awarded directly by the instructor. CR is not computed in GPA calculations. NC: Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The grade is awarded directly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. S: Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An S grade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or above for undergraduate classes and 2.7 or above for graduate classes. The grade S may not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Office of the Registrar. Undergraduate students may elect this option only for free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a university, college or department course requirement. With the approval of their program adviser, graduate students may elect to be graded S/NS in any numerically graded course for which they are eligible. Depending on the program, up to 25 credits of S/NS grades may be applied to an undergraduate degree. S is not computed in GPA calculations. There is no limit on the number of S credits that can be applied to a graduate degree. Undergraduate Graduate Letter Grade Point Letter Grade Point Grade Equivalent Grade Equivalent A 3.9 - 4.0 A 3.9 - 4.0 A- 3.5 - 3.8 A- 3.5 - 3.8 B+ 3.2 - 3.4 B+ 3.1 - 3.4 B 2.9 - 3.1 B 2.9 - 3.0 B- 2.5 - 2.8 B- 2.5 - 2.8 A minimum of 2.7 is C+ 2.2 - 2.4 required in each course C 1.9 - 2.1 that is counted toward C- 1.5 - 1.8 a graduate degree.

No credit earned. NS: Not Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduate classes and 2.7 for graduate classes is converted to NS. NS is not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. I: Incomplete given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control. To obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an I into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student should never re- register for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. For undergraduate students, an I grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to a grade of 0.0 by the Office of the Registrar unless the instructor has indicated when assigning the I grade that a grade other than 0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not completed. The I is not removed from the permanent record and appears on the transcript with the completed grade. An instructor may approve an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by contacting the Office of the Registrar no later than the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade was assigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters, must be received before the I has been converted into a failing grade. In no case can an I received by an undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after the lapse of one year. For graduate students, an I grade does not automatically convert to 0.0 but remains a permanent part of the student's record. To obtain credit for the course, a student must successfully complete the work and the instructor must submit a grade. In no case can an I received by a graduate student be converted to a passing grade after a lapse of two years or more.Letter Grade Equivalents Academic and University Policies18 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma W: Official Withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the seventh week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the week of the quarter is recorded with the \"W\" when a course is dropped. It is not computed in GPA calculations. HW: Hardship Withdrawal grade assigned when a student is allowed to withdraw from a course after the 14th calendar day of the quarter (see Hardship Withdrawal Policy on page 13). It is not computed in GPA calculations. N: Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a final grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 or 800. Grade point average (GPA) The cumulative GPA includes credits granted for courses taken in residence at all campuses of the University of Washington and those with a \"DL \" (Distance Learning) suffix taken through UW Educational Outreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for other UWEO courses that are not residence credit and grades for credit by examination. These latter grades do not affect the student's UW cumulative GPA. Computation of GPA The grade point average for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the total credits attempted for courses taken in residence at the university. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/ NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactory grades are printed on the permanent record as an S and do not count in the quarterly or cumulative grade point average, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades (NS) do not count in the quarterly and cumulative grade point averages and do not count as credits earned toward graduation. Example 1: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TIAS 498 3 x 0.0 = 0.0 TSMIN 300 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TCSIUS 445 5 x 3.2 = 16.0 30.5 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 13 Grade point average = 30.5 \u00f7 13 = 2.35 The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing the GPA.Example 2: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TBUS 300 5 x 2.3 = 11.5 TBUS 310 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TBUS 320 5 x I = 0.0 26.0 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 15 Grade point average = 26.0 \u00f7 10 = 2.60 The student attempted 15 credits, but only 10 are graded; the I is not computed in the grade point average. If the work in TBUS 320 is not made up by the end of the quarter, the I will convert to a numeric grade of 0.0 and the grade point average will be recomputed. When the grade of 0.0 is received, it is computed in the grade point average, but no credit is awarded toward graduation. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic program offering the course, a student may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade will be computed in the grade point average, but credit will be allowed only once. Veterans receiving benefits must receive approval from the veterans coordinator in the Office of Enrollment Services before a course is repeated. Duplicate Courses To protect the student's investment of educational effort and the value of the degree, UW Tacoma will not award credit for courses that repeat work done elsewhere. It is the responsibility of students who have earned credit at other colleges for determining whether courses they plan to take at UW Tacoma would duplicate any previously earned credit. Duplicate credit will not be awarded for courses that are equivalent to courses previously passed. Students who are in doubt should consult an adviser before registering. Class Attendance The University of Washington Tacoma reserves the right to drop students who have not attended class during the first week of the quarter to make space for other students waiting to enroll. However, students should not assume that they will automatically be dropped from a course if they do not attend. It is the student's responsibility to drop the course through MyUW. Students who are registered for a course section but do not attend will be assigned a failing grade by the instructor. Students may not attend a course in which they have not been officially registered after the first two weeks of the quarter. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name appears on the official class list from the Office of the Registrar. Other faculty members may attend informally with the approval of the instructor. Grading Procedures Change of grade Except in case of error, an instructor may not change a grade that he or she has submitted to the registrar. A student who finds administrative omissions or errors in a grade report must make application for a review not later than the last day of the student's next quarter in residence. Grades used to meet graduation requirements cannot be changed after the degree has been granted. Students are not automatically notified of grade changes posted after the first of the quarter. Grade appeal procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded first discusses the matter with the instructor before the end of the following academic quarter. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the director or the dean of the program that offered the course, with a copy of the appeal also to the instructor. This must be done no later than 10 class days after his or her discussion with the instructor. The director consults with the instructor to ensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbitrary or capricious. Should the director believe the instructor's conduct to be arbitrary or capricious and the instructor declines to revise the grade, the director, with the approval of the voting members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member, or members, of the faculty of that program to evaluate the performance of the student and assign a grade. The UW Tacoma vice chancellor for Academic Affairs and the University of Washington provost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal are recorded in written form for deposit in the student's file. Grade Reports The University of Washington does not mail grade reports. Students access their grades online using MyUW . Academic and University Policies19 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Transcripts Official transcripts are available from the Office of the Registrar or the Cashier's Office. Transcripts may be ordered using a request form or by written request from the student. The request must include name; Social Security number or student identification number; current phone number; date of birth; address to which the transcript should be sent and student signature. Additional helpful information includes dates of attendance and former name. Because the signature of the student is required, email requests cannot be accepted. Payment of $9 per transcript is required at the time of the request by check or money order. Current students may have the charge added to their tuition bill. The transcript request form is available online at www.tacoma. washington.edu/cashier/transcripts . Allow three to five working days for processing. Same-day requests are available for an additional $15 fee. Transcripts may be picked up in the Office of the Registrar with picture identification or mailed to a third party, per student request. Each transcript will include all course work taken at the University of Washington, with indication of the campus where the credits were earned. Students can print out an unofficial transcript online at myuw.washington.edu . Scholarship Academic Standards Students are expected to meet the traditional standards of honesty and truthfulness in all aspects of their academic work at UW Tacoma. In particular, all work submitted to an instructor in fulfillment of course assignments, including papers and projects, written and oral examinations, and oral presentations and reports, must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the creations, ideas or words of someone else without formally acknowledging the author or source through appropriate use of quotation marks, references and the like. Student work in which plagiarism occurs will not be accepted as satisfactory by the instructor and may lead to disciplinary action against the student submitting it. Any student who is uncertain whether his or her use of the work of others constitutes plagiarism should consult the course instructor for guidance before formally submitting the work involved.Satisfactory Progress The university requires students to declare a major by the time they have earned 105 credits. Students are urged to meet with an adviser in the Office of Undergraduate Education for advising toward a major. A registration hold will be placed on students who have reached 105 credits and have not declared a major. In rare cases, a student who has met with an adviser in Undergraduate Education will be granted a pre-major extension. The university's satisfactory progress policy requires that students complete their undergraduate degree within 30 credits beyond the minimum required for the degree. Because most degrees require 180 total transfer and UW credits, students generally must complete their programs by the time they earn 210 credits. Undergraduates who have completed more than 210 credits will be notified by the end of the third week of the quarter that a hold is being placed on their registration due to lack of satisfactory progress. Students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisers to prepare a graduation plan or complete a graduation application to avoid this situation. Low Scholarship Academic warning An undergraduate student whose grade point average falls below 2.00 in his or her first quarter at the university receives an academic warning. If a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 for courses earned in residence at the university is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academic probation. Academic probation and dismissal for low scholarship An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the first quarter at the university, when an academic warning is issued) in which his or her cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00. Once on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 for each succeeding quarter's work until the cumulative grade point average is raised to a 2.00 or the student is dropped for low scholarship. Reinstatement An undergraduate student who has been dropped for low scholarship will be readmitted to the university only at the discretion of the academic program and, in some cases, may be required to sit out one quarter. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules reenters the university on academic probation and may be required to re-apply to their academic program. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the university, and the student may not use grades from other colleges or universities to raise his or her UW grade point average. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 grade point average for the following quarter's work or a cumulative UW grade point average of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student is removed from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or better is reached. The petition for reinstatement form is available from the Office of the Registrar or the student's academic program. Please note: The University of Washington transcript is comprised of course work and grades from all three campuses. Students who are dropped for low scholarship from one campus and reinstated at another will remain on academic probation until their cumulative grade point average reaches 2.0. Senior in final quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in what would normally be his or her final quarter places him or her on probation does not receive a degree until removed from probation. Dean's List Quarterly dean's list The quarterly high scholarship list includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly grade point average of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate high- scholarship entries are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual dean's list The yearly award for high scholarship is recorded on the academic transcript of undergraduate students enrolled for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) and who earned a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or more numerically graded credits each quarter. It is also recorded for students enrolled for four quarters who met the standard just mentioned and also earned a quarterly GPA of 3.5 or better in the fourth quarter if enrolled for 10 or more credits. Annual dean's list certificate Annual Dean's List certificates are awarded to students in the senior class who have high scholastic records for their junior year. The honors committee on the University of Washington Seattle campus determines the grade point average required for the awarding of certificates. Students receive a certificate and a letter of congratulations from the UW Tacoma chancellor. Academic and University Policies20 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors ( summa cum laude, magna cum laude, cum laude ) are awarded only to recipients of a first baccalaureate degree. These honors are earned by those students who have completed no fewer than 90 residence credits at this institution. At least 60 of the 90 credits must have been acquired on a graded basis. The university's honors committee determines annually the grade-point requirement for each baccalaureate honor. In recent years, approximately 10 percent of the students have been awarded baccalaureate honors. Credits earned by extension courses are not counted toward honors eligibility. August graduates who wish to participate in the preceding June Commencement should contact their program adviser regarding recognition of honors at the June ceremony. Faculty Honors At the University of Washington Tacoma, faculty honors are awarded to those students receiving a baccalaureate degree whose GPA is in the upper 10 percent of their program and who have earned between 43 and 89 graded credits at the UW . Chancellor's Medal The Chancellor's Medal, which is conferred at Commencement, recognizes the graduating senior who has the most distinguished academic record. Only students who have earned at least 90 credits (43 credits for nursing students) in residence at the University of Washington Tacoma may be considered. Academic and University Policies21 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Undergraduate Policies and Graduation College Academic Distribution Requirements (CADR) Students are required to complete a minimum level of preparation in six subject areas in high school. More information about each of these requirements is available online at www. tacoma.washington.edu/admissions . Minimum high school preparation SUBJECT REQUIREMENT English ........................................ 4 credits Mathematics .............................. 3 credits Social studies ............................. 3 credits Foreign language ....................... 2 credits Science ........................................ 2 credits Fine, visual, performing arts .0.5 credits Academic electives ................. 0.5 credits Using College Course Work to Complete CADR Almost all applicants will have satisfied these requirements through high school course work, which is generally defined as that completed in grades 9-12. However, there are several ways to satisfy CADR at the college level. In general, five quarter credits (or three semester credits) at the college level equals one credit of high-school study. If you completed a portion of these requirements in high school, you can pick up in college where you left off in high school. For example, if you completed three credits of English in high school, you can use one college English composition or literature course to bring your total to four credits. Grading Restrictions To satisfy the college academic distribution requirements, a passing grade, including a D, is acceptable in either high school or college work. Intermediate algebra at the college level must be completed with a C (2.0) or better. Also acceptable is a grade of Pass in a course taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, if you are completing CADR through college course work, you are strongly encouraged to take courses for a letter/ numerical grade, because you may later want to apply this course work towards requirements for your major or university or college graduation requirements, for which grading restrictions pertain. Submission of Final High School Transcript Newly admitted freshmen are required to submit their final high school transcript no later than July 1. Failure to successfully complete course work reported in the application for admission could mean your offer of admission will be revoked. Admission Categories UW Tacoma offers seven admission categories, outlined below. The Office of Enrollment Services can assist applicants who are uncertain about their proper admission category. Matriculated students New students at UW Tacoma seeking their first undergraduate degree are normally admitted as matriculated students. Freshmen coming directly from high school who have fewer than 45 college credits are admitted directly to the core curriculum. Freshman applicants who have more than 45 credits and may be considered \"major ready\" will also be reviewed for program admission. In most quarters, admission for transfer students is a two-step process. Students are first admitted as pre-majors. If students requested a specific major\u2014and if their initial review indicates they may be major ready\u2014their files are then forwarded to the academic program of their choice to be reviewed for program admission. Postbaccalaureate students Postbaccalaureate is a matriculated status at the University of Washington Tacoma. Postbaccalaureate students are those who have completed one or more bachelor's degrees and are working toward another bachelor's degree or completing prerequisite courses for a graduate program. The application of their previous course work toward graduation requirements will be determined by program faculty and advisers. Nonmatriculated students Although a student enrolled at the University of Washington Tacoma in a nonmatriculated status cannot earn a degree, a grade is earned and full credit is awarded and recorded on a UW transcript. The credits earned as a nonmatriculated student usually transfer to other institutions. If a student is later accepted into a matriculated status at the Tacoma campus, up to 45 credits earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied to an undergraduate degree with some restrictions. Students admitted as nonmatriculated are generally allowed to accrue no more than 45 credits in that status. However, some exceptions may be allowed. The number may vary by program. Students considering switching to matriculated (degree-seeking) status are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, as 45 of the last 60 credits of a baccalaureate degree must be earned as a matriculated student in residence at the Tacoma campus. Students who wish to change their status from nonmatriculated to matriculated must apply to do so by the priority application date of the program they wish to enter. Transcripts from all institutions attended must be submitted along with a change-of- status form. Forms are available in the Office of Enrollment Services or on the UW Tacoma website. Applicants seeking matriculated status may have admission and registration priority over nonmatriculated applicants. Non-UW Tacoma students applying to the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Nonprofit Management certificate programs should apply as nonmatriculated students. Please review the program requirements for guidance in making a successful application and completing additional application requirements. Undergraduate Policies and Graduation22 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Summer Only Visiting Students apply as nonmatriculated students. Applicants must meet application and admission requirements if they wish to matriculate for subsequent quarters. Students admitted for autumn who wish to begin their studies during summer quarter should consult their academic programs. Returning former students A UW Tacoma undergraduate student who has not been enrolled for more than one quarter (not including summer) is required to complete and file a Returning Student Application and pay a $60 application fee by the application deadline. Returning students who left in good academic standing and wish to return, must return to the same academic program they were enrolled in when they left. Students who wish to apply to another major may do so after re-admission by submitting a change of major form. Auditors Individuals who wish only to audit university courses should apply for admission with nonmatriculated standing. Attendance in courses as an auditor is by consent of the instructor involved and only as space permits. Permission to audit is ordinarily granted for lecture classes only. An auditor may not participate in class discussion or laboratory work, and the auditor's registration may be canceled at the discretion of the instructor. No record of audited courses is kept. Regular tuition and fees are charged. To receive credit for an audited course, the student must register for the class for credit and complete the course requirements in a subsequent quarter.Dual Enrollment The University of Washington Tacoma has partnered with Tacoma Community College to offer a Dual Enrollment program. Students can attend both schools at once, and it's easy to gain access to a wide variety of degree and certificate programs. On campuses just six miles apart, students will benefit from the close relationship between advisers from both schools, who help them make the best choices to meet their educational goals. Students enjoy a seamless transition between lower- and upper-division course work on the path to earning their bachelor's degrees. To learn more about the Dual Enrollment program, call the Dual Enrollment adviser at 253-692-4743 or 253-460-4468. Guaranteed Admission through the Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) UW Tacoma guarantees general admission to Washington state residents who earn an approved transfer degree at a Washington state community college with at least a 2.75 GPA and meet admission requirements. To qualify for guaranteed admission, students must: Complete the transfer application by the application deadline for the quarter. Eligible students who apply after the application deadline will be admitted on a space-available basis until transfer admissions are closed for the quarter. In the event that space is not available, students eligible for Guaranteed Admission will be admitted for a future quarter as designated by the Office of Admissions. Earn an approved transfer degree, as determined by UW Tacoma admissions. Have a cumulative 2.75 GPA or better in all transferable academic course work (at all colleges attended). Transfer directly from a Washington state community college. Be a Washington state resident. The Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) ensures admission only to pre-major status but does not promise admission to any school or program nor to any particular major within the university. Additional program or university requirements must be met for completion of a baccaulaureate degree. Students are responsible for checking specific program requirements. You may apply to a school or program at the same time you apply to the university or in a later quarter. Whenever you choose to apply to a school or program, you must meet the program's application deadline and admission requirements. Admission to some programs is selective and not all qualified students will be accepted. Transfer Admission Transfer students may apply to a school or program at the same time they apply to the university or in a later quarter. Whenever students choose to apply to a school or program, they must meet the program's application deadline and admission requirements. Admission to some programs is selective and not all qualified students will be accepted. Students who have attended college or university after graduating from high school may be admitted to the University of Washington Tacoma as transfer students. Applicants who have completed fewer than 45 college credits are required to submit their high school transcript and standardized test scores. The minimum cumulative grade point average for all college course work must be at least 2.0. Additional university requirements are outlined below. General University Requirements Foreign language All applicants must complete two high school years, or 10 credits at the college level, of a single foreign language. The study must be devoted to a single foreign language and must be in sequence, with no repetition of any prior term of study. Any natural language other than English that has been formally studied may be used to satisfy this Autumn Winter Spring Summer Freshman Mar. 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 General University Transfer Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 \u2014 Milgard School of Business Apr. 15 Oct. 15 \u2014 \u2014 Environmental Science Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 \u2014 Healthcare Leadership Apr. 15 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Institute of Technology Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 \u2014 Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 \u2014 Nursing (RN to BSN) Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 Feb. 15 Social Welfare Apr. 15 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Urban Studies Apr. 15 Oct. 15 Jan. 15 \u2014 These dates may change for subsequent years, and programs that admit more than once a year may not continue to do so in subsequent years.APPLICATION DEADLINES FOR UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSION Undergraduate Policies and Graduation23 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma requirement, including languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. American Sign Language (AMESLAN, the language of the deaf community in America) will also meet this requirement. However, other forms of deaf signing and computer \"languages\" are not acceptable. The foreign language requirement will be considered satisfied for applicants who had instruction through seventh grade in a language other than English. Mathematics All applicants must complete three years of high school math through intermediate (second-year) algebra or a course in intermediate algebra in college with a minimum grade of 2.0. Proficiency may be satisfied through other course work; check with an adviser for a list. Many of these courses require a minimum grade of 2.0 in order to satisfy the math proficiency. Writing/English composition All applicants must complete at least five credits of English composition with a minimum grade of 2.0 to meet the minimum admission requirement. Undergraduate Transfer Credit To students pursuing a first bachelor's degree, UW Tacoma awards transfer credit according to the guidelines listed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject credits earned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is university policy to accept credits earned at institutions fully accredited by the regional accrediting association provided that such credits have been earned through university-level courses (see exceptions below) appropriate to the student's degree program. For courses taken at a Washington state community college, UW Tacoma follows the list of transferable courses published in the UW Equivalency Guide for Washington Community and Technical Colleges . Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit Lower-division college credit At the time of admission, a maximum of 90 lower-division (100- or 200-level courses) quarter credits can be awarded toward the student's degree. Depending on the degree program, students may be allowed to petition the academic program for additional lower- division credit. Under no circumstances will students be awarded in excess of 135 lower- division credits. Upper-division credits (300- or 400-level courses) from other four-year institutions may apply to some program requirements. For some programs, there is a seven-year limit on upper-division transfer credits that are applied toward required core or concentration courses. Please consult with an adviser for details. UW Extension distance learning If permitted by the degree program, up to 90 credits earned in correspondence courses offered by the Distance Learning division of UW Extension may be applied toward a UW degree. However, 45 of the student's final 60 credits must be taken in residence at UW Tacoma to meet the final-year residency requirement (see page 26). Extension credit from other schools No more than 45 credits earned as extension credit from other schools may be applied toward a UW degree. Military credit, discussed below, is included in the 45 extension credit limit. Guidance/personal development A maximum of 3 credits is awarded for courses in this area as part of the 15 credits allowed for vocational/technical courses. Limitation on ROTC credits Credits earned in first- and second-year military training courses may not be counted in the 180 credits that are required for graduation. Some third- and fourth-year courses may count, depending on the student's degree program. Military credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFI and DANTES may not exceed 30 and are included in the 45 extension credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted, and credit will not be awarded until after the student has enrolled. Scores received in such course work are not included in the transfer GPA. Out-of-sequence courses Credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced-level course has been completed. For example, students will not be awarded credit for Spanish 102 if it was taken after Spanish 103. Physical education No more than 3 quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Vocational-technical courses A maximum of 15 transfer credits will be awarded for a wide range of college-level courses that are vocational-technical, rather than academic, in content (i.e., bookkeeping, electronics, physical therapy technician). These credits may apply only to the elective component of a baccalaureate degree and only with program approval.Alternative credit The University of Washington Tacoma does not award general credit for work or life experience. Courses Receiving No Credit Courses receiving no transfer credit include (but are not limited to): Courses below college level (usually numbered below 100) Repeated or duplicate courses Course work taken at an institution that is not accredited by the regional association Courses that provide instruction in a particular religious doctrine Mathematics courses considered below college level, including basic math, business math, beginning and intermediate algebra Courses offered for non-credit continuing education units Remedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution's first English composition course) Courses providing instruction in English as a Second Language (100-level or above) Remedial courses in any academic discipline Any course in the following categories: aeronautics/aviation/pilot training air conditioning/heating-refrigeration allied health (optics) auto mechanics beginning typing carpentry/construction methods cooking/baking cosmetology custodial training/maintenance diesel mechanics fire science graphics reproduction horse-shoeing military science (lower-division) replacement parts stationary steam engineering study skills water science technology College-Level Examination Program (CLEP): The university does not accept Undergraduate Policies and Graduation24 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma or award credit for CLEP general or subject examinations. Any such credit awarded by other institutions, or through independent testing, will not be transferred to the university. Applicability of Transfer Credit to Degree Requirements The Office of Enrollment Services has the authority to make decisions approving transfer credit to the university and application of transfer credits to fulfill university requirements. The individual academic program offices have the authority to determine application of transfer credits to fulfill major requirements. By the first quarter of enrollment, a student should meet with a program adviser to plan a program of study. The program adviser will determine how the transfer credits may be used in meeting degree requirements. Admission Deficiencies Any student who is admitted to the University of Washington Tacoma with an admission deficiency is required to complete that deficiency within one year of being admitted. Students who fail to do so may have a hold placed on their registration. Students who fail to complete an admission deficiency cannot receive a UW Tacoma degree. Quarter vs. Semester Credits Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit . The University of Washington Tacoma awards quarter credit . One semester credit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter credits; one three- semester-credit course is equivalent to 4.5 quarter credits. Sixty semester credits are equivalent to 90 quarter credits. Transfer GPA In calculating the transfer GPA, the following guidelines apply: Grades from all transferable academic courses attempted, from all colleges the student has attended, in which the student has received grades between 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale are included in the calculation. If a student had repeated a course, the most recent grade for the repeated course is used in the transfer GPA. (Note: This method is different from that used in calculating the UW Tacoma GPA for UW Tacoma courses that have been repeated.) To protect the students' investment of educational effort and the value of the degree, UW Tacoma will not award credit for courses that repeat work done elsewhere. It is the responsibility of students who have earned credit at other colleges to determine whether courses they plan to take at UW Tacoma would duplicate any previously earned credit. Duplicate credit will not be awarded for courses that are equivalent to courses previously passed. Students who are in doubt should consult an adviser before registering for a UW Tacoma course. All transferable academic credit from two-year colleges is included in the calculation, even if it exceeds the 90 credits awarded. Transfer course work completed after a student matriculates must be graded on a numerical or letter-grade basis. The following are not included in the transfer GPA: Courses considered by UW Tacoma to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly MATH 101 Intermediate Algebra) Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teach preparation for the ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills Lower-division military science courses English as a Second Language courses Vocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of Incomplete Courses recorded with a grade of Pass or Satisfactory P .E. activity credits in excess of 3 quarter credits Class Standing A student's initial class standing is determined by the total number of transfer credits awarded by the University of Washington Tacoma, not by the number of years of college study or completion of an associate degree. The following table lists the required credits for each class: Freshman ......................... fewer than 45 credits Sophomore ................... 45-89 credits Junior .......................... 90-134 credits Senior .......................... 135 credits or more Students should note that satisfying UW Tacoma graduation requirements depends not only on the number of credits completed (a minimum of 180) but also on completion of all program requirements. Declaring a Major A major is the academic subject area, such as business or environmental science, in which a student will take the majority of her or his upper-level courses and in which she or he will earn a bachelor's degree. Most transfer students are admitted directly to a major. Students admitted as freshmen or general university transfers will need to declare a major. When to Declare a Major Students are able to declare a major as soon as they have met the minimum credits required for the major. Students are expected to have declared a major by the time they have accumulated 105 credits. Failure to do so will result in a hold on registration. Students who have not been admitted into an academic program are strongly encouraged to make an appointment to meet with an adviser in the Office of Undergraduate Education. Some majors have prerequisites, and students who wait too long to meet with an adviser run the risk of accumulating more credits than they need and still not satisfying the major prerequisites. If a student is not able to declare his or her intended major by the time the student has earned 105 credits, he or she may be able to request a pre-major extension through their adviser. Pre-major extensions are usually granted if there is a reasonable chance of being accepted into the intended major. Students who haven't yet decided on a major and need some guidance can consult Career Development and Education for help. What Majors are Available? UW Tacoma offers eleven majors with a variety of concentrations. Review the academic program sections of this catalog for details. How to Declare a Major Once the admission requirements of a major, if any, have been met, a student can declare the major by following these steps: Download and complete the request to declare/change major form. Take the completed change of major form to the student's current adviser or program office (pre-major students go to the Office of Undergraduate Education in Science 102). The current program Undergraduate Policies and Graduation25 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma adviser will sign the form and make a copy for the program's records. Take the signed form to the new adviser or program office for approval. Students declaring a competitive major will need to submit any supplemental forms or other required documents directly to the program office of the new major. Students will be notified of acceptance into the new major and the new adviser will forward the approved form to the Registrar's Office, where the student's major code will be changed. Students who are not accepted into their requested majors may consult with advisers or submit additional formd to declare a different major. Changing a Major Students can change their majors at any time using this same process. Students should meet with an academic adviser first. Declaring a Double Major or Double Degree Using the same process outlined above, students may complete the requirements of two majors as either a double major or a double degree. Students who complete the requirements of two majors and accumulate a minimum of 180 credits will be awarded one bachelor's degree with two majors, called a \"double major. \" Students who complete the requirements of two majors and accumulate 225 credits (180 + 45) will be awarded two bachelor's degrees, called a \"double degree.\" The student will receive two diplomas. If the two degrees are offered by different schools (i.e., the Milgard School of Business and IAS) or if one of the majors is a B.A. and the other is a B.S, the student must complete a double degree. Second baccalaureate degree A second baccalaureate degree may be granted, but a student must earn a minimum of 45 credits beyond the number required for the first degree. These credits usually must be earned in residence, with the granting of exceptions to the residency rule being the responsibility of the college, school or campus awarding the degree. The student must achieve no less than a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the credits required for the second degree. Students completing a second baccalaureate degree are not registered in the Graduate School, but in the academic division of the university with jurisdiction over the degree sought.Degrees with two majors The student's application for a baccalaureate degree with two majors must show both majors and be approved by the advisers of both programs. Requirements of both majors must be met. Both majors appear on the transcript. Two baccalaureate degrees concurrently Two baccalaureate degrees, associated with different majors, may be granted at the same time, but the total number of academic credits earned must reach a minimum of 45 credits in excess of the number required for the first baccalaureate degree. Declaring a Minor A minor is an optional program of study (usually 25 to 35 credits) built around a particular subject or skill, for example, nonprofit management or applied computing. Minors can be helpful in two ways: They allow students to focus their degree by choosing a minor related to their major or students can broaden their degree by taking an unrelated but complementary minor (for example, a business student taking a computing minor). The minor will also show up on the student's transcripts. Students who have accumulated 90 credits can declare a minor by using the same request to declare/change major form and submitting it to their current adviser. Minors do not have prerequisites and do not require any additional application materials. Students are eligible to complete as many as three minors providing they are completing their first undergraduate degree. More information on minors available at UW Tacoma can be found beginning on page 121. Certifying Completion of a Minor Minors are posted on the student's transcript. A minor must be awarded at the same time the student's first bachelor's degree is awarded. This means: A student who doesn't graduate cannot be awarded a minor. A student cannot earn a minor after graduation. Graduation Requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree Beginning in autumn 2011, all UW Tacoma undergraduate students will be required to complete five credits of English composition with a minimum grade of 2.0. Any student who has not completed an English composition course with this grade will be required to complete either TCORE 101 or TWRT 112 or an equivalent course with a 2.0 within their first two quarters at UW Tacoma or s/he will not be allowed to register for additional course work at UW Tacoma. To graduate with a bachelor's degree, a student must meet minimum general education and basic skills requirements in addition to the requirements of their academic program. This section outlines only the general education and basic skill requirements. Graduation requirements for the individual degree programs are explained in each program's section in this catalog. Earn a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 for all work done in residence at the university. The graduation grade point average is computed when the student has completed all work for the degree and includes only credits earned while in residence at the university. Complete a minimum of 180 academic credits to include: - No fewer than 40 credits of general education courses, to include a minimum of 10 credits in each of three areas of study: Natural World, Individuals and Society and Visual, Literary and Performing Arts - A minimum of 15 credits of writing to include 5 credits of English composition and 10 credits of writing-intensive courses - A minimum of 5 credits of Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning course work Final-Year Residency Requirement Students are required to complete 45 of their final 60 credits as matriculated students in residence at UW Tacoma. Some degree programs may have stricter residency requirements. To seek an exception to the residency requirement the student needs to submit a graduation petition to the UW Tacoma Registrar for review by the Academic Policy Committee. See details in the \"Waiver of Graduation Requirements\" section. If an exception is granted, the student still must present a minimum of 45 credits taken in residence as a matriculated student to be awarded a UW degree. Catalog for Graduation Requirements With the approval of his or her program adviser, a student may choose to graduate under the requirements of either the current catalog or the catalog in effect at the time he Undergraduate Policies and Graduation26 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma or she entered the program from which he or she is to graduate. If the student graduates more than 10 years after enrolling in the program, the current catalog must be used for graduation purposes. Exceptions to this rule cannot be made without official approval. Waiver of Graduation Requirements To request a waiver of any graduation requirement a student must submit a Graduation Petition. If the student is requesting to waive a program requirement, the student should confer with his/her academic adviser. Review is done by the academic program faculty committee or director/dean, as procedures specific to each academic program dictate. If the student is requesting to waive a university requirement (e.g., residency or the minimum grade for composition) or admission requirement (e.g., foreign language) the petition should be submitted to the UW Tacoma Registrar for review by the Faculty Assembly's Academic Policy Committee. Once a determination has been made by the committee, the Registrar will notify the student and the graduation evaluator. To ensure a determination is made in time for graduation, petitions must be submitted at least one quarter before the student's graduation date. The decision of the Academic Policy Committee is final. An exemption from a university graduation requirement becomes void at the end of two calendar years from the date the exemption was granted if all degree requirements have not been completed by that date. Filing a Graduation Application The student must make an appointment with his or her program adviser to complete a written application for graduation. The application may be filed as early as three quarters before the expected date of graduation. The absolute deadline for filing an application is Friday of the second week of the quarter in which the student intends to graduate. Students who will complete their degree requirements in summer quarter but wish to participate in the preceding spring commencement must adhere to the spring deadline. It is the student's responsibility to apply for a degree; degrees are not automatically awarded when requirements have been satisfied.If a student declared a minor but it does not appear on the graduation application, the graduation evaluator will remove it. On the other hand, if a student does list a minor on the degree application, the student must complete that minor or drop it officially, or s/ he will not graduate. This protects the student from being graduated when the actual intent is to continue on in order to complete the minor. Adding minors after applying to graduate A student who wants to add a minor after the graduation application has been submitted must see his or her adviser, who will update the application and notify the graduation evaluator. Commencement Formal Commencement exercises are conducted at the close of spring quarter, on the second Friday in June. Information on participating in Commencement is posted on the UW Tacoma website at www.tacoma. washington.edu/commencement . Students who graduated the previous August, December or March and those who anticipate graduating in June or August of the current year are eligible to participate if they have filed a graduation application. It is the student's responsibility to apply for graduation by the deadline (see Filing a Graduation Application). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed directly to the graduate. Students do not receive their actual diploma at the Commencement ceremony. Student Rights and Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with all academic and administrative regulations and procedures relating to his or her course of study at UW Tacoma. Student Conduct Code The UW Board of Regents has adopted a Student Conduct Code, which applies to both academic and nonacademic conduct for students while in attendance at UW Tacoma. The University of Washington Student Conduct Code obligates students to: Maintain high standards of academic and professional honesty and integrity. Respect the rights, privileges and property of other members of the academic community and visitors to the campus. Refrain from actions that would interfere with university functions or endanger the health, safety or welfare of other persons. Comply with the rules and regulations of the university, its schools, colleges and departments. Violations of these standards may result in a variety of disciplinary actions, including suspension or permanent dismissal from the university.

According to this research, a \"cohort\" model results in higher academic achievement, a lower attrition rate, and greater student satisfaction than other models. In a cohort model, undergraduates take courses with the same students throughout their first year. This helps students, faculty, advisers, staff and librarians create a learning community. Teaching and learning in community (rather than with different students in every class) means that students make friends faster and learn to work together as colleagues. Best practices and research also tell us that interdisciplinary core courses are very successful for first-year students. That is why one Core course often includes more than one field of study. Today's challenges, after all, are complex and require educated citizens to approach them from more than one perspective. In the first year, students meet many of their general education graduation requirements in classes with a student-to-faculty ratio of 25 to 1. Discussion, lectures, reading, writing and project assignments will broaden students' perspectives, not only about what they are studying, but also about the world in which they live. Beyond the Core curriculum, students select courses each quarter from a range of electives that will allow them to explore and prepare for potential majors. Mission The Office of Undergraduate Education offers undergraduate students the opportunity to discover their intellectual, creative and professional passions by introducing them to many interconnected areas of knowledge. The Core program prepares students for success at the upper division by focusing on campus-wide learning goals: communication and self-expression, civic engagement, critical inquiry, global perspectives, diverse cultural views and the ability to solve problems.Office of Undergraduate Education Freshman Curriculum Phone: RebsamenLearning Objectives As the foundation of a student's academic career at UW Tacoma, the cohort model strives to foster the following learning objectives: Communication/Self-Expression Formulate an original thesis-driven argument and sustain it in both written and verbal communication. Express ideas clearly in writing and speaking in order to synthesize and evaluate information before presenting it. Enter/place themselves into an existing dialogue (intellectual, political, etc.). Identify, analyze and summarize/ represent the key elements of a text. Global Perspective Think outside of cultural norms and values, including their own perspectives, to critically engage the larger world. Analyze the ethical implications of actions on the part of individuals and institutions. Recognize the value of obtaining a historical perspective of events as being relevant and useful to guide future decision-making. Inquiry and Critical Thinking Self-assess personal strengths (personal, academic, social) and how they can help overcome weaknesses. Approach complex issues by taking a large question and breaking it down into manageable pieces. Make meaningful connections among assignments and readings in order to develop a sense of the \"big picture. \" Collect, evaluate and analyze information and resources to solve problems or answer questions.Areas of Knowledge (AoK) Core courses are designed to fulfill one or more of the distribution requirements set forth by UW Tacoma. Within the first academic year, full-time first-year students can expect to earn approximately 45 credits towards the university's distribution requirement, including 20-25 distribution credits earned within the Core program. The AoK are as follows and provide foundational learning towards all academic majors and programs: 15 credits in writing to include no fewer than 5 credits in English composition [C] and 10 additional credits in writing- intensive [W] courses 5 credits in quantitative/symbolic reasoning [Q] Freshman Curriculum31 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma 40 combined credits of areas of knowledge that include no fewer than 10 credits in each are of study: Visual, Literary and Performing Arts (VLPA) [V] Individuals and Societies (I&S) [I] Natural World (NW) [N] Courses taken to fulfill the writing [W], reasoning [Q] and academic major requirements may also apply to the areas of knowledge requirements. Academic Standards Undergraduate Education adheres to UW Tacoma's academic standards as outlined by the Office of the Registrar within this catalog. However, if a first-year student has been dropped for one quarter due to deficient satisfactory academic progress, the student is strongly encouraged to attend a community college in the interim quarter. This process encourages students' academic progress and provides them an opportunity to improve their academic performance before petitioning the university for reinstatement. First-year and undeclared students who are dropped from the university are required to meet with their academic adviser to discuss satisfactory academic progress policy and reinstatement procedures at least three weeks prior to the beginning of the petitioned quarter. Advising The primary purpose of academic advising at UW Tacoma is to assist students in the development of meaningful educational plans that will expand the boundaries of knowledge and discovery. The Office of Undergraduate Education collaborates with the campus community to provide resources and support services to all first-year Core and undeclared students. Students admitted to majors are advised by a program adviser. At UW Tacoma, academic advising is based on a system of shared responsibility between student and adviser. An academic adviser can: Assist with class registration and course selection Provide guidance in developing academic goals and choosing a major Offer support or appropriate referrals if a student experiences academic difficulty Clarify university requirements and academic policiesStudents' contribution to academic advising: Make an appointment with an adviser when required or when in need of assistance Prepare for advising sessions and bring relevant materials Recognize that advising is a shared responsibility and accept final responsibility for all decisions. Become acquainted with available resources, academic policies, procedures, and requirements Core Course Numbering All Core courses are lower-division, 100 -level courses. The middle digit of the course corresponds with the quarter the course is offered: Autumn = 0, Winter = 1, Spring = 2. The last digit represents the designated AoK: 1 = Composition (C) 2 = Natural World (NW) 3 = Individuals and Societies (I&S) 4 = Visual Literary & Performing Arts (VLPA) For example, TCORE 101 is a (C) course offered autumn quarter, TCORE 122 is a (NW) course offered spring quarter.

Along the way we will explore key science topics such as high-energy physics, virology, and genomics. The class draws heavily on the field of the social studies of science and anthropology as its key methods for making sense of science in the 21st century.TCORE 122 Logic, Argument, Science and Truth This course will examine how logic and argument are used as a way to organize and gain insight into knowledge. It is the primary way humans acquire new knowledge and discover truth. This course also examines science, the methods of scientific inquiry, and scientific arguments. Students who master the material in this course should be able to analyze and construct general arguments, including arguments with scientific components. TCORE 124 Introduction to Humanities: Seeking Our Identities The humanities are academic disciplines that study the human condition , using methods that are primarily analytic , critical , or speculative , as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural and social sciences. Examples of the disciplines in the humanities include literature, history, philosophy, religion, film, and visual and performing arts. What does it mean to \"find your identity\" in your social, ethnic, and inner worlds? How do you answer the question, \"Who am I?\" We'll explore these questions throughout the course\u2014in the readings, discussions, and creative projects\u2014 both visual and written. Faculty Core curriculum courses are taught by faculty from a variety of academic programs on campus.

It looks at all major aspects of the justice system from an ecological systems approach rather than a specialization in one narrow content area. The curriculum provides a theoretical understanding of the discipline, combined with an understanding of the scientific method as it applies to criminal justice. The Criminal Justice curriculum will allow students to expand their education by learning to evaluate broader aspects of the criminal justice system and develop theoretical and analytical knowledge and skills.

This includes an emphasis on sensitization of students to the human impact of crime including differential impacts of race/ ethnicity, social class, gender, sexual orientation, religious creed and physical and developmental disabilities.

The prerequisite courses can be taken at UW Tacoma. Please see the major sections for details. How to Apply When Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences is fully enrolled and there are more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, admission will be competitive and applicants will be evaluated on three principal criteria: Appropriateness of academic preparation for the degree program Likelihood of success in the degree program Relationship between the degree program and academic or career plans and opportunities Applicants should submit completed applications by the application deadline for the quarter. Early applications are encouraged. A completed application includes the Application for Transfer Admission, application fee, one official transcript from each college or university attended (and a high school transcript if using high school credit to fulfill admission requirements), a personal statement including life and career goals and how the IAS degree will help advance those goals. Each personal statement is reviewed carefully and is an important component of the IAS holistic admission review. Personal statements should be a reflection of an applicant's best writing. Transferring to UW Tacoma Most of the majors and concentrations in IAS blend well with a broad base of courses in the first two years, similar to what an associate in arts or science degree from a Washington state community college would provide. Psychology and environmental studies majors require specific lower-division course work that should ideally be completed in the first 90 credits towards a degree. Review the individual major/concentration requirements in the following pages to learn more about specific prerequisites.Advising Students are strongly encouraged to meet with a program adviser and faculty adviser early in their careers at UW Tacoma. Advisers can: Help students to select a concentration and determine a plan of study Provide guidance on selection of courses Offer advice about resources available to help students succeed academically Assist students in identifying career and educational goals Help students plan internships and independent studies and apply for graduation. In addition, the IAS program is growing rapidly, and an appointment with an adviser can help determine if new courses are applicable to the student's concentration requirements. IAS Course Prefix Structure Beginning with autumn quarter 2010, IAS will be using different prefixes for many of its courses. This change is intended to make our offerings more transparent and student- friendly. Course titles have not changed\u2014only prefixes and occasionally course numbers. Students should be sure to check course equivalencies and do not register for a course they have already taken . For example, if a student was previously enrolled in Ancient Literature of Western Civilization as TIBCIN 281, then registering for the same title as T LIT 251 would be considered a duplicate credit. Major/concentration requirements have not changed. Equivalencies have been entered into DARS and should be reflected when students run a report. Anthropology .........................

Major in Communication Students in the Communication major gain theoretical knowledge and practical skill in the mass media through an interdisciplinary and multicultural curriculum. Students will learn about the social, cultural, economic, political and historical context within which media operate. This major focuses on the full range of communication media \u2014 including radio, television, newspapers, magazines, film, advertising, public relations and the Internet\u2014and how it pervades every aspect of our society. Students will study the considerable power media wield in mobilizing public opinion, in cutting across the boundaries between private and public life, and the strong role they play in national development. Students have the option of a Research track or a Professional track. Under the Research Track, students take a series of courses in U.S. and international media theory and complete a capstone (a 5-credit Senior Thesis) before graduation. Under the Professional Track, students take a series of courses in either print or broadcast media and complete a capstone (a 5-credit Senior Project) before graduation. Given the Communication major curriculum, transfer students should anticipate needing two years to complete all requirements. Prerequisites Students wishing to declare the Comm- unication major must first complete one of the following 5-credit courses with a minimum grade of 2.0: TCOM 201 Media and Society TCOM 230 Media Globalization and Citizenship Graduation requirements Requires 60 credits total including 50 credits of upper-division course work in major. Professional Track The Print and Television options of the Professional Track take an integrated approach to the study of media criticism and media writing and production. They are predicated on the belief that the development of the practical skills needed to produce and write materials for media outlets such as television, newspapers, magazines, and public relations firms is enhanced through a critical examination of cultural products and an understanding of multiple theoretical frameworks. At the same time, the ability to critique cultural products is furthered through the development of practical skills, since this advances an understanding of various factors that influence how media products are developed and distributed. 5 credits Communication Foundation: One of the following theory and methods courses: TCOM 353 Critical Approaches to Mass Communication TCOM 444 Gender, Ethnicity, Class and the Media Communication Core (List A): 20 credits with a minimum of 10 credits of 300- and 400-level courses required TCOM 201 Media and Society TCOM 230 Media Globalization and Citizenship TCOM 247 Television Studies TCOM 257 Ethical Issues in Mass Communication TCOM 258 Children and Television TCOM 353 Critical Approaches to Mass Communication TCOM 354 Communication History TCOM 388 Russian Media Studies TCOM 430 Global Networks, Local Identities TCOM 440 Advertising and Consumer Culture TCOM 444 Gender, Ethnicity, Class, and the Media TCOM 454 Communications Law TCOM 460 Communication and National Development TCOM 461 Media and Identity in Asia TCOM 470 Documentary Production and Critique TCOM 480 Political Economy of the Media TCOM 481 Communication Regulations and Policy TFILM 272 Film Studies TFILM 348 Film and Human Values TFILM 386 Silent Cinema TFILM 420 Contemporary World Cinema TFILM 474 Russian History and Film TFILM 481 Film Theory and Aesthetics TFILM 483 Film Directors TFILM 484 French Cinema TFILM 485 Media GenresTFILM 486 Feminist Perspectives in Film and Literature T GH 302 Global Imaginations T HISP 376 Latin American Film T HISP 377 Spanish Film T HISP 441 Mexican Cinema and Society Professional Track Core (5 credits) TCOM 275 Writing, Reporting and Editing for the Mass Media Professional Track Courses (List B): 20 credits TTBUS 310 Effective Managerial Communications TCOM 347 Television Criticism & Application TCOM 348 Nonfiction Writing for Television TCOM 349 News Writing TCOM 351 Video Production TCOM 387 Writing for Public Relations TCOM 470 Documentary Production and Critique TCOM 482 Investigative Reporting TCOM 486 Feature Writing for Print Media TWRT 365 Literary Editing and Publishing TWRT 382 Writing Popular Fiction TWRT 387 Creative Non-Fiction Writing TCOM 490 Communication Capstone Internship (5 credits) Natural World: 5 credits: Courses with a TESC prefix or an environmental science transfer course; see adviser for applicable transfer courses Research Track The Research Track, through courses on media criticism and methods, media ethics, media law and regulation, media history, political economy of mass media, international and development communication, film studies, and cultural studies, provides a critical overview of the political, economic, historic, social, and cultural contexts of the mass media.

Major in Environmental Studies For information on the bachelor of science degree in Environmental Science, please see page 81. The bachelor of arts in Environmental Studies offers students an interdisciplinary perspective on environmental problems. While receiving a strong background in environmental science, students will be exposed to a broad range of interdisciplinary course work that examines the legal, economic, social, literary, historical and philosophical perspectives on both local and global sustainability issues. This major will prepare students interested in pursuing diverse and contemporary careers such as environmental law, policy, management, planning and teaching in the public, private, academic and nonprofit sectors. An important component of the Environmental Studies major is a capstone experience that emphasizes service to the community while exposing the student to potential future employers and positions. Two required \"bookend\" seminars, taken by entering juniors and graduating seniors, introduce students to scientific research, writing and funding processes. The senior capstone experience allows students to get practical experience in individual or team research or internship positions. Preparatory courses 25-28 credits depending on where credits were earned. These can be taken at UW Tacoma or transferred from another school.

Overall, 45 upper-division credits and 45 credits of IAS courses are required to graduate. At least 5 credits must be taken from each of the following interdisciplinary areas: VLPA (Visual, Literary and Performing Arts) courses Individuals and Society courses Natural World courses (TESC prefix) To propose an individually-designed concentration, students must do the following: 1. Consult with the concentration coordinator to ensure you understand the requirements of the individually- designed concentration. Continue working with the coordinator throughout the proposal process. 2. Identify the unifying interdisciplinary theme of the concentration. Consider what faculty would be appropriate as mentors and consult with them as needed during development phase. 3. Identify the courses taken or planned. This list should comprise 55 credits, plus the 5-credit thesis. Meet with an IAS academic adviser for assistance. This is essential for transfer students. 4. Draft a two- to three-page proposal that includes a brief descriptive title, the rationale for the proposed concentration, a general description of the concentration, a rationale and discussion of the interrelationships among the courses chosen and a complete course list. 5. Secure the support of at least one IAS faculty member to be the sponsor for the concentration. The faculty sponsor attests to the intellectual soundness of the proposal and agrees to provide whatever guidance she or he and the student may jointly decide is needed. The sponsor may also suggest changes in the previously approved written proposal or list of courses. 6. Choose one IAS staff adviser to work with to help you keep track of your progress towards graduation. 7. Add the Agreement and Declaration page to the proposal and have it signed by the faculty sponsor and academic adviser. 8. Submit the proposal for approval to the concentration coordinator by the end of the junior year. Once your proposal has been approved, continue working with the concentration coordinator, faculty sponsor and academic adviser to ensure the concentration is completed appropriately.

Major in Psychology Psychology is the scientific study of the psychological, biological, and contextual determinants of human behavior. The Psychology major at UW Tacoma is shaped by the concept that psychology is a liberal art as well as a rigorous social science. As a program we value the philosophical, historical and cultural traditions that inform psychology, including feminism, existentialism, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, and critical theory. We are also firmly committed to interdisciplinarity, meaning that students should be able to synthesize material across disciplines. The curriculum is designed for students who plan to work as professional psychologists and thus need a sound preparation for graduate study; for students who plan a career in any field dealing primarily with people, such as nursing, teaching, social work, guidance, and human resources; or for those who desire a well- rounded education and thus need a basic knowledge and understanding of human experience and behavior.

Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences81 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Environmental Science Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences offers five options for studying environmental science: Bachelor of science degree in Environmental Science Bachelor of arts in Environmental Studies (see page 72) Minor in environmental studies Certicate in Restoration Ecology Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Bachelor of Science The bachelor of science degree in environmental science provides students with a strong science background focused on the environmental issues of the future. Through lecture, lab, and field classes, students get hands-on experience with biology, chemistry, the geosciences, physics, and math, and learn how to draw connections between them in order to solve the complex, interdisciplinary environmental problems facing the local community and society at large. The Environmental Science program is embedded in the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, allowing our students to synthesize diverse approaches to the environment in the social sciences and humanities as well. Course work and independent study will allow students to develop the tools needed for scientific research, technical writing and grant preparation. Students are prepared to begin working in the sciences or continue their education upon graduation through a culminating capstone experience that gives students the opportunity to work with a scientist on their own undergraduate research project or to intern with a community group to gain practical experience. Students will be prepared to enter government, academic, private or nonprofit careers, or to continue their education in a variety of scientific disciplines. Two required \"bookend\" seminars, taken by entering juniors and graduating seniors, introduce students to scientific research, writing and funding processes. The senior capstone experience allows students to get practical experience in individual or team research or internship positions.Admission Requirements The Environmental Science program considers applications for admission from students with more than 45 college-level credits.

The Nursing program focuses on the discovery and dissemination of knowledge that promotes health. The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service within a community of learners. Partnerships with the community assist the program in providing learning environments in which learners build upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their understanding of local, national and global health issues. Philosophy of Undergraduate Education The Nursing faculty believes that the purpose of university-based undergraduate nursing education is to prepare professional nurses whose practice is informed by theory and research. The philosophy of the undergraduate curriculum is rooted in values of excellence, diversity, community, social justice, integrity and creativity. Preparation for the various roles in practice requires knowledge of the arts and sciences, together with content and processes foundational to the discipline. An interdisciplinary emphasis engages students in a broad range of ideas and knowledge. Ultimately, professional nursing requires a commitment to scholarly inquiry, social equity, advocacy and life-long learning. Program Overview The BSN curriculum focuses on critical thinking, responses to health and human functioning, nursing intervention and person-environment interaction within a context of cultural diversity. The curriculum also includes all the essential elements of baccalaureate education for professional nursing practice as defined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). An interdisciplinary emphasis encourages an understanding of a broad range of ideas, knowledge and methods of study. Most students in the UW Tacoma Nursing program are employed in a variety of health- care settings, so courses are scheduled to enable students to continue employment while enrolled in the program of study. A BSN from UW Tacoma enhances the graduate's ability to contribute to his or her community's institutions and to the health of citizens of Washington state, particularly during this period of rapid change in health care. Accreditation As part of the top-ranked University of Washington School of Nursing at the Seattle campus, UW Tacoma's Nursing program shares accreditation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). Program Goals Opportunities are provided to enable the learner to develop professionally and to meet the Nursing program goals, which are for graduates to: Integrate concepts from the Arts and Sciences in promoting health and managing complex nursing care situations.

Reasonable Accommodation for Disabilities The Nursing program is committed to ensuring that otherwise qualified students with disabilities are given equal access through reasonable accommodations to its services, programs, activities, education and employment for students with disabilities. The Nursing program works closely with Disability Support Services (DSS) in this process. DSS is the contact point for students with permanent or temporary sensory, physical or psychological disabilities interested in requesting reasonable accommodations due to the effects of a disability. Students who wish to request reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact DSS to start the process for documenting their disability and determining eligibility for services prior to the start of the program. While this process can be started at any time, reasonable accommodations may not be implemented retroactively so being timely in requesting accommodations is very important. The university does have policies regarding the documentation required in order to diagnose different disabilities and a process for requesting accommodations. To learn more about the process for establishing services, please contact Disability Support Services at 253-692-4522 (voice), 253- 692-4493 (TTY), 253-692-4602 (FAX), or dssuwt@u.washington.edu . Students with disabilities are expected to perform all the essential functions of the program with or without reasonable accommodation. The Nursing Program will work with the student and the respective campus disability office to provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations. While the Nursing program will make every effort to work with our students with disabilities to accommodate their disability-related needs, it is important to note we are not required to provide requested accommodations that would fundamentally alter the essential functions or technical standards of the program.

This program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the social, economic, historical, environmental and political processes and issues affecting urban areas. Overview The course of study explores both the theoretical nature of societies and the practical application of becoming actively involved in the process of change or improvement. Course topics include society and culture, housing, urbanization, environment, planning, race and poverty, and economic development and sustainability. All of these can be enhanced by field experience, internships, study-abroad programs and community service or research projects. A strong research component is required so the application of theory may be tested in a real-world situation. This prepares strong graduates to enter the workforce or continue their education with graduate or professional study in fields ranging from planning and design to law, public administration, public policy and education. Students who complete the program may qualify for a wide variety of jobs in the public and private sectors including housing, community development, planning, transportation, government or human services. An academic minor or certificate can complement the major so as to broaden students' understanding of topics including nonprofit management, environmental studies, public history, education, human rights, restoration ecology, computing and software systems and geographic information systems (GIS). Students are encouraged to participate in Urban Studies foreign study tours, exchange programs or to have an international focus/ perspective in their course work.Educational Emphasis Urban Studies has built its curriculum around four program goals, which are to: Provide students with a broad understanding of the problems and prospects of our metropolitan areas Equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue careers related to the multi-faceted nature of urban studies Serve as a resource, through service and research, to communities in the South Sound region Guide students to effectively analyze the social and cultural worlds that constitute urban environments Overall objectives of the program: Provide an understanding of the form and function of cities Instill an awareness of problems and issues confronting metropolitan areas Provide an interdisciplinary curriculum that allows students to understand the complex interrelation-ships that make up the urban environment and permits them to approach problems from a variety of perspectives Equip students with the analytical skills needed to undertake research in an urban milieu Learning outcomes: Approach urban issues from an interdisciplinary perspective Apply analytic and quantitative skills to assess and develop strategies to analyze and resolve urban issues Compare and contrast approaches used in designing and undertaking research in urban studies Demonstrate effective written and oral communication skills Demonstrate appreciation for the diverse nature of urban populations and the social justice issues many of these populations faceBACHELOR OF ARTS Urban Studies Hoffman Adviser: Jill Haugen Minor A minor in Urban Studies is available to undergraduate students in other degree programs.

Working both independently and in small groups, students become skilled in the methods that are commonly used to 1) collect and analyze spatial data, and 2) create maps and other graphical representations of these data. Skills gained during the nine-month course of study are theoretical, analytical and practical, and can be applied in a wide range of academic, municipal, environmental and commercial contexts. Demand for individuals with training in GIS is typically high in industries such as urban and regional planning, research and advocacy, resource management, marketing, and various branches of government. This program is designed primarily for students with moderate to no experience working with GIS. Requirements The GIS Certificate requires 24 credits to include the following (all courses must be completed with a minimum grade of 2.0): TGIS 311 Maps and GIS (6) TGIS 312 Intermediate GIS (6) TGIS 313 Applied GIS and Project Design (3) TGIS 414 Advanced Applications of GIS (6) TGIS 415 Critical Theory and GIS Practicum (3) Admission Admission to the GIS certificate program is competitive. Students must complete a separate application in the form of an online survey. Because it is a year-long program, students are only admitted to the program once per year and must begin in autumn quarter.

Check with an IAS adviser to learn more about this certificate. The University of Washington Restoration Ecolog y Network (UW-REN) was established to prepare students to meet the multidisciplinary challenges in the field of ecological restoration. Effective restoration requires the interactive efforts of experts from many disciplines, as illustrated below. UW- REN offers students from any UW program the opportunity to obtain a certificate of academic experience in Restoration Ecology. This program provides students with a substantial background in restoration ecology within the context of their degree program. The REC is not associated with a degree program. It demonstrates to employers and funding agencies that a fundamental training in restoration ecology, including a one-year, team-based restoration project has been completed. Study ranges from theory to practice to provide students with skills necessary to participate as effective team members or to lead challenging restoration projects. Requirements The Restoration Ecology certificate requires a minimum of 25 credits . All courses must be completed with a minimum grade of 2.0. TESC 362: Introduction to Restoration Ecology (7 credits) This is a 300-level course offered at UW Bothell and UW Tacoma. UW Seattle's equivalent course is EHUF 473. Restoration-related courses (10 credits) Students must complete 10 credits of restoration-related courses from an approved list of courses that is available on the UW-REN website at http://depts. washington.edu/uwren . Courses not on the list can be petitioned to the UW- REN director. UW-REN Senior Restoration Capstone TESC 462 (2 credits) TESC 463 (3 credits) TESC 464 (3 credits) The capstone consists of a three-quarter, 10-credit sequence of courses that take place during the fall-winter-spring quarters. In the capstone, students participate in a hands-on restoration project from design, analysis, and implementation to developing a monitoring plan, all within a multidisciplinary teamwork setting.137 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Graduate Credits Taken as an Undergraduate University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate work and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to the Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. For example, a student admitted for autumn quarter may take graduate credits during the preceding spring quarter. This registration and these arrangements must be approved by the graduate program that the student will enter. However, students so enrolling are not reclassified as graduate students until the baccalaureate degree has been granted and after their official admission. At that point, it is necessary to petition to permit the six credits to apply toward the master's degree. Only under these circumstances may graduate work taken as an undergraduate be applied toward an advanced degree. Further registration for graduate work is contingent upon completion of the requirements for the bachelor's degree. Graduate Nonmatriculated Students Graduate nonmatriculated (GNM) is a classification for post-baccalaureate students who are not seeking a graduate degree at the time of registration. While a student does not need GNM status to register for a graduate-level class, a student must have it in order to apply the credits to a graduate degree at the University of Washington should the student later be admitted as a matriculated graduate student. GNM status is granted by the individual graduate program. A minimum GPA of 3.0 in the last 90 quarter (60 semester) graded credits is required for consideration. A student who is later admitted to the Graduate Graduate Policies and Graduation School may apply a maximum of 12 applicable GNM credits (or any combination of GNM and up to six approved transfer credits, totaling 12 credits) toward a master's degree. Admission into the GNM status does not confer priority for or guarantee of later admission into the Graduate School to pursue a degree. Applicants for GNM status must contact the academic program directly for application information. Not all programs choose to offer GNM status. Programs will advise students regarding the status and provide instructions, application forms and program requirements to appropriate candidates. Failure to register for any quarter except summer quarter will result in loss of GNM status. Once GNM status has been lost, the application process must be repeated in order to be readmitted as a GNM student. The transcripts and other student records from the prior records can be forwarded to supplement the new application. GNM students pay fees and tuition at the regular graduate-student rate based on residency of the student including the Student Services and Activity Fee and the Technology Fee. GNM students are not eligible for financial aid because most financial aid is governed by federal regulations that require students to be enrolled in degree programs. Students will be assigned a UW student number and receive a student identification card that entitles them to all privileges and access to facilities that are extended to matriculated students. Visiting Graduate Students A student who wishes to enroll in a graduate program at the University of Washington Tacoma and who intends thereafter to return to another graduate school in which he or she is working toward an advanced degree may be admitted as a visiting graduate student. This admission is contingent on available space and facilities. Such a student must have been officially admitted to another recognized graduate school and be in good standing and currently pursuing a graduate degree. Admission to the University of Washington Tacoma, as a visiting graduate student does not guarantee admission to any particular course of study. A visiting graduate student is permitted to register only in those courses for which he or she is judged to be eligible by a faculty adviser or the instructor of the course and if space is available to accommodate registration. Further details regarding application and other relevant policies may be obtained from the appropriate program office at UW Tacoma or online at www.grad.washington. edu. Transfer Credit A student working toward a master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of six quarter credits of graduate level course work taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petition must include a written recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating completion of the course work. Transfer credits are not entered on the UW transcript. University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate degree and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program that has admitted the student must approve registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the Graduate School, must file a petition with the Dean of the Graduate School to transfer the six credits. The student must also provide a letter from the Office of Graduate Policies and Graduation138 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma the graduate program. Graduate School Memorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses. With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum 10 credits per quarter of any combination of courses numbered 600, 700 or 800. Graduate Student On-Leave Status Graduate students who do not maintain continuous enrollment (summer quarter excepted) must file a petition for on-leave status with their program office. To be eligible for on-leave status, the student must have registered for, and completed, at least one quarter and be in good academic standing. An on-leave student is permitted to use the University Library but is not eligible for other university privileges. On-leave status forms are available from the program office. A $35 fee is charged for each petition filed. Students who are registered for any portion of a quarter may not go on leave for that quarter unless they officially withdraw at the Office of the UW Tacoma Registrar prior to the first day of the quarter. On-leave status can be granted for up to four quarters. On-leave graduate students returning to the university on or before the termination of their authorized periods of leave need only register using MyUW for the quarter they want to return. Re-admission A student previously registered in the Graduate School who has failed to maintain graduate student status but who wishes later to resume graduate studies must apply online to be re-admitted. If the student has attended any other institution during the period when not registered at the University of Washington, official transcripts in duplicate of the student's work must be submitted. An application for re-admission carries no preference and is treated in the same manner as an application for initial admission, including the requirement of payment of the application fee. Students are required to meet the program requirements in place at the time they are re-admitted. The Graduate School normally allows six years to complete requirements for a master's degree. Periods spent on leave or out of status are included. Graduation Requirements for the Master's Degree It is the responsibility of each graduate degree candidate to meet the following Graduate School minimum requirements (plus any additional requirements that may be specified by the program in which the master's degree is being earned; see item 7): 1. Under a thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits (27 course credits and a minimum of nine credits of thesis) must be presented. Under a non-thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits of course work is required. 2. At least 18 of the minimum 36 quarter credits for the master's degree must be for work numbered 500 and above. (In a thesis program, nine of the 18 must be course credits and nine may be for Master's Thesis [700].) 3. Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of course work taken at the University of Washington Tacoma. The Graduate School accepts numerical grades in approved 400-level courses accepted as part of the major and in all 500-level courses. The student must earn a minimum grade of 2.7 in each class in order for it to be counted. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for a graduate degree at the university. 4. The residence requirement for the master's degree is one year (three full-time quarters). Students registered for fewer than 10 credits per quarter may add part-time quarters together to achieve the equivalent of one full- time quarter (10 or more credits) to be applied toward fulfilling residence requirements. However, excess credits beyond 10 may not be subtracted from one quarter and added to another. Once a student is admitted to a graduate degree program, a full quarter of residence is granted for any quarter in which at least 10 credits in approved courses, research, thesis, or internship are satisfactorily completed. 5. In a thesis degree program, a thesis, approved by the supervisory committee, must be submitted to the Graduate Autumn Winter Spring Summer Business (M.B.A.) May 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Computing and Software Systems (M.S.)

Graduate Student Policies The following section contains detailed information concerning policies and procedures relating to graduate students and graduate studies. Students should verify all information with the program adviser of the individual academic program or appropriate staff. For more information on the UW Graduate School and graduate student policies, please visit the Graduate School website at www. grad.washington.edu. Graduate Courses Graduate courses are intended for\u2014and ordinarily restricted to\u2014either students enrolled in the Graduate School or graduate nonmatriculated students and are given numbers from 500 to 800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to both graduates and upper- division undergraduates. Such courses, when acceptable to the supervisory committee and the specific academic program, may be part of the graduate program. The Graduate School accepts credit in approved 300-level courses for the minor or supporting fields only. Courses at the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade point average (GPA) and will not apply toward the minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's degree. Approved 400-level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting fields. Courses numbered 490 and titled Special Topics and Special Projects normally are not applicable to a graduate degree program if addressed primarily to introductory content and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research (499) is not accepted as part of Graduate Policies and Graduation139 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma School. A student must register for a minimum of nine credits of thesis (700). With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of nine credits per quarter of thesis (700). 6. A final master's examination, either oral or written, as determined by the student's supervisory committee, must be passed if it is a program requirement. 7. Any additional requirements imposed by the graduate program adviser in the student's major department or by the student's supervisory committee must be satisfied. A master's degree student usually takes some work outside the major department. The graduate program coordinator in the major department or the student's supervisory committee determines the requirements for the minor or supporting courses. 8. The graduate student must apply for the master's degree within the first seven weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects the degree to be conferred. See Graduate Degree Application Process below. 9. The graduate student must maintain registration as a full- or part-time student at the university for the quarter in which the degree is conferred. A student who does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the following quarter. 10. All work for the master's degree must be completed within six years. This includes quarters spent on leave or out of status and applicable work transferred from other institutions. 11. A student must satisfy the requirements for the degree that are in force at the time the degree is to be awarded. Graduate Degree Application Process Students must submit master's degree requests on the web. Students may submit a request from the first day of the quarter they expect to graduate until the Sunday (midnight Pacific Time) of the ninth week of the quarter they expect to graduate. If degree requirements are not met in the requested quarter, they must submit another degree request for the quarter in which they expect to complete requirements. Master's degree request schedule Your department may require an earlier request submission date, please consult your department.Autumn/winter/spring quarters: Weeks 1-9 are considered as filing the Request on time Weeks 10-11 the request system is closed and no requests are accepted. The next option is to graduate during the following quarter. Summer quarter: Weeks 1-7 are considered as filing the Request on time Weeks 8-9 the request system is closed and no requests are accepted. The next option is to graduate during the following quarter. Completing the master's degree request When completing the master's degree request, the program will automatically run a degree audit to inform the students of any unsatisfied Graduate School requirements. Students will receive an email confirming receipt of their master's degree request and the students' departments are notified through MyGradProgram that a request has been submitted. Authorized departmental users enter department contingencies into MyGradProgram and can elect to send an email to the students to notify them of the departmental contingencies. Authorized departmental users will print the master's degree warrants and the warrants will be routed to the students' master's committees in a manner determined by the department. By signing the master's degree warrants, the students' committees certify that the students have met all departmental requirements for the degree (except the thesis if one is required) and the warrants must be placed in the students' department file. Once the warrants have been signed, the authorized departmental users will recommend whether or not the students are to graduate that quarter and these recommendations are conveyed to the Graduate School through MyGradProgram by the Sunday (midnight Pacific Time) following the end of the quarter. Emails are sent to the students notifying them that their departments have made a recommendation on their request. Once the Graduate School receives the degree request recommendation, a final transcript audit and a review to determine if all Graduate School and department contingencies are met, will be completed by Graduate School staff. The Graduate School enters the final graduation decision into MyGradProgram, email notifications are sent to the students informing them of their graduation status, and authorized department users can view their quarter graduation list in MyGradProgram. Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of spring quarter. Information on participating in the commencment ceremony is posted on the Commencement website at tacoma. washington.edu/commencement . Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed to the student.

Program Design The 72-credit, non-thesis MBA degree has two components: Core courses Elective courses The core curriculum (56 credits) addresses key areas of business knowledge via the core courses, which focus on finance, accounting, marketing, operations, ethics, human behavior, and business strategy. Perspectives on international business are integrated across these courses, which culminate in a capstone course that offers a comprehensive systems perspective on organizations. These courses also emphasize quantitative and qualitative tools for predicting, planning and managing change. Beyond the core courses, students are required to complete 16 elective credits. The choice of electives will depend on the students' career and educational goals. Students can create a profile of elective courses that allows them to gain additional business knowledge. Elective courses also can be taken outside of Business from other UW Tacoma graduate programs. Enrollment and Classes The UW Tacoma two-year MBA allows students to continue in their careers while they develop new managerial knowledge and skills. In the average quarter, an MBA student will enroll in two courses (8 credits) of study. Students may complete their degree on a year- round basis in two years (including summers) or extend to three or more years. Classes meet primarily on weekday evenings and some Saturdays; many incorporate Internet components. Online assignments and discussion offer flexibility while keeping students connected to the faculty and their classmates. Courses integrate current conceptual and practical knowledge while building analytical and interpersonal skills. As a result, the curriculum is immediately relevant to practicing managers. Elective Credits A minimum of 8 graded elective credits must be completed in Tacoma MBA elective courses numbered 500 and above. The remaining elective credits can be completed via Tacoma MBA elective courses, credits from other UW graduate degree programs, transfer credits, or some combination of these as discussed in the policies below.No more than eight credits of TBUS 569, Analytical Research, may be applied toward the MBA degree. Transfer Credits from Other Institutions An admitted MBA student may petition to transfer up to the equivalent of 12 quarter credits of graduate business course work from an AACSB-accredited institution. Graduate credits that have been applied toward a completed degree cannot be transferred. Applicants may petition by sending a letter to the graduate program adviser. The petition should identify the courses requested for transfer credit and, for each course, clearly articulate how the course content contributes to the objectives of the UW Tacoma MBA curriculum. Petition requests will not be evaluated until an official transcript is received by the Milgard School of Business. Written petitions for transfer credits completed prior to admission to the MBA program must be submitted during the first two quarters of enrollment in the MBA program (Autumn or Winter quarter). Enrolled UW Tacoma MBA students who take courses at another institution with the intent of transferring the credits should first seek approval from the graduate program adviser. If approved, these students should submit a written petition to transfer credits within one academic quarter of completing the course at another institution (e.g. petitions to transfer summer credits must be received by the end of autumn quarter). Only grades of \"B\" or higher may be transferred. Course work that duplicates the content of required courses in the MBA curriculum will not be accepted for transfer elective credit. Petitions are reviewed by the Graduate Committee and a letter is mailed to the address of record indicating how many credits, if any, will transfer. Students who transfer graduate credits from another university may be restricted in the elective courses they may take to complete their elective. Details of such restrictions will be included in the reply letter to the petitioning student. All decisions of the Graduate Committee with respect to transfer credits are final. Course Waivers An admitted MBA student may petition to waive up to the equivalent of 12 quarter credits of MBA core courses. Waiver requests must be accompanied by official transcripts and other documentation such as course syllabi or proof of professional licensing where applicable. If a waiver is approved, the petitioner may select an available elective course with the same number of credits to replace the waived course(s). A waiver will not reduce the required credits needed to earn the MBA. Waivers may be granted if the graduate committee concludes that a petitioner has demonstrated proficiency in the course material by prior educational training (e.g., undergraduate major or concentration or graduate degree in a specific field) or professional licensing (e.g., CPA). Waivers will only be entertained for graduate course work completed with a grade of \"B\" or better or undergraduate course work completed with a grade of \"B+\" or better. Students who request waivers may be restricted in the courses they may take to complete their elective. Details of such restrictions will be included in the reply letter to the petitioning student. UW Credits Earned Outside the Tacoma MBA A portion of MBA elective credits may be earned at the University of Washington in other degree programs. Students do not need to petition to ensure these credits apply toward their degrees. The following restrictions apply: 1. At least 8 elective credits must be taken from Tacoma MBA courses numbered 500 and above. 2.

Through innovative pa r t nerships w it h a rea companies, the Institute helps students gain practical work experience and meets continually changing industry needs. The Institute also provides services to attract and support students from diverse educational, economic and ethnic backgrounds. About the Degree Program The master of science degree in computing and software systems (CSS) prepares graduates for careers as database administrators, project managers, software developers, support specialists and systems analysts. Those with a master's degree in computer science typically earn 25 to 30 percent higher starting salaries than those with bachelor's degrees, according to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CSS master's program serves a diverse population of students, from those with significant experience and degrees in the field, to those with non-computing-related undergraduate degrees. By broadening the base of students eligible for the program, the Institute encourages a greater number of undergraduate students to continue their education at the graduate level and to attract an increasing number of nontraditional students who have related work experience and a strong interest in the field. Curriculum The master of science in computing and software systems provides a broad overview of the technologies and theories supporting computing and software systems. The master's program advances the theoretical concepts of computer science from the bachelor's program. In addition, it requires that a student demonstrate the ability to synthesize and apply those concepts outside the classroom. These goals are achieved in three stages: Foundational courses to emphasize theoretical (conceptual) as well as practical (embodied) knowledge. Theory courses that refine critical thinking skills and breadth of knowledge. Thesis, significant capstone design project or course-only option to strengthen confidence, leadership ability and communication skills. Students completing the M.S. degree will attain the following competencies: Familiarity with the software development life cycle, both in theory and application. Skill in developing distributed and Web-based applications, along with the ability to learn new technologies rapidly. The opportunity to learn additional concepts and technologies in greater depth, through a capstone project. A foundation for self-directed learning to stay at the leading edge of this fast- changing field. Bridge Courses A student may be required to take one or more bridge courses in order to fill gaps in their undergraduate education.

The graduate courses offer opportunities to pursue questions of interest across a wide range of fields, spanning the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences, with special emphasis on the relation of knowledge to public action. What are Interdisciplinary Studies? The concept of interdisciplinary studies is founded on a recognition that the experience of phenomena\u2014such as the public problems of poverty, violence, social justice or environmental degradation\u2014do not come in neatly bounded, disciplinary or professional packages. While disciplinary divisions of labor are convenient and necessary to the efficient pursuit of in-depth knowledge, the application of that knowledge in the sphere of public action requires its broader re- integration with the rich, multidisciplinary dimensions and complexities of actual, live situations. The structure of the master of arts program is highly flexible, building on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise among members of the faculty. A required series of four core courses and a capstone course addresses issues of models, problem formation, evidence, and values. The core courses examine the basic foundations of knowing and acting, making them relevant to diverse areas of specific inquiry. Through electives and a thesis (or master's project), students are encouraged to apply the lessons of the core courses to their own chosen areas of interdisciplinary interest. A broad range of student interests can be accommodated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The program integrates the sociology of knowledge, philosophy, social and political theory, history, cultural studies, anthropology and systems theory to shed light on domains of public action. Examples of possible areas of interest, broadly defined, might include the environment, education, ethnicity, gender, families, arts policy and administration, children and the media, human rights, labor, immigration, trade, development, urban studies, the role of state and local government or international non- governmental organizations.Students will learn: How alternative paradigms or models condition our knowledge of the world and how our choice of potential responses connects to how we perceive things to be organized. How to gain insight into the impact of culture and history on the way certain phenomena come to be defined in the public arena as problems, and how they are variously imagined to be caused or solved in relation to diverse professional and disciplinary claims of ownership over them. How evidence can be justified, generated, evaluated and used with varying degrees of validity within diverse frames of application. How to gain insight into the ways in which values are implicitly or explicitly present in every arena socially deemed to be problematic, and how it may be possible to facilitate communication, negotiations, or trade-offs among and across diverse value frames. What is Public Action? Public action entails a series of determinations that are reached as a result of the following considerations: What is the nature of the problem to be addressed? What mode of analysis is to be employed? What will count as evidence? What values are considered relevant or irrelevant? What options are included or excluded? What outcomes of the action are anticipated or unanticipated? By exploring these questions the master's program becomes a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. The factors to be investigated include: Conceptual models, or paradigms Social, professional and institutional Knopp Faculty Coordinator Samuel Parker Administrator Julie Buffington Graduate Program Adviser Linda KachinskyMASTER OF ARTS Interdisciplinary Studies Various types of data used to support alternative perspectives and decisions How various value frameworks shape perspectives, decisions and actions These factors provide a foundation for knowledge and action in the public sphere. The core course of study in this program may therefore apply to virtually any profession or endeavor in our shared public life, whether one works in a large organization or a one- person shop, whether one seeks knowledge for utilitarian ends or to achieve a richer understanding of the world in which everyone must live and act. M.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies161 | 2010-2011 Catalog | University of Washington Tacoma Program Design The Master of Arts program emphasizes foundations of public action and is a 55-credit master's degree. The curriculum includes: Graduate Research and Writing 5 credits Four core courses ...................... 24 credits Capstone course ........................ 6 credits Electives ..................................... 10 credits Final project or thesis ............... 10 credits Graduate Research and Writing Introduces skills to understand published research and to formulate research questions. Includes advanced work in discipline-specific rhetorical strategies and analysis of complex readings. Core Courses The four core courses are closely integrated, constituting a single, extended investigation of how issues and problems are evaluated in the process of taking action. The courses examine analytical tools and how social and organizational cultures influence the work required in moving toward taking action. TIAS 501 Models and Critical Inquiry TIAS 502 Evidence and Action TIAS 503 Culture and Public Problems TIAS 504 Values and Action Capstone Course Students enroll in the capstone course (TIAS 505) after the completion of the core course series. The capstone provides a forum for re-integrating the separate themes of the four core courses and considering how they can be applied to the students' areas of interest. Area of Emphasis Students will work with a faculty adviser to develop a focus within the student's chosen area of interest. The required 15 credits of electives are to be chosen carefully in consultation with the academic adviser, as stepping stones toward the substance of the thesis or project. In addition to elective courses developed specifically for the master of arts degree, students can select from a wide range of courses offered at UW Tacoma, including some of those offered in other UW Tacoma graduate programs. Undergraduate courses appropriate to the student's thesis topic can be taken as graduate courses by enrolling in them as TIAS 590 Independent Study courses. This option requires completion of all the undergraduate requirements, as well as additional work to be negotiated with the instructor that will raise the course demands to graduate level. Thesis or Project The final product of the graduate program must be a thesis or a scholarly project that demonstrates a level of competence equivalent to a thesis. In consultation with faculty, students negotiate specific thesis questions and plans focused on their own chosen goals and areas of interest. It is the student's responsibility to recruit a thesis chair and at least one other reader to constitute a thesis committee. The chair may be the academic adviser or may be someone else whose area of expertise most overlaps with the focus of the thesis or project. Enrollment and Curriculum Sequencing Admission is competitive and is based on space availability in the core courses. Core courses are offered in the evenings, alternating between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday.

For admission, continuation and graduation in their programs, students need to abide by the following specifications for behaviors and abilities. In this document, \"students\" pertains to all UW Tacoma Nursing students. Communication Students must communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and their families as well as with other students, staff, faculty, professionals, agency personnel, community residents and others relevant to their areas of study. Expression of ideas and feelings must be clear and appropriate. Students must demonstrate a willingness and ability to give and receive feedback. Cognitive Students must be able to reason, analyze, integrate, synthesize and evaluate in the context of the nursing activities of their programs/areas of study. Behavioral/Emotional Students must possess the emotional health required for the full utilization of intellectual abilities, the exercise of sound judgment and the timely completion of responsibilities in their programs/areas of study. Further, students must be able to maintain mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients, students, faculty, staff, other professionals and agency personnel under all circumstances including highly stressful situations. Students must have the emotional stability to function effectively under stress and adapt to environments that may change rapidly without warning and/or in unpredictable ways as relevant to their programs or areas of study. Students must be able to demonstrate empathy for the situations and circumstances of others and appropriately communicate that empathy. Students must acknowledge that values, attitudes, beliefs, emotions and experiences affect their perceptions and relationships with others. Students must be able and willing to examine and change behaviors when they interfere with productive individual or team relationships. Students must demonstrate effective and harmonious relationships with the diverse academic, professional and community environments relevant to their chosen programs of study. Professional Conduct Students must possess the ability to reason morally and practice nursing in an ethical manner. They must be willing to learn and abide by professional standards of practice as well as regulations for professional licensure. Students must demonstrate the attributes of compassion, integrity, honesty, responsibility and tolerance. Motor and Sensory Skills Students need to have sufficient motor function and sensory skills to be able to execute movements and make observations required in the domain of nursing care or nursing activity in their chosen programs/ areas of study. Reasonable Accommodation for Disabilities The Nursing Program is committed to ensuring that otherwise qualified students with disabilities are given equal access through reasonable accommodations to its services, programs, activities, education and employment for students with disabilities. The Nursing Program works closely with Disability Support Services (DSS) in this process. DSS is the contact point for students with permanent or temporary sensory, physical or psychological disabilities interested in requesting reasonable accommodations due to the effects of a disability. Students who wish to request reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact DSS to start the process for documenting their disability and determining eligibility for services prior to the start of the program. While this process can be started at any time, reasonable accommodations may not be implemented retroactively so being timely in requesting accommodations is very important. The university does have policies regarding documentation required in order to diagnose different disabilities and a process for requesting accommodations. To learn more about the process for establishing services, please contact Disability Support Services at 253-692-4522 (voice), 253- 692-4493 (TTY), 253-692-4602 (FAX), or dssuwt@u.washington.edu . Students with disabilities are expected to perform all the essential functions of the program with or without reasonable accommodation. The Nursing Program will work with the student and the respective campus disability office to provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations. While the Nursing Program will make every effort to work with our students with disabilities to accommodate their disability-related needs, it is important to note we are not required to provide requested accommodations that would fundamentally alter the essential functions or technical standards of the program.
