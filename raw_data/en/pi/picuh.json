An observational study in homeopathic, acupunctural and naturopathic medical practices. Journal of Complementary and Integrative Medicine: 2010, 7(1) [Download the PDF](http://postprint.nivel.nl/PPpp3520.pdf) There is a steady increase in patients seeking complementary medicine (CM). Little is known about Dutch CM patients and the extent in which they differ from those of mainstream health care seekers. 1839 consecutive new patients consulting one of 40 CM physicians completed a questionnaire before entering the consulting room. Resulting CM patient data was compared with that from 2784 mainstream general practice patients. Differences in patient profiles were tested using multilevel regression analysis. CM patients most often appeared to report general complaints. Half of them consulted a CM physician because they were looking for information and advice from a different angle. One fifth had doubts about mainstream healthcare. The CM patients foremost expected to be treated as a person and to get ample time to talk. The profiles of the patients attending the different types of CM physicians did not differ much. Compared to mainstream patients, CM patients more often appeared to be female and higher educated. We conclude that, contrary to expectations, patients do not consult a CM physician for reasons of disappointment with mainstream GP care. CM consulters primarily appear to seek a physician who takes time and who treats their complaints from a holistic viewpoint. (aut. ref.)
