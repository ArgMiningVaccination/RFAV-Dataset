Besides protecting the body from water loss and microorganism infection, it has an imp ortant cosmetic role. Young and beautiful appearance may have a positive inluence on people's social behavior and reproductive status. Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen is said to have indulged in daily donkey-milk baths, a practice which apparently required over 700 donkeys to accomplish. The a lpha hydroxy acids in the milk is believed to be anti-aging and skin-softening agents. Tang-dynas ty ruler and sole female emperor of China, Wu Zetian, maintained a lifelong interest in skincare formulas. She mixed her \"fairy powder\" (made of carefully harvested and prepared Chinese mothe rwort) with cold water in order to wash her face each morning. The empress was a famed beauty w ell into her old age. The most hair-raising entrant in this list, 16th century Hungarian count ess Elizabeth B\u00e1thory is infamous for being one of the world's irst documented female serial kil lers. Most of her life is shrouded in mystery and legend\u2014the most famous story being that she woul d regularly bathe in the blood of her female victims. Mary, Queen of Scots, the ill-fated and attractive adversary of Elizabeth I, spent her sixteenth-century happier days on her estate in Edinb urgh, Scotland, where her beauty regimen was said to include white-wine baths. In addition to wi ne's antiseptic alcohol content, it was also was thought to improve complexion in general. Cr\u00e8me C\u00e9leste, a favorite product of empress Elisabeth (Sisi) of Austria, was a concoction of sperma ceti (a wax found in the head of sperm whales), sweet almond oil, and rosewater. She would apply this daily and at night, she was known to coat her face in raw veal and crushed strawberries, ke pt in place with a custom-made leather mask. The skin folds are indicative of an aged personal ity, but not youthfulness. So, everyone wants to look younger for whole of the life, which lead to the discovery of many surgical and non- surgical treatment modalities to improve the youthfulness. Sinc e the introduction of Botox in 2002 after FDA approval more aesthetic procedures using Botox w ere performed by aestheticisms involving plastic surgeons and dermatologists. However, many sc ientists are now starting to view physical aging as a disease process. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in aging reveal an intricate series of signals, markers, and pathways, all of w hich are programmed to monitor and control the lifespan of a cell as it ages. By studying these mo lecular events and pathways, the ield of anti-aging will be furthered by the of more and Strategies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113As the most voluminous organ of the body that is exposed to the outer environment, the skin suffers from both intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors. Skin aging is characterized by features such as wrinkling, loss of elasticity, laxity, and rough-textured appearance. This aging process is accompanied with phenotypic changes in cutaneous cells as well as structural and functional changes in extracellular matrix components such as collagens and elastin. With intrinsic aging, structural changes occur in the skin as a natural consequence of the biological changes over time and produce a c ertain number of histological, physiological, and biochemical modiications. Intrinsic aging is determined ge netically (inluence of gender and ethnic group), variable in function of skin site, and also inluenced by hormonal changes. Visually it is characterized by ine wrinkles. By comparison, \"photoaging\" is the term used to describe the changes occurring in the skin, resulting from repetitive exposure to sunlight. The histologica l, physiological, and biochemical changes in the different layers of the skin are much more drastic. From a mechanical point of view, human skin appears as a layered composite containing the stiff thin cover layer pr esented by the stratum corneum, below which are the more compliant layers of viable epidermis and dermis an d further below the much more compliant adjacent layer of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Upon expos ure to a strain, such a multi-layer system demonstrates structural instabilities in its stiffer layers, wh ich in its simplest form is the wrinkling. These instabilities appear hierarchically when the mechanical strain in the skin exceeds some critical values. Their appearance is mainly dependent on the mismatch in mechanical pr operties between adjacent skin layers or between the skin and subcutaneous white adipose tissue, on t he adhesive strength and thickness ratios between the layers, on t heir bending and tensile stiffness as well as on the value of the st ress existing in single layers. Gradual reduction of elastic ibers in aging signiicantly reduces the skin's ability to bend, prompting an up to 4-fold reduction of its stability against wrinkling, thereby ex plaining the role of these ibers in skin aging. Anti-aging medicine is practiced by physicians, scientists, and researchers dedicated to the bel ief that the process of physical aging in humans can be slowed, stopped, or even reversed through existing medical and scientiic intervent ions. This specialty of medicine is based on the very early detection and prevention of age-related diseases. Physicians practicing anti- aging medicine seek to enhance the quality of life as well as its len gth, limiting the period of illness and disability toward the end of one's life. Anti-aging medicine encompasses lifestyle changes (diet a nd exercise); hormone replacement therapies, as needed, determined by a physician through blood testing (DHEA, melatonin, thyroid, human growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone); antioxidants and vitamin supplements; and testing protocols that can measure not only hormone levels and blood chemistry but every metabolic fac tor right down to the cellular level (Figure 1).2ABSTRACT Figure 1: Evergreen Monica Bellucci [227,228]. One of the hottest Italian beauties, although she is 54 years old, starts taking a cold shower to the day. Cold shower, the skin maintains the elasticity and argues that tightens. She uses thermal water and revitalizing spray for her face. The actress is totally against all sorts of plastic surgery, but don't forget to constantly clean and moisturize the skin. She says, noting that eating and drinking can be anything, the main thing in small amounts and never blame themselves for the food. She never denied that sport is important for health and toned gure. Drinking plenty of water is another good thing that Bellucci follows as her regular activities.06 Electromagnetic 1; Strategies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113Skin aging is a complex biological process inluenced by a comb ination of endogenous or intrinsic and exogenous or extrinsic factors. Because of the fact that skin h ealth and beauty is considered one of the principal factors representing overall \"well-being\" and the perception of \"health\" in humans, several anti-aging strategies have been developed during the last years. In contrast to thin and atrophic, inely wrinkled and dry intrinsically aged skin, premature photoaged skin typically shows a thickened epidermis, mottled discoloration, deep wrinkles, laxity, dullness and roughness. Gradual loss of skin elasticity leads to the phenomenon of sagging. Slowing of the epidermal turnover rate and cell cycle lengthening coincides wi th a slower wound healing and less effective desquamation in older adults. This fact is important when esthe tic procedures are scheduled. On the other side, many of these features are targets to product application or pr ocedures to accelerate the cell cycle, in the belief that a faster turnover rate will yield improvement in skin appe arance and will speed wound healing. A marked loss of ibrillin-positive structures as well as a reduced cont ent of collagen type VII (Col-7), may contribute to wrinkles by weakening the bond between dermis and epidermis of extrinsically age skin. Sun-exposed aged skin is characterized by the solar elastosis. The sparse distributio n and decrease in collagen content in photoaged skin can be due to increased collagen degradation by various ma trix metalloproteinases, serine, and other proteases irrespective of the same collagen production. The ove rall collagen content per unit area of the skin surface is known to decline approximately 1%/year. Glycosaminog lycans (GAGs) are among the primary dermal skin matrix constituents assisting in binding water. In photo-a ged skin, GAGs may be associated with abnormal elastotic material and thus be unable to function effectively. The total hyaluronic acid (HA) level in the dermis of skin that age intrinsically remains stable; however, epiderm al HA diminishes markedly. Decreased estrogen levels may play a role in skin aging in women and compounds sti mulating estrogen receptors could potentially counteract some of the visible signs of aging. As people live l onger, women spend a larger portion of their lives in a post-menopausal state, with a deiciency of estrogen as compa red to their younger selves. Changes in diet and increasing exercise, together with a regimen of antioxidants, n utritional supplements, and growth factors, can alter how the genes express themselves. Both factors can greatl y enhance the healing capability of the skin and can improve the results of cosmetic surgeries (Figure 2). Figure 2: Desired effect of anti-aging Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h Strate gies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook101134.1. The aging processes Aging can be viewed as the accumulation of changes in cells and tissues resulting from a greater disorderliness of regulatory mechanisms that result in reduced robustness of the organism to encountered stress and disease. The notion of greater disorderliness in agi ng is illustrated by the erosion of the orderly neuroendocrine feedback regulation of the secretion of luteini follicle hormone (ACTH) and growth ho rmone (GH). These changes are manifested as menopause, andropause, adrenopause, and somatopau se. Skin aging is part of the slow decline in appearance and function that appears to be attribute d in large part to the drastic decline of hormones in the body after adulthood. At the cellular level, se veral processes are involved in the physiology of aging and the development of some age-related diseases. The process of apoptosis signiies the process of nontraumatic and noninlammatory cell death. Dysregulation o f apoptosis has been implicated in the increased incidence of cutaneous malignancies that are more pre valent in older individuals, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma . Cell senescence limits cell divisions in normal somatic cells and may play a central role in age-related diseases. Telomeres are thought to play a role in cellular aging and might contribute to the genetic back ground of human aging and longevity. It has been speculated that the limited proliferation potential of hum an cells is a result of the telomere shortening that occurs during DNA synthesis at each cell division. Photoag ing may accelerate the shortening of telomeres and push cells into senescence sooner. That could be the reason why various growth factors may affect the speed and quality of wound healing. Biochemical insults also arise within aging cells, in part from the action of reactive oxygen species generated and scaven ged incompletely throughout the cell cycle. Aging-associated changes also occur between and among cells via alterations in the intercellular matrix, the intercellular exchange of trophic factors, the release of inla mmatory cytokine mediators, and the degree of iniltration by other associated cell types. In addition, th e quantity and distribution of various growth factors may affect wound healing. Decline of DNA repair in comb ination with loss of melanin increases the risk of photo-carcinogenesis and can also cause the decline of enzymatically active melanocytes (10-20% each decade) that contributes to increased sensitivity to UV ra diation. However, it is not known why free radical damage does not adversely affect all of the body's cell s (e.g., gonadal germ cells) [1] (Figure 3). Figure 3: Schematic representation of pathogenesis of skin Strategies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook101134.2. Factors involved in skin aging S kin aging is a complex biological process inluenced by combi nation of endogenous or intrinsic (genetics, cellular metabolism, hormone and metabolic processes ) and exogenous or extrinsic (chronic light exposure, pollution, ionizing radiation, chemicals, toxins) fac tors. These factors lead together to cumulative structural and physiological alterations and progressive change s in each skin layer as well as changes in skin appearance, especially, on the sun-exposed skin areas [2]. Faci al skin wrinkles can be considered as a marker for intrinsic aging (See wrinkle classiication in Exhibit 1) . The major perceived risk factors are unhealthy eating habits, stress, less exercise, dehydration, diseased sta te and sleeping habits. T hough the main factor responsible for extrinsic aging is UVR [3]. Beyond sun damage f actors such as smoking and atmospheric pollution have also been studied and considered in extrinsic ag ing. Studies have shown a clear correlation between these factors and the appearance of melanosis and wrink les. Both of these factors contribute to aging through a common mechanism called oxidative stress that h as a negative impact on cellular processes, such as DNA replication. In addition to the UV region of solar radiation that contributes to cellular injury, visible radiation has an oxidative effect similar to that of in frared radiation via heat generation. The effects of comorbidities, such as metabolic illnesses common in the eld erly, nutritional deiciencies, and the use of drugs such as corticosteroids, and even cancer treatments, shou ld be assessed by dermatologists attending to skin conditions associated with aging [4]. Good skin conditi on can be maintained to some extent by changes in modiiable lifestyle factors such as smoking and sun screen use [5]. Human skin cells respond to instructions from highly specialized proteins or hormones re ferred to as growth factors. The growth differentiation factor GDF11, a TGF- family member, has been a ssociated with the maintenance of youth phenotypes in different human tissues and organs, and in the sk in has been related to an inhibition of the inlammatory response. The production of elastin and collagen d ermal connective ibers slows, and, with age, the regenerative rates of GAGs become delayed [6,7]. 4.3. Photodamage Chronic repetitive exposure of human skin to solar UV rays caus es marked morphological, histological, biochemical, and biophysical changes that are described as phot oaging. the clinical signs of photoaging are ine and coarse wrinkles, actinic keratoses, solar elastosi s, yellowing, pigmentation disorders olar comedones, telangiectasia, laxity, roughness, and extreme dryness [8]. UV damage can also cause si gniicant changes in some of the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum, reducing its cell cohesion a nd mechanical integrity; the UV radiation also affects the molecular structure of cell proteins and lipid s [4]. According to Leccia et al., 2019, at the cellular level DNA damage is the main event following UV exposu re. The kind of lesions produced depends on the wavelength and the energy proile of the radiation, with different photoproducts being formed as a result. Although endogenous DNA repair mechanisms are somewha t effective in repairing DNA, some DNA damage persists and can accumulate with chronic exposure [9 ]. Through ROS formation, UVB induces a ctivator protein-1 (AP-1) overexpression along with the upreg ulation of collagen-degrading enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Figure 4). Overall, UVB stimulates collagen degradation and inhibits procollagen biosynthesis resulting in loss of collagen content and wrinkle formation, thus inducing skin photoaging, as reported by Karapetsas et al., 2019 [10]. S un damage also creates a state of chronic inlammation, with the release of proteolytic enzymes by the in lammatory system, disrupting the dermal Exhibit 1: Pierard Classi cation of Wrinkles [26]. develop and non-exposed skin, disa ppear with skin traction, change in orientation with body postu re, and are due to atrophy of the extracellular matrix.

UV protection strategies, such as sunscreen use, ar e important in limiting further DNA damage [9]. E xposure to UV radiation is the primary factor of extrins ic skin aging; it accounts for about 80% of facial aging [11] (Figure 4) ( Exhibit 2). Effects of UVR on the Dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) in vit ro: UVR can signiicantly modulate sWAT metabolism. This effect is observable not only in chronica lly sun-damaged human skin, but even after a single UV exposure of a non-damaged skin. Free fatty ac id and triglyceride content in sWAT of sun-exposed skin (forearm) is signiicantly lower than in the b uttocks (sun-protected area) of the same subjects. At the same time, young subjects did not demonstrate such differences, which points to the UV- induced effect and not just to the regional variations in fat m etabolism. Additionally, both chronic and single UVR exposure signiicantly reduces master adipogenic fac tors such as peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR); this reduction was rapid and rema ined stable for at least 72 h after acute Figure 4: A model proposed to explain the mechanism of infl ammaging in skin [11].

(B) Repeated UV radiation over-activates the complement system, causing damage to the dermis-epidermis j unction, on which they deposit, and macrophages are overburdened with oxidi zed lipids. Overburdened macrophages release proinfl ammatory cy tokines and ROS, the former of which cause chronic infl ammation and lon g-term damage to the dermis, while the latter triggers the oxid ative stress- induced damages to the dermal extracellular matrix.

From this point of view dWAT content correlates w ith a much more pronounced extrinsic aging process in the dorsal hand comparing to the palm area. Ch ronological skin aging demonstrates similar but not as pronounced differences in aging processes in palmar and dorsal regions of the hand. This can be an indication that UVR accelerates the processes of skin agi ng, whereas their basic components are determined by some other factors, one of which could be the loc al dWAT content. This can make skin aging not only body area dependent, but also spatially heterogeneous in the same body area, since dWAT can have a spatially heterogeneous structure (Figure 5). 4.4. E nvironmental factors beyond UV radiation Infrared radiation and heat: Visible light (400-740 nm) and IR radiation have long been considered to minimally impact the skin, apart from the heat sensation provided by IR radiation [12]. IR radiation accounts for approximately 40% of the solar radiation energy reaching the earth's surface, subsequently generating heat and increasing skin temperature. IR thermogenic radiation can reach the dermis (65%) and hypodermis (10%), and its capacity to induce metalloproteinase expression in the dermis is well known along with its oxidative role. In human skin, IR radiation and heat can lead to macrophage recruitment like UVR. Heat can induce various cytokines in human skin and was found to increase tropoelastin mRNA and protein expression in the epidermis and in the dermis. Both IR and heat-induced acute stress increase in the number of mast cells and expression of tryptase . Chronic IR and heat exposure each inlammatory cellular iniltration, disrupts metalloproteinases, and alters dermal structura l proteins, thereby adding to skin [13]. Erythema ab igne, a reticulated pattern of erythema and hyperpigmentation, is caused by repeated exposure of direct heat or infrared radiation to a person's skin, often from occupational exposures or use of heating pads [14]. Pollution: The damaging effects of skin exposure to pollutants may result in skin disorders and pathologies, including xerotic skin, sensitive skin, premature skin aging and accelerated aging symptoms, such as wrinkle formation, abnormal pigmentation and skin dryne ss. Pollutants may also be involved in acne, eczema, skin rashes and skin cancers. Prolonged and repetitive daily exposure to high levels of pollutants impairs the skin's natural defense capacity to some extent. Mor eover, some pollutants (e.g., ozone) can induce damage via signal transduction mechanism even when there is no percutaneous penetration to deeper skin layers [15]. There is solid evidence that skin path ologies such as premature aging, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis are associated with pollutant ex posure; all of these skin conditions are also associated with an altered redox status. Some of the most noxio us pollutants that humans are exposed to include ozone (O3), particulate matter and cigarette smoke. Pec orelli et al., 2019 reported that increased levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in the skin, in response to pollutants, likely accelerates skin aging and exacerbates existing skin inlammatory conditions [16]. Whe n ozone exposure precedes UV exposure, Figure 5: Possible role of adipocyte-myo broblast transition in extrinsic aging [78]. Absorption of UV radiation in the skin causes acute enlargeme nt of the dWAT layer. However, upon chronic overexposure to UV radiation, it c auses the depletion of dWAT and a concurrent development of cutaneous brosis, pre sumably through adipocyte-myo broblast transition (AMT). Replacement of dWAT v olume with brosis leads to production of mechanically heterogeneous skin structur es and to the loss of the effective skin volume.012 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h ISBN: 978-81-9430 gies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113there is an enhancement of UV-induced depletion of protective v itamin E from the skin's stratum corneum [17]. Even in indoor conditions, particulate matter (PM2.5) ex posure levels were positively associated with skin aging manifestation. Particles can serve as carriers for o rganic chemicals and metals that are capable of localizing in mitochondria and generating ROS directly in mi tochondria leading to collagen degradation in human skin [18]. In line with this, cosmetic anti-pollution products containing anti-oxidants, but also aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists are effective in re ducing or preventing increase in skin pigmentation [19]. 4.5. Lifestyle-related factors Smoking: It is now well established that smoki ng has an aggravating ef fect on skin aging. Even external exposure to cigarette smoke (secondhand cigarette smoke) premat urely ages the skin [4]. Particularly owing to nicotine, smoking negatively affects the dermal microv asculature and hinders the healing process. It also has a toxic effect on keratinocytes and ibroblasts by increasing the expression of metalloproteins and tropoelastin. Furthermore, smoking increases the expression of small proteoglycans and reduces the synthesis of procollagen. The clinical manifestations of th ese phenomena are pale and wrinkled skin; DNA mutations also result from oxidative effects or toxi c damage [8]. Smoki ng provokes elastosis, telangiectasia, skin roughness, and premature wrinkles on facia l skin due to the vascular constriction of nicotine. A clear dose-response relationship has been observed between smoking and wrinkling [4]. Park et al., 2018 reported that cigarette smoke induces both ROS pro duction (oxidative stress) and autophagy [20]. It has been observed that the skin of smoking addicts at the age of 40 years resembles skin of non- smoking 70-year-old adults. Skin damage due to tobacco smoke is irreversible, where further damage can be avoided by stopping smoking [21]. Wang et al., 2018 reported that application of tobacco extracts to skin and oral ibroblasts in vitro triggered several hallmarks of se nescence including premature cell cycle arrest, oxidative DNA damage, secretion of inlammatory cytokines and M MPs, and downregulation of junction proteins E-cadherin and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, tight junctio n protein) [22]. Sleep: Restricted sleep affects facial appearance negatively and decr eases others' willingness to socialize with the sleep-restricted person [23]. An estimated 5 0-70 million American adults suffer from one or more sleep disorders [24]. Sleep is important for growth and renewal of multiple physiological systems. Oyetakin-White et al., 2015 reported that good sleepers had sig niicantly lower intrinsic skin ageing scores (by SCINEXATM). Sleep deprivation is associated with increased signs of in trinsic skin aging (ine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity), with much slower reco very rates after skin barrier disruption and lower satisfaction with appearance [25,26]. The sleep deprived individuals were noted to have hanging eyelids, swollen eyes, darker circles and more droopy corners of the mouth [24]. Wrinkles occur where fault lines develop in aging skin. Those fault lines may be due to skin distortion resulting from facial expression or may be due to skin distortion from mechanical compression during sleep. Expression wrinkles and sleep wrinkles differ in etiology, location, and anatomical pattern. Compression, shear, and stress forces act on the face in lateral or prone sleep positions (Figure 6) [27]. Diet and nutrition: Rhytides, sagging of skin, and loss of elasticity Figure 6: External forces (including compression, tension, and shear) act on facial tissue in lateral or prone sleep positions [26]. During side or stomach sleeping, facial tissue is subject to shear, compression, and t ensile mechanical forces. The skin is stretched and pulled in all directions with changes in sleep position. These forces become signi cant when we consider the amount of time spent in sleep and sleep position.013 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h Strategies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113are all related to changes in the collagen and elastic ibers o f the skin, which are themselves impacted by diet. Ingestion of sugar, in particular, can accelerate these s igns of aging, as it promotes cross-linking of collagen ibers. This process is accelerated by hyperglycemia. Research indicates that once established, the body is unable to repair these cross-links. With accumulation o f advanc ed glycation end products (AGEs), structural changes in the skin can occur, resulting in increase d stiffness and reduced elasticity. Cook ing processes that lead to higher levels of AGEs include grilling, frying, and roasting. Herbs and spices, such as oregano, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and garlic, as well as su bstances found naturally in certain fruits and vegetables, such as lipoic acid inhibit the production of AGEs [28]. Frequently researched antioxidants such as carotenoids, tocophenols and lavonoids, as well as vitamins (A, C, D and E), essential omega-3-fatty acids, some proteins and lactobacilli have been referred as agents capable of promoting skin health and beauty [29]. The WHO and Food and Agriculture of the UN reports recommend adults to consume at least ive servings of fruits and vegetables per day excluding starch y vegetables [30-34]. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) nonionic surfactants can cause dryness of the skin [35]. Each cleansing agent, even normal tap water, inluences the skin sur face. The increase of the skin pH irritates the physiological protective 'acid mantle', changes the composi tion of the cutaneous bacterial lora and the activity of enzymes in the upper epidermis, which have an acid pH optimum. The dissolution of fat from the skin surface may inluence the hydration status leading to a dr y and squamous skin [36]. Accordingly, in o rder to lowering the skin damage, cleansings with neutral pH and pH close to 5.5 are recommended [37]. 4.6. Systemic morbidities From a biochemical standpoint, chronological aging induces incr eased markers of oxidation, glycoxidation, lipoxidation, and glycation in skin collagen. collagen's cross-linking lysine residues undergo copper-dependent enzyme, converts lysine to allysine at all ages. Recently it has been s hown that allysine is further oxidized to a stable end product, 2-aminoadipic acid. This oxidative change results in signiicant accumulation of 2-aminoadipic acid in collagen of aged skin; increased oxidative end product is also seen in diabetes, renal failure, and sepsis. Obesity and overweight are risk factors for various dis orders, including diabetes [38,39]. Diabetes mellitus (DM): Yoon et al., 2002 reported that elasticity of facial skin was decreased in patients with diabetes. Decrease of the ine lakes of the diab etes patients relect that irritation and xerotic changes are aggravated in skins of diabetic patients [40-45]. D M is among the most common aging-related comorbidities, and the generation of advanced glycation end pro ducts is intimately related to dermal damage since it changes the properties of collagen types I and IV. Cli nically, reductions in lexibility and rigidity and an increase in susceptibility to mechanical stimulation are obs erved [4]. 30-70% of patients with DM, both type 1 and type 2, will present with a cutaneous complication o f DM at some point during their lifetime. The prevalence of ichthyosiform changes of the shins (\"ish sca le\" skin) in those with type 1 diabetes has been reported to be between 25-50%. Xerosis is one of the most common skin presentations (abnormally dry skin) in patients with diabetes and has been reported to be present in as many as 40% of patients with diabetes [38]. Uruska et al., 2019 reported a two-way relations hip between insulin resistance and AGE accumulation in the skin in people with Type 1 diabetes [40] wh ich is related with increased stiffness and reduced elasticity. Moreover, not only collagen, but also elast in, is affected by AGEs, resulting in a reduction of skin elasticity. Pageon et al.., 2014 reported that the imba lance between synthesis and degradation that results from glycation, may contribute to skin aging [41]. Noor dam et al., 2013 reported higher glucose levels are associated with a higher perceived age among non-dia betic subjects also. Several studies have shown that culturing human ibroblasts under hyperglycemic cond itions results in both an increased amount of ROS at a cellular level as well as an increased induc tion of premature cellular senescence which in turn may cause premature skin aging and a higher perceived a ge (Figure 7) [42-44]. Obesity: A hyperglycemic state is common in obesity and is associated w ith peripheral resistance to insulin and a higher risk of glycation [45,46]. Also, Sami et a l., 2015 reported that skin of the patients with massive weight loss is weak due to lower density and thickness of collagen ibers and damage to its elastic 014 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h ISBN: 978-81-9430 57-2-9Skin Strate gies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113ibers. It usually occurs because of damage of collagen and ela stin, which allows for no skin retraction after weight loss [47]. Striae distensae (striae or stretch mar ks) is a common dermatosis in patients with obesity, representing linear atrophic plaques which are created due to tension and skin stretching from expanding fat deposits. Due to excessive sweating and increased friction between skin surfaces, a number of skin infections are more frequent in obesity including oppos itional intertrigo (inlammation-rash in body decrea sed stratum corneum hydration, water loss, higher advanced glycation end-p roducts and decreased dermal collagen iber density compared with normal-weight subjects. These resul ts indicate that the ordinary age-related physiological skin changes seen in the elderly can also occur i n obese-diabetes patients aged in their 40s [49]. Menopause: The effects of estrogen deiciency on the skin are an importan t endogenous cause of aging skin in women. Estrogen's key role in maintaining the skin's st ructural and functional integrity is well established with evidence that shows that estrogens are essenti al for skin hydration, sebum production, improved barrier function of the stratum corneum, and increased collagen and elastin content [50]. Following menopause many women detect a swift commencement of skin aging; skin becomes thinner with decreased collagen content, decreased elasticity, increased wrinkling and increased dryness [51]. Reduced estrogen levels during menopause affect skin components with estrogen re ceptors, particularly in epidermal cells and sebaceous glands. By contrast, androgenic hormone levels do not decline signiicantly during this period Figure 7: ROS-mediated senescence [42]. Besides causing DNA damage and mitochondria dysfunction, OS act ivates p53 that, in turn, induces prooxidant genes and imbalances antioxidant genes induction. Th e set of alterations caused by ROS lead to induction of cell se nescence, which, in turn, can develop both positive and negative effects; miR34a expression increases with aging in many tissues downregulating SIRT1 protein activity (a longevity promoting factor) and PNUT protein (a DNA protecting factor which prevents telomere attrition and is inv olved in g/10.17352/ebook10113[4]. Accordingly, dermal cellular metabolism is inluenced by t he hypoestrogenoemic state of menopause leading to changes in the collagen content, alterations in the concentration of glycoaminoglycans and most importantly the water content. Consequently, changes in these b asic components leads to an alteration in function compatible with skin aging. Changes in the skin collag en leads to diminished elasticity and skin strength. Collagen content may be measured by various methods s uch as direct skin biopsy, skin blister assessment for collagen markers and skin thickness measurement. All these variables indicate a reduction in collagen content following menopause. This may be reversed w ith the administration of estrogen given both topically and systemically. A reduction in hydrophilic gly coaminglycans leads to a direct reduction in water content, which inluences the skin turgor [51,52]. A stud y of elderly males and females has conirmed that administration of topical estrogen increases keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal thickness after only two weeks. In estrogen deicient women skin thickness is r educed by 1.13% and collagen content by 2% per postmenopausal year. Type I an d III skin collagen is th ought to decrease by as much as 30% in the irst ive years after menopause. This decrease in skin thickne ss and collagen content in elderly females correlates with the period of estrogen deiciency rather than c hronological age [51]. The highest loss (of up to 30%) is observed in the irst 5 years, followed by a 1%-2% l oss of collagen annually [53]. Acne scarring: Skin with acne scarring has reduced elasticity due to scar ib rosis and shows a worsened appearance of furrows and wrinkles. Atrophic facial acne scarri ng is a widely prevalent condition that can have a negative impact on a patient's quality of life. The appe arance of these scars is often worsened by the normal effects of aging. Facial aging often exacerbates the eff ects of acne scarring. Inlammation associated with moderate to severe acne can result in dermal collagen and fat loss, leading to atrophic scarring. Both acne scarring and the normal aging process can result in the lo ss of dermal collagen and facial lipoatrophy, such that patients already suffering from the negative impact o f facial acne scarring may ind the appearance of these scars worsening over time as they approach their 40s a nd 50s [54]. Emotional stress and depression: Evidence suggests that chronic psychological stress stimulates the autonomic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, and the hyp othalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis when the body attempts to resolve perceived threats to homeostasis. Prolonged activation of these pathways can result in chronic immune dysfunction, increased production of R OS, and DNA damage, which are known to contribute to the again of skin and other tissues [55]. Maar ouf et al., 2019 reported similar observation of aberrant barrier dysfunction, characterized by decreased epi dermal lipid and structural protein production, decreased stratum corneum hydration and increased t ransepidermal water loss [56]. Liu et al., 2018 reported that early life adversity is associated with both persistent disruptions in the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychiatric symptoms. Glucocor ticoid receptors (GRs), which are encoded by the NR3C1 gene, bind to cortisol and other glucocorticoids t o create a negative feedback loop within the HPA axis to regulate the body's neuroendocrine response to stress. Excess methylation of a promoter sequence within NR3C1 that attenuates GR expression, however, h as been associated with both early life adversity and psychopathology. As critical regulators with in the HPA axis, GRs and their epigenetic regulation may mediate the link between early life adversity an d the onset of psychopathology [57]. 4.7. Hormone and metabolic processes All endocrine glands are affected by the global aging process. A few direct consequences interfere with skin aging. They are mostly related to the declined activity of the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes [58]. The most important endocrine compound produced by the skin is vitamin D, which is a regulator of the calcium metabolism and exhibits other sys temic effects as well. Vitamin D3 and its analogues regulates several physiological processes in the skin -like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of keratinocytes and maintenance of normal skin barri ers and immune system [59]. Extension of health-span in experimental animals and analysis of survival cu rves suggest that in the absence of Growth hormone (GH), aging is slowed down or delayed. The peripheral e ffects of GH are mainly exerted by insulin- like growth factor (IGF), produced by the liver upon GH stimula tion. The circulating IGF-1 is bioavailable and functionally active depending upon its binding with the IGF -binding proteins (IGF-BPs) [60]. Eto Banglades h ISBN: 978-81-9430 57-2-9Skin gies doi: https://dx.doi.or g/10.17352/ebook10113al., 2018 reported severe GH deiciency results in early aging, such as wrinkling and dryness of skin [61]. Hypopituitary adults are usually described as having dry and th in skin, an increase in skin thickness was demonstrated after GH treatment in normal elderly males selecte d on the basis of low IGF-I levels [62]. The progressive decline in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) serum conc entration with age, and conversely its supplementation has not demonstrated pr ominent effects on the skin except on sebum production [58]. DHEA is the major steroid produced by th e adrenal zona reticularis and, in contrast to declines with ageing [63]. DHEA and its sulfate (DHEA-S) are the most abundant steroids in humans whose low levels are relat ed to aging, greater incidence of various cancers, immune dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis [64]. Calvo et al., 2008 strongly suggested the possibility that DHEA could exert an anti-aging effect in t he skin through stimulation of collagen biosynthesis, improved structural organization of the dermis wh ile modulating keratinocyte metabolism [65]. Estrogen, alone or together with progesterone, prevents o r reverses skin atrophy, dryness, and wrinkles associated with chronological aging or photoaging. Estrogen and progesterone stimulate proliferation of supp ress collagenolysis by reducing MMP activity in ibroblasts, thereby maintaining skin thickness. Es trogen maintains skin moisture by increasing hyaluronic acid levels in the dermis; progesterone increases se bum excretion [66]. Several reports suggest positive correlations between the levels of circulating estroge ns and: (1) perceived age, (2) attractiveness, (3) enhanced skin health, and (4) facial coloration in women [6 7]. Topical corticosteroids have been shown to reduce cutaneous CD44 expression, correlated with skin atrophy if there's a CD44 deiciency. Corticosteroids can also induce dermatoporotic changes through modulating gene expression of collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [68]. The corticosteroid-induced atrophy can be one of the most severe forms of skin aging corresponding to dermatoporosis (Exhibits 3,4). 4.8. Other intrinsic issues of aging Anatomical skin sites: Large variations in some skin properties (hydration, transepidermal water loss, epidermal lipids, sebum secretion, and mechanical properties) have been observed with respect to the studied body site. There are also large differences in skin thickness in function of the body site, ranging from very thin on the eyelids to more than 5 mm on the sole of the feet. A regional variation is clearly observed when considering the quantity and composition of lipids in the stratum corneum. Because of thickness and sebum secretion, the viscoelastic properties of the skin is very different at the forehead, nose, and cheeks compared with the forearm [8]. Human skin retains water mostly through the outermost stratum corneum layer. Loss of hydration in aged skin, due to a decline in function of the stratum corneum, results in a sagging and wrinkling appearance [69]. Ethnicity: Campiche et al., 2019 reported that Africans fr om the African continent show delayed signs of aging compared to Caucasians [70]. Facial wrinkles and ne lines appear later in African Americans than in Caucasians and may not appear until late in the ifth or Exhibit 3: Neuroendocrine Receptors Active in the Skin Adrenergic and mineralocorticoid receptors Glutamate receptors Growth hormone receptor Histamine receptors Melanocortin receptors Miscellaneous neuropeptide receptors Miscellaneous receptors Neurokinin receptors Neutrophin receptors Opioid receptors and PTH-related protein receptors PRL and LH-CG receptors Serotonin receptors Thyroid hormone receptors Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 21.

White women self-reported more signs of moderate and severe facial aging than Asian and Hispanic women beginning in the fourth decade. When comparing t he severity of facial features against photo-numeric rating scales, the mean severity of crow's feet l ines was most severe in Fitzpatrick skin type I and least severe in Fitzpatrick skin types IV and V [71] . Asians are a population with various skin phototypes, ranging from type III to IV Fitzpatrick's classiic ation in Chinese and Japanese to type IV and V in Indian and Pakistani people. Chan et al., 2019 reported that As ian skin tends to present post-inlammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, lentigines and freckles, nevus of O ta, and Hori nevus. The main skin diseases reported in Asians are acne, atopic dermatitis, and viral infec tions. Wrinkles and skin thickness, early signs of aging in Caucasians, are less evident in Asian skin. However , pigmentary changes occur earlier [72]. Asian and black skin has thicker and more compact dermis than white s kin, with the thickness being proportional to the degree of pigmentation. This likely contributes to the l ower incidence of facial rhytides in Asians and blacks [73]. Signs of facial aging in individuals with skin of color tend to be most pronounced in the periorbital and midface region with less prominent features of skin aging in the upper third of the face and a decreased tendency toward perioral rhytides and radial li p lines [74]. Darker skin types are better protected regarding sun exposure due to the higher melanin cont ent in their skin. In fair-skinned persons the skin appears severely atrophic with multiple teleangiectasi s and a variety of premalignant lesions such as actinic keratosis, whereas in dark-skinned persons deep furr ows and severe solar elastosis occur Gender: Sugawara et al., 2019 reported caulilower-shaped sebaceous gl ands in male while young females had somewhat more cylindrical and smaller sebaceous gla nds than the young males [76]. There are signiicant morphological differences according to sex: tot al skin thickness is greater for men on most skin sites [58]. Also, increased sebum and decreased skin elast icity were mostly correlated with facial pore development in [77]. Rahrovan et al., 2018 reported SC reh ydration capacity in sun-exposed aged female subjects was signiicantly lower than that of age-matche d male subjects. The skin par ameters of hydration, transepidermal water loss, sebum, microcirculation, pigmentation, and thickness are generally higher in men but skin pH is higher in women [78]. Trojahn et a l., 2015 reported that changes in skin elasticity, wrinkling, sagging, and yellowness seem to be cause d by additional extrinsic ageing in women. Intrinsic ageing has a very strong inluence on facial skin cha racteristics in Caucasian women in general [79]. 4.9. Skin aging prevention and therapy Anti-aging in dermatology primarily focuses on the prevention o f skin aging with UV protection (clothing and sunscreens), free radical scavengers (synthetic or botanic) , and cell-protecting agents such as vitamin B3. For the correction of signs of early skin aging, retinoic a cid derivatives in dermatological prescriptions are the best studied substances. Topical hormonal prescriptions are also an option if UV damage has not been the leading culprit for aging. Chemical peeling leads to a marked increase in collagen formation, the deeper the better. Ingredients in cream preparations can re duce supericial skin folds (polyphenols, amino acid peptides). Modulators of regular pigmentation are im portant for anti-aging preparations [80]. There are no proven effective topical antiaging ingredients/or treatment that completely eliminates the symptoms of skin photoaging, but there are products and treatme nts that can visibly reduce or slow down these symptoms: it is more correct to consider reduction of the appearance of aged skin. Many cosmetic products claim to reduce the clinical signs of photoaged skin; however, there are very few scientiic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies to support these claims. Generally speaking, the quality control testing on ingredients and safety testing a re of good quality, and the used ingredients are mostly safe. However, these ingredients may not be as efic ient as claimed, and the concentrations used in these formulations will not necessarily correspond to an \"ef fective\" concentration. This can be the case with many plant extracts with antioxidant properties [8]. Indee d, product testing may also be warranted by the companies to document claimed eficacy and to support ma rketing. Finally, many antiaging claims are based on in vivo testing on cells or simple skin models but not in vivo on a suficient number of human subjects book101134.10. Cosmetological care Daily skin care: Healthy and functioning skin barrier is important protector ag ainst dehydration, penetration of various microorganisms, allergens, irritants, re active oxygen species and radiation. The skin barrier may be speciically adjusted to allow penetration. For this reason, daily skin care may increase skin regeneration, elasticity, smoothness, and thus temporarily change the skin condition [2]. Protection, prevention, cleansing, and moisturizing are the key components of an effective skincare routine. Because most sun damage results from every day, incidental UV exposure, rather than occasional bursts while on vacation, dermatologists recommend daily use of sunscreens. In general, gel-based and bar cleansers are best for oily complexions, whereas cream or lotion-based ones a re better for normal to dry skin. Moisturizers supply humectant agents, which draw water into the stratum corn eum from the environment and dermis below. Moisturizers also include occlusive agents that act as a barrier to trans-epidermal water loss. In almost all cases, products contain both humectants, like hyalur onic acid, urea, and allantoin, and occlusives, including petrolatum, mineral oil, and lanolin. The classical m oisturizers are used for treating dryness in the photoaged pyrrolodone-5-carboxylic acid and salts, panthenol, amino acids and proteins (collagen and proteins from wheat, rice, silk, soybean, and oat ). More sophisticated peptides and proteins are presently used as moisturizers. It concerns generally more lipophylic quaternary N-alkyl derivatives of proteins or small polypeptides with long side chains (ester binding) to increase the lipophilic character: binding to the horny layer and a better percutaneous absorption . Recently, the use of small peptides, which mimic the amino acid sequence of collagen or enzymes (bio mimetic peptides), has been proposed as moisturizers [58]. Surface-smoothing silicone derivatives or i lmogen proteins such as quaternized proteins or silk, rice and oat, and skin feel agents are used in antiagi ng products. The high adsorption to the skin surface provokes a smoothing of the skin surface an d is at the same time humectant. For a better percutaneous penetration, small fragments of hyaluronic acid were also suggested. Humectants are present in the water phase of a formula; occlusives are in the oil phase. Oil in water formulations tend to be lightweight gels, lotions, and serums and are best suited for n ormal to dry skin. Water in oil formulations may be ointments or creams and offer superior hydration for dry skin [81]. Correct sun-protection: Singer et al., 2019 reported that avoidance of sun exposure at peak times and textile sun protection are important pillars of a modern prophy lactic approach. Besides, antioxidants and DNA repair enzymes may be added to topical sunscreens in order to enhance the protection before and even after sun exposure [82]. The FDA regulates sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication. Currently, 16 UV ilters are listed, 14 organic ilters and two nonorganic ilters, including zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The FDA has changed its guidelines to address broad-sp ectrum sunscreen use, which involves UVA and UVB coverage; water resistance, to indicate the time du ration the sunscreen is effective; and sun protecti on factor (SPF). SPF-30 or higher is recommended and c an be labeled as reducing the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging [83,84].

The most important source of antioxidants is provided by nutrition. To the most known systemic antioxidants belong vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and from the trace el ements copper and selenium. There are also studies demonstrating that vitamins C and E combined with ferul ic acid impart both a sunscreen and an anti-oxidant effect [2]. Aesthetic non-invasive procedures: Noninvasive skin tightening has become one of the most common cosmetic aesthetic procedures being performed today. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) surveys released in 2014 and 2015, ther e has been a 12% increase in the demand for cosmetic procedures, with Americans spending more than $12 billion and having 10 billion procedures in 2014 [85]. A noninvasive device combines multipolar RF and P EMFs and is referred as (MP)2, which stands for \"Multipolar Magnetic Pulse.\" The device was introduc ed for the non-ablative treatment of skin laxity and cellulite [86]. Lee et al., 2014 reported that comb ined multi-polar radiofrequency and pulsed electromagnetic ield device is safe and effective for rejuvena ting aged skin in Korean subjects [87] (Figure 8). Pulsed electromagnetic ields (PEMFs) are induced by short pulses of electrical current that penetrates into the skin and results in the stimulation of molecular and cellular activities. It has been used in medicine for bone growth, wound healing, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Pulsed electromagnetic ields increase collagen iber production by dermal stimulate angiogenesis, leading to wound-healing effects. Radiofrequency (RF) devices remain a dominant technology in the noninvasive management of skin aging, as it is a safe and effective treatment for a broad range of skin conditions. It can induce wrinkle reduction, cellulite improvement, laxity and body, and skin contouring improvement. When radiofrequency is applied by an alternating current, an electric ield is generated, which achieves skin tissues, generating the rmal energy. The heat is not diminished by tissue diffraction or absorption by epidermal melanin and is th en appropriate for treatment of all skin types [86,88]. RF with micro-needling is effective and safe in improving skin laxity and texture. Pairing skincare cosmeceutical products pre- and post-procedure is bene icial as it enhances patient results, patient experience, and reduces patient downtime. Zahr et al., 2019 rep orted that combining the multi-ingredient anti-aging facial moisturizer pre- and post-RF microneedling wa s safe and tolerable for the patients [89] (Exhibit 6) (Figure 9). 4.11. Topical anti-aging preparations Retinoids: Topical vitamin A has the ability to diminish the signs of agi ng by decreasing ine lines and wrinkling. In addition, there is a normalization and enhancemen t of elasticity. Improvement of skin tone and texture is a beneit of vitamin A, which enhances skin lighteni ng when used in conjunction with skin lighteners [90]. The most widely utilized ones include retinol, enzym reactions, all of these are converted ultimately to trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA), which is the acti ve form of vitamin A in skin. Speciically, Figure 8: The Venus Legacy noninvasive skin tightening device. [86,87] The medical device is used in non-invasive body shaping, cellul ite reduction, skin tightening, and wrinkle reduction for the face and body. T he device is powered by (MP)2 technology, which combines Multi-Polar Radio Frequency and Pulsed Electro Magnetic Fields, and features the advanced t echnology that induces lipolysis, allows for increased blood circulation, and stimulates lymphatic drainage in the treatment converted to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenase. And inally, retinaldehyde is oxidized to RA by retinaldehyde oxidase. Retinol and retinal must be metabolized in the skin to the active trans-retinoic acid. The incorporation of retinol and probably also retinal in cosmetic preparations poses the problem of stability (slow oxidation of retinol in function of time) [8,91]. Topical natural retinoic acid precursors such as retinaldehyde or ROL are less irritant than acidic retinoids. Retinoids may be combined with other compounds with complementary actions against ageing, nutritional deiciency and cancer, such as antioxidants, to potentiate their beneicial effects in the skin [92] (Figure 10). The molecular mechanisms by which retinoids improve aged human skin have been dificult to investigate largely due to lack of appropriate in vitro models. Shao et al. , 2017 reported that topical application of 0.4% ROL to aged human skin leads to remarkable skin changes in both epidermis and dermis through affecting three major types of skin cells, epidermal keratinocytes, derma l endothelial cells and ibroblasts. increases epidermal thickness by stimulating epidermal keratinocytes proliferation, which involves c-Jun transcription factor, a major deriving for ce for keratinocyte proliferation. In addition to epidermal changes, topical ROL signiicantly improves dermal EC M microenvironment; increasing dermal blood vessel formation by stimulating endothelial cells prolife ration and ECM production by activating ibroblasts. Topical ROL also stimulates TGF-/CTGF pathway, th e major regulator of ECM homeostasis, and thus increased the deposition of mature collagen in aged human skin in vivo. Additionally, the restoration of dermal ECM may provide a better, more permissive environment fo r the proliferation of dermal endothelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes, and activation of dermal roblasts (TGF-/CTGF pathway). Coupling of the proliferation of keratinocytes and endothelial cells, an d dermal ibroblasts activation forms a self- enforcing environment, which might explain the remarkable anti- aging effects of ROL in aged human skin [93]. Kong et al., 2016 reported that ROL anti-aging effects in clude the inhibition of UV-induction of matrix metalloproteinases, and the promotion of collagen synthesis in photoaged skin.5, 10 In clinical studies, Exhibit 6: Classi cation of Noninvasive Body-Contouring Devices According to Ene rgy Used [89].

Bagatin et al., 2018 reported that treatments with adapalene 0.3% gel and tretinoin 0.05% cre am in cutaneous photoaging did not differ signiicantly regarding clinical evaluation of the following cr iteria: global cutaneous photoaging, periorbital wrinkles, ephelides/melanosis, forehead k eratosis. They concluded that adapalene 0.3% gel is a safe and effective option for the treatment of mi ld or moderate photoaging [95]. Tretinoin is a prescription strength retinoid approved by the US FDA for acne and for the mitigation of ine facial wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin . Topical application of tretinoin inhibits AP-1, thus suppressing the expression of MMPs and preventing th e degradation of collagen. An increase in epidermal thickness and anchoring ibrils is observed, and intr insically aged skin may also beneit from the topical application of retinoids. Prescription strength tretino in affords the most potent retinoid effects, but Kader Moh https:// dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113often results in limited utility and decreased adherence due to irritation reactions (ie, burning, scaling, and dermatitis) [11,96,97]. Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abund ant leaves of the plant Psoralea corylifolia . Chaudhuri et al., 2014 reported that bakuchiol, having no str uctural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression proile [98]. Dhaliwal et al., 2019 reported that demonstrates that bakuchiol is comparable with retinol in its ability to improve photoageing and is better tolerated than retinol. Bakuchiol is promising as a more tolerable alternative to retin ol (bakuchiol 0\u00b75% cream twice daily or retinol 0\u00b75% cream daily) [99]. Kwon et al., 2018 reported that retinaldehyde 0.1% and 0.05% creams used to treat photoaged skin both were well tolerated and improved s kin hydration and texture. Retinaldehyde 0.1% cream improved the melanin index as well [100]. An improve ment of the photoaged dermal matrix by topical application of a cosmetic \"antiaging\" product containin g a lipoentapeptide, white lupin, and retinyl palmitate was reported by Watson et al., 2008 [101]. Also, synt hetic retinyl-N-formyl aspartame has also been demonstrated to improve skin roughness and wrinkles. Howev er, studies of retinyl esters, such as retinyl -Hydroxy acids (AHAs): Hydroxy acids, also called fruit acids, are among non-organic acids which have been used in the treatment of skin disorders since about 5 0 years ago. They are some of the most widely used and studied anti-aging skincare compounds. AHAs act on both the epidermal and the dermal levels. When applied to the skin, AHAs stimulate the exfoliatio n of epidermal cells in the stratum corneum by interfering with the ionic bonding between these cells. This results in the sloughing off dull and rough skin and promotes cellular renewal. Initially used for treatmen t of hyperkeratosis and other skin conditions affecting subcutaneous turnover, AHAs were found to promote sof ter, smoother skin, faded wrinkles, lightened age spots, and decreased blemishes. AHAs also improve the subcutaneous barrier function, increase epidermal proliferation and thickness, and restore hyd ration and pursiness through an increase in hyaluronic acid. The well-known beneits of AHA's include ex foliation, moisturization, reduction of ine lines and wrinkles, collagen synthesis, irming and skin lighte ning. Although these naturally occurring organic acids are often referred to as fruit acids because they are found in many common fruits such as citrus fruits (citric acid), apples (malic acid), and grapes (t artaric acid), the two most widely used AHAs are not components of fruit. Glycolic acid (GA) is a sugar cane der ivative, and lactic acid (LA) is derived from milk [90,103]. Glycolic acid (GA): Tang et al., 2019 demonstrated that GA reduced UVB-induced typ e-I procollagen expression and secretory collagen levels, when applied topicall y onto human keratinocytes and the C57BL/6J mice dorsal skin. The UV-induced MMP-9 level and activ ity were reduced by GA pre-treatment. Concomitantly, GA reverted mitogen-activated protein kinase (MM P-9) activation and inhibited the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (p38, pERK) tr iggered by UVB. Finally, GA triggers the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) channel to in itiate the anti-photoaging mechanism in keratinocytes. These indings clearly indicated that the mechan isms of GA promote skin protection against UVB-induced photoaging and wrinkle formation [104], Application of 5% GA cream for 3 months has been shown to improve skin texture and discoloration of photoaged sk in. In another study, 8% (glycolic acid or L-lactic acid) for 22 weeks, the majority of patients (76% for glycolic acid; 71% for lactic acid) reported a noticeable improvement in the appearance and smoothness of phot oaged skin [102]. In a study of 50% GA peels by Newman et al, there was improvement in mild photoaging of skin. Other signiicant improvements were noted, including decreases in rough texture and ine wrink ling, fewer solar keratoses, and slight lightening of solar lentigines. Histologic analysis showed thin ning of the stratum corneum, granular layer enhancement, and epidermal thickening. Some specimens showed an increase in collagen thickness in the dermis. GA peels do not affect deep wrinkles or deep pigmentati ons [105]. Lactic acid (LA): Lactic acid (as sodium lactate) is a well-known part of the sk in's natural moisturizing complex, and is considered to be an excellent moisturizer. LA a lso contributes to the cell cycle in human keratinocytes [106]. Treatment with 12% LA resulted in increase d epidermal and dermal irmness and thickness and clinical improvement in skin smoothness and in th e appearance of lines and wrinkles. Both 023 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h ISBN: in reducin g ine wrinkles on the external-lateral region of the eyes, after three applications (85% LA versus 70% GA) [107] . Recently more attention has been drawn to alpha hydroxy and polyhydroxy acids (AHA and PHA) due to the ir excellent moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Algiert-Zieliska et al., 2019 reported maintenance of the epidermal barrier integrity during application of lactic acid (LA) and lactobionic acid and the op portunity to use them on sensitive skin types including couperose skin [108]. One of the reasons lactic acid is widely used as exfoliator and chemical peeling agent is its profound effect on desquamation of the ski n. Desquamation is due to the dissociation of the cellular adhesions, which occurs as a result of reduced cal cium ion concentration in the epidermis by chelating action of AHAs [109]. Yamamoto et al., 2006 also show ed that LA not only increased the production of ceramide in the stratum corneum, but also appeared to improv e the ratio of ceramide 1-linoleate to oleate as compared to vehicle following 1-month topical applica tion of 4% L-lactic acid. The increased ratio of ceramide 1-linoleate to oleate has been suggested to play an important role in increasing skin barrier function [110]. -Hydroxy acids (BHAs): Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs), such as salicylic acid, are very sim ilar to AHAs except for difference in their solubility. In the other hands, they are lipid-soluble in contrast to water solubility of AHAs. This structure allows them to penetrate int o the skin through sebaceous follicles, making it appropriate for patients with oily skin and open comedones. In addition to prove anti-inlammatory effect of BHAs (e.g. salicylic acid), the skin irritancy effect of the m have also been proved to be less than AHAs. Beta hydroxy acid found in skin-care products works best in a concen tration of 1-2% [103]. Salicylic acid (SA) is a BHA, which has action to normal keratinization, decreases in lammation, and reduces sebum production with a comedolytic effect. The concentration of salicylic to tr eat acne is 0.5-5% [111]. SA has been used in the treatment of photoaging with in-ofice peels of 20-30%. The se can be quite helpful in patients who are unable to tolerate AHAs since irritancy levels tend to be less with salicylic acid. In addition, it can be quite useful to combine or alternate both AHAs and BHAs since their m echanisms of action differ, and using both may be quite beneicial [90]. Vender et al., 2019 reported that daily use of a ceramide containing cleanser and cream that also has SA offers an effective, easy and comfor table option for dry skin conditions. After treatment subjects reported a signiicant improvement in the qu ality of their professional life, self-image, and social life. The products were shown to be safe, comfortabl e, and well tolerated [112]. Shamalnasab et al., 2018 reported that salicylates activate adenosine monop hosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), which is now considered as a promising target to slow down aging and prevent age-related diseases in humans [111]. A topical combination containing 10.4% was used in the to pical treatment of females of ages 20 to 58. After 4 weeks, improvement was achieved, which remained continu ous and cumulative in the eighth week [95]. 2% supramolecular salicylic acid has a similar eficacy w ith 5% benzoyl peroxide 0.1% adapalene in mild to moderate acne treatment. The skin barrier (skin hydrati on value and TEWL value), skin brightness (L* value) and erythema (a* values) indicators showed similar s tatistical improvement [113]. Ascorbic acid (AA): Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant which protects skin fr om oxidative damage and rejuvenates photo-aged skin. It has been utilized as a skin lightener (e.g., via tyrosinase inhibition and/or its antioxidant effect). It also has been rep orted to have anti-inlammatory properties since it reduces the erythema associated with post-operative la ser resurfacing. In addition, AA also serves as an essential co-factor for the enzymes lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase, both of which are required for posttranslational processing in collagen (Types I and III) biosynthesis. Thus, by stimulating these biosynthetic steps, ascorbic acid will increase the produ ction of collagen which will lead to wrinkle reduction [91]. Vitamin C deicient individuals may experience easy bleeding, bruising, and poor wound healing [114]. In addition, topical vitamin C increases levels of tissue inhibitors of collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP-1) [90]. Normal skin contains high co ncentrations of vitamin C, which supports important and well-known functions, stimulating collagen synthe sis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photodamage. Vitamin C uptake from the plasm a and transport across the skin layers is mediated by speciic sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter s (SVCTs) that are present throughout the 024 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades h ISBN: https:// dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113body and are also responsible for transport into other tissues. Interestingly, cells in the epidermis express both types of vitamin C transporter, SVCT1 and SVCT2 (Figures 8 ,11) (Exhibit 7) [115]. Garre et al., 2018 reported that topical serum containing L-Ascorbic acid, soluble proteoglycans, low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, and a tripeptide protected against oxidative damage and dermal protein loss caused by photo- and chronological aging in human skin explants. In-vivo, the serum hydrated skin for 6 hours, and users perceived increased skin brightness, hydration, and fewer wrinkles [116]. Zasada et al., 2019 reported that 2.5 ml of serum containing 20% L-ascorbic acid with hydrate from strawberries was used topically in every of 4 treatments. The impact of active substance on skin irmness and elasticity as well as the degree of hydration and skin tone was more eficient after micro-needle mesotherapy [117]. Wang et al., 2019 reported 2-O--d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid a unique AA derivative identiied in Lycium barbarum , exhibited enhanced free radical scavenging activity compared with AA and its synthetic derivative AA-2G. AA-2G protected h ydrogen peroxide-induced Treatment with AA-2G elimina ted oxidative the ratio of cellular glutathione to glutathione disulide more effectively than AA and AA-2G [118]. Ggotek et al., 2019 reported three times higher antioxidant properties of than ruti n, measured by the cation radical scavenging activity by the ferric-reducing activity o f plasma (FRAP) test . However, the mixture of ascorbic acid and rutin (Ascorbic A. + Rutin) had approximately 20% higher antiox idant properties compared to Ascorbic A alone. The F-C test showed that AA + Rutin acted two times stro nger than AA. or Rutin alone [119]. Crisan et al., 2015 reported topically applied vitamin C (concentration o f 5% and a pH of 5.5 in a novel complex with Figure 11: Delivery of nutrients to the skin [131]. The location of the vitamin C transport proteins SVCT1 and SVCT2 are indicated. Red arrows de pict nutrient fl ow from the blood vessels in the dermis to the epidermal laye r.

Vitamin E: The very properties that make alpha-tocopherol such a powerful antioxidant causes it to break down in the presence of oxygen or upon exposure to light. For t hat reason, -tocopherol acetate, which is the more stable esteriied form, is used in cosmetics. Since -toco pherol acetate is not an antioxidant and has no antioxidant activity, it must irst convert to its active alpha -tocopherol form. Years of debate questioned the ability of alpha-tocopherol acetate to be delivered to the skin and bio-converted to an active form. Finally, in 1990, the bioconversion of alpha-tocopherol acetate to free alp ha-tocopherol was able to be demonstrated. The use of vitamin E in skin care has anti-aging beneits based on its moisturization properties but mostly on its protective capabilities. Vitamin E enhances the photopro tective to protective effects of sunscreen, and when combined with vitamin C, the two are even stronger as phot o protectants [90]. Unfortunately, oral supplementation of vitamin C and E has proven insuficient in p reventing skin aging owing to their poor solubility, ineficient skin permeability, or instability durin g storage [121]. Topical vitamin E (-tocopherol) used as a component of skin products has anti-inlammatory and antiproliferative effects in concentrations between 2 and 20%. It acts by smoothing the skin and increasing the ability of the stratum corneum to maintain its humidity, to accelerate the epithelialization, and contribute to photoprotection of the skin. The effects are not as strong as with vitamins C and B3 [122]. Most of the OTC antiaging creams contain 0.5%-1% of vitamin E. Topical application of the gel containing 2% phytonadione, 0.1% retinol, 0.1% vitamin C, and 0.1% vitamin E has been seen to be fairly or mod erately effective in reducing dark under- eye circles, especially in cases of hemostasis. Topical applica tion of vitamin E can rarely cause contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and xanthomatous reaction [123 ]. The interaction of vitamins E and C has led to the idea of \"vitamin E recycling\", where the antioxidant function of oxidized vitamin E is continuously restored by other antioxidants (Figure 9). This \"antioxidant ne twork\" depends upon the supply of aqueous antioxidants and the metabolic activity of cells [124] (Figure 12). Vitamin E is a promising chemo-preventive and pharmacologically safe agent, which can be exploited or tested against skin cancer [125]. Experimental evidence sugg ests that topical and oral vitamin E has anticarcinogenic, photoprotective, and skin barrier-stabilizing properties [126]. The topical use of resveratol, a polyphenol from red grapes with great antioxidant activity in skin care formulation Farris Figure 12: The interdependence of vitamins E and C, and glutathione, in th e scavenging of free radicals and regeneration of the reduced antioxidants [131]. Vitamin E is in the lipid fraction of the cell, whereas vitamin C and glutathione are water-soluble and present in the cytosol. Vitamin C is only one player in the antioxidant ar senal that includes enzymatic defenses (catalase, glutathione p eroxidase and superoxide dismutase) as as other non-enzymatic defenses glutathione, uric acid and dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113et al., 2014 reported that signiicant improvement in ine line s and wrinkles, skin irmness, skin elasticity, skin laxity, hyperpigmentation, radiance, and skin roughness ov er baseline in 12 weeks after using a topically applied proprietary blend containing 1% resveratrol, 0.5% baicalin, and 1% vitamin E. Ultrasound measurements in the periorbital area showed an average improvem ent of 18.9% in dermal thickness suggesting signiicant dermal remodeling [127]. Combination of vitamin E, vitamin C, and ferulic acid can reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-induced tumors, and th eir antioxidant effects are much better than the use of vitamin C alone [128]. Burns et al., 2013 demonstrat ed that topical 5% alpha tocopherol may actually promote carcinogenesis when applied on chronically UVB -damaged skin while treating with a more stable antioxidant compound may offer therapeutic beneits [129]. Coenzyme Q10: (a ubiquinone) is free radical inhibito r that inhibits lipid peroxides from forming in plasma membranes. Q10 plays a very im portant role in cellular energy production and works in the mitochondrial ATP energy-producing pathway of the cell. Q10 levels diminish with age, as does cellular energy production, which may improve by adding Q1 0 [90]. Additionally, UVR, which leads Appr oximately 46% of total Q10 was found to be present in the reduced form in human epidermis. Q10 scavenges R OS and protects cells against oxidative stress. Zhao et al., 2019 concluded that suppression of the PKA -ERK 1/2 signaling pathway may be one of the important mechanisms by which Q10 protects astrocytes from UVB- induced oxidative damage [130]. Knott et al., 2015 reported that quinone values on the skin surface w ere signiicantly increased after treatment with Q10-containing formulas demonstrating that the powerful an tioxidant Q10 can be delivered directly to the uppermost layer of the skin [131]. Q10 is an insoluble, poorly permeable antioxidant with great biological value which acts as anti-aging and anti-wrinkle agen t. Q10 nano-structured lipid carrier topical skin penetr ation than the Q10-emulsion [132]. Also, El- Leithy et 2018 reported Q10 enhanced solubility and permeability with improved anti-wrinkle [133]. The concentration of Vitamin E a nd Q10, which together with squalene, play a key role against external oxidative insult, has been shown to decrease signiicantly during ageing. Topical application was found to be more effective than oral administra tion in terms of sebum levels of thickness [1 35]. As an effective fat-soluble antioxidant and an essential element of the mitochondrial respiratory chain , Q10 may have healing effects on wound tissues by decreasing oxidative stress and improved mitochondri al eficiency. Choi et. al, 2009 reported the anti-inlammatory and wound healing effect of Q10 in mice [ 133]. Despite the lack of evidence, large numbers of people in the population are taking oral Q10 and oth er vitamins and cofactors in the hope that these agents will slow senescence and expand longevity [136]. -Lipoic acid: Lipoic acid is a very powerful antioxidant that has the unusual advantage of being both water and fat soluble and is an important cofactor in mitochond rial dehydrogenases. -lipoic acid (ALA) is a sulhydryl compound found naturally in virtually all plant and animal species and in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In the human body, it is bonded to lysine residues and acts as a cofactor in various multienzyme complexes. Nevertheless, there is often little or n o free ALA in tissues, so a topical antioxidant formulation containing this natural antioxidant could be used t o protect the skin against the effects of ultraviolet rays, such as photoaging and skin cancer [137]. Stu dies have shown the ease with which lipoic acid is able to penetrate the skin, after which it converts int o its active byproduct dihydrolipoic acid. Topical application of 3% lipoic acid has demonstrated its abil ity to decrease UVB-induced erythema, which demonstrates its photoprotective and anti-inlammatory properti es. Also, a 12 -week study demonstrated that using a topical cream containing 5% ALA was quite effectiv e in treating signs of photoaging [90]. ALA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, are powerful anti oxidants that have many physiological functions, including free radical scavenging of reactive oxygen species, generation of cellular antioxidants, chelation of metal ions, and inlammatory suppression (when giv en orally) [138]. Though ALA is normally administered in oral or injection, it is rarely used topically because of its bad penetration. Kubota et al., 2019 developed novel nanocapsule of ALA, named -lipoactive (nLA), t o improve skin permeability. In in Kader Moh dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113experiments, it was improv ing UV-induced pigmentation and epidermal thickening [139]. Sherif et al., 2019 demonstrated application of topical 30% poloxamer gel loaded with ALA cubosomes. Reduction in facial lines, almost complete resol ution of ine lines in the periorbital region and upper lip area and overall improvement in skin color and te xture in most volunteers. There were no instances of irritation, peeling or other apparent adverse side effects [140]. In a similar study with 5% Cubosomal ALA signiicantly increased epidermal thickness with effective and safe modality for improving aging face [141]. Lin et al., 2004 were unable to detect protec tion using ALA alone or together with vitamins C and E. According to them, a commercial formulation of ALA pro vided no protection [142]. Isaac et al., 2015 reported that rheological features, such as viscosity, thi xotropy, and compliance, and the presence of a hydrophilic polymer strongly inluenced the release of ALA from topical emulsion dosage form [137]. -Glucans: -Glucan is a dietary iber, found in many natural sources, and controls chronic metabolic diseases effectively. The in vivo cholesterol binding and reduc tion in the skin thickness by -glucan were highly encouraging [143]. Although isolated from different sour ces, including oat, barley, and reishi mushrooms, the most biologically active are isolated from cell membranes of baker's Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). bot h keratinocytes and Langerhans cells, -Glucans act to stimulate the protective qualities of t hese cells as our irst line of defense. Topical -Glucans can accelerate wound healing and increase resistance to infection by enhancing macrophage- mediated phagocytosis. Studies have also demonstrated that -Gl ucans have photoprotective properties similar to those of vitamin E by their ability to sustain level s of reduced glutathione in the skin following UVR. -Glucans are extremely soothing and calming to the skin t hrough their reinforcement of skin macrophages, which have implications in minimizing irritancy po tential of products. The potential uses of -Glucans in dermatology are numerous. In personal-care prod ucts for shaving, where nicks and cuts, razor burn, irritation and folliculitis are problematic, the pr otective, wound-healing, anti-irritating effects of -Glucans can be quite helpful. The photoprotective effects of -Glucans as well as their ability to soothe, moisturize, and protect the skin from potential irritation that can occur with other treatment products, makes them quite useful in anti-aging skin regimens [90]. Topic al application of -glucans is increasing, since activity (antioxidant, anti-inlammatory and regenerative effects, immunomodulation, radioprotection, moisturization and rejuvenation) might help as a complementary therapy in managing various skin diseases and conditions. Macrophages, keratinocyte s and ibroblasts are considered the main target cells of -glucans during wound healing. -glucans enhance wound repair by increasing the iniltration of macrophages, which stimulates tissue granulation, collagen deposition and re-epithelialization [144] (Figure 13). A long-term use of glucan showed reduction of wrinkle depth, height and overall roughness, which is probably caused by stimulation of ibroblast and increase production of collagen. A cell turnover and regenerative extract of eta-glucan is believed to support healthy immunosurveillance [145]. Dammarane ginsenosides are considered to play a major role in the antiwrinkle activities of ginseng. These compounds are strongly linked with cellulose, pectin, or -glucan [146]. Jesenak et al., 2016 investigated the immunomodulatory and activity of an Imunoglukan P4H\u00ae cream, containing -glucans (pleuran), in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, where use of -glucan-based cream as a supportive Figure 13: Schematic depiction of -glucan pluripotent mechanisms in ukan P4H\u00ae showed signiicant improvements in both subjective and objective symptoms of atopi c dermatitis and a signiicant decline in disease severity; exacerbation was observed [148]. Sensitive sk in is frequently complaint in dermatology consultation with cutaneous manifestations such as stinging, re dness, dryness, and burning sensation that affect the quality of life. Its pathogenesis is mainly related to dysfunction of neurosensory, skin barrier, and also immune activity. Wang et al., 2018 conirmed the effective ness, tolerance and antisensitive function of a new complex cream composed by Yunnan Portulaca oleracea ex tract, Prinsepia utilis oil, beta-glucan, and sodium hyaluronate extracted from mushroom. The proposed da ily care safe moisturizer provided a statistically signiicant improvement in clinical grading score s for dryness, roughness, and erythema at 28 days compared to baseline [149] (Exhibit 8). Ceramide: The stratum corneum is comprised of corneocytes surrounded by i nter-celluar lipids including ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Ceramid e predominant moisturizers have become a mainstay of treatment of skin disease. Ceramides constitute (on a weight basis) approximately 47% of the SC lipids [150]. Moisturizing treatment involves a four-step proce ss: a) repairing the skin barrier, b) increasing water content, c) reducing TEWL and d) restoring the lipid barr iers' ability to attract, hold and redistribute water. Interestingly, a statistically signiicant higher cerami de/cholesterol ratio was found for men than for women, as reported by Vozella et al., 2019 [151]. Jensen et al. , 2005 reported reduced activities of ceramide- generating epidermal acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) and ceramide synthase in the inner epidermis of aged skin, explaining its reduced capacity in barrier repair [152]. The effect of Ceramide cream on enhancing skin barrier function and hydration might be explained by its unique ingredients. Ceramide cream increases skin hydration and improves barrier function which may make it suita ble for use on dry skin [153]. Several studies have demonstrated that ceramides play an essential role in both the barrier and water-holding functions of healthy stratum corneum, suggesting that the dysfunction of the stratum corneum associated with ageing as well that observed in patients with several skin diseases could result from a ceramide deiciency. A 2-week topical application of a sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus p reparation led to signiicant and relevant increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels [154]. Draelos et a l., 2018 demonstrates that a proprietary combination of ceramide PC-104, palmitamide MEA, glycerrhetinic acid, and grape seed extract in a glycerin, dimethicone, and petrolatum vehicle was effective in reducing t he signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and other types of pruritic dermatoses (e.g., senile itch, cosmetic intolerance syndrome) in children and adults [155]. Yazdanparast et al., 2018 reporte d skin-identical ceramide complex cream improved contact dermatitis with a decrease in Three-Item Sever ity (TIS) and an increase in skin hydration, implying a repair of the skin barrier [156]. Advancements in co smetic chemistry have resulted in the development of bio-identical synthetic ceramides that are commo nly incorporated into skin care products (notably CER-1, CER-3, and CER-6), which have been shown to fun ction similar to natural ceramides [150]. Zhang et al., 2015 reported limited penetration of ceramide spe cies into SC and accumulation on to the skin, suggesting that topical replenishment of CER may not be a n effective approach to improve the barrier properties of healthy skin [157] (Figure 14). Nicotinamide: Niacin (vitamin B3) has two potential forms that can be used in cosmeceuticals: niacinamide (nicotinamide) and nicotinic acid [158]. Topical ni cotinamide (the active form of vitamin-B3) has been shown to improve ine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigment ed spots, red blotchiness and sallowness (yellowing), as well as elasticity. In addition, nicotinamide h as been demonstrated to increase the skin's production of collagen and ceramides, and to stimulate keratino cyte differentiation, leading to improved barrier function and skin appearance [90,102]. Nicotinamide cre am is a more effective moisturizer than Exhibit 8: List of the Plant Extracts Mostly Used in book10113white petrolatum on atopic dry skin, and may be used as a treat ment adjunct in atopic dermatitis [159]. Ashkani et al., 2015 reported its anti-inlammatory, antioxidan t, and immunomodulatory properties, as well as an epithelization inducing action. Nicotinamide also im proved tissue regeneration through the increment of ibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and [160]. Nicotinamide and clindamycin were signiicantly more eficacious in oily an d non-oily skin types, respectively. Skin type is a signiicant factor in choosing between topical nicoti namide and clindamycin in patients with acne vulgaris [161]. Because topical clindamycin, like other an timicrobials, is associated with emergence of resistant microorganisms, nicotinamide 4% gel is a desirable alternative treatment for acne vulgaris [162]. Niacinamide 4% induces and solar elastosis. Niacinamide is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for melas ma, compared to 4% hydroquinone. Niacinamide was effective in approximate 40% of patients, showi ng outstanding clinical results [163]. In ageing skin, topical application of niacinamide improves the su rface structure, smoothens out wrinkles and inhibits photo-carcinogenesis. It is possible to demonstrate an ti-inlammatory effects in acne, rosacea and nitrogen mustard-induced irritation [164]. Nicotinamide also in creases keratin, ilaggrin, and involucrin [165]. Nicotinamide increases collagen in cultures and reduces the increased dermal glycoaminoglycosides in photodamaged skin. The glycation between protein and sugar resulting in formation of cross-linke d products gives a yellow color to the skin. As nicotinamide is a precursor of antioxidant NADPH, it has ant iglycation effects, thus preventing shallowing of skin. In a double-blinded, split face, randomized controlled trial, 5% nicotinamide cream was compared to \"vehicle only cosmetic\" in 30 Japanese women on face for 8 w eeks. There was a signiicant decrease in wrinkles and skin roughness with nicotinamide [166]. Zinc: The skin is the third most zinc (Zn)-abundant tissue in the bod y. Zn is a cofactor for over 1000 enzymatic reactions and is necessary for over 2000 transcriptio n factors. Zn-inger proteins function for DNA interaction, RNA packaging, activation of transcription, re gulation of apoptosis, folding and assembly of protein, and lipid binding. Zn also functions as an intracel lular signaling molecule, like calcium, by transducing extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling. Additionally, about 10% of human proteins Figure 14: The molecular structures of the ceramides (CER) present in huma n stratum corneum [225], indicated according to the numbering system (based on chromatographic migration) and accor ding to their structures. 17% of the world's population who are in t he condition of general malnutrition due to starvation, severe illness, alcohol addiction [167]. The import ance of zinc for humans was acknowledged in the Middle East (Iran, Egypt), in the early 1960s, in patien ts with growth retardation, hypogonadism, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dry and wrinkled skin, and severe i ron deiciency anemia [168]. A Zn-deicient diet alters the expression of polypeptides rats beca use of impaired keratinolytic enzyme activity. Zn is required for the proliferation of keratinocytes and the s uppression of inlammation in Keratinocytes. Zn the melanocyte proliferation and the autophagy. Zn promotes lipogenesis and glucose transport via its insulin-like effects on 3T3-L1 ibroblasts and adipocyt es [167]. Topical preparations like zinc oxide, calamine, or zinc pyrithione have been in use as photoprotectin g, soothing agents or as active ingredient of antidandruff shampoos. Its use has expanded manifold over th e years for a number of dermatological conditions including et 2018 demonstrated that SIG-1273 reduced cell death by 66%, outperforming niacinamide, ascorbic acid, and -tocopherol in acid, peptides) and antioxidant ingredients (ectoin e, coffeeberry oil, and olive oil), according to the type and area of the face, on the improvement of signs o f skin aging. Ingredients from formulations studied have been shown to reduce the signs of skin aging by th e multiple extrinsic factors known today as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared solar radiation; pollutants; aridity conditions; or even endogenous factors, such as factors [171]. A ilm-forming exopolysaccharide (EPS) called as alteromonas ferment extract was included in the formulation for its anti-adhesion effect. E PS signiicantly reduced particle adhesion to skin and protected keratinocyte membranes from lipid peroxid ation, preserved cell integrity, and normalized the collagen network in skin exposed to heavy metals , hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. Narda et al., 2018 reported that daily application of the facia l cream containing an EPS, carnosine, and niacinamide over 5 days had a protective effect against polluti on-induced changes [172]. Giacomelli et al., 2018 reported that clinical application of a multicomponent pow der, including three naturally occurring standardized extracts rich in polyphenols (grape seed extract, green tea extract, oak wood/bark extract) allows the prevention of any metal deposition within the SC fol lowing exposure in a polluted environment and plays an effective role in counteracting skin damages induc ed by air pollution [173] (Exhibit 9).

Systemic Anti-aging preparations Collagen supplementation: In 2016, the collagen market was valued at an estimated 3.71 bi llion USD and is projected to reach 6.63 billion USD by 2025. Collagen su pplements, originating from various sources (eg, porcine, bovine, marine) and available in numerous formula tions (eg, protein, gelatin, hydrolysate, peptides), are marketed as improving skin integrity and modulat ing skin aging. When denatured by heat, collagen forms gelatin, which has been used for centuries as a food source and traditional medicine in Europe and China. Further enzymatic hydrolysis of gelatin pr oduces collagen hydrolysates (CH) composed of peptides of varying lengths, conveniently formulate d into liquid drinks and jelly sticks for oral consumption. In the past decade, CHs have gained popularit y as a nutraceutical supplement. Choi et al., 2019 reported promising preliminary results for the short and l ong-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements als o increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. However, even with this increase in pa tient interest and market share, the use of collagen supplementation in dermatology remains controversial d ue to the lack of regulation on quality and quantity of ingredients in OTC collagen supplements [53,174]. M aria et al., 2019 reported improvement of general skin conditions, acting in different mechanisms by oral supplementation and topical application of hydrolyzed proteins [175]. Proksch et al., 2014 reported sig niicant improvement in after 8 weeks of supplementation in women aged 35-55 years but study failed to r each a level of statistical signiicance with regard to skin moisture and skin evaporation [176]. Oral a dministration of Low-molecular-weight Collagen peptide (LMWCP), which is a ish-derived collagen hydr olysate, promotes recovery of collagen ibers and normal elastic ibers in the skin from degraded coll agen and abnormal elastic ibers caused by UVB irradiation in hairless mice [177]. Kim et al., 2018 report ed that LMWCP is a safe health functional food ingredient with anti-skin photoaging eficacy which can ef fectively improve hydration, elasticity, and wrinkling in human skin at the dose of 1000 mg once daily [178] (Figure 15). Oral supplementation with collagen bioactive peptides (hydrolyz ed ish collagen) combined with chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine, L-carnitine, vitamins, and m inerals signiicantly improved the clinical parameters related to skin aging and joint health [179]. Lee et al., 2019 reported that orally administering collagen peptide NS (CPNS) to rats, the plasma concentrations o f Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp increased dramatically. The CPNS consumption signiicantly wrink le formation, transepidermal and epidermis thickness, and increased skin hydration [180]. An association between oral administration of collagen peptides combined with vitamin C and extracts of Hibiscus sabdariffa and Aristotelia chilensis Figure 15: Collagen ber structure, absorption/metabolism and deposition into skin cells and dermal layers. It is generally thought that collagen (derived products) are hydrolyzed into amino acids in the GIT prior to being absorbed into the blood circulation, whi ch are then deposited into the skin cells and/or utilized as building block component s for extracellular matrix proteins produced by broblasts. AL A = Alanine, HYP = Hydroxyproline, GLY = Glycine, PRO = dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113was observed by Addor et al., 2018. Female adult patients recei ved an oral nutritional supplement from a sachet and were instructed to consume 1 sachet diluted in 200 m L of water once daily for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluation by high frequency ultrasound and cutometry showed si gniicant improvement of irmness and elasticity and an increase in dermal thickness by ultrasound af ter 3 months of use [53]. Zague et al, 2018 reported that collagen peptides modulate the metabolism of extr acellular matrix proteins by human dermal ibroblasts (in culture) that were derived from sun-protected a nd sun-exposed body sites [181]. Song et al, 2017 examined the effects of collagen hydrolysates from sliver carp skin on UV-induced photo-aging in mice and found that LMW peptides exerted beneicial effects when com pared to high molecular weight CHs on HA levels and moisture content of the skin [182] (Exhibit 10). Probiotics: Lactic acid bacteria consist of 26 genera now, and play an essential role in the food industry in the manufacture of many fermented products (cheese, yogurt, fermented vegetables, etc.). Application of these organisms is now being extended to the area of health improvement, as their probiotic activities become known. Lactococcus lactis H61 improved skin status in Japanese women with oral intake of heat- killed or live cells. With regard to live cells in fermented mi lk made by strain H61, the reported effects are attractive and it is expected that consumption of H61-fermented milk will increase [183]. It is also reported that oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1 improves the appearance of adult acne [184]. Oral intake of yoghurt made by using Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038 plus Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 for 4 weeks improved skin elasticity and the degree of dry ness in cheeks of women [185]. Mori et al, 2016 also reported that the intake of fermented milk containing Biidobacterium breve strain Yakult plus galactooligosaccharides for 4 weeks increased hydration levels of the stratum corneum in women [186] (Figure 16). Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is ubiquitous in nature, especially found in the ma rine environment as a red- orange pigment common to many aquatic animals such as salmonids , shrimp, and crayish. The ROS lead to skin aging via oxidative damage that are induced by UVR. The refore, topical formulations which have antioxidant effect could reduce aging level [187]. Eren et al., 2019 reported that topical formulations of astaxanthin-loaded algae extract could be suggested as topical anti-aging formulations [188]. Comparative studies examining the photoprotective effects of carotenoids ha ve demonstrated that astaxanthin is a superior antioxidant, having greater antioxidant capacity than canthaxanthin and -carotene in human dermal ibroblasts [187]. In particular, astaxanthin inhibits R OS formation and modulates the expression of oxidative stress-responsive enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is a marker of oxidative stress and a regulatory mechanism involved in the cell adaptati on against oxidative damage [189] (Figure 17).

Zinc Importance for skin morphogenesis, repair and maintenanc e such as wound healing 8. SeleniumActs as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase (GPX) removing ha and repair; prevents oxidative stressand UVB-radiation; also acts only via direct radical scavenging, but also by activating the cellular antioxidant defense system through m odulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway. Fang et al., 2017 demonstrate d that astaxanthin protected against early burn-wound progression by attenuating ROS-induced oxidative str ess in deep-burn model [190]. In vitro, astaxanthin effectively suppresses cell damage caused by free radicals and induction of MMP-1 in skin after UV irradiation [191]. Chou et al., 2016 reported tha t an enriched astaxanthin extract from H. pluvialis increased collagen content through inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP -3 expression in human et al., 2017 reported that astaxa nthin-treated wounds in mice showed signiicantly increased expression of wound healing biological markers such as collagen type I 1 (Col1A1) and basic ibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [193]. The immunomodu latory action of astaxanthin has been also reported in dogs and cats, enhancing both cell-mediated an d humoral immune responses. In these studies, astaxanthin increased natural killer (NK) cell cytotox ic activity, suggesting that astaxanthin may regulate NK cells that serve as an immunosurveillance system ag ainst tumors and virus-infected cells [194,195]. Astaxanthin is reported to improve the DNA repair ca pacity of cells exposed to UV radiation. In particular, astaxanthin was capable of minimizing DNA damage an d inluencing the kinetics of DNA repair [196]. Human cells possess multiple protection mechanisms again st UV-induced ROS, either by preventing damage or by damage repair. Camera et al., 2009 reported that a staxanthin inhibits the UV-induced DNA damage and increases the expression of oxidative stress-respons ive enzymes [197]. Tominaga prophylactic astaxanthin suppleme ntation may inhibit age-related skin deterioration and maintain skin conditions associated with envi ronmentally induced damage via its anti- inlammatory effect Colostrum is the initial milk or \"irst milk\" that is produced by mammals (including humans) immediately following parturition. As expected, colostrum was m ore effective than milk with the total lipid, Figure 16: Bio-actives from probiotics for were higher in colostrum when compared to milk. In addition, with further analysis, the fat globule fr action provided the strongest stimulation for wound repair that contained Epidermal Growth Factors. The milk luid produced by all female mammalian species after birth has the function to meet the complete nutri tional requirements of the neonate and, at the same time, provide all of the biochemical needs and supp ort the many biological functions of the immature newborn to help the newborn survive and develop. Start ing in the 1980s and through the mid- 1990s, supplemented cell culture medium with milk or colostrum was reported to improve the growth rate of many cell types including skin (ibroblasts). Peptides from milk protein hydrolysates improved the growth of human keratinocytes in culture. Medium supplement ed with 300 g/mL for 12 days where the average molecular weight of 800 Da containing a high concen tration of amino acids promoted the growth of the keratinocytes by 108% [199]. Colostrum is the onl y known natural source of the enzyme, telomerase, which may help to slow down the aging of DNA. In fa ct, there is evidence that short telomeres and a lack of telomerase can exert a longevity-promoting effect via prevention of cancer [200]. Colostrum also includes EGF and IGF-1, which are known to assist in the r epair and regeneration of cells. EGF and IGF-1 play essential roles in wound healing, which makes colost rum an important potential adjunct to the skin's repair following a surgical cosmetic procedure. Let's no t forget about the lactoferrin in colostrum, either. Lactoferrin helps manage the immune response in the ski n cells, which means supplementing with lactoferrin may potentially help a person increase his or her s kin's anti-inlammatory response [201]. Selenium: Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in the human body a nd plays an important role in the body via effects and are involved in regulating antioxidant activities [202]. Se and the selenoproteins are essential for keratinocyte function and skin development. A lack of selenoenzymes in the mouse epidermis leads to abnormalities in the skin and hair follicles , premature skin aging, and premature death. Additionally, several studies have shown that Se pretreatment c an drastically protect keratinocytes, melanocytes, and ibroblasts from UV-induced cytotoxicity. Low doses of Se were very potently protective against UVA-induced cytotoxicity in young keratinocytes, wherea s the aged keratinocytes require four times more Se than the young keratinocytes to be protected from UVA-induced cytotoxicity [203,204]. Se Figure 17: The proposed mechanism by which astaxanthin inhibits oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and development and progression Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades of their stemness phenotype through adhesion to the basement membrane [204]. Wang et. al, 2 017 showed that Vitamin C (250 mg/kg), vitamin E (250 mg/kg) and Se (0.2 mg/kg) exerted antioxidant ef fects and consequently may prevent skin damage caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetes (65 mg/kg) in Swiss albino rats [205]. Hyaluronic Hyaluronic acid (HA) is part of the body's connective tissues, and is known to cushion and lubricate. Aging destroys HA. Diet and smoking can also aff ect your body's level of HA over time. Skin care products with HA are most frequently used to treat wrinkle d skin although they don't replace anything the body has naturally lost. These are very effective moisturiz ers [206]. UV radiation damage causes initially a mild form of wound healing and is associated at irst with an increase of dermal HA. As little as 5 min of UV exposure in nude mice caused enhanced deposition of HA, indicat ing that UV radiation induced skin damage is an extremely rapid event. The initial redness of the skin fo llowing exposure to UV radiation may be due to a mild edematous reaction induced by the enhanced HA deposit ion and histamine release. Repeated and extensive exposures to UV ultimately simulate a typical wou nd healing response with deposition of scarlike type I collagen, rather than the usual types I and III collagen mixture that gives skin resilience and pliability [207]. HA based formulations (i.e., gels, creams, in fold, anti-aging, space-illing, and face rejuvenating properti es. This has been achieved via soft tissue augmentation, improved skin hydration, collagen and elastin sti mulation, and face volume restoration. HA, alone or in combination with lidocaine and other co-agents, sho wed promising eficacy in skin tightness and elasticity, face rejuvenation, improving aesthetic scores, reducing the wrinkle scars, longevity, and tear trough rejuvenation [208]. Sparavigna et al., 2019 reported sig niicant improvement of wrinkles' grade around the eyes, vertical lip lines and wrinkles' severity of n asolabial folds after the irst injection and the effect increased after the second injection. Aging/photoagi ng grade and surface microrelief improved 2 months after the irst injection procedure. The treatments we re very well tolerated by the volunteers as determined by the self-grading score [209]. Lee et al., 2019 reported that Cross-linked hyaluronic acid (CLHA) patches were not an irritant, whereas a clinical study s howed that application of single CLHA patches signiicantly improved skin hydration at the periorbital region for 3 days and at the nasolabial fold for 6 days. Patch application also improved supericial wrinkles at t he periorbital region for 3 days and at the nasolabial fold for 1day. The absence of side effects indicate d that application of these CLHA microstructure patches is both safe and convenient for moisturization and anti -wrinkle effects [210]. Jeon et al., 2019 reported that CTP-EGF has a superior ability, compared with nat ural EGF, to permeate skin and induce HA synthesis and collagen formation. Thus, it has great potential to be used in cosmetics and therapeutic agents to improve wrinkles and health of the skin [211]. There exist m any different types of HA gel illers that differ in their HA concentration, particle size, cross-linking density , duration, and presence of lidocaine. High- density, large-particle illers are recommended for deep dermal injections while the low-density, small- particle illers are recommended for ine lines. HA gel is used by several healthcare professionals include the plastic surgeon, primary care provider, dermatologist, nurs e practitioner and the internist to enhance cosmesis. HA illers are injected to restore volume lost due to age or disease, provide facial contour, and help maintain a youthful appearance. Filler injection has becom e one of the most commonly performed procedures in a dermatology cosmetic practice [212]. Poly-L-lactic acid: Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is an injectable iller used for rest oring facial fat volume loss. Polydioxanone Cog thread and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) th read have been used clinically for lifting and antiaging purposes [213]. PLLA is an effective treatment fo r patients seeking to correct volume loss due to aging. Although the US FDA has approved PLLA for use in people with the HIV in 2004, it is well- suited for patients seeking cosmetic treatment. By 2009 PLLA wa s FDA-approved for the correction of nasolabial fold contour deiciencies and other lines and wri nkles. There have since been limited but promising results with off-label use of PLLA for non-facial vol umization as well, including the hands, neck/ d\u00e9collet\u00e9, abdomen, and gluteal area [214]. PLLA is a safe, bio degradable volumizer used to reverse the signs of aging by gradually correcting volume loss. Patients sh ould be aware of possible adverse reactions during the course of treatment [213]. Injection of PLLA in the deep dermis or subcutaneous dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113cause an immediate augmentation of the treated tissue. This is a temporary but immediate response that is due to tissue edema and luid from the reconstitution of the pr oduct. It will resolve within 2 to 3 days after injection. Once the carrier substance is absorbed, the poly-L-l actic acid particles induce an inlammatory response through phagocytosis by tissue macrophages. This is a similar process to suture reabsorption in the skin. The inlammatory response breaks down the poly-L-l actic acid into lactic acid monomers and is then metabolized to carbon dioxide and water while stimulati ng the production of new collagen type-I ibers in the skin. Approximately half of the product is digest ed within 6 months. The duration of action is 12 to 24 months [215]. Kapiciolu et al., 2019 reported that PL LA and Cog sutures were effective in facial rejuvenation (studied in female rats); both increased dermis th ickness and stimulated collagen production [216]. Repeated PLLA treatments may improve skin quality in a t ime-dependent manner. Pigmentation, erythema, and pore size were signiicantly decreased, whereas r adiance and smoothness were signiicantly increased at 12 months. No treatment-related adverse events occ urred. Repeated PLLA treatments may improve skin quality in a time-dependent manner [217]. The proc ess of hydration, loss of cohesion and molecular weight, and solubilization and phagocytosis of PLA by the host's macrophages, degrades PLA into lactic acid by way of resp iratory excretion. Crystals are left behind to stimulate collagen and a granulomatous reaction. This inlam matory reaction elicits resorption and the formation of ibrous connective tissue about the foreign body, causing dermal ibroplasia that leads to the desired cosmetic effect [2]. Kim et al., 2019 reported that powdered polydioxanone injection induces collagen formation more effectively than PLLA injection [215]. Hormone replacement therapy: In postmenopausal women, dermal collagen decreases, and skin becomes thinner [218]. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) h as been shown to be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. However, its use is controvers ial owing to potential health risks, such as thromboembolism and cancer. Bioidentical hormone therapy has also been used by dermatologists for its anti-aging effects on the skin, but little is known about e ficacy and side effects of bioidentical hormones in this ield [219]. Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study show ed a higher risk for breast cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and thromboembolic events with combined treatment of estrogens and progestin. Synthetic progestins mostly used worldwide include medroxyproge sterone acetate (most frequently used in the US), norethidrone acetate, cyproteron acetate, norgestim ate, norgestrel, and dydrogesterone [220]. The HRT impact on skin thickness and dermal density was demonst rated early when estrogens were initially administered to postmenopausal women. Such replenishm ent therapy was therefore considered as an attempt at alleviating in part skin atrophy and xerosis i n postmenopausal women. Indeed, HRT controls in part the dermal thickness and laxity, and the colla gen content and density, as well as the tissue mechanical reactivity to stress [221]. Physicians and patients have become extremely reluctant concerning HRT following the WHI study. Numbers of HRT prescriptions in th e US rose from 58 million in 1995 to 90 million in 1999, corresponding to 15 million women per year. Nu mbers remained stable through to 2002. Within 3 months after publication of the results of the WHI stu dy, prescriptions of various formulations of combined estrogens and progesterone dropped by 33% to 66% [2 20]. Vinogradova et al., 2019 reported association between risk of venous thromboembolism and different types of HRT. Transdermal treatment was the safest type of hormone replacement therapy wh en risk of venous thromboembolism was assessed. Transdermal treatment appears to be under used, w ith the overwhelming preference still for oral preparations [221]. Both oral and transdermal estradio l caused a signiicant decrease in FSH while only transdermal resulted in a signiicant decrease in LH. Oral estradiol, not transdermal serum high density lipoprotein, thyroxine binding pro tein and growth hormone binding protein [222]. Applying estrogen cream to the skin after menopause impr oves the external appearance of facial skin [218]. There is strong evidence that transdermal estradiol has a cardioprotective effect [223]. Due irst-pass hepatic metabolism, transdermal produc ts achieve clinical beneits while minimizing patient exposure to estrogens, which is consistent with the mos t recent clinical guidelines [224]. Also, by increasing skin collagen content, and increasing acid mucopo lysaccharides and HA, estrogen therapy encourages the growth and development of vaginal epithelial cel ls which make up the thick layers of the vaginal wall, and condone a moist, supple and elastic environme nt [225]. Botelho et al., 2014 reported Banglades (0.1%) + estradiol (0.25%) is safe and effective in re-establishing optimal serum levels of e stradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone and relieving the symptoms of menopause [223]. Abdi et al., 2017 al so concluded that use of transdermal nano- formulations in hormone therapy can relieve climacteric symptom s and prevent other postmenopausal symptoms [226-245]. 4.13. Epilogue As more and more anti-ageing and antioxidant skin care products lood the market, there is growing concern about deinitions and experimental proof of effectivene ss. The physician has an important role in understanding which treatment options are appropriate for mi ld, moderate, and severe photoaging, and in educating patients on the risks and beneits of each. Th e choice of the right active compounds, the veriication of their activity inside a cosmetic formulation, t heir stability and synergistic effects should be the irst step toward the creation of modern and effective p roducts. To be active inside the skin, the antioxidants have to penetrate into the living layers of the sk in, where free radicals are generated and should be effective against ROS. This is possible only if the t opical applied formulation holds the potential to be effective. Moisturizing and emollient products are gaining i ncreasing importance in dry skin treatment, maintenance of daily care of normal skin as well as ancillary t herapy of many skin diseases. Consumers are nowadays more focused on their health and appearance. As a result, there has been an increasing demand in topical antiaging formulations with natural and nutra ceutical ingredients. Novel and innovative delivery systems are transforming the new product development i n the cosmetic ield because of consumer perceivable beneits and optimized sensory attributes. The appl ications of novel drug delivery systems can be found in many cosmetic products. Nanomaterials are nowadays used in almost all the major cosmetic industries. The truth is, there is no magic pill at present tha t will retard aging. But that is not to say there are not simple lifestyle and dietary adjustments that can make people live longer. A cosmetic product that produces clinically objective effects on the most-reported sign s of aging is an attractive option for those unable to avoid extrinsic aging factors but wishing to improve their appearance without resorting to more invasive measures.038 038 8 Abdul Kader Moh book10113Skin care products with antioxidative and anti-aging claims are one of the most fast-growing market for cosmetics worldwide. Anti-aging in dermatology prima rily focuses on the prevention of skin aging with UV protection (clothing and sunscreens), fre e radical scavengers (synthetic or botanic), and cell-protecting agents. Many synthetic and natura l products have been reported to enhance levels of antioxidant enzymes, which make them thera peutic candidates to mitigate UV-mediated damage and to prevent the health consequences of UV exposure. Topical hormonal prescriptions are also an option if UV damage has not been the leading culprit for aging. Chemical peeling leads to a marked increase in collagen formation, the d eeper the better. Ingredients in cream preparations can reduce supericial skin folds (polyph enols, amino acid peptides). Modulators of regular pigmentation are important for anti-aging preparations. New approaches are being designed to exploit the signaling pathways to delay o r even prevent free-radical induced symptoms of aging. There are too many products on the market, f rom so many brands, with more and more ingredients, and at various price points. Selecti ng the right anti-aging product is deinitely a daunting task, but this guide is meant to simplify the process and help to choose the right anti-aging skin care products for an individual skin.ARTICLE SUMMARY5039 039 Abdul Kader Moh https:// dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book101131. Skin aging is characterized by features such as wrinkling, l oss of elasticity, laxity, and rough-textured appearance. 2. Anti-aging medicine encompasses lifestyle changes, hormone r eplacement therapies, as needed, determined by a physician through blood testing; ant ioxidants and vitamin supplements; and testing protocols that can measure not only ho rmone levels and blood chemistry but every metabolic factor right down to the cellular level. 3. Cell senescence limits cell divisions in normal somatic cell s and may play a central role in age-related diseases. 4. The major perceived risk factors are unhealthy eating habits , stress, less exercise, dehydration, diseased state and sleeping habits, though the mai n factor responsible for extrinsic aging is UVR. 5. Exposure to UVR is the primary factor of extrinsic skin agin g, it accounts for about 80% of facial aging. 6. IR radiation and heat can lead to macrophage recruitment lik e UVR. 7. Even in indoor conditions, particulate matter (PM2.5) exposu re levels were positively associated with skin aging manifestation. 8. Smoking provokes elastosis, telangiectasia, skin roughness, and premature wrinkles on facial skin due to the vascular constriction of nicotine. 9. Sleep deprivation is associated with increased signs of intr insic skin aging (ine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity), with much slower reco very rates. 10. Cooking processes that lead to higher levels of advanced gl ycation end product (AGEs) include grilling, frying, and roasting. 11. Among US population 75% consumed less fruit and 87% consume d fewer vegetables than recommended. 12. Higher intakes of vitamin C and linoleic acid and lower int akes of fats and carbohydrates are associated with better skin-aging appearance. 13. In order to lowering the skin damage, cleansings with neutr al pH and pH close to 5.5 are recommended. 14. 30-70% of patients with DM, both type 1 and type 2, will pr esent with a cutaneous ARTICLE https:// dx.doi.org/10.17352/e book10113 complication of DM at some point during their lifetime. 15. Obese-diabetes patients have decreased stratum corneum hydr ation, increased trans-epidermal water loss, higher skin AGEs and decreased dermal collagen ibe r density compared with normal- weight subjects. 16. Type I and III skin collagen is thought to decrease by as m uch as 30% in the irst ive years after menopause. 17. Africans from the African continent show delayed signs of a ging compared to Caucasians. Darker skin types are better protected regarding sun exposure due to the hi gher melanin content in their skin. 18. The skin parameters of hydration, trans-epidermal water los s, sebum, microcirculation, pigmentation, and thickness are generally higher in men but skin pH is higher in women. 19. There is no proven effective product that completely elimin ates the symptoms of skin photoaging, but there are products and treatments that can visibly reduce o r slow down these symptoms.041 Abdul Kader Moh iuddin, Banglades Anti-Aging Medicine As It Relates to Dermatology.
