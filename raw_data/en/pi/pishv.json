The video is a little choppy but the audio is perfect MENOPAUSE & THYROID GUT HEALTH WEIGHT RELEASE We created this protocol after treating hundreds of women every year now KNOWING now what the key factors are to establishing LONG-TERM results. To rev up your metabolism, give you abundant energy to crush your To Do list To break the stubborn weight loss cycle and give you the body you deserve To look at that woman you see in the mirror with pure love and acceptance To selfishly put yourself first for once without any guilt THE GAT PROTOCOL FOR WOMEN & [MAXIMized HEALTH MINDSET COACHING](https://themaximmovement.com/mpc/) IS HERE! Supporting your family's needs, your work needs, your extended family's needs, your bills, your finances, etc. etc. ... let alone make time for yourself can seem IS overwhelming, I know! We are powerful, resilient women and every day we are powering through... but you and I both know that we're not handling our life as great as we could be.... Girl, the struggle is real! ... and you are not alone! In fact, I bet this sounds a lot like you: Truth bomb: Your efforts thus far haven't helped you balance your stress hormones or get rid of your bloating or flatten your tummy or help you sleep or gain energy... (big breath) ...one bit. Maybe they've given you some great ideas or things you know you \"should\" do, but you still somehow backslide into old habits, or overwhelm. I know because I see my patients struggle with this over and over again, which is why I'm so excited to bring all of my expert solutions to YOU for a fraction of the cost. Enough is enough! We're here to help! I'm Andrea Maxim, team leader, was an ND for 10yrs and Master Mindset Coach [we have a team of active NDs], and I know all about what you're going through. In case we've never met before, let me tell you a little bit about me... I am a mother of two beautiful girls, Aria and Brooklyn, both stubborn and feisty in their own ways. I have my furbaby, King, our beloved German Shepherd and a wife to my ride-or-die hubby, Scott. After treating over 500 patients a year, I got a great grasp on what will help you lose that tummy bloat, regain your energy and overall make you feel like a strong, confident woman again. This clinical experience helped to create the GAT PROTOCOL \u00a9 which is my team's system for healing your Gut-Adrenals (stress)-Thyroid in that order for long-lasting success, the same protocol I wrote about in my book, MAXIMized Health! Now, I am also a proud [MAXIMized Health Performance Coach](https://themaximmovement.com/mpc/) working at the mental level on ANXIETY, EMOTIONAL EATING, RELEASING INAPPROPRIATE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (Anger, Shame, Guilt, Hurt, Sadness, Hopeless, Worthless) to give you results that stick well beyond the GAT Protocol. My team and I believe that the women I treat are absolute SUPER HEROS! BUT... because you're \"doing it all\" you become overworked and overwhelmed. You're searching for a more natural and different approach to your health, but you want it to be customized to YOUR busy lifestyle and your body's needs... not just a recipe-in-a-box that quite frankly, just doesn't work for you. The change I want for you is to make you feel beautiful and to love your reflection in the mirror. To be assertive about protecting your values and needs as a woman, without diluting it to others, and to feel confident in saying NO to things you don't want to do.was IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED WITH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE, DATA-DRIVEN PROTOCOL OUT THERE?
