It has proven to be an extremely successful way of helping to clear the body of harmful toxins and pollutants and to promote general health and well being. It can be done as a fast/cleanse where it is the only thing ingested for 3 to 10 days or it can be a nice addition to your daily detox regiment. If it is used as a fast you should consult with your physician first to make sure it is safe for you to do so. INGREDIENTS - 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice. Organic lemons, fresh, not bottled juice. Limes may be substituted. Lemon zest and pulp may be added, making sure that the lemons are organic and not artificially colored or treated with pesticides. - 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. This must be pure maple syrup, not pancake syrup. The darker Grade B maple syrup is recommended, which has more color and nutrients than Grade A, which is also acceptable. - 1/10 teaspoon cayenne pepper. You can start with a lesser amount if the taste/spiciness needs getting used to. - A 10-ounce glass of medium hot water, but cold water can also be used. DIRECTIONS "}
