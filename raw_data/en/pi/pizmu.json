In a nutshell, it's acupuncture without the needles. I work with the biofield and other energy systems to help it heal itself. But what I really love about it is that it's self-help, things I can do for myself and I can teach others so that they can help themselves. Energy Medicine is an approach that involves balancing and restoring your body's natural energies for the purposes of increasing your vitality, strengthening your mental capacities, and optimizing your health. The form of Energy Medicine I use was developed by Donna Eden and is described in her book, \"Energy Medicine\". ENERGY MEDICINE IS NOT THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Energy Medicine is a term used by many training programs that teach people how to assess and correct for energy imbalances in the body. I do not diagnose or treat medical or mental health disorders, nor am I trained or licensed to do so. Energy medicine attempts to optimize the body's overall health and vitality, but it is not to be used instead of appropriate care from a licensed professional. What's Energy testing? It's a tool which invites the body to reveal its truths. It assesses the flow of energy to give us the information we need to track our energies. We energy test by using your arm or leg. I'll ask you to \"hold\" or \"meet my pressure\" and will press down on your arm/leg for 2 seconds. I'll also teach you how to self-test. What's an EEM session like? Unlike a massage, you'll be fully dressed on the table with your shoes off. I don't do a lot of deep physical touch. Some will be deep, some light and some off the body. You are the one in charge of the session. We are a partnership and in order for you to succeed, you need to give me as much feedback as possible. Energy Medicine procedures are designed to enhance and balance the flow of the body's natural energies. You can expect me to approach my work with you in a professional manner, to honor scheduled appointment times, and to treat any information I learn about you as confidential. See more information under the EEM Session tab. How do I know if energy is moving during a session? Energy is so amazing that you can move energy in so many different ways. You can yawn, feel buzzing in your body, sigh, feel emotions, burp, feel your stomach grumble, etc. What does grounding mean? Grounding is the energetic connection we have to the earth, but we also need to be rooted. Being grounded affects us emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually. How can you start helping yourself right now? Start doing the Daily Energy Routing (DER) at least once or twice a day. The more you do it, the better you feel. See resources tab for videos you can use to follow along. Do you suggest self-care for in-between sessions? Yes! At the end of each session, exercises are suggested to support the positive changes that have been made and for continued healing. Simple tools like the Daily Energy Routine (DER). See resources tab for videos of the DER. What's Reiki? Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. See more information under the Reiki Sessions tab.
