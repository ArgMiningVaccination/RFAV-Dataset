SUBPART 7-2 Children's Camps (Statutory Authority: 1390, 1394, 1395, 1399-a; L. 2012, ch. 501) Subdivision (o) of section 7-2.5 is amended to read as follows: (o) The camp operator shall pr ovide adequate supervision. Adequate supervision shall mean: (1) supervision such that a camper is pr otected from any unreasonable risk to his or her health or safety, includi ng physical or sexual abuse or any public health hazard; [and] (2) as a minimum, there shall exist visu al or verbal communications capabilities between camper and counselor during ac tivities and a method of accounting for the camper's whereabouts at all times[.]; and 4 (3) at camps required to comply with secti on 7-2.25 of this Subpart, protection from any unreasonable risk of experiencing an occurrence which would constitute a reportable incident as defined in section 7-2.25(h)(4) of this Subpart. Section 7-2.24 is amended to read as follows: Variance; waiver. (a) Variance - i [I]n order to allow time to comply w ith certain provisions of this Subpart, an operator may submit a written request to th e permit-issuing official for a variance from a specific provision(s) when the health and sa fety of the children attending the camp and the public will not be prejudiced by the variance, and where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in immediate comp liance with the provision. An operator must meet all terms of an approved variance(s) in cluding the effective date, the time period for which the variance is granted, the requiremen ts being varied and any special conditions the permit-issuing official specifies.

(b) Waiver - i [I]n order to accept alternative arra ngements that do not meet certain provisions of this Subpart but do protect the safety and health of the campers and the public, an operator may submit a written request to the permit-issuing official for a 5 waiver from a specific provision of this Subpart . Such request shall in dicate justification that circumstances exist that are beyond the control of the operator, compliance with the provision would present unnecessary hardship a nd that the public and camper health and safety will not be endangered by granting such a waiver. The permit-issuing official shall consult with a representative of the State De partment of Health prior to granting or denying a waiver request.

Such report shall be provided in a form and manner as required by the Justice Center. 7 (j) Employee Screening, Tr aining, and Code of Conduct (1) Prior to hiring anyone who will or may have direct contact with campers, or approving credentials for any camp staff, the operator shall follow the procedures established by the Justice Ce nter in regulations or pol icy, to verify that such person is not on the Justice Center's sta ff exclusion list established pursuant to section 495 of the Social Services Law. If such person is not on the Justice Center's staff exclusion list, the operator shall also consult the Office of Children and Family Services State Central Regist ry of Child Abuse and Maltreatment as required by section 424-a of the Social Se rvices Law. Such screening is in addition to the requirement that the opera tor similarly verify that a prospective camp staff is not on the sexual abuse regi stry, as required by section 7-2.5(l) of this Subpart.

(1) The camp operator shall cooperate fully with the investigation of reportable incidents involving campers with developm ental disabilities a nd shall provide all necessary information and access to conduc t the investigation. The camp operator shall promptly obtain an appropriate medi cal examination of a physically injured camper with a developmental disability. The camp operator shall provide information, whether obtained pursuant to th e investigation or otherwise, to the Justice Center and permit-issuing offici al upon request, in the form and manner requested. Such information must be provi ded in a timely manner so as to support completion of the investigation subject to the time limits set forth in this subdivision. (2) Unless delegated by the Justice Center to a delegate investigatory agency as defined in subdivision seven of Section 488 of the Social Services Law, incidents of abuse or neglect, as defined in subdi vision eleven of Section 488 of the Social Services Law, shall be investigated by the Justice Center. With regard to all other reportable incidents, as defined in Sec tion 488 of the Social Services Law, the permit-issuing official shall initiate a prom pt investigation of an allegation of a reportable incident, which shall commence no later than five business days after notification of such an incident, unless the Justice Center agrees that it will undertake such investigation. Additional ti me for completion of the investigation 10 may be allowed, subject to the approval of the department, upon a showing of good cause for such extension. At a minimu m, the investigation of any reportable incident shall comply with the following: (i) Investigations shall include a review of medical records and reports, witness interviews and statements, expert assessments, and the collection of physical evidence, obser vations and information from care providers and any other information th at is relevant to the incident. Interviews should be conducted by qua lified, objective individuals in a private area which does not allow those not participating in the interview to overhear. Interviews must be co nducted of each party or witness individually, not in the presence of other parties or witnesses or under circumstances in which other parties or witnesses may perceive any aspect of the interview. The person alleging th e incident, or who is the subject of the incident, must be offered the opport unity to give his/her version of the event. At least one of the persons conducting the interview must have an understanding of, and be able to accommodate, the unique needs or capabilities of the person being inte rviewed The procedures required by this Subparagraph (i) may be altered if , and only to the extent necessary to, comply with an applicable co llective bargaining agreement. (ii) All evidence must be adequately protected and preserved. 11 (iii) Any information, including but not limited to documents and other materials, obtained during or resulting from any investigation shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise permissible under law or regulation, including but not limited to Article 11 of the Social Services Law. (iv) Upon completion of the inves tigation, a written report shall be prepared which shall include all relevant findings and information obtained in the investigation and details of steps taken to investigate the incident. The results of the investigat ion shall be promptly reported to the department, if the investigation was not performed by the department, and to the Justice Center. (v) If any remedial action is necessa ry, the permit-issuing official shall establish a plan in writing with the camp operator. The plan shall indicate the camp operator's agreement to the remediation and identify a follow-up date and person responsible for moni toring the remedial action. The plan shall be provided, and any measures ta ken in response to such plan shall be reported, to the department and to the Justice Center. (vi) The investigation and written re port shall be completed and provided to the department and the Justice Center within 45 days of when the incident was first reported to the Justice Center. For purposes of this 12 section, \"complete\" shall mean that all necessary information has been obtained to determine whether and ho w the incident occurred, and to complete the findings referenced in paragraph (l)(2)(iv) of this subdivision. (3) (i) The camp shall maintain a facility in cident review committee, composed of members of the governin g body of the children's camp and other persons identified by the camp operator, includi ng some members of the following: camp administrative staff, direct support staff, licensed health care practitioners, service recipients, the permit-issuing official or designee and representatives of family, consumer and other advocacy organizations, but not the camp director. The camp operator shall convene a facili ty incident review panel to review the timeliness, thoroughness and appropriateness of the cam p's responses to reportable incidents; recommend additional opportunities for im provement to the camp operator, if appropriate; review incident trends and patterns concer ning reportable incidents; and make recommendations to the camp opera tor to assist in reducing reportable incidents. The facility inci dent review panel shall meet at least annually, and also within two weeks of the completion of a written report and remedial plan for a reportable incident. (ii) Pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 490 of the Social Services Law and regulations of the Justice Center, a camp operator may seek an 13 exemption from the requirement to establish and maintain an incident review committee. In order to obtain an exem ption, the camp operator must file an application with the permit-issuing official, at least sixty days prior to the start of the camp operating season, or at any time in the case of exemptions sought within the first three months following the e ffective date of this provision. The application must provide sufficient docum entation and information to demonstrate that that compliance would present undue hardship and that granting an exemption would not create an undue risk of harm to campers' health and safety. The permit-issuing official shall consult with the State Department of Health (department), and shall not gr ant or deny an application for an exemption unless it first obtains department approval for the proposed decision. An operator must meet all terms of an approved exempti on(s), including the c ondition that it will remain in effect for one year unless re voked by the permit-issuing official, subject to department approval, or the facility changes operators. Any application for renewal shall be made within 60 days pr ior to the start of the camp's operating season. The procedure set forth in this Subpa ragraph (ii) shall be used instead of the general procedures set forth in section 7-2.24 of this Subpart. (m) In addition to the requirements specified by subdivisions (d) and (g) of section 7-2.4 of this Subpart, a permit may be denied, revoked, or suspended if the children's camp fails to comply with regulations, policies, or other requirements of the Justice Center. In 14 considering whether to issue a permit to a children's camp, the permit-issuing official shall consider the children's camp's past and current compliance with the regulations, policies, or other requireme nts of the Justice Center. 15 Regulatory Impact Statement Statutory Authority: The Public Health and Health Planning C ouncil is authorized by Section 225(4) of the Public Health Law (PHL) to establish, am end and repeal sanitary regulations to be known as the State Sanitary Code (SSC), subj ect to the approval of the Commissioner of Health. Article 13-B of the PHL sets forth sa nitary and safety requirements for children's camps. PHL Sections 225 and 201(1)(m) au thorize SSC regulation of the sanitary aspects of businesses and activities affecting public health including ch ildren's camps. Legislative Objectives: In enacting to Chapter 501 of the Laws of 2012, the legislature established the New York State Justice Center for the Prot ection of People with Special Needs (Justice Center) to strengthen and sta ndardize the safety net for vul nerable people that receive care from New York's Human Services Agenci es and Programs. Th e legislation includes children's camps for children with developmental disabi lities within its scope and requires the Department of Health to prom ulgate regulations approved by the Justice Center pertaining to incident management . The proposed amendments further the legislative objective of protecting the health and safety of vulnerable children attending camps in New York State (NYS). 16 Needs and Benefits: The legislation amended Article 11 of So cial Services law as it pertains to children's camps as follows. It: included overnight, summer day and tr aveling summer day camps for children with developmental disabilities as faciliti es required to comply with the Justice Center requirements. defined the types of incident required to be reported by children's camps for children with developmental disabilities to the Justice Center Vulnerable Persons' Central Registry. mandated that the regulations pertaining to children's camps for children with developmental disabilities are amende d to include incident management procedures and requirements consistent with Justice Center guidelines and standards. required that children's camps for child ren with developmental disabilities establish an incident review committee, recognizing that the Department could provide for a waiver of that requ irement under certain circumstances required that children's camps for children with developmental disabilities consult the Justice Center's staff exclusion li st (SEL) to ensure that prospective employees are not on that list and to, wh ere the prospective employee is not on 17 that list, to also consult the Office of Children and Family Services State Central Registry of Child Abuse and Maltre atment (SCR) to determine whether prospective employees are on that list. required that children's camps for child ren with developmental disabilities publicly disclose certain information rega rding incidents of a buse and neglect if required by the Justice Center to do so. The children's camp regulations, Subpart 7-2 of the SSC are being amended in accordance with the aforem entioned legislation. Compliance Costs: Cost to Regulated Parties: The amendments impose additional require ments on children's camp operators for reporting and cooperating with Department of He alth investigations at children's camps for children with developmenta l disabilities (hereafter \"camps\"). The cost to affected parties is difficult to estimate due to variati on in salaries for camp staff and the amount of time needed to investigate each reported incide nt. Reporting an incident is expected to take less than half an hour; assisting with th e investigation will range from several hours to two staff days. Using a high estimate of st aff salary of $30.00 an hour, total staff cost would range from $120 to $1600 for each investigation. Expenses are nonetheless expected to be minimal statewide as be tween 40 and 50 children's camps for children with developmental disabilities operate each year, with combined reports of zero to two 18 incidents a year statewide. Accordingly, any individual camp will be very unlikely to experience costs related to reporting or investigation. Each camp will incur expenses for contact ing the Justice Center to verify that potential employees, volunteers or others fa lling within the definition of \"custodian\" under section 488 of the Social Services Law (collectively \"employ ees\") are not on the Staff Exclusion List (SEL). The effect of a dding this consultation should be minimal. An entry level staff person earning the minimu m wage of $7.25/hour should be able to compile the necessary information for 100 empl oyees, and complete th e consultation with the Justice Center, within a few hours. Similarly, each camp will incur expenses for contacting the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) to determine whet her potential employees are on the State Central Registry of Child Abuse and Maltre atment (SCR) when consultation with the Justice Center shows that the prospective em ployee is not on the SEL. The effect of adding this consultation should also be minima l, particularly since it will not always be necessary. An entry level staff person earni ng the minimum wage of $7.25/hour should be able to compile the necessary informa tion for 100 employees, and complete the consultation with the OCFS, within a few hours. Assuming that each employee is subject to both screens, aggregate staff time required sh ould not be more than six to eight hours. Additionally, OCFS imposes a $25.00 screening fee for new or prospective employees. Camps will be required to disclose info rmation pertaining to reportable incidents to the Justice Center and to the permit issui ng official investigati ng the incident. Costs 19 associated with this include staff time for locating information and expenses for copying materials. Using a high estimate of staff sa lary of $30.00 an hour, and assuming that staff may take up to two hours to locate and copy the records, typical cost should be under $100. Camps must also assure that camp staf f, and certain others, who fall within the definition of mandated reporters under secti on 488 of the Social Services Law receive training related to mandated reporting to the Justice Center, and the obligations of those staff who are required to report incidents to th e Justice Center. The costs associated with such training should be minimal as it is ex pected that the training material will be provided to the camps and will take about one hour to review during routine staff training. Camps must also ensure that the telephone number for the Justice Center reporting hotline is conspicuously posted for ca mpers and staff. Cost associated with such posting is limited, related to making and posting a copy of such notice in appropriate locations. The camp operator must also provide each camp staff member, and others who may have contact with campers, with a c opy of a code of conduct established by the Justice Center pursuant to Sec tion 554 of the Executive Law. The code must be provided at the time of initial employment, and at least annually thereafter during the term of employment. Receipt of the code of conduc t must be acknowledged, and the recipient must further acknowledge that he or she ha s read and understands it. The cost of providing the code, and obtai ning and filing the required employee acknowledgment, 20 should be minimal, as it would be limited to copying and distribu ting the code, and to obtaining and filing the acknowledgments. Staf f should need less th an 30 minutes to review the code. Camps will also be required to establish and maintain a facility incident review committee to review and guide the camp's respons es to reportable incidents. The cost to maintain a facility incident review committee is difficult to estimate due to the variations in salaries for camp staff and the amount of time needed for the committee to do its business. A facility incident review committ ee must meet at least annually, and also within two weeks after a repor table incident occurs. Assuming the camp will have several staff members participate on the committee, an average sa lary of $50.00 an hour and a three hour meeting, the cost is estimated to be $450.00 dollars per meeting. However, the regulations also provide the opportunity for a camp to seek an exemption, which may be granted subject to Department approval ba sed on the duration of the camp season and other factors. Accordingly, not all camps can be expected to bear this obligation and its associated costs. Camps are now explicitly required to obt ain an appropriate medical examination of a camper physically injured from a repor table incident. A medical examination has always been expected for such injuries. Finally, the regulations add noncomp liance with Justice Center-related requirements as a ground for denying, revoking, or suspending a camp operator's permit. 21 Cost to State and Local Government: State agencies and local governments that operate children's camps for children with developmental disabilities will have the sa me costs described in the section entitled \"Cost to Regulated Parties.\" Currently, it is estimated that five summer day camps that meet the criteria are operated by municipalities. The regulation imposes additional requirements on local health departments for re ceiving incident reports and investigations of reportable incidents, and providing a copy of the resul ting report to the Department and the Justice Center. The total cost for these services is difficult to estimate because of the variation in the number of incidents and amount of time to investigate an incident. However, assuming the typically used estimate of $50 an hour for health department staff conducting these tasks, an investigation genera lly lasting between one and four staff days, and assuming an eight hour day, the cost to investigate an inci dent will range $400.00 to $1600. Zero to two reportable incidents occur statewide each year, so a local health department is unlikely to bear such an expense. The cost of submitting the report is minimal, limited to copying and mailing a copy to the Department and the Justice Center. Cost to the Department of Health: There will be routine costs associated with printing and dist ributing the amended Code. The estimated cost to print revised code books for each regulated children's camp in NYS is approximately $1600. There will be additional cost for printing and distributing training materials. The expenses will be minimal as most information will be 22 distributed electronically. Local health depa rtments will likely include paper copies of training materials in routine corresponde nce to camps that is sent each year. Local Government Mandates: Children's camps for children with deve lopmental disabilities operated by local governments must comply with the same requirements imposed on camps operated by other entities, as described in the \"Cost to Regulated Partie s\" section of this Regulatory Impact Statement. Local governments serv ing as permit issuing officials will face minimal additional reporting and investigation re quirements, as described in the \"Cost to State and Local Government\" s ection of this Regulatory Imp act Statement. The proposed amendments do not otherwise impose a new program or responsibilities on local governments. City and county health depa rtments continue to be responsible for enforcing the amended regulations as part of their existing progr am responsibilities. Paperwork: The paperwork associated with the amendment includes the completion and submission of an incident report form to the local health department and Justice Center. Camps for children with developmental disabili ties will also be required to provide the records and information necessary for LHD inve stigation of reportable incidents, and to retain documentation of the results of their c onsultation with the Just ice Center regarding whether any given prospective employee was found to be on the SEL or the SCR. 23 Duplication: This regulation does not duplicate any exis ting federal, state, or local regulation. The regulation is consistent with regula tions promulgated by the Justice Center. Alternatives Considered: The amendments to the camp code are mandated by law. No alternatives were considered. Consideration was given to including a cure period to afford camp operators an opportunity to correct violations associated with this rule; howe ver, this option was rejected because it is believed that lesse ning the department's ability to enforce the regulations could place this al ready vulnerable population at greater risk to their health and safety. Federal Standards: Currently, no federal law governs the operation of children's camps. Compliance Schedule: The proposed amendments are to be eff ective upon filing with the Secretary of State. 24 Contact Person: Katherine Ceroalo New York State Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Rm. 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, New York 12237 (518) 473-7488 (518) 473-2019 (FAX) REGSQNA@health.state.ny.us 25 Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for Small Business and Local Government Types and Estimated Number of Small Businesses and Local Governments: There are between 40 and 50 regulated children's camps for children with development disabilities (38% are expected to be overnight camps and 62% are expected to be summer day camps) operating in New Yo rk State, which will be affected by the proposed rule. About 30% of summer day camps are operated by municipalities (towns, villages, and cities). Typical regulated children's camps representing small business include those owned/operated by corporations, hotels, mo tels and bungalow colonies, non-profit organizations (Girl/Boy Scouts of America, Cooperative Extension, YMCA, etc.) and others. None of the proposed amen dments will apply solely to camps operated by small businesses or local governments. Compliance Requirements: Reporting and Recordkeeping: The obligations imposed on small bus iness and local government as camp operators are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regulated Parties,\" \"Local Government Mandates,\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. The obliga tions imposed on local government as the permit issuing official is described in \"Cos t to State and Local Government\" and \"Local Government Mandates\" portions of the Regulatory Impact Statement. 26 Other Affirmative Acts: The obligations imposed on small busin ess and local government as camp operators are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regulated Parties\" \"Local Government Mandates,\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Professional Services: Camps with 20 percent or more deve lopmentally disabled children are now explicitly required to obtain an appropriat e medical examination of a camper physically injured from a reportable incident. A medical examination has always been expected for such injuries. Compliance Costs: Cost to Regulated Parties: The obligations imposed on small bus iness and local government as camp operators are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regulated Parties\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Cost to State and Local Government: The obligations imposed on small bus iness and local government as camp operators are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in the 27 \"Cost to Regulated Parties\" section of the Regulatory Impact Statement. The obligations imposed on local government as the permit issui ng official is described in \"Cost to State and Local Government\" and \"Local Governme nt Mandates\" portions of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Economic and Technological Feasibility: There are no changes requ iring the use of technology. The proposal is believed to be economically feasible for impacted parties. The amendments impose additional reporting and i nvestigation requirements that will use existing staff that already have similar job re sponsibilities. There are no requirements that that involve capital improvements. Minimizing Adverse Economic Impact: The amendments to the camp code are mandated by law. No alternatives were considered. The economic impact is already minimized. Consideration was given to including a cure period to afford camp operators an opportunity to correct violations associated with this rule; howe ver, this option was rejected because it is believed that lesse ning the department's ability to enforce the regulations could place this al ready vulnerable population at greater risk to their health and safety. 28 Small Business Participation and Local Government Participation: No small business or local government pa rticipation was used for this rule development. The amendments to the camp code are mandated by law. Ample opportunity for comment will be provided as part of the process of promulgating the regulations, and training will be provided to affected entities with regard to the new requirements. 29 Rural Area Flexibility Analysis Types and Estimated Number of Rural Areas: There are between 40 and 50 regulated children's camps for children with development disabilities (38% are expected to be overnight camps and 62% are expected to be summer day camps) operating in New Yo rk State, which will be affected by the proposed rule. Currently, th ere are seven day camps and ten overnight camps operating in the 44 counties that have population less than 200,000. There are an additional four day camps and three overnight camps in the nine counties identified to have townships with a population density of 150 pers ons or less per square mile. Reporting and Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements: Reporting and Recordkeeping: The obligations imposed on camps in ru ral areas are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regulated Parties\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Other Compliance Requirements: The obligations imposed on camps in ru ral areas are no different from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regulated Parties\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. 30 Professional Services: Camps with 20 percent or more develo pmentally disabled children are now explicitly required to obtain an appropriat e medical examination of a camper physically injured from a reportable incident. A medical examination has always been expected for such injuries. Compliance Costs: Cost to Regulated Parties: The costs imposed on camps in rural areas are no differe nt from those imposed on camps generally, as described in \"Cost to Regul ated Parties\" and \"Paperwork\" sections of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Economic and Technological Feasibility: There are no changes requ iring the use of technology. The proposal is believed to be economically feasible for impacted parties. The amendments impose additional reporting and i nvestigation requirements that will use existing staff that already have similar job re sponsibilities. There are no requirements that that involve capital improvements. 31 Minimizing Adverse Economic Impact on Rural Area: The amendments to the camp code are mandated by law. No alternatives were considered. The economic impact is already minimized, and no impacts are expected to be unique to rural areas. Consideration was given to including a cure period to afford camp operators an opportunity to correct violations associated with this rule; howe ver, this option was rejected because it is believed that lesse ning the department's ability to enforce the regulations could place this al ready vulnerable population at greater risk to their health and safety. Rural Area Participation: No rural area participation was used for this rule development. The amendments to the camp code are mandated by law. Am ple opportunity for comment will be provided as part of the process of promulgating the routine regulations, and training will be provided to affected entities with regard to the new requirements. 32 Job Impact Statement No Job Impact Statement is required pursu ant to Section 201-a (2)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. It is a pparent, from the nature of the proposed amendment that it will have no impact on j obs and employment opportunities, because it does not result in an increase or decrease in current staffing level requirements. Tasks associated with reporting new incidents types and assisting with the investigation of new reportable incidents are expect ed to be completed by existing camp staff, and should not be appreciably different than that al ready required under current requirements. 33 Emergency Justification Chapter 501 of the Laws of 2012 established the Justice Center fo r the Protection of People with Special Needs (\"Justice Center\") , in order to coordinate and improve the State's ability to protect those persons having various physical, developmental, or mental disabilities and who are receiving serv ices from various facilities or provider agencies. The Department must promulgate re gulations as a \"state oversight agency.\" These regulations will assure proper coordination with the efforts of the Justice Center. Among the facilities covered by Chapter 501 are children's camps having enrollments with 20 percent or more developmentally disabled campers. These camps are regulated by the Department and, in some cases, by local health departments, pursuant to Article 13-B of the Public Health Law and 10 NYCRR Subpart 7-2. Given the effective date of Chapter 501 a nd its relation to the start of the camp season, these implementing regulations must be promulgated on an emergency basis in order to assure the nece ssary protections for vulnerable persons at such camps. Absent emergency promulgation, such persons would be denied initial coordinated protections until the 2014 camp season. Pr omulgating these regulations on an emergency basis will provide such protecti on, while still providing a full opportunity for comment and input as part of a formal rulemaking process which will also occur 34 pursuant to the State Administrative Procedures Act. The Department is authorized to promulgate these rules pursuant to secti ons 201 and 225 of the Public Health Law. Promulgating the regulations on an emergenc y basis will ensure that campers with special needs promptly receive the coordina ted protections to be provided to similar individuals cared for in other settings. Such protections include reduced risk of being cared for by staff with a history of in appropriate actions such as physical, psychological or sexual abuse towards persons with special needs. Perpetrators of such abuse often seek legitimate access to children so it is critical to camper safety that individuals who that have committed such acts are kept out of camps. The regulation provides an additional mechanism for camp operators to do so. The regulations also reduce the risk of incidents involvi ng physical, psychological or sexual abuse towards persons with special needs by ensuring that such occurrences are fully and completely investigated, by ensuring that camp staff are more fully trained and aware of abuse and reporting ob ligations, allowing staff and volunteers to better identify inappropriate staff behavi or and provide a mechanism for reporting injustice to this vulnerabl e population. Early detection and response are critical components for mitigating injury to an indi vidual and will prevent a perpetrator from hurting additional children. Finally, prompt enactment of the proposed regulations will ensure that occurrences are fully invest igated and evaluated by the camp, and that measures are taken to reduce the risk of re-occurrence in the future. Absent emergency adoption, these benefits and prot ections will not be available to campers 35 with special needs until the formal rulemaki ng process is complete, with the attendant loss of additional protections against abuse and neglect, including physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS This proposal will amend Part 405 (Hos pitals - Minimum Standards), primarily with respect to pediatric pr ovisions and also to update various provisions to reflect current practice. Hospitals, for the purposes of Part 405, pertain to general hospitals. Proposed amendments to Section 4 05.1 (Introduction) specify that the requirements of Part 405 relating to patient care and services will appl y to patients of all ages, including newborns, pediat ric and geriatric patients. Proposed amendments to Section 4 05.3 (Administration), which currently requires hospitals to provide to the State E ducation Department (\"SED\") a written report whenever enumerated professionals licen sed by SED lose hospital employment or privileges for certain reasons, will require si milar reporting to the Department of Health for certain individuals licensed by such Department. Proposed amendments to Section 405.6 (Q uality Assurance Program) will require hospital quality assurance processes to incl ude a determination that the hospital is admitting only those patients for whom it has appropriate staff, resources and equipment and transferring those patients for whom th e hospital does not have the capability to provide care, except under conditions of disa sters or emergency surge that may require admissions to provide care to those patients. 2 A new subdivision (d) is added to Sec tion 405.7 to require hospitals to post and provide a copy of a Parent's Bi ll of Rights, setting forth the rights of patients, parents of minors, legal guardians or other persons w ith decision-making authority to certain minimum protections required under other provisi ons of these regulations. In particular, the Parent's Bill of Rights would advise that patients may not be discharged from the hospital or the emergency room until any tests that could reasonably be expected to yield \"critical value\" results - result s that suggest a life-threaten ing or otherwise significant condition such that it requires immediate me dical attention - are reviewed by a physician, physician assistant (PA), and/or nurse prac titioner (NP) and are communicated to the patient, his or her parents or other decision-makers as appropriate. Proposed amendments to Section 405.9 (Admission/Discharge) specify that a hospital will be required to adm it pediatric patients consistent with its ability to provide qualified staff, space and size appropriate equipment necessary for the unique needs of pediatric patients. If the hos pital cannot meet these requireme nts, it will be required to develop criteria and policies a nd procedures for transfer of pediatric patients. This section also requires hospitals to develop pol icies and procedures permitting at least one parent/guardian to remain with a pediatric patient at all times, to the extent possible given the patient's health and safety. Proposed amendments will also require hospitals to develop and implement written policies a nd procedures pertaining to review and communication of laboratory and diagnostic test/service result s to the patient and, if the patient is not legally capable of making d ecisions, the patient's parent, legal guardian, health care agent or health care surrogate, as appropriate and subject to all applicable 3confidentiality laws and regula tions. Such policies and procedures must ensure that no discharge will occur while the results of a test that reasonably could be expected to yield a \"critical value\" are pending so as to assure ap propriate care is provided to the patient. Further, all communication with the patient, parent, legal guardian, etc. must be clear and understandable to the recipient. In addition, the hospital must ask the patient or the patient's representative for the name of th e patient's primary care provider, if known, and forward lab results to such provider. This proposal also updates Section 405.12 (Surgical Services), which currently requires hospitals to develop and implement e ffective written policies and procedures, to provide that such policies and procedures include the performa nce of surgical procedures, the maintenance of safety controls and the inte gration of such services with other related services of the hospital to protect the health and safety of the patients in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical pract ice and patient care. The amendments will also require hospitals to assu re that the privileges of each practitioner performing surgery are commensurate with his or her training a nd experience. Precautions must be clearly identified in written policies and procedures specific to the surgical service and post anesthesia care unit (\"PACU\") includi ng appropriate resuscitation, airway and monitoring equipment including a resuscitat ion cart with age a nd size appropriate medications, equipment and supplies. Updates to Section 405.13 (Anesthesia Services), which currently require hospitals to develop and implement effectiv e written policies and procedures on matters 4such as the administration of anesthetics, the maintenance of safety controls and the integration of such services with other re lated services of the hospital. Under the amendments, such policies and procedures will have to be reviewed and updated at least biennially. In addition, hospita ls will have to establish c linical competencies that are relevant to the care provided and, at a minimum, include inst ruction in safety precautions, equipment usage and inspections, infection cont rol requirements and any patients' rights requirements pertaining to surgical/anesthesia consents. The amendments further provide that all equipment and services provid ed must be age and size appropriate. Updates to Section 405.14 (Res piratory Care Services) wi ll provide that orders for respiratory care services, in addition to sp ecifying the type, frequency and duration of treatment, and as appropriate, the type and dose of medication, the type of diluent, and the oxygen concentration, must be consistent with generally accepted standards of care. The amendments further provide that all e quipment and services provided must be age and size appropriate. Updates to Section 405.15 (Radiologic and Nuclear Medicine Services) will specify that care must be provided in accord ance with generally accepted standards of practice. The amendments will also require that policies and procedures regarding imaging studies for newborns and pediatric pa tients must include standards for clinical appropriateness, appropriate radiation dose and beam collimation, image quality and patient shielding. In addition, a policy and pr ocedure must be developed to ensure that the practitioner's order for an imaging study is specific to the body part (s) that are to be 5imaged. Quality improvement audits must ve rify that these policies and procedures are being followed and must include a review of the adequacy of diagnostic images and interpretations. Radiation safety principles must be adequate to ensure compliance with all generally accepted standards of practice as well as pertinent laws, rules and regulations. The amendments also provide that the chief of ra diology, in conjunction with the radiation safety officer, must ensure that all practitioners who utilize ionizing radiation equipment within the hospital are prop erly trained in radia tion safety procedures for patients of all ages. The amendments to Section 405.15 also will update the megavoltage (\"MEV\") requirements for therapeutic radi ology or radiation oncology serv ices to provide that they utilize six or more MEV unit with a source-axis distance of 100 or more centimeters as the primary unit in a multi-un it radiation oncology service. In addition, as amended, the regulations will require each therapeutic radi ology service to have full time New York State licensed radiation therapists sufficient to meet the needs of the service and also a New York State licensed radia tion therapy physicist who will be involved in treatment, planning and dosimetry as well as calibrating the equipment. The amendments will also change a reference to an MEV unit so that it instead refers to a linear accelerator. A computed tomography (\"CT\") scanner must be available within the radiation therapy program that is equipped for radiation oncol ogy treatment planning or arrangements must be made for access to a CT scanner on an as ne eded basis. Provisions must be made for access to a magnetic resonance imaging (\"MRI\" ) scanner for treatment planning purposes on an as needed basis. 6 Updates to Section 405.17 (Pharmaceutical Services) will require hospital pharmacy directors, in conjunction with desi gnated members of the medical staff, to ensure that for patients of all ages, weight must be measured in kilograms and that resources relating to drug inte ractions, drug therapies, side effects, toxicology, dosage, indications for use, and routes of administra tion are available to the professional staff. Pediatric dosing resources must include ag e and size appropriate fluid and medication administration and dosing. Dosing must be weight based and not exceed adult maximum dosage, or in emergencies, length based, with appropriate references for pediatric dosing available. The amendments will further requir e the director to ensure that the pharmacy quality assurance program include monitori ng and improvement activities to identify, measure, prevent and/or mitigate adverse drug events, adverse drug reactions and medication errors in accordance with genera lly accepted standards and practices in the field of medication safety and quality improve ment. All drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in accordance w ith written policies and procedures to maximize patient safety and quality of care. Updates to Section 405.19 (Emergency Se rvices) provisions will require at least one clinician on every shift to have the skills to assess and manage a critically ill or injured pediatric patient and be able to resusc itate a child. The dire ctor of the hospital's emergency service, attending physicians, s upervising nurses, regi stered professional nurses (\"RNs\"), physician assistants (\"PAs\" ) and nurse practitioners (\"NPs\") must satisfactorily complete and be current in Pe diatric Advanced Life Support (\"PALS\") or 7have current training equivalent to PALS. Hospitals with less than 15,000 unscheduled emergency visits per year do not need to have the supervising or attending physician present, but such supervising or attending physician must be available within 30 minutes of \"patient presentation\" provi ded that at least one physician, NP, or PA is on duty in the emergency service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, the amendments will requir e hospitals to develop and implement protocols specifying when supervising or atte nding physicians must be present. In no event shall a patient be discharged or tran sferred to another hosp ital, unless evaluated, initially managed, and treated as necessary by an appropriately privileged physician, PA or NP. Specifically, no discharge should occur while the results of a test that reasonably could be expected to yield a \"critical value\" ar e pending so as to assure appropriate care is provided. The amendments will also require hospitals to develop and implement written policies and procedures pertaining to review and communication of laboratory and diagnostic test/service resu lts ordered for a patient rece iving emergency services to the patient and, if the patien t is not legally capable of making decisions, the patient's parent, legal guardian, health care agent or health care surrogate, as appropriate and subject to all applicable confidentiality laws and regulations. Further, policies and procedures must ensure that all communication with the patient, pare nt of a minor, legal guardian, etc. must be clear and understandable to the recipient. In addition, the hospital must ask the patient or the patient's representative for the name of the patient's primary care provider, if known, and lab result s must be forwarded to such provider. 8 Section 405.20 (Outpatient Services) re quires outpatient services, including ambulatory care services and extension clinics to be provided in a manner which safely and effectively meets the needs of all patients. Written policies must be in place for admission of patients whose postoperative st atus prevents discharge and necessitates inpatient admission to a hospital capable of providing the appropriate level of care. Section 405.22 (Critical Care and Special Care Services) adds new provisions regarding Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PIC U) Services. A \"PICU\" is defined as a physically separate unit that pr ovides intensive care to pediatric patients (infants, children and adolescents) who are cri tically ill or injured. It must be staffed by qualified practitioners competent to care for critically i ll or injured pediatric patients. \"Qualified practitioners\" are practitioners functioning within his or he r scope of practice according to State Education Law and who meets the hospital's criteria for competence, credentialing and privileging practitioners in the management of critically ill or injured pediatric patients. PICUs must be approve d by the Department and the governing body must develop written policies and procedur es for operation of the PICU in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical care for critically ill or injured pediatric patients. The PICU must have a minimum average annual pediatric patient number of 200/year. It must provide medical oversight for interhospita l transfers of cr itically ill or injured patients during transf er to the receiving PICU. The PICU must be directed by a board certified pediatric medical, surgical, anesthesiology or critical car e/intensivist physician who mu st be responsible for the 9organization and delivery of PICU care and has specialized training and demonstrated competence in pediatric critical care. Su ch physician in conjunction with the nursing leadership responsible for the PICU must pa rticipate in administrative aspects of the PICU. All hospitals with PICUs must have a physicia n, notwithstanding emergency department staffing, in-house 24 hours per day w ho is available to provide bedside care to patients in the PICU. PICU physician a nd nursing staff must successfully complete and be current in pediatric advanced life support (PALS) or have current training equivalent to PALS. The hospital must have an organized quality performance improvement program for PICU services and include monitoring of volume and outcomes, morbidity and all case mortality review, regular multidisciplinary conferences including all health professionals involved in the care of PICU patients. Failure to meet one or more regulatory requirements or inac tivity in a program for a peri od of 12 months or more may result in actions, including, but not limited to, withdrawal of approval to serve as a PICU. No PICU can discontinue operation without first obtaining written approval from the department and must give written notifica tion, including a closure plan acceptable to other department at least 90 days prior to planned discontinuance of PICU services. A hospital must notify the department in writing within 7 days of any significant changes in its PICU services, includi ng, but not limited to: (a) any temporary or permanent suspension of services or (b) difficulty m eeting staffing or workload requirements. 10 Section 405.28 (Social Servic es) is updated to current standards that care be provided under the direction of a qualified soci al worker who is licensed and registered by the New York State Education Department to practice as a licensed master social worker (LMSW) or licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), with the scope of practice defined in Article 154 of the Education Law. 11Pursuant to the authority vested in the P ublic Health and Health Planning Council and subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Health by paragraph (2) of section 2803 of the Public Health Law, Part 405 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York is hereby amended to be effective upon publication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register to read as follows: Section 405.1 is amended to read as follows: 405.1 Introduction. * * * (e) The requirements of this Part relating to patient care and serv ices shall apply to patients of all ages, including newbor ns, pediatric and geriatric patients.

PHL Artic le 28 (Hospitals), Section 2800 specifies that \"Hospital and related services including health-related service of the highest quality, efficiently provided and properly utilized at a reasonable cost, are of vital concern to the public health. In order to provide for the pr otection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants of the state . . . , the depart ment of health shall have the central, comprehensive responsibility for the developm ent and administration of the state's policy with respect to hospital and related services . . . .\" PHL Section 2803(2) authori zes the Public Health a nd Health Planning Council (\"PHHPC\") to adopt and amend rules and regul ations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, to implement the purposes and provisions of PHL Article 28, and to establish minimum standards governing the ope ration of health care facilities. 73 Legislative Objectives: The legislative objective of PH L Article 28 includes the protection of the health of the residents of the State by assuri ng the efficient provision and proper utilization of health services, of the highest qu ality at a reasonable cost. Needs and Benefits: These amendments are promulgated to update various Part 405 pe diatric and general hospital provisions including surgical , anesthesia, radiology and pharmacy and emergency services. Pediatrics is a unique, distinct part of medicine which is very different than adult medicine. Historically, chil dren have often been seen as small adults. This has changed over time and it is now recogni zed that certain areas of pediatric care such as emergency, critical care and me dication dosing require specialized knowledge, skills and equipment. Part 405 of Title 10 NYCRR sets forth general hospital minimum standards. In 2010, the New York State Emergency Medical Serv ices for Children (\"EMS-C\") Advisory Committee recommended and the Department determined that Part 405 needed to be updated to address the unique needs of ch ildren. A comprehensive approach was necessary to make sure that hospitals are admitting children for whom it has appropriate staff, resources and equipment and that policies and procedures are in place for 74transferring those patients for whom the hospital does not have the capability to provide care, except under conditions of disasters and emergency surge situations. Many facilities that once had dedicated pediatric units have closed or reduced their units, resulting in a reduced focus on pediatric care. Currently, the pediatric provisions need strengthening as they do not sp ecifically address minimum st andards for pediatric critical or emergency care. Pediatric care has b ecome much more sophisticated and requires highly trained staff with expert ise in the particular requirements for caring for children. In addition, various Part 405 s ubdivisions have been updated for all patients including surgical, anesthesia, radiologic and nucl ear medicine, pharmaceutical and emergency services to reflect current practice. The Department, in conjunction with th e EMS-C Advisory Committee, carefully reviewed Part 405 of Title 10 and proposes numerous updates and amendments. In particular, significant changes have been made to the Emergency, Radiology and Pharmacy provisions and new provisions are added regarding sta ndards for Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs). New provi sions will require age appropriate equipment and supplies. The new provisions assure that personnel in the emergency department and pediatric intensive care unit have the skills to access and manage a critically ill or injured pediatric patient, includi ng resuscitation. Changes in technology and equipment for diagnostic medical imaging and appropriate use of such equipment are addressed. Policies and procedures regarding imaging stud ies for newborns and pediatric patients are updated to include standards for clinical ap propriateness, appropria te radiation dosage and beam collimation, image quality and patient shielding. Pharmacy and equipment 75requirements for pediatric patients are revise d to assure age and size appropriate dosing. The regulations clarify that pediatric dosing must be weight based and all patients must be weighed in kilograms. Current regula tions require Advanced Cardiac Life Support (\"ACLS\") training or current tr aining equivalent to ACLS fo r adults but do not require Pediatric Advanced Life Support (\"PALS\") or current training equi valent to PALS for appropriate staff that will be caring for children within the hospital. These regulations address this inequity. This regulatory proposal attempts to strengthen minimum standards for the care of child ren that are flexible enough to fit the large tertiary care facilities as well as rural and community hospi tals. This measure also requires that if laboratory and other diagnostic tests/services are ordered for a patient while receiving emergency services, the hospital must de velop and implement written policies and procedures pertaining to the review and communication of th e laboratory and diagnostic test/service results to the patient, the patient's parent, legal guardian or health care agent, or surrogate, if known, and the patient' s primary provider, if known. These regulations, requiring hospitals provide patients and their parents or other medical decision makers with critical information a bout the patient's care a nd to provide and post a Parent's Bill of Rights, and another set of regulations requiring hospitals to adopt protocols to identify and treat sepsis, were inspired by the case of Rory Staunton, a 12- year old boy who died of sepsis in April of 2012. Both sets of regulations, together known as \"Rory's Regulations,\" will help New York State set a \"gold standard\" for patient care. 76Costs for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the Regulated Entity: Costs that may be incurred by the regulat ed parties could include PALS training, accommodations for parent(s) to stay with thei r child at all times, review and update of various policies and procedures, pharmacy requirements regarding weight based dosing and the requirement of a board certified pe diatric medical, surgical, or anesthesiology critical care/intensivist phys ician who has demonstrated comp etence in pediatric critical care to direct PICU services. The cost of providing and posting the Parent's Bill of Rights should be minimal. Regulated parties mu st also ensure that their equipment is age and size appropriate. PALS certification costs can range from $0- $300. Currently there are grant funded opportunities for PALS certificat ion. Accommodations for parents may be able to be arranged with existing resources, but could al so require additional furnishings. What accommodation costs would be incurred depends on the hospital involved. Review and update of the various policies and procedures and the pharmacy requirements could be accomplished with existing staff imposing little or no additional cost to the regulated parties. The \"average\" salary of a board certified medical, surgical, pediatric, or anesthesia intensivist to direct the PICU would be approximately $187,192. Hospitals will need to inventory their equipment and suppl ies to ensure that th ey are size and age appropriate and provide accordingly. Pediat ric dosing resources must include age and 77size appropriate fluid and medication admini stration dosing information if not already currently provided. Cost to State and Local Government: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to St ate or local government as a result of these regulations, except that hospitals operated by the State or local governments will incur minimal costs as discussed above. Cost to the Department of Health: There will be no additional costs to the De partment associated with the implementation of this regulation. Existing staff will be uti lized to conduct surveilla nce of the regulated parties and monitor compliance with these provisions. Local Government Mandates: Hospitals operated by State or local governments will be aff ected and be subject to the same requirements as any other hos pital licensed unde r PHL Article 28. Paperwork: 78This measure will require facilities to deve lop various written policies and procedures with respect to: transfers of pediatric patie nts when unable to appropriately and safely care for them, enabling parents/guardians to st ay with pediatric patients, assurance that staff privileges are commensurate with trai ning and experience, assurance that various equipment is age and size appropriate, im aging studies and orders. In addition, monitoring and improvement activities to iden tify, measure, prevent or mitigate adverse drug events, and for a hospital that provides PICU services policies and procedures for the operation of the PICU in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical care for critically ill or injured pediatric patients. For hospitals with less than 15,000 unscheduled emergency visits per year, the hospital must develop and implement protocols sp ecifying when supervising or attending physicians must be present. (Such faciliti es must have at least one physician, nurse practitioner, or licensed phys ician assistant on duty in the emergency service 24 hours a day, seven days a week). Duplication: These regulations will not conflict w ith any state or federal rules. Alternative Approaches: 79There are no viable alternatives to this regu latory proposal. All gene ral hospitals must be able to admit pediatric patients consistent with its ability to provide qualified staff, size and age appropriate equipment necessary for th e unique needs of pediatric patients. If the hospital cannot meet these requirements, it will be required to develop criteria and policies and procedures for tran sfer of pediatric patients. Consideration was made when developing th e Pharmaceutical Services provisions in Section 405.17, that for pediatric patients only weight must be measured in kilograms. Upon further consideration it was determined th at it was more appropria te to require that weight be measured in kilogr ams for patients of all ages. When developing the Critical Care and Special Care Services for provisions for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) services in Section 405.22 the Department initially considered a minimum bed standard of si x beds. Upon further consideration it was determined that a minimum standard would not be a bed standard but instead require that a PICU must have a minimum average annual pediatric patient numbe r of 200/per year. Federal Requirements: These regulations will not conflict w ith any state or federal rules. Compliance Schedule: 80These regulations will take effect upon public ation of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register, but genera l hospitals will have 90 days from such date to comply with these provisions.

Ceroalo NYS Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Room 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, NY 12237 (518) 473-7488 (518) 473-2019 - FAX REGSQNA@health.state.ny.us 81REVISED REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESS A ND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Effect of Rule: These regulations will apply to the 228 general hospitals in New York State. A recent survey conducted by the Department determin ed that 32 hospitals in New York State currently have a pediatric intensive care unit (\"PICU\"). The proposed amendments will apply Statewide, including 18 general hospi tals operated by local governments. These hospitals will not be affected in any way different from a ny other hospital. The operation of a PICU is not mandated by the State but is at the option of the hospital. Compliance Requirements: The literature supports the regulatory changes made to general hospital minimum standards with respec t to pediatric care . These provisions specify that general hospitals in New York State must ensure that at leas t one clinician on every shift in the emergency department has the skills to assess and manage a critically ill or injured pediatric patient and be able to resuscitate a child. This standard is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics (see Pediatrics 1995; 96:526). This measure al so states that policies and procedures regarding imaging studies for newborns and pedi atric patients must include standards for clinical appropriateness, appropr iate radiation dosage and beam collimation, image quality and patient shie lding. Medical imaging policies must provide age and 82weight-appropriate dosing for children receiving studies invo lving ionizing radiation as supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Emergency Physicians ( Pediatrics 2009; 124:1223). Pediatric pharmacy resources must include age and size appropria te fluid and medication admi nistration and dosing. Dosing must be weight based and weight must be measured in kilograms as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics; ( Pediatrics 2003;111:1120). Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) or equivalent training will be required for appropriate staff that will be caring for children in the hospital, a pract ice supported by the Am erican Academy of (Pediatrics 1995;96:526). The PICU shall have a medical director w ho has received special training and has demonstrated competence in pediatric critic al care as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Societ y of Critical Care Medicine ( Pediatrics 2004; 114: 1114). PICU medical and nursi ng directors shall be responsible for promoting and verifying pediatric qualificati ons of staff, overseeing pedi atric quality assurance and developing and reviewing PICU care policies consistent with recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of Critical Care Medi cine, Pediatrics 2004; 114: 1114. PICUs must have a minimum aver age annual patient number of 200/year. This is consistent with the recommendation made in the American College of Surgeons' Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient, 2006. 83Cure Period: Chapter 524 of the Laws of 2011 requires agen cies to include a \"cure period\" or other opportunity for ameliorative action to preven t the imposition of penalties on the party or parties subject to enforcement when developi ng a regulation or expl ain in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis why one wa s not included. This regulati on creates no new penalty or sanction. Hence, a cure pe riod is not necessary. Professional Services: The majority of facilities have in-house staff that could make any required changes to the policies and procedures. Sma ll facilities may contract with outside professional staff from the various disciplines to assist them. Compliance Costs: A hospital that wants to provide PICU services must have an intensivist who has received special training and has demonstrated competen ce in pediatric care to direct the PICU. Currently, the majority of PICUs in New York State already have an intensivist in their employ. According to Jobs-Salary.com, the average pediatric intensivist salary is $187,712, with a range from $100,651 to $280,000. PALS training ranges from $0-300. 84 Economic and Technological Feasibility: This proposal is economically and technically feasible. Minimizing Adverse Impact: General hospitals will have 90 days from th e effective date of these regulations to implement these provisions In addition, at pr esent; grant funding is available for PALS certification. Small Business and Local Government Participation: This proposal has been discussed and revi ewed by the EMS-C Advisory Committee, the Greater New York Hospital Association (\"GNYHA\" ), the Healthcare Association of New York State (\"HANYS\"), the Iroquois Hospita ls Association and the State Hospital Pharmacy Association. 85RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Effect of Rule: The provisions of these regulations will apply to general hospitals in New York State, including the 47 general hospitals located in rural areas of the State. These hospitals will not be affected in any way different from any other hospital. Compliance Requirements: Compliance requirements are applicable to t hose hospitals located in rural areas. Compliance will require the admission of pedi atric patients only if qualified staff and appropriate equipment are available. Furthe r, compliance will require the adoption and implementation of policies and procedures ta ilored to the pediatric patient related to surgery, anesthesia, respiratory care, ra diologic and nuclear medicine, pharmacy, emergency medicine, etc. ensuring the pediat ric patient is appropr iately cared for by skilled staff with the appropriate eq uipment in the appropriate location. Professional Services: Professional services for hospitals in rural ar eas are not expected to be impacted as a result of these regulations differe ntly than other hospitals. 86 Compliance Costs: Costs for general hospitals in rural areas will be the same as for general hospitals in nonrural areas. Cost that may be incurred by the regulated partie s could include PALS training, accommodations for parent(s) to stay with their child at al l times, review and update of various policies a nd procedures, pharmacy requirements regarding weight based dosing and the requirement of a board certified pediatric medical, surgical, or anesthesiology critical care/i ntensivist physician who has demonstrated competence in pediatric critical care to direct PICU services. Regulated parties must also ensure that their equipment is age and size appropriate. PALS certification costs can range from $0-$300. Currently there are grant funded opportunities for PALS certificat ion. Accommodations for parents may be able to be arranged with existing resources, but could al so require additional furnishings. What accommodation costs would be incurred depends on the hospital involved. Review and update of the various policies and procedures and the pharmacy requirements could be accomplished with existing staff imposing little or no additional cost to the regulated parties. The \"average\" salary of a board certified medical, surgical, pediatric, or anesthesia intensivist to direct the PICU would be approximately $187,192. Hospitals will need to inventory their equipment and suppl ies to ensure that th ey are size and age appropriate and provide accordingly. Pediat ric dosing resources must include age and size appropriate fluid and medication admini stration dosing information if not already currently provided. 87 Minimizing Adverse Impact: Adverse impact will be minimized through th e provision of time sufficient to comply with the regulations. Hospitals will have a minimum of 90 days following adoption of these regulations to adopt and implement sepsis protocols and at leas t six months before information to inform risk adjusted mortality measures will have to be reported to the Department. Rural Area Participation: These regulations have been discussed with hos pital associations that represent hospitals throughout the state, including thos e that are located in rural ar eas. The associations are supportive of this initiative. 88REVISED JOB IMPACT STATEMENT Nature of Impact: These provisions will not have a significant impact on jobs. A PICU in any New York State general hospital must be directed by a board certified pediatric medical, surgical, anesthesiology or critical car e/intensivist physician who mu st be responsible for the organization and delivery of PICU care. Such intensivist must have specialized training and demonstrated competence in critical ca re. Hospitals that wa nt to provide PICU services may already have an inte nsivist to direct their unit. Categories and Numbers Affected: There are 32 hospitals in New York Stat e the report that th ey have a PICU. Regions of Adverse Impact: There are no regions of adverse impact. 89 Minimizing Adverse Impact: Hospitals will have 90 days from the effective date of these regulations to implement the provisions. In addition, at present, there is grant funding available for PALS certification. Pursuant to the authority vested in the Pub lic Health and Health Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health by Section 225 of th e Public Health Law, Section 12.3 of Title 10 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rule s and Regulations of the State of New York is amended, to be effective 90 days after pub lication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register, to read as follows: 12.3 Precautions to be observed for the prevention of hemorrhagic diseases and coagulation disorders of the newborn and in fants related to vitamin K deficiency. It shall be the duty of the a ttending physician, licensed midw ife, registered professional nurse or other licensed medical profe ssional attending the newborn to assure administration of a single [parenteral] intramuscular dose of 0.5 - 1.0 mg of [natural] vitamin [K1;] K1 oxide (phytonadione) within [one hour] six hours of birth in accordance with current standards of medical care. 2REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Paragraph (4) of Section 225 of the Public Health Law gives the Public Health and Health Planning Council authority to promulga te this regulation with the approval of the Commissioner of Health. Legislative Objectives: The proposed rule expands the time window for the administration of vitamin K to newborn infants to remove a barrier to moth ers completing the first breastfeeding prior to routine procedures, such as vitamin K administration. Needs and Benefits: Current hospital regulations (10 NYCRR \u00a7 12.3) require administration of Vitamin K to the newborn within one hour of birth. This short time period has been identified as a barrier in ensuring that new mothers and their infants have the recommended 30- 60 minutes of uninterrupted time fo r mother-infant skin-to-skin contact to complete the first breastfeeding before routine pr ocedures occur, such as vitamin K administration. There are no medical reasons to require that vitamin K be administer ed to newborns within one hour of birth. This proposed rule expands the time window for administration of vitamin K to newborns from within one hour to within six hours of birth, which is consistent with the 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement and with the position statement of the Canadian Pediatric Soci ety, Fetus and Newborn Committee (originally issued 1997). A public health goal of the New York State Department Health is to 3increase exclusive breastfeeding, and rem oving this barrier may help promote and support early initiation and exclusive breas tfeeding during the birth hospitalization. Costs: Costs to the State Government: The rule does not impose any new costs on state government. Costs to Local Government: The rule does not impose any new costs on local government. Costs to Private Regulated Parties: The proposed rule would have very minima l costs for hospitals. Minimal costs for hospitals may include the co st of changing the hospital policy and procedures for administering vitamin K to newborn infants and the costs of training staff to inform them of the change. Vitamin K will continue to be administered to newborn infants in the same manner and the same dose as is done currently under 10 NYCRR \u00a712.3. The proposed rule will simply change the current re gulation to allow for greater flexibility. Costs to the Regulatory Agency: The rule does not impose any new costs on any regulatory agency. 4 Local Government Mandates: The rule imposes no mandates upon any county, c ity, town, village, sc hool district, fire district, or other sp ecial district. Paperwork: The rule imposes no new reporting require ments, forms, or other paperwork upon regulated parties. Hospitals were and will continue to be required to document the administration of vitamin K. Duplication: There are no relevant rules or other le gal requirements of the Federal or State governments that duplicate, overlap , or conflict with this rule. Alternatives: The Department considered other possible time frames. Extending the window for the administration of vitamin K to newborns from within one hour to within six hours was consistent with the recent recommendation of the 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement and with the position statemen t of the Canadian Pediatric Society, Fetus and Newborn Committee (originally issued 1997). Federal Standards The rule does not exceed any minimum standa rds of the federal government for the same or similar subject area. 5Compliance Schedule: The proposed effective date will be upon public ation of a Notice of Adoption in the State Register.

Three general hospitals in the State are considered small businesses. These small business hospitals will not be affected differently from any other hospital. Compliance Requirements: Compliance requirements are applicable to those three hospitals considered small businesses as well as the 18 hospitals opera ted by local governments. Compliance will require: (a) reviewing and cha nging written policy for the admi nistration of vitamin K to newborn infants; and (b) traini ng applicable providers and st aff about the change in the timeframe for administering vitamin K. Professional Services: Professional services are not anticipated to be impacted as a result of the following: (a) changing the timeframe for administration of vitamin K to newborn infants; and (b) training providers and staff about the cha nge in the timeframe for administering vitamin K. Compliance Costs: Compliance costs associated with these regu lations will be minimal and will arise as a 7result of: (a) changing written policy and pr ocedures for administering vitamin K to newborn infants; and (b) informing staff about the change in the timeframe for administering vitamin K to newborn infants. This will apply to those hospitals defined as small businesses. Economic and Technological Feasibility: It is economically and technologi cally feasible for small busin esses to comply with these regulations. Minimizing Adverse Impact: There are no adverse impacts anticipated. This regulatory change incr eases the flexibility of administering vitamin K. Hospitals will have a minimum of 90 days following adoption of these regulations to change th eir policy and protocols for administering vitamin K to newborn infants and three m onths to inform staff about the change. Small Business and Local Government Participation: These regulations have been discussed with le adership from the Hosp ital Association of New York (HANYS), the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), and the Iroquois Healthcare Alliance. These associa tions represent hospita ls throughout the State of New York, including t hose that are small businesses and operated by local governments. These three associations were all supportive of this initiative. 8Cure Period: Chapter 524 of the Laws of 2011 requires agen cies to include a \"cure period\" or other opportunity for ameliorative action to preven t the imposition of penalties on the party or parties subject to enforcement when developi ng a regulation or expl ain in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis why one wa s not included. This regulati on creates no new penalty or sanction. Hence, a cure period is not required. 9 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Effect of Rule: The provisions of these regulations will apply to general hospitals in New York State, including 47 general hosp itals located in rural areas of the State. These hospitals will not be affected in any way differe nt from any other hospital. Compliance Requirements: Compliance requirements are applicable to those hospitals located in rural areas. Compliance will require: (a) reviewing and ch anging written policy for the administration of vitamin K to newborn infants; and (b) info rming applicable staff about the change in the timeframe for admi nistering vitamin K. Professional Services: Professional services will not be impacted as a resu lt of these regulations. Compliance Costs: Compliance costs associated with these regu lations will be minimal and will arise as a result of: (a) changing written policy and pr ocedures for administering vitamin K to newborn infants; and (b) tr aining staff about the change in the timeframe for administering vitamin K to newborn infants. This will apply to those hospitals located in rural areas of New York State. 10Minimizing Adverse Impact: There are no adverse impacts anticipated. This regulatory change incr eases the flexibility of administering vitamin K. Hospitals will have a minimum of 90 days following adoption of these regulations to change th eir policy and protocol for administering vitamin K to newborn infants and three mont hs to inform staff about the change. Rural Area Participation: These regulations have been discussed with hos pital associations that represent hospitals throughout the State, including th ose that are located in rura l areas. These associations have been supportive of this initiative. 11JOB IMPACT STATEMENT No Job Impact Statement is required pursu ant to section 201-a( 2)(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. It is a pparent, from the nature of the proposed amendment, that it will not have a substant ial adverse impact on jobs and employment opportunities. Newborn infants are still required to have a single dose of vitamin K after birth. This medication will be provided in th e same setting (hospital or birthing facility) by staff with similar credentials, and the pro cedure will take the same amount of time. The change in the regulation will just wi den the time window which this medication may be given, from within 1 hour of bi rth to within 6 hours of birth. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS This rule amends Sections 700.2 and 717.3 a nd Parts 793 and 794 of Title 10 (Health) of NYCRR, the operational rules for hospices appr oved to provide services in New York State under Article 40 of the P ublic Health Law.

Section 4002 of the Public Health Law is am ended by adding a new subdivision 5 to read as follows: \"Terminally ill\" means an i ndividual has a medical prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is approximately one year or less if the illness runs its normal course. Legislative Objective: PHL Article 40 provides for Hospice care to offer persons with terminal illness an appropriate palliative care alternative to curative treatments and to protect such vulnerable individuals through the imposition of care delivery standards for providers. It is the legislative intent th at hospice's interdisciplinary program and innovative approach to home and inpatient services be available st atewide. These proposed regulations further this objective by expanding the de finition of terminal illness to allow individuals the benefit of hospice care earlier in their terminal illness to manage their symptoms on an ongoing basis, thereby reducing the need for co stly emergency room visits and hospital stays. Needs and Benefits: The proposed rule making was necessitated by changes in the federal conditions of participation/rules for hospice providers and recent Medicaid Redesi gn Initiatives. State rules have been revised and reordered to be consistent with federal rules to facilitate provider compliance and surveilla nce activities. Revi sions to federal and state rules are 67 intended to improve care delivery proce sses and support performance improvement activity at the provider level. Additionally, amendments were necessitated by Chapter 441 of the Laws of 2011, signed by the Governor on August 17, 2011 and Medicaid Redesign efforts to expand hospice benefits. Individuals could benefit from receiving hospice services earlier in their terminal i llness, by having their symptoms managed on an on-going basis, thereby reducing the need for emergency room visits and hospital stays. Costs: Costs to Regulated Parties: Nominal costs may be incurred by hospice providers if coordination, management and documentation of care has not been effec tively implemented by the hospice; or if data driven, outcome based quality assessm ent and performance improvement activities have not been taking place. These nominal costs are associated with federal quality assessment and performance improvement progr am requirements and would have to be incurred regardless of the proposed regulator y changes. There are currently 48 hospices in New York State. Costs to the Agency and to the State and Local Governments Including this Agency: The change in hospice patient eligibility which allows individuals with a 12 month life expectancy to elec t the hospice benefit, has been estimated to have a net aggregate increase in gross Medicaid expenditures of $1,704,658. The aggregate NY State and Local Government share of th e increase in Medicaid expenditures is approximately $400,000 for State government, and another $400,000 for local governments in the aggregate. Pursuant to 42 CFR Section 447.205, the Department gave public notice in December 2011 to am end the NYS Medicaid Plan for hospice 68 services to expand access to the hospice benefit. No additional costs are anticipated for the Agency or for State and Local Governments. Local Government Mandates: There are no local mandates in this ru le. However, 6 counties operate hospice programs and will be required to meet thes e rules in the same manner as will private entities, as there is no exemption author ity for publicly sponsored programs. Paperwork: Under the proposed rules, providers w ill now be required to report verified incidences of mistreatment or abuse to the De partment of Health and or state/local bodies having jurisdiction, as required by federal rule s. All other reporti ng requirements are consistent with existing regulations. Duplication: Proposed rules will be duplicative of, but c onsistent with, federal rules. There are no known conflicts with federal rules; consistency should f acilitate provider compliance and improve effectiveness of surveillance processes. Alternatives: The Department could choose to retain existing standards in which case federal rules would supersede State rules where gaps or inconsistency exist. This option was rejected as it would be confusing to bot h providers and surveyors. Furthermore, conforming state requirements to the federal re quirements will facilitate the enforcement of both. Federal Standards: Section 418 of 42 CFR sets forth the fe deral rules for hospices. The proposed State rules are consistent with federal rule s, but do exceed federal rules as follows: 69 The quality assessment and performan ce improvement section includes the requirement to have a quality committee to assure comprehensive representation and involvement in quality activities and to assure a broader quality overs ight process at the provider level. This is a state requirement that is not included in the federal rules. Infection control includes standards for prevention and management of HIV and other bloodborne pathogen infections, cons istent with existing standards for all provider types in NYS. The standards exceed federal rules by including the required program specifications. The responsibilities of th e governing body are more cl early delineated in the proposed rules than in the federal rules, including implementation of a complaint investigation procedure and re quiring that the governing body obtain a Health Commerce System account for communication with the Department. The proposed rule specifically states th e requirements for contracts, including management contracts, to ensure hospice a nd provider accountability and governing body responsibilities. Such requirements ar e not stated in the federal rules. Health requirements for personnel are specific and consistent with other provider types in NYS to assure adequate patient care protection. Job descriptions, employee identification and pers onnel records are also requi red as appropriate business practices. These requirements are not stated in the federal rules. Compliance Schedule: As the amendments ensure conformance w ith federal standards that were already in effect as of December 3, 2008, and any st ate requirements exceeding federal rules are already in effect, regulated pa rties should already be in comp liance, and should readily be able to comply as of the eff ective date of these regulations. 70 Contact Person: Katherine Ceroalo New York State Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Rm. 2438 Empire State Plaza Albany, New York 12237 (518) 473-7488 (518) 473-2019 (FAX) REGSQNA@health.state.ny.us 71 REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSI S FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Effect of Rule: Local governments will not be affected by this rule except to the extent that they are providers of hospice services. There are 6 county-based hospice providers. The small businesses which will be affected are hospice providers which employ fewer than 100 persons. There are approximately 36 small business hospices in NYS. Compliance Requirements: Regulated parties are expected to be in immediate compliance as these rules are consistent with federal standards already in effect as of Dec. 3, 2008, and rules that exceed the federal rules are already in place for existing hospice providers in NYS. The proposed regulations will create a new state reporting requirement, consistent with federal rules, for reporting verified instances of patient mistreatment , abuse or neglect to the Department or to other st ate and local authorities. The reporting will be done through existing complaint reporting mechanisms. The proposed regulations also require the hospice to report to the Department data on quality indicators a nd patient outcomes, which will be the basis for performance improvement activities. This may require additional staff training and el ectronic data systems at the hospice. The Department implemented a hospice quality initiative intende d to assist hospices with meeting this requirement. All other repor ting requirements mentioned in the proposed regulations currently exist for the hospice providers. The Department does not intend to publis h a small business regulation guide in connection with this regulation. Although a num ber of hospices are sm all businesses, the 72 impact is not expected to be substantial. Additional guidance will be posted on the web as needed after the regulation is promulgated. Professional Services: No additional professional staff are expected to be needed as a result of the regulations. Quality assessment and performance improvement requirements could be handled by existing staff with a ppropriate training, unless sta ff shortages already exist at the hospice. Compliance Costs: There are no capital costs associated w ith these proposed rules. Additional costs may be associated with maintaining and an alyzing data and carry ing out performance improvement activities. The costs for sm all businesses and county sponsored hospices should not be significantly different from the costs to other affected providers. Economic and Technological Feasibility: The Department has considered feasibility and believes the rules can be met with minimal economic and technological impact . Departmental resources have been identified to assist hospices with quality indicators and performance improvement. Other regulations should not affect the routine cost of doing business. Minimizing Adverse Impact: While the Department has considered the options of State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) Section 202-b(1) in developing this rule, flexibility does not exist for any particular entity sin ce the new requirements are consis tent with new federal rules already in effect. 73 Small Business and Local Government Participations: The Hospice and Palliative Care Associati on of NYS, which represents 47 of the 48 hospices statewide, were included dur ing the development of the proposed rulemaking. The Department will meet the re quirements of SAPA Section 202-b(6) in part by publishing a notice of proposed rulema king in the State Register with a comment period. The Department will also conduct a meeting with the State-wide provider associations representing hospices and county-based hospice providers. 74 RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: All counties in NYS have ru ral areas with th e exception of 7 dow nstate counties. Counties with rural areas are served by 34 of the existing 48 hospices in NYS. Reporting, Record Keeping and Other Co mpliance Requirements and Professional Services: Regulated parties are expected to be in immediate compliance as these rules are consistent with federal standards already in effect as of Dec. 3, 2008, and rules that exceed the federal rules are already in place for existing hospice providers in NYS. The proposed regulations will create a new state reporting requirement, consistent with federal rules, for reporting verified in stances of patient mistreatment, abuse or neglect to the Department or other state and local authorities. The reporting will be done through existing complaint reporting mechanisms . The proposed regulations also require the hospice to report to the Department data on quality indicators and patient outcomes, which will be the basis for performance improvement activities. This may require additional staff training and el ectronic data systems at the hospice. The Department implemented a hospice quality initiative intende d to assist hospices with meeting this requirement. All other repor ting requirements mentioned in the proposed regulations currently exist for the hospice providers. Additional quality indicator and outcome data will need to be maintained in support of the reporting of the quality indicators and patie nt outcomes. This can be accomplished by existing clinical and/or admi nistrative staff with appropriate training. Professional personnel required of the hospice is unchanged from existing requirements. 75 Costs: There are no capital costs a ssociated with these rules; any such costs would result from new federal rules, regardless of whether amendments were made to state regulation. Additional training of staff in quality asse ssment and performance improvement may be required to be in compliance with the requirements of the new federal rules. Minimizing Adverse Impact: While the Department has considered the options in State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) Section 202-bb(2)(b ), the proposed regulatory changes are consistent with new federal requirements. Th erefore, Department authority to minimize impact is limited. Adverse impact is expected to be minimal. Rural Area Impact: The Department will meet the requirements of SAPA Section 202-bb(7) in part by publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the State Register with a comment period. The Department will also conduct a meeting with the statewide provider organization representing hospice providers. 76 STATEMENT IN LIEU OF JOB IMPACT STATEMENT A Job Impact Statement is not required pursuant to Section 201-a(2)(a) of the State Administrative Proce dure Act. The proposed regulations are intended to be consistent with current federal rules and also expand the definition of \"terminal illness\" to allow expanded access to hospice services and improve patient care. It is apparent, from the nature and purpose of the proposed rule, that it will not have a substantial adverse impact on jobs or employment opportunities. Pursuant to the authority vested in the P ublic Health and Health Planning Council and subject to the approval of the Commissione r of Health by Section 2803 of the Public Health Law, Part 405 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York is hereby amended, to be effective upon publication of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Re gister, to read as follows: Section 405.2 of Part 405 is amended to read as follows: 405.2 Governing body .

A four level addition to the existing west wing of the hospital will primarily be used to accommodate continued inpatient surgical growth, which is to be accomplished through the addition of three new inpatient Class C orthope dic operating rooms (ORs) adjacent to the existing fourth floor surgical suite. This will increase the total inpatient ORs from 21 to 24. The addition will also include two sub-sterile rooms, a seven-room examination suite, an administrative suite, orthopedic storage areas, a mechanical equipment room, two new elevators and breakthrough connections to the existing third, fourth and fifth floors of the Hospital's West Wing. The addition of 10 medical/surgical beds will increase the Hospital's current certified bed total from 205 to 215. After the addition of the 10 beds, the bed complement will be: 201 Medical/Surgical, 10 Pediatric, and 4 Intensive Care. The additional beds will address the growth in volu me that the hospital is realizing and can be accommodated in the Hospital's current footprint, without any construction and with a capital cost of less than $300,000. DOH Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary The addition of 10 medical/surgical beds and 3 operating rooms will allow the hospital to meet the increasing demand for inpatient and outpatient services.

[AER] Council Action Date December 12, 2013. Project # 132009-C Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) is a 205-bed acute care hospital located at 535 East 70th Street, New York, 10021, in New York County. HSS seeks CO N approval to add 10 net new inpatient beds to its current certified capacity of 205 total beds for a new certified total beds complement of 215 and three (3) net new operating rooms (ORs) for a total of 24. Hospital for Special Surgery has the following certified beds and services: Table 1: Hospital for Special Surgery: Certified Capacity Bed Category Current Requested Upon Project Completion Medical / Surgical 191 +10 201 Intensive Care 4 4 Pediatric 10 10 Total 205 215 Table 2: Hospital for Special Surgery: Certified Services Ambulatory Surgery - Multi Specialty Audiology O/P Clinical Laboratory Service CT Scanner Magnetic Resonance Imaging Medical Social Services Medical/Surgical Nuclear Medicine - Diagnostic Pediatric Pediatric O/P Pharmaceutical Service Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation O/P Primary Medical Care O/P Radiology - Diagnostic Respiratory Care Therapy - Occupational O/P Therapy - Physical O/P Ther apy - Speech Language Pathology HSS is a member of New York Presbyterian Health care System and an affiliate of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. The hospital is authorized to provide health care at nine (9) sites in the New York metropolitan area. These sites provide outpatient services such as Physical Therapy, Primary Medical Care, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Diagnostic Radiology , and Ambulatory Surgery - Single Specialty. Hospital for Special Surgery is an acute care ho spital that specializes in orthopedic surgery. Approximately 97.0% of the hospital's inpatient disc harges are allocated to major diagnostic category diseases and disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. The facility's service area is comprised of non-NYS residents (33. 0%), all the boroughs of New York City and the New York metropolitan area (63.0%), and other NYS counties (4.0%). In 2008, HSS recorded 10,979 medical/surgical discharg es; by 2012, discharges increased by 23.1%, to 13,511. The average daily census (ADC) for these di scharges stood at 131 pati ents on any given day in 2008; then increased to 138 in 2009. The hospital's up ward trend in medical/surgical ADC continued in 2010, to 141 patients on any given day and reached a hi gh of 148 patients in 2012. At the same time, HSS experienced a marked decline in the average le ngth of stay (ALOS) of its medical/surgical discharges. During the period, medical/surgical ALOS declined by 7.0%, from 4.3 days in 2008 to 4.0 in 2012 (Table 3).

In 2008, HSS recorded 19,681 ambulatory surgery procedures; by 2012, the num ber increased by 34.6%, to 26,499 (Table 4). Table 4: Hospital for Special Surgery: Distribution of Ambulatory Surgery Cases Source: SPARCS 2008 - 2012 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 19,681 23,224 24,540 26,429 26,499 Need for Additional Operating Rooms and Inpatient Beds HSS's performs the majority of its cases on Monday through Friday. During these times the operating rooms exceed the maximum utilization rate, causing the hospital to be unable to accommodate new surgeons, the growing practices of current surgeons, or emergencies. In order to alleviate surgical constraints, HSS implemented an inpatient surgical schedule every other Saturday. However, the extent of the surgeries that can be done on Saturdays is limited by surgeon schedules and staff availability, and by the need to manage daily inpatient bed occupancy. Currently, there are 21 certified oper ating rooms at the facility. Duri ng the period from 2008 to 2012, the hospital averaged 12,346 and 24,075 inpat ient and outpatient inpatient and outpatient surgeries averaged 36,421 per year. The average per operating room was 1,734, which exceeded the general guideline of 1,200 cases per OR per year. There are several reasons that HSS seeks to increase its medical/surgical complement of beds. Firstly, the increase in inpatient admissi ons/discharges over the past seve ral years demonstrates market demand for its services. SPARCS data for the years 2008 - 2012, show t hat HSS's inpatient discharges have grown at an average annual rate of 5.8 percent per year. The applicant expe cts that the demand for its services will continue to grow at a rate of 4. 0 percent for the remainder of the decade. HSS also expects that the following factors will continue to contribute to its growth: broad geographic service area; the general aging of the population that is favorable for orthopedic surgery; and the number of revision surgeries to replace impl ants that have reached the end of their useful life expectancy. The facility's sustained growth in inpatient volume over the last five years was in part due to its improvement in ALOS, which allowed the hospital to tu rn over its beds. If HSS did not improve its ALOS, the hospital would have operated closer to the medica l/surgical optimum of 85.0 percent. HSS efficient discharge planning allows the hospital to have pati ents in the operating room while those in-house are being discharged. Project # 132009-C Exhibit Page 5 Conclusion The additional beds will allow HSS to meet the demand for its inpatient services as admission continues to increase at an average annual rate of about 5.8 pe rcent. The need for the additional operating rooms is supported by the facility's 7.7 percent annual rate of grow th in surgical cases over the last five years. The additional beds and OR's will also support the hospita l's current surgeons and assist in the recruitment of new orthopedic surgeons, which will help ensure ti mely access to inpatient surgical services. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Programmatic Analysis Program Description The Hospital for Special Surgery seeks approval to cons truct a four (4) level addition to its existing West Wing and add three (3) new inpatient Class C orthop edic operating rooms (ORs) adjacent to the existing fourth floor surgical suite, thus increasing the total inpatient ORs from 21 to 24.

Th e building will be 23 stories and approximately 759,615 square feet. The building is in the proximate location of the main campus, which will allow coordination between outpatient and inpatient services. The state-of-the art building is sufficient to meet the current ambulatory care demand and provide space to meet the anticipated growth projections through 2026. It should be noted that there are two companion applications being processed in tandem with this project; CON number 132037 and 13207, which will be discussed in separate reviews. The building will include: Clinic space for hematologic, thoracic, endocrinology, head, neck and other oncology services, including an outpatient bone marrow transplant program; Infusion rooms for standard chemotherapy and early stage trials of new drugs and biologic agents; Consultative services including, dental, speech and swallowing, cardiology, pulmonary, pre-surgical testing, cutaneous lymphoma and outpatient rehabilitation; Radiation oncology program including: three linear accelerators, one MRI simulation suite and one CT simulation suite; Diagnostic imaging program including: three angio/CT units and one PET/CT; An interventional radiology program including: chemotherapy and retail pharmacies, laboratory medicine and pathology services; Academic and administrative office space and a conference center. It is anticipated by 2026 the building will accommodate over 1,300 patients, 2,600 visitors and 1,600 staff per day. The facility will also be performing bone marrow transplants to patients on Saturdays, and Sundays. Memorial Hospital will reach capacity for both inpatient and outpatient services by 2014, given the current trend over the past three years. The applicant anticipates a stable market share during this period given three tre nds that currently exist: 1. Projections are consistent with the emerging trends in treating cancer patients as treatment shifts from inpatient to outpatient. 2. Cancer patients are receiving a longer course of treatment, which has allowed the patients to live longer. 3. Approximately 70% of the patients receive multiple medical treatments. This application is in res ponse to current trends, coupled with the projected number of individuals over age 60, which illustrate the challenges that Memorial will face in responding to the increasing incidence of cancer in the population over the next ten to fifteen years. This facility will serve New York City's five boroughs, Long Island's Nassau County, twelve counties in New Jersey, as well as Fairfield County in Connecticut. The increase in cancer is projected to rise by 20.2% between 2013 and 2030. Project # 131326-C Exhibit Page 2 The Hospital believes this proposal will enable the facility to promote more efficient use of space that currently impedes programs from functioning together seamlessly. It will also emphasize institutional-based service delivery; and enhance medical and health information technologies that will increase quality, efficiency, and patient safety. A design team studied the utilization assumptions and provide data with industry guidelines/standards, using a per square foot model for productivity and taking into account historical utilization patterns and the future model of the changing healthcare environment. This proposed site at 74 th Street will provide additional space to accommodate anticipated patient growth projections. DOH Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary Memorial Hospital for Ca ncer and Allied Diseases seeks approval to certify a hospital extension clinic, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Ambulatory Care Center. The facility will be an ambu latory care center specifically designed for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The building will contain enough space to meet current demand as well as projected growth and allow the hospital to transfer patients into an outpatient setting where appropriate. Program Summary Based on the results of this review, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's current compliance pursuant to 2802-(3)(e) of the New York State Public Health Law. Financial Summary Project costs of $1,506,019,991 will be met from the following: Equity of $150,674,316, operations / philanthropy of $505,345,675, and $850,000,000 in bond Budget in 4,076,888 Expenses: 3,951,366 Gain/ (Loss) $ 125,522 It should be noted that due to components of the project which are not reimbursable by Medicaid, the Total Reimbursable Projec t Cost is limited to $1,230,484,285.

Project # 131326-C Exhibit Page 4 Need Analysis Project Description Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases is a 514-bed acute care hospital located at 1275 York Avenue, New York, 10021, in New York County. The applicant seeks CON approval to certify a hospital extension clinic to be located on the far-east en d of the block between 73r d and 74th Streets and York Avenue and the FDR Drive, New York, in New York County. Background/Analysis Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Servic es has the following certified beds and services: Table 1: Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Services: Certified Beds by Service. Bed Category Capacity Intensive Care 20 Medical / Surgical 457 Pediatric 37 Total 514 Table 2: Proposed Services at the 74th Street Site: Service Add CT scanner Dental Linear Accelerator Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nuclear Medicine (Diagnostic) Nuclear Medicine (Therapeutic) Nutritional Pet Scanner Pharmaceutical Service Radiology - Diagnostic Radiology - Therapeutic Therapy - Occupational Therapy - Physical Therapy - Respiratory Therapy - Speech Language Pathology Transfusion Services - Limited Oncology O/P Memorial is authorized to operate 13 extension clinics in the following counties: Kings, New York, Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. These clinics provide out patient services such as diagnostic radiology, medical social services, nursing, pharmaceutical, primary medical care O/P, psychology, nutritional, clinical laboratory, CT scanner, magnetic resonan ce imaging, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and linear accelerator. Memorial has 514 total inpatient beds. In 2008, the hosp ital recorded 22,618 total inpatient discharges; by 2012, these discharges increased by 8.5 percent to 24 ,534 (Table 3). Memorial has a large service area. An average of 32 percent of the hospital's inpatient discharges are for patients that reside outside New York State, while 53.0 percent of discharges origin ate from Kings, New York, Queens, Suffolk, Nassau, and Westchester Counties. In 2000, the total cens us of the aforementioned counties was 9,909,272 residents; by the 2010 census period, the population increased by 2.0 percent to 10,103,290 and is projected to reach 10,327,907 by 2020. Project # 131326-C Exhibit Page 5 Table 3: Total Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS 2008 - 2012) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total Inpatient Discharges 22,618 23,423 24,381 24,468 24,534 During the five year time interval 1996-2000, the av erage cancer incidence for the residents of counties from which the hospital draws about 53 percent of its inpatients discharges was 47,225 ; by 2006-2010, this increased by 9.8 percent to 51,830. During the same period, cancer incidence in New York State increased by 11.6 percent from 93,112 to 103,907. The overall current patient visits for all of Memorial 's sites totaled 1,171,131. Of these, 3.0 percent, 23.3 percent and 39.6 percent were allocated to m agnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic radiology and primary medical care, respectively. The outpatient visits that Memorial saw on its main ca mpus will be moved to the new extension clinic. In 2010, the hospital recorded 116,489 visits, by 2012, thos e visits increased by 9.2 percent to 127,247. The facility expects the aforementioned to exceed 133,00 0 by the end of 2013 and increase to more than 142,000 by 2014. Imaging at the new site will support the complement of outpatient clinical programs in the building, as well as provide additional capacity for in stitutional growth. Patients will al so benefit by having all of their services in a single setting. Patients will be able to coordinate their appointments with physician visits and/or infusion treatments, thereby reducing travel ti mes, patient fatigue and the burden on the caregiver. Memorial indicates that in 2012, there were 24 2,056 outpatient diagnostic radiology procedures performed at its Manhattan sites. The facility expects its year one volume to increase slightly to 254,966 and reach 259,546 by year three (3). Memorial states that its current Interventional Radiology (IR) program is at maximum capacity. On average, its patients encounter a four -day wait time for procedure appointments. In order to ameliorate the issue, the hospital states that it has ex tended its hours of operation and offered weekend hours. However, by 2017, the hospital expects that the IR service capacity will be exhausted. This service will also relocate to the new building and be built with capacity for current demand and for future growth. The program will also support the other clinical programs in the ambulatory care center. The applicant's 2012 data show that the program recorded 7,081 IR procedur es; by the first year of operation the facility expects that these procedures will increase more t han twofold, to 17,723, and reach 16,250 by the third year of operation. The hospital recorded 22,505 radiation oncology proc edures in 2010; by 2012, said procedures increased by 4.0 percent to 23,414. The hospital will add 3 net new linear accelerators to support the program. Based on current use and the need as described below, the hospital has the usage to support the request. According to the need methodology set forth in sect ion 709.16, linear accelerators are expected to perform between 5,000 and 6,500 treatments per year. Based on 709.16, the public need for linear accelerators in New York City is: 1 Number of Cancer Cases per Year 37,840 2 60% will be Candidates for Radiation Therapy 22,704 3 50% of (2) will be Curative Patients 11,352 4 50% of (2) will be Palliative Patients 11,352 5 Course of Treatment for Curative Patients is 35 Treatments 397,322 6 Course of Treatment for Palliative patients is 15 Treatments 170,281 7 The Total Number of Treatments [(5)+(6)] 567,603 8 Need for MEV Machines in NYC (Each MEV Machine has Capacity for 6,500 Treatments) 87 9 Existing/Approv ed Resources 72 10 Remaining Need for MEV Machines 15 Project # 131326-C Exhibit Page 6 There is a remaining need for 15 linear Accelerators in New York City. If this project is approved, there will be a remaining need for 12 linear accelerators The new Ambulatory Care Center will support state- of-the-art early clinical trials of new drugs and biologicals (phase 1, 2 and 3 level protocols) ac ross the entire spectrum of malignant diseases, and investigate the efficiency of new pharmacology. T he space currently occupied by the outpatient clinics on the main campus will be reallocated for use by inpatient services. This will allow the hospital to address its inpatient needs for cancer patients that are i mmuno-compromised and in need of single occupancy rooms. Conclusion The new building will enhance Memorial's ability to provide cancer care and meet the oncology needs of the patients that choose to use the ho spital's services. It will also allow the hospital to continue to recruit new faculty, and implement state-of-the-art tech nology and medical treatment used in cancer care. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Programmatic Analysis Project Proposal Memorial Hospital for Cancer a nd Allied Diseases proposes to co nstruct a 23-story ambulatory care extension clinic. The Center will offer multidisci plinary care with all services under one roof. Approved services will be: CT Scanner; Dental; Linear Accelerator; (Occupati onal, Physical, Respiratory, and Speech Language Pathology); and Transfusion Services (Limited). Staffing will increase by 650.0 FTEs in the first y ear after completion and by an additional 23.0 FTEs by the third year of operation. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations This facility has no ou tstanding Article 28 surveillance or enf orcement actions and based on the most recent surveillance information, is deemed to be curr ently operating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules and regulations. This determination was made based on a review of the files of the Department of Health, incl uding all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Article 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints.

Category 2008 2009 2010 2012 Total Inpatient Discharges 22,618 23,423 24,381 24,468 24,534 The proposal will allow Memorial to: Consolidate all non-urgent clinical laboratory services under one roof and house the following laboratories/programs: o Hematology and Hemostasis; o Clinical Chemistry; o Microbiology and Infectious Disease; o Flow Cytometry; o Transfusion Medicine; o Cell Therapy; o Innovation Center; o Lab Administration; and o Academic Offices. Repurpose the space at the Main Campus for direct patient care and retain space for a Rapid Response Laboratory; and Develop expertise in three new program areas: o Education o Innovation o Outreach. The building will support Memorial's clinical services and an academic research and training platform for the next generation of laboratory medicine professiona ls. It is planned that the Lab will develop a formal Project # 132037-C Exhibit Page 4 outreach program that will provide proprietary spec ialized testing to peer institutions as a reference laboratory. Data from the facility show that its laboratory inpatient and outpatient volume in 2007 was about 2.9 million; by 2012, volume had increased to 3.9 million and is projected to reach approximately 4.5 million in 2016. The project will allow the hospital to improve its l aboratory services and ensure that the needs of its patients are met in a timely manner. The population to be served currently receives cancer care at Memorial's facilities. Conclusion The new building will allow the hospital to consolidat e all of its non-urgent laboratory services at one location and reallocate the facility's main campus spac es for direct patient care. The laboratory services will serve the entire populati on of Memorial's Cancer Center patient s, across all patient care sites and throughout the continuum of care. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Programmatic Analysis Program Description Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases (M emorial) proposes to construct a stand-alone, state- of-the-art laboratory building at 327 East 64th Street, New York, and be certified for clinical laboratory services. Currently, MHCAD's lab space is scattered throughout four separate buildings on their main campus. The new freestanding facility will serve as an anchor for a comprehensive Laboratory Medicine Service, thus allowing for consolidation and collocation of all non-urgent clinical lab services (which, in turn, should improve efficiency and consistency of processing specimens and reduce congestion at the main campus). In addition, the new laboratory building will provide expansion space, allow for repurposing of main campus space for direct patie nt care use, and provide an academic research and training platform to develop partnerships with area colleges and accredited medical technology programs to generate specialists in the field of m edical technology and laboratory medicine. Staffing will increase by 155.8 FTEs in the first year after completion and to 166.8 FTEs by the third year of operation. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations This facility has no outsta nding Article 28 surveillance or enfor cement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance information, is deemed to be curr ently operating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules and regulations. This determination was made based on a review of the files of the Department of Health, incl uding all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Article 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended.

In the event contributions do not meet the requ ired need, the applicant will use equi ty from its inter-corporate un- secured loan from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) at no interest and no stated term, for which payments only have to be made when the facility has excess cash flow, or the amount may be provided from operations. Working capital requirements are estimated at $8,562,333, which appears reasonable based on two months of third year incremental expenses. The app licant will provide equity from operations to meet the working capital requirement. BFA Attachment A are the 2012 certified financial statements of MHCAD, which indicate the availability of sufficient funds to meet the total project cost and the working capital requirements. The submitted budget indicates an incremental excess of expenses over revenues of $17,813,000 and $3,588,000 during the first and third years respecti vely. The budget used current utilization data and reimbursement methodologies for the procedures only. The reason for the projected incremental loss is due to depreciation and interest into the newly constr ucted facility. The loss will be absorbed through operations which the facility can absorb, as i ndicated on BFA Attachment A. The budget appears reasonable. BFA Attachment A is a financial summary of Memorial . As shown on BFA Attachment A, the hospital maintained an average positive working capital position and an average net asset position during the period shown. Also, the facility achieved an avera ge annual excess of operating revenues over expenses of $151,500,000 for the period shown.

Currently, the extension clinic is 52,638 square feet . The facility is expanding another 38,623 square feet, resulting in 91,261 total square feet. The extension site will serve principally the population from Long Island. Coupled with the current trend of treating cancer patients as outpatients and the increase in the duration of treatment, the applicant believes expansion will make it more efficient and possible for more outpatient services to be provided due to: additional office space for clinicians and physicians for surgical consultations and other office visits; increased Chemotherapy infusion bays by 18; increased support of pain management in a clinical setting; expanded chemistry lab services on-site. There are two companion projects being processed simultaneously, 131326 and 132037. All of these projects are part of Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases strategic plan to meet the current and future needs of the expanding clinical needs that are projected in the near future. DOH Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary Memorial Hospital for Ca ncer and Allied Diseases seeks approval increase the scope and capacity of their Suffolk County hospital extension clinic.

In comparison, during the same periods, cancer incidences in New York State in creased by 11.6 percent, from 93,112 to 103,907. Due to the increase in cancer incidence and the incr eased longevity of this population, Memorial states that the wait times for the next available appointment at the site have increased over the decade. The proposed expansion in space and in the range of ca ncer services for the service area population will decrease the length of time that pat ients have to wait to receive care and allow the facility to meet the needs of the patients in the service area. In addition to enhancing the patient's experience, anot her major goal of the expansion is to broaden the array and number of clinical trials available to Memo rial's patients from Suffolk County. Memorial states that the site has offered clinical trials to its patient s since 2005; however, space constraints limit the scope and number of protocols available to the patients. The curren t portfolio of clinical tria ls at the site is about 122. Memorial indicates that the proposed expansion w ill allow increases in the number of studies offered to a more diverse patient population in Suffolk County. The project will allow the hospital to improve through put and ensure that the needs of its patients are met in a timely manner. The population to be served current ly receives cancer surgical care at Memorial's main campus. The proposed expansion will allow the applicant to c ontinue to provide the needed care in the service area as the increase in cancer incidences continues, and the ov erall population grows.

Project # 122206-C Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Griffiss EC, LLC d/b/a Griffiss Eye Surgery Center, a single-specialty ambulatory surgery center, seeks approval to become a multi-specialty ambulatory surgery center by adding plastic surgery services to its current ophthalmology surgery servic es at 105 Dart Circle, Rome, 13441, in Oneida County. Griffiss EC also proposes to provide podiatry services. Upon a pproval, it will operate as Griffiss Surgery Center. Griffiss EC became operational on January 3, 2012 for a limited life of five years. Analysis The service area includes the greater Rome and Utica areas in Oneida County. The table below provides information on the projected payor mix. Projections CON 2,624 cases from March to December of 2012. From January to June 2013, there were 2,497 procedures performed. Medicaid was the primar y source of payment for 6.16 percent of the cases and the secondary source for 5.55 percent of the proced ures. Charity care is 2 percent. Griffiss is a participating provider with Medicaid and with all Medicaid managed care plans in Oneida and Madison Counties. Griffiss EC is committed to serving all persons in need of surgery regardless of the source of payment. Based on the current plastic surgery practice, the nu mber of projected procedures is 195 procedures in year 1 and 204 procedures in year 3. Currently, Oneida County has two single-speci alty (ophthalmology and endoscopy) freestanding ambulatory surgery There are no multi-specialty freestanding ASCs in Oneida County. Ambulatory Surgery Visits, 2012 (SPARCS) 2012 Mohawk Valley Endoscopy Center 5,534 In addition there is one freestanding ASC (inter ventional pain management services) that has been approved, but is not yet operational. Conclusion Currently, Oneida County does not have a freestandi ng ASC offering plastic surgery services. The proposed project will improv e access to such services for t he communities of Oneida and Madison Counties. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended with a continuation of the limited life expiring January 2, 2017.

Upon approval of this project, CON #071088, a proposal to construct a new 210-bed RHCF, will be withdrawn. The applicant states that 54 beds (certified as 42 temporary and 12 permanent) of the 87 bed total will be moved from the Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital Medical Center Skilled Nursing Facility (CVPH-SNF) to Meadowbrook. This brings the total of net new beds for Clinton County to 26 after adjusting for Meadowbrook Healthcare's seven temporary beds. The cost savings between CON #071088 and the current proposal is over $25 million; $40,858,627 compared to $15,528,968. The construction of Meadowbrook Healthcare's 87-bed addition will encompass a two story 48,730 square foot addition which will contain two neighborhood household units on each floor. The addition will be constructed by Meadowbrook Healthcare's landlord, Meadowbrook Realty Group, LLC, whose members and ownership percentages are identical to the members of Meadowbrook Healthcare. The members of Meadowbrook Healthcare have ownership interests in two other RHCF facilities located in New York State: Cortlandt Healthcare, LLC (which has been sold under CON 131054, contingently approved on 6/6/2013 by PHHP C) and South Shore NH, Inc. d/b/a South Shore Healthcare. Financial summaries are presented as BFA Attachments C and D. DOH Recommendation Contingent Approval. Need Summary Currently there is an unmet need for 126 beds in Clinton County, and the overall utilization rate for facilities in the county is 97.4%. Program Summary The expansion of Meadowbrook will provide critically needed nursing home beds to Clinton County. The design shows sensitivity to avoiding \"have/have not\" comparisons between existing and new nursing units. The new bedrooms will displace the inadequate temporary beds currently operated at CVPH and Meadowbrook, providing the residents greatly improved living areas. Financial Summary Meadowbrook Realty Group, LLC will fund the $15,528,968 in total project cost through a $2,489,046 equity contribution from its members and a $13,039,922 taxable HUD insured mortgage pursuant to Section 241/232, with a 30 year term at a Budget: Revenues: $23,963,200 Expenses: 23,541,624 Gain: $421,576 Subject to the noted contingencies, it appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner.

[AER] Council Action Date December 12, 2013. Project # 122281-C Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background CGSR, Inc. d/b/a Meadowbrook Healthcare is a 200 bed proprietary residential health care facility located at 154 Prospect Avenue, Plattsburgh, 12901, in Clint on County. The facility seeks approval to add an 87- bed addition to the facility. The 2016 projected bed need for the Clinton County is 126, as shown in Table 1. Clinton County's utilization in 2011 was 97.4% as indicated in Table 2. Table 1: RHCF Need - Clinton County 2016 Projected Need 616 Current Beds 423 Beds Under Construction 67 Total Resources 490 Unmet Need 126 Meadowbrook Healthcare utilization was slightly lo wer than that of Clinton County for 2009, 2010 and 2011, as shown in Table 2. Table 2: RHCF - Meadowbrook Healthcare /Clinton County Occupancy Meadowbrook County 97.6% 98.0% 97.4% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and analy zed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion polices and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patients admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage or Health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. Meadowbrook Healthcare was below the 75 percent planning average for 2010 but above it in 2011. The facility reported Medicaid admissions of 14.49 perc ent and 22.43 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 75 percent planning averages for Clinton County for these years were 15. 61 percent and 20.42 percent. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended. Project # 122281-C Exhibit Page 4 Programmatic Analysis Facility Information Existing Proposed Facility Name Meadowbrook Healthcare Same Address 154 Prospect Avenue Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Same RHCF Capacity 200 287 ADHCP Capacity N/A N/A Type of Operator Proprietary Same Class of Operator Corporation Same Operator CGSR, Inc. Same Meadowbrook Healthcare (Meadowbrook), a 200 bed nursing home located in Plattsburgh, proposes to add 87 beds, which will be located in a new addition to be constructed on the ea st side of the existing Meadowbrook building. The additional beds will include 42 temporary SNF beds currently located in Champlain Valley Physicians Hosp ital (CVPH), and 7 temporary beds located at Meadowbrook. The Meadowbrook project has been submitted to supplant a previously approved project, 071088 James Mann Healthcare, which had proposed the construction of a 210-bed nursing home in Clinton County. Clinton County has been severely under-bedded since the closure of Cedar Hedge Nursing Home in 2006. The situation has resulted in the operation of numerous temporary nursing home beds to meet the demand for long term care placements, and alleviate the back-up of hospital patients at CVPH awaiting discharge to a nursing home. The completion of the ex pansion project will result in the elimination of all temporary SNF beds in Clinton County. CVPH curre ntly operates a 54 bed hospital based nursing home unit, and any proposed changes to the permanent capacity or location of the unit will be the subject of a subsequent CON application. The existing Meadowbrook facility is configured in an \"H\" shape in two connected buildings, with the oldest wing dating to the 1970's and the newer addition on the eastern side constructed in 1987. The site slopes nearly 20 feet from the main entrance loca ted adjacent to Prospect Avenue on the eastern side. The Meadowbrook building contains 200 permanent beds and an additional 7 temporary beds located on the second, third and fourth floors of the original wing. The existing building is in generally good condition and has undergone periodic updating including renovated activity and dining space. Meadowbrook is fully sprinklered and will require no modifications other than the extension to cover the new addition. The new 87 bed addition will be located at the east end of the existing building, and will connect with and augment the 1987 addition. The new wing consists of two stories, with the shape suggesting a jet aircraft tail. Due to the difference in grad e, the ground floor of t he new addition will connec t to the basement of the 1987 wing and the upper floor will connect to the first floor nursing unit. The new main entrance for the nursing home will be moved to the front of the ground floor of the new building, opening into an entrance area which includes reception and main dining. An elevator provides access to the second floor of the building as well as the adjacent 1987 building. T he nursing station is located opposite main dining, as well as the spa bathing suite. Therapy expansion wi th a training apartment is tucked into the corner past the nursing station, and opens into the existi ng occupational and physical therapy area of the 1987 wing. The corridor continues into the existing basement area which contains the physical and occupational therapy area and offices. A small addi tion will be constructed on the south side for a new barber/beauty salon which must be relocated to create the connecting corridor. The ground floor, or garden level, of the addition will consist of 41 beds divided into 20 and 21 bed neighborhoods bisected by the new main entryway. The floor will be programmed as a short term rehabilitation unit, and all the resident rooms will inclu de showers. The nursing unit will include 27 single occupancy and 7 double occupancy rooms, with most of the latter enhanced doubles employing partitions to separate the beds. One temporar y bed will be relocated from the oldes t building to create a traditional double with a common headwall. Project # 122281-C Exhibit Page 5 The second floor will consist of 46 beds divided into two 23 bed neighborhoods. The floor will be programmed as a more traditional general nursing un it with 18 singles and 14 doubles. Eight of the doubles will be configured with the less desirable head to head bed placement in order to accommodate the relocation of 6 temporary beds from the 1970 building. Each neighborhood will contain centrally located dual shower rooms, and individual dining room s with country kitchen. A separate spa bathing suite serves the floor. Both floors feature a lar ge central living area, and strategically placed parlors where residents may congregate informally. The elevat or provides direct access into the 1987 building nursing unit past the nursing station. A large exp anded activity space extends into the 1987 nursing unit lounge creating a multi-access area. Renovations to the existing Meadowbrook building will be limited in nature. In addition to the previously noted expanded spaces in the 1987 building, the third and fourth floor activity rooms in the 1970 building will be expanded through enclosing adjacent under-ut ilized screened porches. The principal enhancement will be the elimination of the 7 temporar y beds in the 1970 building and the return of those rooms to more appropriately sized single bedrooms. Compliance Meadowbrook Healthcare is currently in substant ial compliance with all applicable codes, rules and regulations. Conclusion The expansion of Meadowbrook will provide critically needed nursing home beds to Clinton County. The design shows sensitivity to avoiding \"have/have not\" comparisons between existing and new nursing units. The new bedrooms will displace the inadequat e temporary beds currently operated at CVPH and Meadowbrook, providing the resident s greatly improved living areas. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended. Financial Analysis Lease Agreement and Medicaid Capital Reimbursement The applicant has submitted a draft lease agreeme nt, the terms of which are summarized below: Date: September 20, 2013 Premises: A 287 Bed RHCF located at 154 Prospect Avenue, Plattsburgh, New York 12901 Meadowbrook Ending June 29, 2042 Rent: Landlord's principal and interest payments due under any mortgage plus required escrows and reserves under such mortgage which equals approximately for the existing and pro posed mortgage $2,973,378 per year or $247,781.50 per month Provisions: Trip le net lease Per the applicant, the break out of rent expense is as follows: $1,644,000 for current rent; $67,400 for depreciation on moveable equipment associated with the expansion; $497,800 for depreciation on building improvements and expansion; and $7 64,178 for construction loan interest. The lease arrangement between the landlord, Meadowbrook Realty Group, LLC and the operator, CGSR, Inc. d/b/a Meadowbrook Healthcare, is a non-arm's length agreement as the members' and ownership interest is identical for both entities. Project # 122281-C Exhibit Page 6 Currently, Medicaid capital reimbursement is based on the return of and return on equity methodology, which will not be altered upon the change in ownership. Based the on 2013 Nursing Home Consolidated Capital (Schedule VI - Property) there is seven years of remaining useful life. Total Project Cost and Financing Total project costs for new construction, renovation, and acquisition of moveable equipment is estimated at $15,528,968, broken down as follows: New Construction $9,889,087 Renovation & Demolition 391,000 Site Development 350,000 Design Contingency 1,153,520 Construction Contingency 576,760 Planning Consultant Fees 99,300 Architect/Engineering Fees 803,000 Other Fees 85,000 Movable Equipment 578,600 Telecommunications 95,000 Financing Costs 949,602 Interim Interest Expense 471,168 CON Application Fee 2,000 CON Processing Fee 84,931 Total Project Cost $15,528,968 Project costs are based on a May 1, 2015 start date with a fourteen month construction period. The Bureau of Architectural and Engi neering Facility Planning (BAEFP) has determined that the new bed cost of $159,241 is within the applicable geographic per b ed cost limitations. The Department is reducing the recommended equity contribution to a combined rate of 16.02841%, for subproject one (15% which is the required minimum) & subproject two (25%). The total project costs are below the reimbursable adjusted maximum bed caps, therefore the recommended equity contribution is reduced by 50 cents for each $1. The approved project costs is below the regional bed caps, and adds back approximately $645,171 in added equity to bring subproject one to the 15% minimum. The applicant's financing plan appears as follows: Equity: Meadowbrook Realty Gr oup, LLC members $2,489,046 HUD Mortgage, FHA insured under section 241/232 (30-year term, 5.5%) 13,039,922 Total $15,528,968 A letter of interest has been provided by Century Health Capital, Inc.

Operating Budget The applicant has provided an operating budget, in 2013 dollars, for the first year subsequent to change in ownership. The budget is summarized below: Per Diem Total discounts) Total Revenues: $23,963,200Project 122281-C Exhibit 99,650 RHFC Occupancy 95.13% The following is noted with respect to the submitted RHCF operating budget: RHCF expenses include lease rental RHCF Medicaid revenues are based on the 2012 rates, adjustment for the change in capital component, a 2.0% inflation factor with the first year's rate starting approximately May 1, 2016 RHCF Medicare revenues were based upon actual 2012 rates RHCF private pay revenues are based upon actual rates trended to 2016 RHCF projected utilization is 95.13%: utilization fo r the first six months of 2013 averaged 96%, in 2012 averaged 95.27%, and for the peri od averaged 97.21% utilization by Feasibility Meadowbrook Realty Group, LLC will fund the tota l project cost of $15,528,968 through a $2,489,046 equity contribution from its members, and a $13,03 9,922 insured HUD mortga ge at the above stated terms. Review of BFA Attachment A, the members ne t worth statements, shows t here are sufficient liquid resources available for the proposed equity contribution. The applicant estimates the working capital requirem ents at $911,213, which is based on two months of the first year's incremental expenses. Working capita l will be provided from the members of the operator, CGSR, Inc. d/b/a Meadowbrook Healthcare. As not ed above, the members have sufficient liquid assets to meet this obligation. The submitted budget indicates that net income of $421,576 would be generated in the first year after the addition of 80 new beds and conversion of 7 tempor ary beds to permanent status, bringing the facilities total certified bed count to 287. The following is a comparison of the 2011 historical and the projected revenue and expense: Projected Income $ 23,963,200 Projected Expense 23,541,624 Projected Net Income $421,576 Annual 2011 Income $18,311,925 Annual 2011 Expense 18,074,348 Annual 2011 Net Income (Loss) $237,577 Incremental Net Income (Loss) $183,999 The applicant anticipates an incremental net increase in patient days of 26,954 on the new 80 beds, a utilization rate of 92.3%, of which 27,253 of patient days will have Medicaid as their payor. Overall, the Medicaid utilization will increase from 62.34% in 2011 to 72.83% by the end of the first year. Project # 122281-C Exhibit Page 8 Staff notes that with the expected 2014 implementa tion of managed care for nursing home residents, Medicaid reimbursement is expected to change fr om a state-wide price wi th cost-based capital component payment methodology to a negotiated reim bursement methodology. Facility payments will be the result of negotiations between the managed long term ca re plans and the facility. At this point in time it cannot be determined what financial impact this ch ange in reimbursement methodology will have on this project. As shown on BFA Attachment B, CGSR, Inc., d/b/ a Meadowbrook Healthcare, for the years 2010 through 2012, generated an average net surplus of $402,195, had an average positive working capital position of $2,142,928, and had an average positive net asset po sition of $1,647,769.

Regional Trauma Center Safe Center Stroke Center Project # 132195-E Exhibit Page 4 Combined, the hospitals in the system have a total of 46 clinics that operate in the New York metropolitan area. These clinics include diagnostic and treatment centers, ambulatory surg ery centers, hospital extension clinics and school based hospital extension clinics. Prior to this application, BIMC, NYEEI and SLR were organized under t he passive parent holding company model with Continuum Health Partners Inc. (Continuum). Continuum was reorganized, and MSHG became the passive parent of the former Co ntinuum Hospitals and Mount Sinai Hospital. This proposal will establish MSHG as the active parent of the above mentioned facilities and accomplish the following goals: maintain and grow a comprehensive, integr ated system that is prevention oriented; achieve the triple aim; expand access; and improve quality and more efficient operations in the communities served by the organization. MSHG plans to achieve its goals by expanding prim ary medical care, specialty care, screening and diagnostic services, urgent care and other ambulatory services that promote and improve public health. The new system will have the ability to manage population health through Mount Sinai's Accountable Care Organization, launched in July 2012, and its commi tment to advance models of care such as health homes and keep care at the community level. The system will be developed with the belief that the pat ient will be provided with the appropriate level of care regardless of the point of ent ry. The system will have a primary care network with over 430 full and part-time physicians and 12 ambulatory care centers. Its ambulatory care network is designed to prevent hospital readmissions and emergency department visits , thereby reducing cost and improving outcomes. Displayed in Table 3 below are the inpatient utilization statistics for the seven (7) hospital divisions. In 2011, the hospitals recorded 160,274 total inpatient discharges; by 2012 thes e discharges increased by 9.4 percent, to 175,288. During the same perio d, total emergency department visits at the aforementioned facilities increased by 6.9 per cent, from 452,399 in 2011 to 483,800 in 2012.

Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Programmatic Analysis Program Description Establish Mount Sinai Hospitals Group, Inc. (MSHG) as the active parent and co-operator of the following licensed healthcare facilities: Mount Sinai Hospital (M SH); Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC); St. Luke's- Roosevelt Hospital (SLR); and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary (NYEEI). Mount Sinai Hospitals Group, Inc., currently operating as a passive parent, is the sole corporate member of the aforementioned hospitals. Being established as the active parent will allow MSHG to exercise active powers and oversight with respect to the affiliated entities' day -to-day operations. There ar e no costs associated with this project and no change in authorized services or nu mber or types of beds as a result of this proposed change in governance structure. MSHG is an existing health care organization with three (3) directors who will comprise the governing board pending approval. Subsequent to final approval , MSHG will add up to 42 additional individuals, all of whom currently serve on the boards of three (3) or more of the four (4) hospitals involved in this project. Character and Competence The Board of Trustees of Mount Sinai Hospitals Group (MSHG) is: Name Position/Experience Peter W. May Chairman of MSHS and MSHG Boards. Member of The Mount Sinai Board of Trustees since 1989 and C hairman of the Board since 2002. Steven Hochberg Senior Vice Chairman of the MSHS and MSHG Boards. Member of the Continuum Board since 2005 a nd Chairman of the Board since 2011. Blaine V. Fogg Board Member. Member of the MSHS Board of Trustees since 1987. Staff from the Division of Certification & Surveilla nce reviewed the disclosu re information submitted regarding licenses held, formal education, training in pertinent health and/or related areas, employment history, a record of legal actions, and a disclosure of the applicant's ownership interest in other health care facilities. Licensed individuals were checked against the Office of Medicaid Management, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Educat ion Department databases as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Medicare exclusion database. Project # 132195-E Exhibit Page 7 Mr. Hochberg disclosed the following settlements and pending investigations which occurred during his affiliation with the entities noted below: In the first half of 2002, by letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, Beth Israel reported misstatements in Medicare cost r eports filed for 1995 through 1999. Subsequently, beginning in October 2002, the United States Attorney's Office for the S outhern District of New York subpoenaed Beth Israel and requested information related to cost reports for 1991 through 2001. On November 30, 2005, Beth Israel and the US Attorney's Office, on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, entered into a Stipulat ion and Order of Settlement and Dismissal related to the Medicare cost reports and billing from 1992 to 2001. Beth Israel did not admit to any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $72.9 million to Medicare in a settlement of the issues. On November 29, 2005, Beth Israel Medical Center and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services entered into a corporate integrity agreement in connection with the resolution of the aforementioned disclosed Medicare cost report misstatement and a related investigation. (The agreement expired around November 29, 2010.) In February 2012, following receipt of a subpoena from the United States A ttorney for the Southern District of New York requesting information regardi ng Beth Israel Medical Center's outlier payments and the setting of its charges from 1997 through 2003, Be th Israel entered into a settlement agreement and made payment to the United States for $13,031,355 in March 2012. In January 2013, St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital agreed to pay $1,258,115 to the United States and $1,066,885 to the State of New York to settle claims brought by the United States and New York State in regard to billing for outpatient psychiatric services from 1998 through 2010, and certain issues related to inpatient reimbursement fo r the period 1998-2002. In May 2013, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary (NYEE) re ceived a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Attorney's Office under the False Claims Ac t related to allegations of false claims for payment submitted to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices in connection with post-surgical pathology. In June 2013, Continuum Health Partners received a Ci vil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office requesting the production of documents rela ting to approximately $871,000 in overpayments from Medicaid for services furnished by Continuum hospitals to Healthfirst, Inc. Insureds. Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certificat ion & Surveillance reviewed the ten year surveillance history of all associated facilities. Sources of info rmation included the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professio nal reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital was fined $4,000 in Septem ber 2006 following an investigation into the care rendered to a patient who presented with a brain malf ormation. It was determined that the patient was not fully educated on his post-discharge care and did not re ceive an appropriate prescription for medication. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended. Project # 132195-E Exhibit Page 8 Financial Analysis Capability and Feasibility There are no significant issues of capability or feasibility associated with this application.

BFA Attachment D is the financial summary of St. Lu ke's Roosevelt Hospital C enter and Affiliates during the period 2011 through 2012. As shown, the facilit y had maintained an average positive working capital position and an average negative net asset position fr om 2011 through 2012. The applicant has indicated that the reason for the negative net asset position is the facility exper ienced a loss on refinancing; a required accounting recognition of minimum pension liab ilities; loss on interest rate swaps and equity loss in its captive malpractice insurance program. Most of these items were non-cash actions or one time, extraordinary events. Also, approx imately half of the 2012 negative fund balance is attributable to a subsidiary corporation that operates a staff housing residence, and the liabilitie s of that entity have no recourse to any of the other assets of St. Luke's Roosevelt, apart from the staff housing residence.

(MVN), which is currently the passive parent of FSL, to become the active parent of the facilities. Upon approval, Mohawk Valley Network, Inc. will change its name to Mohawk Valley Health System (MVHS). In addition to the above listed facilities, MVHS will also se rve as the active parent of Visiting Nurse Association of Utica and Oneida County, Inc. (VNA), Mohawk Valley Home Care, LLC (MVHC) and Senior Network Health, LLC (SNH). MVN is currently the sole member of each of these entities. FSL is a not-for-profit hospital with 370 licensed acute care beds and is a designated Stroke Center . FSL also operates 16 extensi on clinics throughout the region and operates a dental residency program. SEMC is a not-for-profit community hospital located in Utica, New York. The facility is certified to operate 201 beds. SEMC is the only New York State designated Level 2 trauma center in the community. SEMC also provides community based services at 14 certified hospital extension clinics. SEMC also provides educational programs, including: SEMC's College of Nursing, Family Medicine Residency program, fellowship in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery, and fellowship in Hospital Medical programs. SEMC is sponsored by Partners in Franciscan Ministries, Inc. (PFM), which is a not-for-profit charitable tax-exempt corporation sponsored by the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Francis of the Neumann Communities in Syracuse (SOSF). PFM and SOSF are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. The main reason put forth for this proposed affiliation is to address the increasingly challenging financial conditions the facilities are encountering, and the associated threat to the on-going provision of quality care at the facilities. The proposed active parent model is intended to reduce these concerns through the combined improvement efforts of FSL and SEMC. Overall, the active parent is intended to strengthen the facilities' quality improvement and performance initiatives and programs in a way that is not possible without this arrangement. Some of the current financial issues that are being faced by FSL and SEMC include: SEMC has suffered unsustainable operating losses of almost $2 million through June, 2013. FSL has lost approximately $3.5 million from operation through June 2013. The shift in the payer mix away from commercially insured patients towards Medicaid and uninsured patients, which negatively impacts the hospitals' revenue. Changes in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also reduced revenue. Declining inpatient and outpatient patient base. Sequestration. Without the active parent the applicant indicates that SEMC's expected survival time is limited to only a few months. The main goal of this active parent is to keep these needed facilit ies operating. Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 2 BFA Attachment A shows the organizational chart for VHS providers under the active parent structure. DOH Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary This CON seeks to transition Mohawk Valley Network, Inc. (MVN) from the passive parent of Faxton-St Luke's Healthcare (FSL) to the active parent and co-operator of FSL, St. Elizabeth Medical Center, and St. Lukes Home. The joining of these entities under a common active parent will create a health system that will be able to respond to the evolving needs of the community. Program Summary Based on the information reviewed, staff found nothing that would reflect adversely upon the applicant's character and competence or standing in the community. Financial Summary There are no project costs associated with this project.

Planned Parenthood Mohawk Hudson (PPMH) is located in the service ar ea and is authorized to provide abortion services. The majority of abortions in the service area are perf ormed by PPMH-Utica. Late term abortions up to 19 weeks 6 days are referred to PPMH-Schenectady. If t here is a need for an in-hospital abortion, the patient is referred to Albany Medical Center. Over the last two years, Faxton-St. Luke's performed fewer than 10 in-hospital abortions allocated to APR-D RG Abortion w/o D&C, Aspiration Curettage or Hysterectomy. Approval of the propose d active parent will bring operational coll aboration and clinical integration between the two hospitals. The system is ex pected to achieve the following benefits: elimination of administrative redundancy in support and clinical functions; coordination of service and clinical programs in order to enhance operational efficiencies and programmatic development; improvement in the capacity of the local health system to respond to evolving community needs in a more efficient manner; streamlining of services as needed; strengthening of the facilities' quality impr ovement and performance initiatives, staff and programs; Upon approval of the active parent, the two hospital sys tems plan a comprehensive review of their clinical practices in order to determine the areas with superior or best practices that could be transferred between the two hospitals. Conclusion As the active parent, MCHS will cont inue to offer the range of servic es in the community where MVN and SEMC already provide services. The combined resources of the two or ganizations will allow MVHS to develop more effective programs than the facilities co uld achieve alone, thereby improving health care in the community. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended. Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 7 Programmatic Analysis Program Proposal Mohawk Valley Network (MVN) seeks approval to becom e the active parent and co-operator of Faxton-St. Luke's Healthcare (FSL), St. Elizabeth Medical Center (SEMC), St. Luke's Home (SLH), Visiting Nursing Association of Utica and Oneida C ounty (VNA), and Mohawk Valley Ho me Care (MVHC). Upon approval, MVN will be renamed the Mohawk Valley Health Syst em (MVHS). The active parent will allow SEMC and FSL to eliminate redundancy in support and clinical functions and streamline services. The applicant does not anticipate any change in the overa ll complement of services offered. Character and Competence The proposed board members for MVHS are as follows: Name Domenic Aiello, M.D. Physician Catherine Cominsky Manager, Higher Education Joan Compson Retired CPA/Chief Financial Officer Thomas Dennison, PhD Professor and former nursing home administrator Gregory Evans President/CEO of Manufacturing Company Maria Gesualdo, D.O. Physician Harrison Hummel, III President/CEO of Office Supply Company Todd Hutton, PhD President/CEO of Utica College Andrew Kowalczyk, III, JD Attorney Gregory McLean President, Investment Company Scott Perra President/CEO of Faxton-St. Luke's Norman Siegel, JD Judge, Oneida County John Sperling, MD Physician Stephen Sweet Owner, Distribution Company Richard Tantillo Vice President of Communications & Development at Hamilton College Symeon Tsoupelis Owner, Symeon's Restaurant Mark Warfel, D.O. Physician Bonnie Woods Trust Execut ive at Bank of America Eric Yoss, MD Physician Richard Zweifel Partner, CPA Firm Staff from the Division of Certification & Surveilla nce reviewed the disclosu re information submitted regarding licenses held, formal education, training in pertinent health and/or related areas, employment history, a record of legal actions, and a disclosure of the applicant's ownership interest in other health care facilities. Licensed individuals were checked against the Office of Medicaid Management, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Educat ion Department databases as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Medicare exclusion database. Ms. Cominsky, Drs. Warfel and Yo ss, and Messrs. Evans, Hummel, Kowalczyk, Tsoupelis, Siegel and Zweifel each disclosed the following actions which occurred during their affiliation with the entities noted below: Around December 2007, St. Elizabeth Medical Center (SEMC) was included in a nationwide investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney General's Office in to billing for kyphoplasty procedures. It was determined that certain procedures billed as inpatient should have been billed as outpatient, therefore, SEMC entered into an agreement to pay back $195,976 plus interest. In March 2013, St. Elizabeth Medical Center receiv ed a citation for alleged violations relating to an employee allegation of overexposure to carbon mono xide. The citation and $8,500 penalty are currently being contested. Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 8 Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certificat ion & Surveillance reviewed the ten-year surveillance history of all associated facilities. Sources of info rmation included the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professional reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. In June 2007, during a recertification survey of St . Elizabeth Medical Center's Home Care, deficiencies were noted. In 2008, St. Elizabeth settled with the De partment of Health (DOH). As part of the settlement, St. Elizabeth admitted to the existence of substantial ev idence of violations in the following areas: policies and procedures of service delivery, patient assessment and plan of care and governing authority. A $10,000 civil penalty was assessed of which $5, 000 was paid and the remaining $5,000 was suspended providing St. Elizabeth did not violate certai n terms and regulations within 3 years. In January 2005, St. Elizabeth Medical Center was fi ned $4,000 based on an investigation of a patient admitted to the hospital for a coronary artery bypass graft. An incision was made in the left leg to harvest a vein for bypass when it was discov ered that the vein was not present due to a previous harvest. In November 2005, Presbyterian Home was fined $1,000 based on deficient practices relating to quality of care (specifically, pressure sores) noted dur ing an inspection conducted in February 2005. In January 2010, Presbyterian Home was fined $10,000 based on deficient practices relating to quality of care (specifically, accidents) noted during an inspection conducted in October 2008. In November 2011, Sitrin Health Care Center was fi ned $6,000 based on deficient practices relating to quality of care (specifically, accidents and supervision, menus not meeting resident need, and administration) noted during an inspection conducted in August 2010. During recent recertification inspections conducted in 2013, Presbyterian Home was issued a harm level deficiency and St. Luke's Home was issued an Immediat e Jeopardy level deficiency for deficient practices relating to Advanced Directives/CPR/DNR and failure to provide continuous oxygen. The DOH will review both matters for a potential future enforcement action. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended. Financial Analysis Business Plan of Efficiencies In order to effect the change, a Business Plan of Efficiencies (BPOE) has been developed in order to define and develop the opport unities that come with the affiliation of Faxton-St. Luke's Healthcare (FSL) and St. Elizabeth Medical Center (SEMC) to creat e Mohawk Valley Health System (MVHS). These opportunities can be grouped into two categories: Confirmed and Validated Opportunities (opportunities that have been identified and validated as opportunities which can be achieved as part of the affiliation) and Non-Validated Opportunities (Alt hough identified, these opportunities will require additional discussion and validation post-transaction). In order to determine these opportunities, several distinct steps were undertaken: Assessment of the MVHS administrative of or ganization to identify functions that will become corporate or remain at the hospital level Development of individual departmental integrat ion plans with the guidance and assistance of hospital senior leadership Development of detailed departmental assessments Quantitative assessment of hospital departments utilizing databases to identify opportunities for operational efficiency Qualitative interviews to identify opportuniti es to achieve potential integrative synergies Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 9 Once the report was developed the main areas that were determined to be impacted are as shown: Administrative functions: The geographic proximity of the two facilities will a llow for consolidation of administrative functions. Support Services Functions: The ability to centralize management in sele ct support departments affords MVHS the ability to standardize policies and procedures system-wide while reducing unnecessary redundant functions and expense Joint contracting for select support servic es provides MVHS the ability to renegotiate contracts and standardize functions between the two hospitals Clinical Service/Function Integration: Clinical coordination, program alignment and the maximization of existing organizational resources Redistribution of services among the ex isting Faxton, St. Luke's and St. Elizabeth campuses Upon implementing the BPOE, it is expected that each of the three areas will have significant savings over the course of the first five to six years unde r the active parent. Each year is shown to have a confirmed savings, with an additional amount of possible savings. The total confirmed savings for the first five to six years, by function, is shown below: Administrative Functions: $5.628 million confirmed savings / $18.352 million possible savings. Support Functions: $428,740 confirmed savings / $4.339 million possible savings Clinical Functions: no confirmed savings / $27.477 million possible savings Operating Budget The applicant has submitted the Inpatient and Outpatient operating budget, in 2013 dollars: Current Year FSL & SEMCFirst Year Incremental Cumulative Year 1 Third Year Incremental Cumulative Year 3 Operating and Non- Operating Revenues: (A) Other Operating Revenues: Current Year Year 1 Incremental Cumulative Year 1 Year 3 Incremental Cumulative Year 3 Tuition Revenue $2,439,641 1,144,89 6 $3,584,537 and outpatient utilization by payor source as of the current year and the first and third year is shown below. The applicant assumes utilization at the current levels: Payor Inpatient Outpatient Medicaid Other 3.15% 1.97% Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. With respect to feasibility, it is noted that the applic ant indicates they cannot sustain present structural inefficiencies or the resulting operati ng deficits, over the long-term. The applicant indicates that by implementing the proposed active parent structure under MVHS, and obtaining the described economies of scale, as well as eliminating some duplicative areas within their operations, they will be able to return their operations to a sustainable performance level within the next several years. Their budget appears reasonable. Working capital for the merged entities (MVN) and (S EMC) will be derived from the net assets of the combined operation. MVHS shall have a budget and su fficient operating funds to function independently in order to accomplish its corporate purposes, mi ssion, vision, and values. The hospitals intend that MVHS will receive funds for ongoing operations from any one or a combination of sources, consistent with the requirements of the Code applicable to tax exempt organizations, including, without limitation: (a) MVHS's operations; (b) contributions from FSL, SEMC, any FSL Affiliate, or any SEMC Affiliate; and (c) assessment of reasonable corpor ate fees for the value of services rendered to FSL, SEMC, the FSL Affiliates, and the SEMC Affiliates. MVHS shall deter mine and assess contributions from FSL, SEMC, the FSL Affiliates, and the SEMC Affiliates in a fa ir and equitable manner at all times. Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 11 BFA Attachment M is MVHS' pro-forma balance sheet that shows operations will start off with $177,964,498 in positive equity. BFA Attachment B is the 2009-2012 certified financia l statements for Mohawk Valley Network, Inc. and Subsidiaries. The statement shows that MVN was op erating with a positive average working capital and a positive average net asset positi on and generated an average net operating loss of $1,347,711 and an average net income of $7,435,471, for the period 2009 -2012. MVN, however, experienced a loss in 2010. The explanation for the loss is detailed below. T he average net income that is shown is due to MVN selling off its wholly owned for-profit subsidiary, Faxchil Realty, Inc., and its wholly owned for-profit subsidiary, Centrex Clinical Laboratories, Inc. T he overall gain in connection with the sale was approximately $30,762,000 in 2009 and $792,000 in 2010. If this sale did not happen MVN would have recorded a loss of $1,619,050 in 2009 and $3,044,883 in 2010.

The explanat ion for the loss is detailed below. BFA Attachment L is the internal financial statement through 8/31/2013 for Mohawk Valley Home Care. The statement shows that the facility was operating with a positive working capital and a positive net asset position and generated a net operating inco me of $22,551 for the period 1/1/2013-8/31/2013. The previous years financial statements are included in the overall financial position of MVN, no separate financial statements were created for Mohawk Valley Home Care. A primary cause of the deterioration in the hospit al finances is revenue stagnation. The combined net patient revenue for FSL and SEMC rose from about $454 million to $457 million from 2010 to 2012. This is an increase of less than one percent over two year s. There are numerous causes of this stagnation. Both hospitals have experienced a shift in thei r payor mix away from commercially insured patients towards Medicaid and uninsured patients. SEMC experienced a 13% decrease in acute ca re commercial discharges from 2010 to 2012, compared to a 2.7% decline in acute care Medica id discharges. During this same period, acute care charity discharges at SEMC almost doubled. Similarly, FSL experienced a 17% decline in acute care commercial discharges and a 6% increase in acute care Medicaid discharges from 2010 to 2012. FSL estimates that reductions in payments for Medicare and Medicaid dual eligibles reduced revenues to FSL by $1 million between 2010 and 2012. Medicaid reimbursement reductions further re duced revenues to FSL by $600 thousand between 2010 and 2012, and Sequestration has resulted in approximately 3.5 million in additional reductions in Medicare reimbursements in 2013. At SEMC, Medicaid reductions resulted in r educed revenues of $1 million, and Sequestration has resulted in an additional reduction in Medicare reimbursements of $1 million. According to the applicant, increased outpatient fa cility competition is also having an impact on the hospitals. Recent outpatien t facility entry in the region includes a gastrointestinal ambulatory surgery center (ASC), a urology clinic in Utica specializing in radiation oncology services, and an eye care ASC in Rome. FSL estimates these facilities led to rev enue declines of nearly $6 million from 2011 to 2012. While SEMC does not provide radiation oncology servic es, it estimates that its revenue decline from these facilities was $3.2 million from 2011 to 2012. Sequestration has added additional strain to the fi nancial situation in 2013. Overall, FSL has lost $3.5 million from operations through June, which is an annualized loss of $7 million. SEMC expects losses similar to 2012. SEMC lost more than $2 million through June 2013, which is an annualized loss of over $4 million. St. Luke's Home (SLH) has experienced losses primar ily due to less than optimal occupancy rates, and a higher Medicaid payer mix than years past. SLH, as a result of the HEAL 20 Grant for $8,008,000 (to decertify 82 skilled nursing beds: 40 beds at St. Luke's Home and 42 beds at Allen Calder Skilled Nursing, adding 10 ADHCP slots, and renovations to convert space and expand the staff cafeteria and dining area), is debt free. As a result of this, SL H can expect positive cash flow even with an annual $800,000 operating loss. Project # 132204-E Exhibit Page 13 FSL and SEMC have taken action over t he past four years in an attempt to make the facilities profitable, or at least break. These include the following: St. Elizabeth Medical Center 2011: Eliminated 24 FTE positions, including layoffs Froze the defined benefit Pensi on Plan for Non-Union employees Additional supply chain savings: $470,000 2012: Eliminated 53 FTE positions, including layoffs Froze the defined benefit Pension Plan for UFCW Union employees Additional supply chain savings: $825,000 Capital Purchases frozen Confirmed plan to close School of Radiography in 2014 2013: Eliminated 67 FTE positions, including layoffs Froze the defined benefit Pension Plan for NYSNA Union employees Faxton-St. Luke's Healthcare 2010 to 2012 : Achieved total annual savings of $15.7 million Eliminated 256 FTE positions Implemented weekly review process for all staffing requests 2013: January to June: achieved $5.5 million in annualized savings Additional staffing reductions and benefit changes Supply pricing and utilization improvements July to December: Initiated plan to save additional $10.2 million in annualized savings 91.3 FTE reductions Non-salary expenses improvements It appears the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner, and approval is recommended.

Character and Competence The members of the LLC are: Todd Todd is an attorney currently employed as a lice nsed associate broker for a real estate company. He worked four years as a medical malpractice and health care litigation attorney and, besides general liability and product liability cases, he was involved in every aspect of medical malpractice defense litigation for both physicians and hospitals. He feels that this experience has allowed him to learn the inner workings of the health care system, including hospital and physician practices. Additionally, he feels it has allowed him to define the line between go od and inadequate care and the processes which hospitals and physicians should have in place to insure the delivery of the necessary standard of care to the public. Mr. Vitolo feels he has developed a solid understanding and respect for the ethics, rules, regulations and laws that define the standard of ca re and conduct for patient care. In 2004, he started another career in residential real estate sales where he founded the Columbia Group which manages the sale and purchase of multi- million dollar properties. Mr. Vitolo feels this business experience will be useful as the operator of an ambulatory surgery center. Scott Vitolo is currently the practice manager and administrator for an office based surgical (OBS) practice. Previously, he was a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) who worked as a New York City Emergency Medical Service 911 EMT. He has also worked in the construction field. Mr. Vitolo is now, and has been, a medical practice manager for over 19 years, overseeing the planning, construction, and opening of an office based surgery center accr edited by a national accrediting organization. Project # 112086-B Exhibit Page 6 Mr. Vitolo acted as the general contractor and projec t manager for not only the OBS practice, but has also been involved in the development of several restaurant projects. He feels his intimate involvement in the construction and initiation of the OBS practice gave him extensive experience and knowledge of the Life Safety aspect of health care facilities. He also feels his experience as a practice manager and OBS administrator has given him an understanding of the ethical, moral, health and procedural standards required to operate an ambulatory surgery center. Mr . Scott Vitolo will be the center's administrator. Noreen Vitolo, a licensed esthetician, is the owner/ope rator of a skin care business. She previously worked in a multi-location medical practice in the ar eas of operations, sales and customer service. She had also worked at an advertising agency prior to founding her own company which specialized in medical marketing. Her firm focused primarily on consumer medical education for physicians and hospitals in the tri-state area and her firm won a Te lly award. Ms. Vitolo has traveled to Armenia to produce awareness videos for a children's open heart surgery center staffed by American volunteer surgeons, nurses and physicians in an effort to rais e money for this charitable cause. Additionally, Ms. Vitolo actively fundraises for the American Cancer Society, and she is a member of the Staten Island Mental Health Society, the Women's Guild Committe e and the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce. She opened her current business in 2003 and feels that her extensive experience running small businesses will be beneficial to the op eration of the center. While Ms. Vito lo's role in the center will be all encompassing, she will act as Chief Business O fficer and Director of Community Outreach and Education. She intends on ensuring that the center provides charitabl e care to the uninsured and reduced fees to those in need, especially thos e in traditionally underserved populations. Dr. Michel Costes is a practi cing physician who will serve as t he facility's medical director. It should be noted that Dr. Robert Vitolo, the father of Todd, Scott, and Noreen, is the current owner of an office based surgery practice at the proposed locati on. The proposal does not include any reference to Dr. Vitolo being a member of the applicant nor being in any management position at the center. He has signed an affidavit indicating he will have no ownership, managerial, or operational role in the center. Dr. Vitolo's only role will be as a participating/practicing surgeon. Staff from the Division of Certification & Surveilla nce reviewed the disclosu re information submitted regarding licenses held, formal education, training in pertinent health and/or related areas, employment history, a record of legal actions, and a disclosure of the applicant's ownership interest in other health care facilities. Licensed individuals were checked against the Office of Medicaid Management, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Educat ion Department databases as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Medicare exclusion database. Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certificat ion & Surveillance reviewed the ten-year surveillance history of all associated facilities. Sources of info rmation included the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professional reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. Integration with Community Resources Should any patients present themselves at the center in need of primary care services, the center hopes to work with Staten Island University Hospital (SIU H) to provide such serv ices. The proposed operators indicate that they have reached out to SIUH in an e ffort to establish a mutual network relationship. Additionally, the operators intend to participate in co mmunity health events and local religious institution events to make sure the community is aware of their services. The center intends on utilizing electronic medical reco rds and hopes to integrate in the regional health information organization (RHIO) or health information exchange (HIE). A sliding fee scale will be in place for those without insurance, and provisions will be made for those who cannot afford services. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, c ontingent approval is recommended.

Attachments BFA Attachment A Personal Net Wo rth Statement- 1504 Richmond, LLC BFA Attachment B Pro-forma Balance Sheet- Richmond Surgery Center BFA Attachment C Detailed Budget of Richmond Surgery Center BHFP Attachment Map Supplemental Information Outreach Below are presented summaries of responses by ho spitals to letters from the Department asking for information on the impact of the proposed ambulatory su rgery center (ASC) in their service areas. There follows a summary of the applicant's response to DO H's request for informatio n on the proposed facility's volume of surgical cases, the sources of those cases, and on how staff will be recruited and retained by the ASC. Facility: Richmond University Medical Center 355 Bard Avenue Staten Island, NY 10310 Operating Room utilization at Richmond University Medical Center (RUMC): 1 The hospital did not furnish the number of surgical cases. The percentages show the distribution of cases between inpatient and ambulatory surgery at each site. RUMC opposes the application but does not specify the number of cases from the applicant surgeons that may be lost to the proposed ASC, nor does it attach a dollar amount to any expected loss of ambulatory surgical volume. The hospital states that its current surgical revenues help support vital services, such as its primary care and subspecialty clinics, its 911 ambulance and trauma services and its CPEP psychiatric coordination. The hospital does not quant ify the impact that a loss of surgical revenues to the proposed ASC would have on these or any ot her of its services or operations. Surgery Case Proportion1 Current OR Use Ambulatory Inpatient Ambulatory Cases by Applicant Physician Reserved OR Time for Applicant Physicians 60%-90% 85% 15% 164 Not specified Project # 112086-B Exhibit Page 9 RUMC had a working capital ratio of 1.1 in both 200 9 and 2010. In 2009, RUMC had an operating gain of $7.2 million on revenues of 304.9 million. In 2010, the facility had an operating gain of $6.5 million on revenues of $305.5 million. In 2009, RUMC prov ided charity care of $23.4 million and experienced bad debt of $16.4 million. In 2010, the facility provided $1 8.3 million in charity care and had $16.0 million in bad debt. Facility: Staten Island University Hospital 475 Seaview Avenue Staten Island, NY 10305 Operating Room utilization at Staten Island Un iversity Hospital (SIUH) by Location: 2 The hospital did not furnish the number of surgical case s. The percentages show the distribution of cases between inpatient and ambulatory surgery at each site. 3 Four of the seven applicant physicians who performed am bulatory surgery cases at the hospital in 2011 have OR block time. The hospital opposes the application, based on its as sumption that all 458 cases performed by applicant physicians at SIUH in 2011 would be transferred to t he proposed ASC. The hospital projects that this would result in a loss of $1 million in revenues, which would put \"great pressure\" on the facility's $5.3 million worth of community health improvement serv ices, such as health education events, chronic disease screening, flu vaccinations, smoking cessat ion programs, and similar activities. The hospital does not specify the specific impact that the proj ected loss would have on any individual service. SIUH had working capital ratios of 1.7 and 1.8 in 200 9 and 2010, respectively. In 2009, the hospital had an operating gain of $18.8 million on operating revenue of $700.8 million. In 2010, the facility's operating gain was $24.4 million on operating revenue of $757.8 million. SIUH provided uncompensated care at established charges of approximately $56,880,000 an d $56,169,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. This amount consisted of charity care of $51,080,00 0 and $49,619,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and uncollectible charges written off as bed debt of $5,800,000 and $6,550,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Supplemental Information from Applicant Need and Sources of Cases : The applicant states that the projec ted volume of cases is based on the actual experience of the physician s who have expressed an interest in performing procedures at the proposed facility. The vast majority of these case s (85 percent) are currently performed in office-based settings. The applicant also expects the demand for ambul atory surgical services to continue to grow. The applicant further expects that patients will be attracted to the proposed ASC because of its convenience in scheduling and the fact that it will be located in an out-of-hospital setting. Office-Based Cases: As noted, 85 percent of the cases proj ected for the proposed ASC are currently performed in an office-based setting. Staff Recruitment and Retention: The applicant expects to employ ex isting staff of the current office- based practice. To the extent that additional staff is needed, the proposed operators are committed to not actively seeking staff from local hospitals.

In addition, neither hospital furnished information on its current annual number of ambulatory surgery cases. The Department does not find the comments of the two hospitals sufficient to warrant reversal or modification of the recommendation for five-year limited life approval of the proposed ASC based on public need, financial feasibility and operator character and competence. Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 1 Public Health and Health Planning Council Project # 131069-E Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center County: Nassau County Program: Ambulatory Surgery Center Purpose: Establishment Acknowledged: February 15, 2013 Executive Summary Description Gastro Operating Company, LLC d/b/a Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center, an existi ng proprietary Article 28 diagnostic and treatment center (D&TC) is requesting approval to extend their lim ited life approval for one year.

Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background The Gastro Operating Co, LLC, d/b/a Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center (MEC), requests approval of certification for an additional year. MEC was approved for a limited life of five years through CON 061004, with an operating certificate effe ctive October 15, 2008 through Oc tober 15, 2013. MEC operates at 865 Merrick Avenue, Westbury, 11590, in Nassau County. Analysis Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center's se rvice area includes approximately 28 zip codes in Nassau County. MEC projects approximately 9,000 visits in the first year following approval of this project and 9,700 visits in the third year. These projections are based on t he current practices of participating physicians, who expect to perform more of their cases at MEC rather than at their respective offices. The table below presents information on the payor projections that were included in MEC's original CON application (061004) and those that are proposed in the current application. Payor CON 061004 CON 131069 Medicare 35% Department of Defense -- 1% Total 100% 100% The applicant believes that these revised projections for Medicaid and charity care are reasonable and achievable for the following reasons: Since the approval of MEC, there have been significant changes with respect to Medicaid reimbursement. In 2006, the Medicaid reimbursemen t rate was lower than other payors; now it is competitive. Access to care for Medicaid patients has improv ed because health care providers in Nassau County are aggressively seeking relationships with Medicaid Managed Care plans. Nassau County is a mandatory Medicaid managed care county. There are currently six plans that are available to Medicaid recipients. MEC has a work ing relationship with four of the six approved Medicaid managed care plans. The Affordable Care Act will improve access to health care coverage for everyone. In order to improve its charity care commitment, MEC is re-focusing its efforts on reaching targeted populations through marketing, advertising, public relations, and other efforts. In 2012 MEC had 5,453 visits. The payer mix of visits was: Charity Care 0.9% Medicaid 2.8% Medicare Cross 32.4% Commercial 41.3% Self-Pay 0.0% MEC experienced low Medicaid volume in its initial year s, with noticeable increases in Medicaid visits not occurring until 2011-2012. The applicant reports that th is was due principally to MEC's inability to obtain Medicaid certification until 2011. This in turn was due largely to the need to correct structural defects in the facility, identified upon an approval inspection, wh ich caused a temporary shutdown of the facility. MEC was unable to bill Medicaid for nearly two and a half years of its initial limited life period. Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 4 MEC also reports that software probl ems caused underreporting of its Medi caid and charity care activities to SPARCS. Since September 2013 MEC has been wo rking with SPARCS and the software vendor to correct and resolve this issue. In the meantime, MEC's data for 2012 shows Medicaid visi ts as 2.8% of total visi ts, the highest level of the facility's four years of operations. However, data for the first nine months of 2013 show Medicaid visits at 4.9% of MEC's volume, a rate 75% higher than that of 2012. This is a favorable development and may indicate that MEC's outreach to underserved populations is beginning to bear fruit. Nevertheless, MEC now expects to serve a lower volume of Medicaid clients than the 10% projected in its original 2006 application. We again note the projec ted payor mix for the first year of MEC's proposed three-year extension, and compare it to 2012: Utilization by Payor Source 2012 One Year Extension Medicaid 2.8% 5.0% has provided a statement that the prop osed financial/referral structure has been assessed in light of anti-kickback and self-ref erral laws with consultation of the legal counsel. This statement is acceptable to the Department. Meadowbrook indicates it serves all persons in need of surgery regardless of their ability to pay or the source of payment. Conclusion From 2008 to 2012, MEC served an increasing number of patients each year and will continue providing needed services to the communities of Nassau C ounty and surrounding areas. MEC has improved its efforts to serve Medicaid and needy populations. However, MEC's abilit y to serve a significant number of Medicaid and charity care clients on a sustained ba sis has not yet been demonstrated. Accordingly, a limited life extension for one year as reques ted in this application is warranted. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval for a limited life of one additional year is recommended. Programmatic Analysis Background Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center, an existing ambula tory surgery center, is seeking approval for permanent life. Character and Competence The members of the LLC are: Name Pradeep Bansal, MD Michael Barth, MD 14% 14% 14% 14% All of the members are practicing su rgeons/gastroenterologists, with Dr. Singh serving as the Medical Director. Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 5 Staff from the Division of Certification & Surveilla nce reviewed the disclosu re information submitted regarding licenses held, formal education, training in pertinent health and/or related areas, employment history, a record of legal actions, and a disclosure of the applicant's ownership interest in other health care facilities. Licensed individuals were checked against the Office of Medicaid Management, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the Educat ion Department databases, as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Medicare exclusion database. Dr. Garbus has one (1) pending malpractice claim and Dr. Rieders has two (2) pending malpractice claims. Dr. Lipsky disclosed one (1) settled malpractice suit. Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certificat ion & Surveillance reviewed the ten-year surveillance history of all associated facilities. Sources of info rmation included the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professional reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended. Financial Analysis Operating Budget The applicant has submitted an operating budget, in 2013 dollars, for the current year and the first and third years of operations subseque nt to receiving approval of this project, as summarized below: Current Year Year One Year Three Revenues Operating $6,288,473 $8,548,693 $8,633,506 Non-Operating * Procedure $727.10 $459.80 $432.17 * Settlement income received in 2012 Projected utilization is based upon operating the ex isting four procedure rooms each week, Monday through Friday, and an average of approximately 36 to 38 cases per day in the first and third years, respectively. The applicant is estimating that the par ticipating physicians will perform more cases at the facility in years one and three. Expenses are based on historical experience as adjusted for utilization and rising costs. Below is the comparison of CON 061004 projected a nd actual utilization for the first and third years. Utilization (p rocedures) 2009 2011 Projected 3,899 4,889 Actual 3,553 4,929 Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 6 During the review process the appl icant discovered that the statis tics report to SPARCS was an inaccurate representation of Meadowbrook's perform ance, due to a malfunction in their software. The applicant's staff has been working wi th SPARCS and the vendor to correc t the problem. In the interim, Meadowbrook manually retrieved and reported the dat a from 2008 through September 2013. There is a slight difference between the data collected thr ough the Statewide Planning & Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), and those by the applicant. Accord ing to the applicant the results differed when multiple procedures were performed on the same patient. Below is the comparison of CON 061004 projected th ird year utilization by payor source compared to actual payments. Utilization by Payor Source Projected Actual Medicaid Colon Cancer Screening Initiative Outreach Program The applicant states CMS did not approve their Medi care certification until 2010, when a construction issue was corrected. Their Medicaid certificati on came in 2011, but was backdated to 2008, when CMS recognized the application was caught in a government error. In addition, the applicant has outlined a number of fa ctors that have impacted its original payor mix projections. They included: a competition for the Medicaid patients; improvements in the Medicaid reimbursement rates; Nassau County becoming a m andatory Medicaid manage care county; health care providers in Nassau County (hospitals, D&TCs, ASC s, private practitioners) aggressively seeking relationships with the six plans available to the M edicaid recipients, which has had a positive impact on the Medicaid patients' access to care; the Affordable Care Act; and the finite number of Medicaid and Medicaid-eligible residents in Nassau County. Curr ently, Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center has a working relationship with four of the approved Medica id managed care plans serving Nassau County. Below is the utilization by payor source for the current year of 2012, and the first and third years subsequent to receiving approval of this project. Utilization by Payor Source 2012Year One of Extension Medicaid 2.8% 3.0% The applicant states approximately 15% of procedures in 2012 were performed on patients residing in the neighborhoods that were included in the Colon Cancer Outreach Initiative. They also state that the absolute number, as well as the overall percentage of procedures performed at no cost to the patients, has increased in each consecutive year. It should be noted that t he applicant has found the lack of healthcare insurance was not as much of a barrier to accessing their healthcare services as cultural barriers within the minority communi ties. Over the past five years the center has worked with Nassau County's healthcare providers and community-based or ganizations to promote colon cancer awareness, screening, and early detection. Some of the organizations are: Winthrop University Hospital, South Nassau Communities Hospital, Rota-Care, Grace Ca thedral International, L.I. Inter-Denominational Conference of Clergy, and Latin/African American Chapl ain Association. Also, the facility maintains an open access program and free transportation. During the first nine months of 2013, Medicaid represented approximately 4.9% of the center's overall activity (which compares unfavorably to the initial 10% commitment as projected in the 2006 CON). The appl icant states a 10% Medicaid commitment is not achievable, and thus reduced its Medicaid commitment to 5%. Project # 131069-E Exhibit Page 7 The applicant states while they have succeeded in reac hing the minority communities with their Colon Cancer Outreach Program, they ov erestimated the percentage of uninsured within these communities and fell short of their 5% commitment. In an effort to address this shortfall they are working with a public relations firm to refocus on the targeted populations. Cu rrently charity care is approximately 2%, and they believe that charity care of 3% is a reasonable and achievable projection. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this application. Gastro Operating Company, LLC d/b/a Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center, projects an operati ng excess of $4,134,954 and $4,096,031 in the first and third years, respectively. Revenues are ba sed on current and projected federal and state governmental reimbursement methodologies, while commercial payers are based on experience. The budget appears reasonable. Presented as BFA Attachment A and B are Gastro Operating Company, LLC, d/b/a Meadowbrook Endoscopy Center's 2011 and 2012 certified financia l summaries, which show an average negative working capital of $211,471, an average positive equity position of $619,338, an d an average positive net income of $2,268,115. The applicant st ates working capital will turn posit ive during the current fiscal year. It appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capab ility to proceed in a financially feasible manner and approval is recommended.

[AER] Council Action Date December 12, 2013. Project # 131296-B Exhibit Page 4 Need Analysis Background Oneida Health Systems, Inc. and eight physicians are seeking approval to establish and construct a diagnostic and treatment center to provide multi-specialty ambulator y surgery services at 5299 Route 233, Westmoreland, 13323, in Oneida County. Analysis The service area includes Oneida and Madison Coun ties; it will also serve communities of the surrounding areas. Oneida County has two freestanding single-specialty ASCs as County (Source: SPARCS 2012) ASC Type Name of the Facility Total Patients 2012 Ophthalmology Griffis Eye Surgery Center (Opened Jan 3, 2012) 0 Endoscopy Mohawk Valley Endoscopy Center 5,534 The participating surgeons currently perform approx imately 4,668 procedures per year. The number of projected surgical procedures to be performed is 3, 497 in Year 1 and 4,231 procedures in Year 3. These projections are based on the current practices of the participating surgeons. Oneida Healthcare Systems (OHS) has exper ienced problems providing adequate emergency department coverage for orthopedic services. Curr ently, OHS's one orthopedic surgeon can provide emergency department coverage one out of five nights. In the last four years, OHS did not have success in recruiting orthopedic surgeons and believes that the proposed ASC will improve opportunities for the recruitment of orthopedic personnel. OHS plans to recruit two orthopedic surgeons to provide adequate emergency department coverage for these services. Currently, OHS has four (4) operating rooms. Thes e ORs are operating at full capacity. In 2012, OHS had a total of 8,040 surgical patients (inpatient cases = 998, ambulatory surgery patients = 7,042), for a total of 2,010 patients per OR per year. Upon approval of the proposed ASC, OHS and the proposed ASC will have a total of eight (8) operating rooms. Assumi ng a volume of 1,200 procedures per OR per year, the hospital and the ASC will have a combined capacity to perform 9,600 procedures per year. The distribution of the hospital's current 8,040 cases per year across these eight ORs would yield an average of 1,005 procedures per OR per year, which would leave additional capacity for growth in surgical volume from the recruitment of additional orthopedists to the service area. OHS, at present, does not provide pain managemen t services. The proposed ASC will provide this service. The applicant is committed to serving all persons without regard to their ability to pay. The applicant has provided a statem ent that the proposed financial/re ferral structure has been assessed in light of anti-kickback and self-ref erral laws with consultation of legal counsel. This statement is acceptable to the Department. Conclusion Approval of the proposed ambulatory surgery cent er will improve opportunities to recruit orthopedic surgeons for OHS, easing the lack of emergency department coverage by orthopedic surgeons at the hospital. The ambulatory surgery centers will also a llow OHS to relieve overcrowding in its ORs and use the hospital's operating rooms pr imarily for inpatients. Project # 131296-B Exhibit Page 5 Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval wi th an expiration of the operating certificate five (5) years from the date of issuance is recommended.

Included in the review were the results of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professional reviews, and/or comprehensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were properly corrected with appropriate remedial action. Integration with Community Resources The facility will ensure that patients ha ve access to primary care servic es through referrals to local area physicians and hospital based clinics. Outreach to the underserved will include working with hospital emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics so a ll patients have access to high quality orthopedic and pain management services. Provisions will be made for those who cannot afford services, and charity care will be provided. The applicant intends on utilizing an Electronic Medica l Record but has not yet identified the specific system it will be using. The facility is open to bec oming part of an Accountable Care Organization or medical home based on regulatory and market demands. The center's goal is to integrate into a Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) /Health Information Exchange (HIE). Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, approval is recommended.

Upon CON approval, the physicians will co ntinue to operate their private practices. Each physician has provided a referral letter in support of utilization projections. Capability and Feasibility Total project costs of $1,784,815 will be met through a bank loan from Oneida Savings for $1,550,000 at stated terms, with the remaining $234,815 from propo sed member's equity. BFA Attachment A is the net worth statement of the proposed me mbers, which indicates the avail ability of sufficient funds. Dr. Patalino has submitted a letter of interest from NBT Bank for a personal loan to satisfy his proportionate share of equity contribution. BFA Attachment B is the financial summary of Oneida Health Systems, Inc., which indicates the availability of sufficient funds. BFA Attachment B, financial summary for Oneida He alth Systems, Inc., indicates the facility has maintained positive working capital and positive net assets and experienced a negative net income of $2,513,273. As of June 30, 2013 the facility has ma intained positive working capital and positive net assets and experienced a negative net income of $1,388,889. The applicant has indicated that the reasons for the loss were due to overtime expense s and the recently implemented electronic medical records that added approximately $700,000 of dep reciation expense in 2012, and approximately $1,400,000 of depreciation expense in 2013. To im prove operations, the applicant indicates that the hospital staff has been reduced by 57 FTEs since 2012, and that the collaboration with physicians in the development of this ASC will strengthen the organization. Working capital needs are estimated at $753,824 bas ed on two months of third year expenses. The applicant will finance $375,000 of working capital at an inte rest rate of 4% over 5 years, for which a letter of interest has been provided by Oneida Savings.

BFA Attachment D Pro-forma Balance Sheet Supplemental Information Outreach Below are summaries of responses by hospitals to le tters from the Department asking for information on the impact of the proposed ambulatory surgery center (ASC) in their service areas. There follows a summary of the applicant's response to DOH's request for information on the proposed facility's volume of surgical cases, the sources of t hose cases, and on how staff will be recruited and retained by the ASC. Facility: Rome Memorial Hospital 1500 N. James Street Rome, New York 13440 Surgery Cases Current OR Use (% of capacity) Ambulatory Inpatient Amb. Surg. Cases by Applicant Physicians Reserved OR Time for Applicant Physicians 42% 2,524 805 None NA The hospital states that the proposed ASC would be located in Oneida County, less than six miles from Rome Memorial, and that the facility is expected to perform 4,231 pr ocedures annually. Citing SPARCS data, the hospital points out that residents of Oneida County, where Rome Memorial is located, underwent 4,500 orthopedic-related ambulatory surgery procedures in 2012. According to the hospital, this means that the ASC would draw heavily from the current ambulatory surgery caseload of Rome Memorial and the other hospitals in Oneida County. The hospital states that such a shift of cases to the new ASC would have a crippling effect on Rome Memorial and the other hospitals in Oneida County, which depend on margins from outpatient services to fund essential inpatient and emergency services and which provide charity care to the most vulnerabl e residents of the community. A loss of revenues to the proposed ASC would exacerbate Ro me Memorial's consolidated loss that totaled $3.4 million through the first six months of 2013. Project # 131296-B Exhibit Page 9 However, Rome Memorial acknowledges that none of the ASC's applicant physicians currently provide services at the hospital. Rome Memorial also states that the low utilization of its operati ng rooms (42%) demonstrates that sufficient surgical capacity is already available in t he area; therefore, the proposed ASC is not needed.

Cases by Applicant Physicians Reserved OR Time for Applicant Physicians 50% 7,200 3,000 None NA The hospital states that, given the under-utilization of 14 operating suites at Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare, including six at its Faxton campus ambulatory su rgery suite, there is no need for additional operating room capacity in the area. The hospital acknowledges that none of the physici ans associated with the proposed ASC currently practice at Faxton St. Luke's facilit ies. Faxton St. Luke's He althcare also states that the proposed ASC will not adversely affect the hospital's community -oriented services. However, Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare believes that the establishment of t he proposed multi-specialty ASC does open the door for the migration of Faxton St. Luke's medical staff to the ASC and also will affect the hospital's ability to recruit new physicians. The hospital points out that Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare has lost approximately $3 million annually in operating profits as more than 4,000 cases were transferred from its facilities to the Mohawk Valley Endoscopy Center, which opened in 2011. Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare also notes that more than 1,000 of its ophthalmological cases have been transferred to an office based ophthalmological practice in Rome, representing a loss in profitability of over $250,000 annually. The hospital states that it is already in serious financial distress, losing mo re than $3.5 million in operations through July, 2013. Therefore, it could ill afford to lose additional revenues to the proposed ASC. In 2012, Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare incurred ex penses of $279.3 million on pa tient service revenue of $278.7 million. In 2011, the hospital had expenses of $271.8 million on revenue of $273.6 million. The hospital's current assets in 2012 were $141.3 million and current liabilities were $59.8 million, for a working capital ratio of to 2.4 to 1.0. In 2011, Fa xton St. Luke's Healthcare's current assets were $118.1 million, and current liabilities were $46.6 million, for a wo rking capital ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. In 2012, Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare incurred expenditures for bad debt of $8.9 million and incurred charity care costs of $340,000. In 2011, Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare in curred expenditures for bad debt of $9.0 million and incurred charity care costs of $657,000.

The hospital states that the 2012 ambulatory surger y volume of the physicians from the proposed ASC contributed $1.1 million to SEMC's bottom line. The hospital also notes that if additional orthopedic and pain management physicians in the area were to take their cases to the ASC, this would result in an additional loss of $692, 347 to SEMC. If the ASC's currently proposed services were to be expanded in the future to include additional ambulatory surgical se rvices (ENT, GYN, etc.), t he hospital projects that the negative impact on SEMC would be up to $7,559,931 per year. The hospital does not describe the impact of any of these losses on its community-oriented services. In 2012, SEMC incurred expenses of $199.9 million on net patient service revenue of $189.8 million. In 2011, the hospital had expenses of $196.5 million on net patient revenue of $191.4 million. The hospital's current assets in 2012 were $59.8 million and current liabilities were $39.5 million, for a working capital ratio of to 1.5 to 1.0.

Facility: Community Memorial Hospital -- No Response 150 Broad Street Hamilton, New York 13346 Supplemental Information from Applicant Need and Sources of Cases: The applicant states that cases will come from the case load of the four physician members' private practice, which rec ently opened a second site and which added two new physicians in September, 2013. The applicant anticipat es that these expansions will triple the number of surgeries being performed by the practice. The pr oposed caseload will include cases currently being performed by one of the member physicians at an ASC in Syracuse some 30-40 miles away. The applicant also expects that the proposed ASC's more convenient geographic access and the cost- effectiveness and quality of ASC services preferred by insu rers and patients will bring cases to the facility. The applicant also anticipates that increased insuranc e coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act will raise the demand for surgic al services in the area. Staff Recruitment and Retention: The proposed ASC will recruit em ployees from accredited schools and training programs and through advertisements in local newspapers and professional publications. In view of recent layoffs from area ho spitals, it is anticipated that fo rmer hospital employees may seek employment at the proposed facility. Staff will be retained though competitive salaries and benefits, incentives for good performance and good human reso urce and communication systems within the organization. Project # 131296-B Exhibit Page 11 Office-Based Cases: The applicant states that \"a portio n\" of the 1,124 pain management procedures currently performed by one of the member physician s in an office-based setting will be performed in the proposed ASC. DOH Comment None of the physicians associated with the proposed ASC currently practice at tw o of the hospitals that submitted comments on the application, Rome Memori al and Faxton-St. Luke's Healthcare. Thus, while the potential exists for the ASC's physi cians to draw from the patient base of each of these facilities, the anticipated impact of the ASC in the specific terms described by these hospitals must be considered speculative. As for the third commenting hospital, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, where the applicant physicians do practice, the Department acknowledges that SEMC's anticipated loss of cases to the ASC could have an adverse impact on the hospital. Howeve r, the health care market in Oneida County, as elsewhere, cannot be held static, and it is incu mbent upon any institution to adapt to changing circumstances, including the entry of new prov iders. Indeed, the Depar tment sees the proposed collaborative relationship between SEMC and Faxton-S t. Luke's Medical Center under the Mohawk Valley Health System active parent arrangement (CON #132204) as just such an adaptation, and it seems likely that the efficiencies and savings to be gained fr om that partnership will enable SEMC to remain competitive with the proposed ASC and with other providers in the region. Based on these considerations, the Department finds no basis for reversal or modification of the recommendation for five-year limited life approval of the proposed ASC based on public need, financial feasibility and operator character and competence.

There follows a summary of the applicant's response to DO H's request for informatio n on the proposed facility's volume of surgical cases, the sources of those cases, and on how staff will be recruited and retained by the ASC. Facility: Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center -- No Response 621 Tenth Street Niagara Falls, New York 14302 Facility: DeGraff Memorial Hospital -- No Response 445 Tremont Street North Tonawanda, New York 14120 Facility: Mount St. Mary's Hospital and Health Center -- No Response 5300 Military Road Lewiston, New York 14092 Supplemental Information from Applicant Need and Sources of Cases: The applicants cite the projected growth in the 65 years and older population of Erie and Niagara counties as a major sour ce of cases, in the form of individuals needing cataract surgery. The applicants also state that 90 percent of the participating physicians' cases are currently performed at the Ambulatory Surgery Center of Western New York, LLC, a multi-specialty ASC located in Amherst, New York. Be cause of the easier scheduling that will be available at the proposed ASC and because of its location more central to the physicians' Erie and Niagara County patient bases (51% of the patients come from Niagara County), t he applicants believe that their patients will prefer to have surgeries performed at the proposed facility. Staff Recruitment and Retention: The applicants state that employees will be recruited from accredited schools and training programs, as well as through adv ertisements in local newspapers and professional publications. The proposed ASC also plans to offer competitive salary and benefits and will maintain good human resource and communication systems. In addition, the ASC will provide a positive work environment and flexible working hours. Office-Based Cases: The applicants state that only a small number of cases are currently being performed in an office setting. As noted, the vast ma jority of the procedures projected for the ASC are currently being performed at the Ambulatory Surger y Center of Western New York. The applicant physicians will continue to perform procedures at Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center and Mount St. Mary's Hospital, to serve on their medical staffs, and to take ophthalmology call.

Project # 132034 B Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Brooklyn United Methodist Church Continuum Services, Inc., a to-be-formed not-for-profit corporation, is seeking approval to establish and construct a 12 stat ion chronic renal dialysis diagnostic and treatment center to be located within the existing 120 bed Broo klyn United Methodist Church residential health care facility at 1485 Dumont Ave, Brook lyn, 11208, in Kings County. Analysis The primary service area for Brooklyn United Methodi st Church Continuum Services is Kings County, which had a population estimate of 2,565,635 for 2 012. The percentage of the population aged 65 and over was 11.5%, above the state av erage of 13.7%. The non-white population percentage was 64.3%, which is above the state average of 42.0%. These ar e the two population groups that are most in need of end stage renal dialysis service. Comparisons be tween Kings County and New York State are listed below. Ages 65 and Over: Census 2011 Capacity The Department's methodology to estimate capacity for chronic dialysis stations is specified in Part 709.4 of Title 10 and is as follows: One free standing station represents 702 treatments per year. This is based on the expectation that the center will operate 2.5 patient shifts per day at 6 days per week, which can accommodate 15 patients per week (2.5 x 6 x 15 x 52 weeks). This projected 702 treatments per year is based on a potential 780 treatments x 52 weeks x 90% utilizat ion rate = 702. The estimate d average number of dialysis procedures each patient receives per year is 156. One hospital based station is calculat ed at 499 treatments per year per stat ion. This is the result of 2.0 shifts per day x 6 days per week x 52 weeks x 80% utilization rate. One hospital based station can treat 3 patients per year. Per Department policy, hospital-based stations can treat fewer patients per year. Statewide, the majority of stations are free standing, as are the majority of applications for new stations. As such, when calculation the need for additional stations, the De partment bases the projected need on establishing additional free standing stations. There are currently 667 free standing chronic dialysis stations operating in Kings County and there are 130 stations in pipeline. Based upon DOH methodology, the 797 free standing stat ions in Kings County could treat a total of 3,587 patients annually. Project # 132034 B Exhibit Page 4 Projected Need Table 1 2011 2016 Total Patients Treated Total Residents Treated ***Projected Total Patients Treated ***Projected Residents Treated 3954 879 1002 1019 1162 Existing Stations 667 667 667 667 Total Stations (Including Pipeline) 797 797 797 797 Net new stations from this project 12 12 12 12 Total Stations After Approval (Including Pipeline) 809 809 809 809 Unmet Need With Approval 70 193 210 353 ***Based upon a estimate of a three percent annual increase The data in the first row, \"Free Standing Stations Needed,\" comes from the DOH methodology of each station being able to treat 4.5 patients, and each ho spital station being able to treat 3 patients annually. The data in the next row, \"Existing Stations,\" comes from the Departm ent's Health Facilities Information System (HFIS). \"Unmet Need\" comes from subtract ing needed stations from existing stations. \"Total Patients Treated\" is from IPRO data from 2011. Conclusion There is currently a need for 365 dialysis stations to tr eat the residents of Kings County. This project will help meet the need for dialysis stations as well as prov ide easier access to dialysis care for residents of the Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home RHCF. The remaining need will then be 353 stations. Recommendation From a need perspective, approval is recommended.

The budget appears reasonable. Review of BFA Attachment A shows that for 2011 and 2012, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home had both a positive working capital position and net asset position. The facility also generated an average net income of $184,177. In 2011, the fac ility however, generated a loss of $204,747, which was due to retroactive adjustments to the ra tes based on Medicaid overpayments.

Out-of-State Compliance Request Forms were sent for all the out-of-state pr oviders listed above as affiliations in the previous seven years.

Project # 131125 E Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Ruby Care LLC is seeking approval to be establishe d as the new operator of Harbour Health Multicare Center for Living (Harbour Health), a 95 bed existing facility located at 1205 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, in Erie County. The facility plans to change its name to Emerald North Nursing and Rehabilitat ion Center. Analysis Erie County is currently overbedded by 602 beds, as shown in Table 1. Table 1: RHCF Need - Erie County 2016 Projected Need 5,291 Current Beds 6,225 Beds Under Construction -332 Total Resources 5,893Unmet Need -602 Harbour Health exceeded the Department's planni ng optimum for 2009 through 2011. Harbour Health also exceeded the Erie County average for the same years. Occupancy was 97.7% in 2009 and 97.5 % in 2010 and 2011 while Erie County averaged 95.3% in 2009, 93.9% in 2010, and 93.4% in 2011. Table 2: Harbour Health /Erie County Facility/County/Region % Occupancy 2009 % Occupancy 2010 % Occupancy 2011 Harbour Health 97.7% 97.5% 97.5% Erie County 95.3% 93.9% 93.4% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and ana lyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion polices and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patients admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage of health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. Harbour Health exceeded the Erie County 75% Medi caid admission percentages of 23.67% in 2010 and 23.36% in 2011 with admissions of 46.94% and 58.82%, respectively. Conclusion This transfer of ownership will not result in any ca pacity changes and will preserve a facility that is a resource for the community and for its Medicaid-eligible population. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

The applicant projected the following expense reductions: Reduced ROM aides ($32,419). Reduce activities by 1 FTE ($32,419). Outsource to HCS RN Day shift time S.W ($12,979) Reduce therapists 1.5 FTE's ($104,208) Capability and Feasibility The purchase price for the acquisition of the operat ing interests of Harbour is $1,180,109.35 and will be financed as follows: Cash of $680,109.35 from t he proposed members at Closing and $500,000 via a promissory note at a 0% intere st rate for a three year term. Working capital requirements are estimated at $901,578, wh ich is equivalent to two months of first year expenses. The applicant will provide the funds from t heir personal resources to meet the working capital requirement. BFA Attachment A are the personal net worth statements of the proposed members of Ruby Care, LLC, which indicates the availability of sufficient funds for the equity contribution for the purchase price and the working capital requirement. The applicant has submitted an affidavit indicating that they will contribute re sources disproportionate to ownership per centages. BFA Atta chment C is the pro-forma balance sheet of Ruby Care, LLC, which indi cates a positive net asset position of $1,335,578 as of the first day of operation. It is noted that assets include $1,250,000 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Th us, members' equity would be a positive $85,578. Project # 131125 E Exhibit Page 9 The submitted budget indicates a net income of $873,893 during the first year subsequent to the change in operator. The budget appears reasonable. Staff notes that with the expected 2014 implementa tion of managed care for nursing home residents, reimbursement is expected to change from state-wide price with a cost based capital component payment methodology to a negotiated reimbursement methodology . Facility payments will be the result of negotiations between the managed long term care plans and the facility. At this point in time, it cannot be determined what financial impact this change in re imbursement methodology will have on the project. BFA Attachment B is the financial summary of Harbour Health Multicare Center for Living for 2010, 2011, and for July 27, 2012 through December 31, 2012. As shown, the facility had an average negative working capital position and an average negative net as set position during the period shown. Also, the facility incurred average losses of $378,434 during t he period shown. The applicant has indicated that the reason for the losses are the result of the fo llowing: high workers compensation expense, unfavorable payor mix, pharmacy operating costs, consulting services and employee benefits at a higher rate than normal. The facility implemented t he following steps to im prove operations: opera ting efficiencies and increasing payer mix by extensive training and in-s ervice of its screening and admissions team. BFA Attachment D are the September 30, 2013 internal financial statements of Ha rbour Health Multicare Center for Living. As shown on Attachment D, the facility had a negative working capital position and a negative net asset position through September 30, 2013. Also, the facility incurred losses of $52,079 through September 30, 2013. The applicant has indi cated that the losses through September 30, 2013, was due to the approximately month long ban on admissi ons at the facility during the late summer of 2013, which caused occupancy to dip during the fall of 2013. During the second half of October, 2013, the facility regained its prior occupancy levels. Also , the facility has realized higher paying Medicaid and HMO residents, which re sulted in part from the facility's exclusiv e contract with the county hospital to admit from their \"ALC List\" residents, who, for a vari ety of reasons, are difficult to discharge from the hospital. This program has been successful such th at the facility is developing a similar program with one of the largest hospitals in the region. As a result of these arrangements, the facility will continue to receive additional admissions of residents for which higher reimbursement is received. BFA Attachment E is the financial summary of West Lawrence Care Center. As shown, the facility had an average negative working capital position and an aver age positive net asset position from 2010 through 2012. The reason for the negative working capital po sition is that the facility experienced historical losses. Also, the facility incurred average historic al losses of $81,385 from 2010 through 2012. The applicant has indicated that the reasons for the loss es were due to a retroactive rate reduction of $833,857 and an approximate $40 per patient day reduction in the facility's Medicaid rate. The applicant implemented the following steps to improve operations: re-evaluating staffing patterns, decreasing excess staff, and aggressively re structuring contracts and insurance policies. Subject to the noted contingencies, it appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner, and contingent approval is recommended. Recommendation From a financial perspective, approval is recommended.

Table 2: Hawthorn Health Multicare Center for Living /Harbour Health Multicare Center for Living /Erie County Facility/County/Region % Occupancy 2009 % Occupancy 2010 % Occupancy 2011 Hawthorn Health Multicare 90.7% 88.2% 86.9% Erie County 95.5% 93.8% 91.7% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and ana lyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion polices and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patients admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage of health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. Hawthorn Health Multicare Center for Living Medi caid admission percentage exceeded the Erie County 75% Medicaid admission percentages of 23.67% in 2010 and 23.36% in 2011 with admissions of 45.51% and 52.91% respectively. Conclusion Approval of this application will help maintain a community resource that provides beds for many Medicaid and low income patients in Erie County. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

The facility is in compliance with CMS 2013 sprinkler mandates. Conclusion No negative information has been received concerni ng the character and competence of the proposed applicants identified as new members. Recommendation From a programmatic perspective, is recommended. Financial Analysis Asset Purchase Agreement The change in ownership will be effe ctuated in accordance with an executed purchase agreement, the terms of which are summarized below: Date: March 6, 2012 Seller: Presbyterian Senior Care of Western New York, Inc. Purchaser: Opal Care, LLC Purchased Assets: All of the rights, title and inte rest in, to or under the basic assets, free and clear of all liens, claims, assessments, security interests, mortgages, collateral assignments, leases, attachments, charges, violations, levies and other encumbrances or defects in title of and type whatsoever.

The applicant has provided an executed promissory note for $550,000 with no interest, payable in three equal annual installments with the remaining balance of $892,356 to be paid with equity from the proposed members. BFA Attachment A is the net worth statements of the proposed members, which indicates available resources. The proposed members have submitted affidavit s stating they will contribute resources disproporti onate to ownership percentage. The applicant has submitted an original affidavit, whic h is acceptable to the Department, in which the applicant agrees, notwithstanding any agreement, arrangement or understanding between the applicant and the transferor to the contrary, to be liable and responsible for any Medicaid overpayments made to Project # 131156 E Exhibit Page 7 the facility and/or surcharges, assessments or fees due from the transferor pursuant to Article 28 of the Public Health law with respect to the period of time prior to the applicant acquiring its interest, without releasing the transferor of it s liability and responsibility. Lease Agreement The applicant has submitted a draft lease agreeme nt, the terms of which are summarized below: Premises: A 122-bed RHCF located at 1175 Delaware Lessor: 1175 Delaware Avenue Realty, LLC Opal Care, LLC Terms: 20 years Rental: $142,000/year Provisions: Lessee responsible for taxes, utilities, insurance and maintenance. Benjamin Landa, husband of proposed member Judy Landa, is a member of 1175 Delaware Avenue Realty, LLC; therefore, the lease arrangement is a non-arm's length agreement. The lease payments are equal to 55% of debt service on the mortgage plus $10 ,000. The applicant has submitted an executed assignment agreement to assign all of its right, titl e and interest as buyer under the purchase agreement with respect to the property to 1175 Delaware Avenue Realty, LLC. Operating Budget The applicant has submitted an operating budget, in 2013 dollars, for the first year subsequent to change in ownership summarized below: Revenues: $7,690,323 90.2% The following is noted with respect to the submitted RHCF operating budget: Expenses include lease rental Medicare and private pay assume current rates of payment. Medicaid rate is based on the 2013 Medicaid rate published by DOH with no trend to 2014 The capital component of the Medicaid rate is based on the return of and return on equity reimbursement methodology. Utilization by payor source for year one and three is expected as follows: Medicare 8.73%Medicaid 80.67% Private Pay 10.6% Breakeven occupancy is projected at 78.0% Capability and Feasibility The total purchase price of $1,442,356 will be met with a $550,000 promissory note at stated terms to be held by the seller, Presbyterian Senior Care of West ern New York, Inc., with the remaining $892,356 from member's equity. Working capital requirements are estimated at $1,101, 913, based on two months of first year expenses, which will be provided as equity from the propose d members. BFA Attachment B is the pro-forma balance sheet of Opal Care, LLC as of the first day of operation. As shown, the facility will initiate Project # 131156 E Exhibit Page 8 operation with $1,858,000 member's equity. It is not ed that assets include $1,500,000 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it rec ognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Thus, member's equity would be a positive $358,000. The submitted budget indicates a net income of $1,078,844 for the first year subsequent to change in ownership. BFA Attachment E is a budget sensitiv ity analysis based on the 2011 utilization by payor. DOH staff notes that the applicant has taken a conser vative approach in calculating first year revenues. The budget appears reasonable. Staff notes that with the expected 2014 implementa tion of managed care for nursing home residents, Medicaid reimbursement is expected to change fr om a state-wide price with a cost-based capital component payment methodology, to a negotiated re imbursement methodology. Facility payments will be the result of negotiations between the managed long term care plans and the facility. At this point in time, it cannot be determined what financial impact this change in reimbursement methodology will have on this project. Review of BFA Attachment C, financial summary of Hawthorn Health Multicare Center for Living, indicates the facility has experienced negative working capital, negative equity and an average net loss of $518,036 for 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2012, under receivership, the facility experienced negative working capital, negative equity and a net loss of $659,178. As of September 30, 2013, the facility experienced negative working capital, negativ e equity, and generated a net income of $5,562. The applicant has stated the reason for the losses wa s due to necessary window and masonry repairs, leaving the rooms being repaired and adjacent rooms unoccupied until repairs were complete. This caused a significant decrease in census, from which the facility had a hard time recovering due to competition in the area. To improve operations the receiver has impl emented the following operating efficiencies: Reduced expenses through a decrease in sta ff for a cost savings of approximately $677,667. Termination of two contracts that will reduce yearly operating expenses by approximately $300,000. An increase in census, including Medicare and HMO residents, resulted from the facility's exclusive contract with the county hospital to adm it residents who are difficult to discharge from the hospital, as well as reimbursement by the hospi tal of facility costs until Medicaid approval is obtained. Extensive training and in-service of its scre ening and admissions team has been successful in increasing payor mix. Review of BFA Attachment D, financial summary of We st Lawrence Care Center, indicates the facility has experienced average negative working capital, ma intained average positive equity, and experienced an average net loss of $81,385 for the period shown. The applicant has indicated the reason for the losses were due to approximately $833,857 in retroactive rate reductions and an approximate $40 per patient day reduction in the facility's Medicaid rate. To improve operations, the facilit y is reevaluating staffing patterns, decreasing excess staff, and restructur ing contracts and insurance policies. Based on the preceding, and subject to the noted contingency, it appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner, and approval is recommended. Recommendation From a financial perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

South Sh ore Nursing Realty, LLC, a related entity, will purchase the nursing home property. Analysis There is currently a need for 1,417 beds in the Long Island region as indicated in Table 1 below. However, the overall occupancy for the Long Island R egion is 92.4% for 2011, as indicated in Table 2. Table 1: RHCF Need - Long Island Region 2016 Projected Need 16,962 Current Beds 16,000Beds Under Construction -455Total Resources 15,545Unmet Need 1,417 South Shore Healthcare's utilizati on was 109.4% in 2009, 114.7% in 2010, and 109.1% in 2011. As a facility that provides sub-acute care services ta ilored to seniors as well as adults ages 16 and older, patient turnover is higher than at other residential health care facilities. Table 2: South Shore Healthcare/Nassa u County/Long Island Region Occupancy Facility/County/Region % Occupancy 2009 % Occupancy 2010 % Occupancy 2011 South Shore Healthcare 109.4% 114.7% 109.1% Nassau County Region 94.5% 94.0% 92.4% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and analy zed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage of Health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. South Shore Healthcare's Medicaid admissions of 4.54% in 2010 and 5.72% in 2011 did not exceed the Nassau County 75% rates of 14.16% in 2010 and 13.61% in 2011. South Shore Healthcare did not meet the county's annual percentage rate of Medicaid ad missions and will be required to follow the contingent approval requirements as noted below.

Operating Budget Following is a summary of the submitted operating bud get, presented in 2013 dollars, for the first year subsequent to change in ownership: Revenues: Medicaid $3,684,000Medicare Total $13,495,444Project # 131264 E Exhibit Page 7 Net Income $ 106,256 Total Patient Days 32,747 Medicaid capital component includes lease rental payment. Medicare and private pay revenues are based on current payment rates. Medicaid rates are based on 2013 Medicaid pricing rates with no trend to 2014. Other income represents ancillary se rvices, beauty shop and vending machines. Overall utilization is projected at 89.7%. Utilization by payor source is ant 42.94% Private/Other 31.57% Breakeven utilization is projected at 89.0%. Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs associated with this applicat ion. The total purchase price for the operations is $6,250,000 which has already been paid by the proposed members. Working capital requirements are estimated at $2,249, 241 based on two months of first year expenses, and will be satisfied from proposed members' equity. Re view of BFA Attachment A, net worth of proposed members, reveal sufficient resources to satisfy the working capital requirements for the RHCF change in ownership. The submitted budget indicates that a net income of $106,256 would be maintained during the first year following change in ownership. BFA Attachment E is the budget sensitivity analysis based on the June 30, 2013 utilization by payor. DOH staff notes that t he applicant has taken a conservative approach in calculating first year revenues. BFA Attachment B presents the pro-forma balan ce sheet of South Shore Rehabilitation. As shown, the fa cility will initiate operation with $1,385,729 members' equity. The budget appears reasonable. Staff notes that with the expected 2014 implementa tion of managed care for nursing home residents, Medicaid reimbursement is expected to change fr om a state-wide price with a cost-based capital component payment methodology, to a negotiated re imbursement methodology. Facility payments will be the result of negotiations between the managed long term care plans and the facility. At this point in time, it cannot be determined what financial impact this change in reimbursement methodology will have on this project. Review of BFA Attachment C, financial summary of South Shore Healthcare, shows positive working capital, net equity and a net profit from operations of $212,645 as June 30, 2013. The negative net equity in 2012 and the net loss in 2012 and 2011 was due to management fees charged by a related company. Review of Attachment D, financial summaries of proposed member's affiliat ed nursing homes, shows the 11 RHCFs had average positive net income for the period shown with the following exceptions: Little Neck Nursing Home had an average $758,803 net loss from operations due to Medicaid recoupment, but has since maintained a net income of $1,301,044 as of August 31, 2013. Townhouse Extended Care had an average $78,989 loss from operations due to bad debt write-offs and management fees paid to related entities. Silverlake Specialized Rehabilitation had an average $453,085 loss from operations due to lower patient acuity levels, low census and Medicaid recoupment, which they have since corrected by improvement of the census, increased acuity leve ls and the finalization of recoupment in 2012. Based on the preceding and subject to the not ed contingency, it appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner, and approval is recommended.

Project # 132071-E Exhibit Page 3 Need Analysis Background Steuben Operations Associates, LLC d/b/a Steuben C enter for Rehabilitation and Healthcare seeks approval to be established as the new operator of Steuben County Infirmary, a 105-bed residential health care facility located at 7009 Rumsey St reet Extension, Bath, in Steuben County. Analysis There is no remaining RHCF bed need in Steuben County, as shown in Table 1. Table 1: RHCF Need - Steuben County 2016 Projected Need 691 Current Beds 691 Beds Under Construction 0 Total Resources 691Unmet Need 0 Steuben County Infirmary did not exceed the Depart ment's planning optimum of 97% occupancy for 2009, 2010, or 2011. However, utilization exceeded the Steuben County average for the same years. Table 2: Steuben Operations Associates/Steuben County Facility/County/Region % Occupancy 2009 % Occupancy 2010 % Occupancy 2011 Steuben Operations 91.9% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and ana lyzed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion polices and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patients admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage of health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. Steuben County Infirmary did not exceed the Steuben County 75% Medicaid admission percentages of 17.97% in 2010 and 17.14% in 2011 with admis sions of 16.89% and 5.08%, respectively. Conclusion This transfer of ownership will not result in any cacpacity changes and will preserve a facility that is serving the community, with higher occupancy rates than other RHCFs in the county. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

The members of Steuben Land Associates, LLC are Daryl Hagler (99%) and Jonathan Hagler (1%). The applicant members have submitted an original affi davit, which is acceptable to the Department, in which the applicant agrees, notwithstanding any ag reement, arrangement or understanding between the applicant and the transferor to the contrary, to be liable and responsible for any Medicaid overpayments made to the facility and/or surcharges, assessments or fees due from the transferor pursuant to Article 28 of the Public Health Law with respect to the period of time prior to the applicant acquiring interest, without releasing the transfero r of its liability and responsibility. Lease Agreement Facility occupancy is subj ect to an executed lease agreement, t he terms of which are summarized as follows: Date: June 15, 2013 Premises: A 105 bed RHCF located at 7009 Rumsey Street Extension, Bath Landlord: Steuben Land Associates, LLC Project # 132071-E Exhibit Page 8 Tenant: Steuben Operations Associates, LLC Terms: 30 years commencing on the execution of the lease Rental: Base rent equal to the debt serv ice payments of the mortgage covering the premises. $316,406 per year plus $250,000 per year. Provisions: Tenant is responsible for taxe s, insurance, utilities and maintenance The lease arrangement is an arm's length agreement. The applicant has submitted an affidavit attesting to the relationship between landlord and tenant in that members of each company have previous business relationships involving real esta te transactions of other nursing homes. Operating Budget Following is a summary of the submitted operating b udget for the RHCF, presented in 2013 dollars, for the first and third year subsequent to change in ownership: Revenues: Medicaid $6,941,932 Medicare 1,896,139 Private Expenses: 1,178,669 $334,256 Utilization: (patient days) 38,284 Occupancy 99.9% The following is noted with respect to the submitted RHCF operating budget: Expenses include lease rental. Medicaid revenues include assessment revenues. Medicaid rates are based on 2013 Medicaid pricing rates with no trend to 2014. Medicare and Private rates are based on the exper ience of the County and the applicant's experience in assuming operations of similar facilities. Overall utilization is projected at 99.9%, while ut ilization by payor source is expected Medicaid 76.3% Medicare 9.3% Private Pay 14.4% Breakeven occupancy is projected at 97.0%. Capability and Feasibility The purchase price of the operations will be fi nanced by a loan from Greystone of $6,288,750 at an interest rate of 5.26% for 10 years, with a 20 year amortization, with the remaining $698,750 from the members of Steuben Operations Associates, LLC. BF A Attachment A is the net worth statement of proposed members, which shows sufficient equity. A Le tter of Interest has been submitted by Greystone. The members of Steuben Operations Associates, LLC hav e submitted an affidavit stating that they will fund the balloon payment, should acceptable financing not be available at the time the loan comes due after the 10 year period. BFA Attachment E is the interest and amortization schedule for the ten year term. Project # 132071-E Exhibit Page 9 Working capital requirements are estimated at $1, 890,535, based on two months of the first year expenses, of which $945,268 will be satisfied from the proposed member's equity, and the remaining $945,267 will be satisfied through a loan from Greystone at 5.26% over 5 years. A letter of interest has been supplied by the bank. BFA Attachment A is t he net worth of proposed members, which shows sufficient equity . The submitted budget indicates that a net income of $334,256 would be maintained during the first year following change in ownership. DOH staff has reviewed the difference between the current 2012 net operating loss of $2,881,322, as shown on BFA Attach ment E, and the first year budgeted net income of $334,256 and has concluded that the difference is main ly due to the reduction in employee fringe benefits of $2,872,740. The facility will no longer participate in the County benefit plan. BFA Attachment G is the budget sensitivity analysis based on September 25, 2013 current utilization of the facility, which shows the budgeted revenues would decrease by $183,076, resu lting in a net income in year one of $151,180. BFA Attachment C is the pro-forma balance shee t of Steuben Operations Associates, LLC d/b/a Steuben Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare, which indi cates positive members' equity of $2,020,268 as of the first day of operations. It is noted that assets in clude $6,987,500 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid re imbursement purposes. Thus, members' equity would be negative $4,967,232. The bud get appears reasonable. Staff notes that with the expected 2014 implementa tion of managed care for nursing home residents, Medicaid reimbursement is expected to change fr om a state-wide price with a cost-based capital component payment methodology to a negotiated reim bursement methodology. Facility payments will be the result of negotiations between the managed long term care plans and the facility. At this point in time, it cannot be determined what financial impact this change in reimbursement methodology will have on this project. As shown on BFA Attachment D , the facility ma intained positive working capital in 2009-2010, experienced negative working capital in 2011, and main tained positive net assets and an average net loss from operations of $2,137,607 for the period shown. As shown on BFA Attachment E, the facility experi enced negative working capital, net assets and a net operating loss of $2,881,322 in 2012. The county cannot maintain its current operation due to reoccurring losses from year to year and has therefore decided to sell the facility. BFA Attachment H is the financial summary of the pr oposed members' affiliated health care facilities and shows the facilities have maintained positive income from operations for the periods shown with one exception, Chittenango Center fo r Rehabilitation had loss due to a one-time audit recoupment.

Analysis There is currently a need for 8,862 beds in the New Yo rk City Region as indicated in Table 1 below. However, the overall occupancy for the New York City Region is 94.8% for 2011 as indicated in Table 2. Table 1: RHCF Need - New York City Region 2016 Projected Need 51,071 Current Beds 41,895 Beds Under Construction 314 Total Resources 42,209 Unmet Need 8,862 Sephardic's utilization was 96.5% in 2009, 96.5% in 2010, and 96.6% in 2011. Sephardic has continually exceeded the County and the Region's overall occupancy rates. Table 2: Sephardic Nursing & Rehabilitation Center /Kings County/New York City Region Occupancy Facility/County/Region % Occupancy 2009 % Occupancy 2010 % Occupancy 2011 Sephardic Nursing & Rehabilitation Center 96.5% 96.5% 96.6% Kings County Region 94.9% 95.4% 94.8% Access Regulations indicate that the Medicaid patient admissions standard shall be 75% of the annual percentage of all Medicaid admissions for the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility is located. Such planning area percentage shall not in clude residential health care facilities that have an average length of stay 30 days or fewer. If there are fo ur or fewer residential health care facilities in the planning area, the applicable standard for a planning area shall be 75% of the planning area percentage of Medicaid admissions, whichever is less. In calculating such perc entages, the Depart ment will use the most current data which have been received and analy zed by the Department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate adjustments in its admis sion policies and practices so that the proportion of its own annual Medicaid patient's admissions is at least 75% of the planning area percentage of Health Systems Agency percentage, whichever is applicable. Sephardic's Medicaid admissions of 49.81% in 2010 and 45.18% in 2011 exceeded the Kings County 75% rates of 28.12% in 2010 and 30.92% in 2011. Conclusion Approval of this application will result in the maintena nce of a necessary commu nity resource that provides needed services to the Medicaid population. Recommendation From a need perspective, contingent approval is recommended.

The purchase price for the transfer of the real property interests of t he facility is $30,000,000. The purchase price for the real estate interests will be met as follows: equity of $750,000 from the proposed members, personal loan of $2,250,000 at an interest rate of 5% for a ten year term, and a bank loan of $27,000,000 at an interest rate of 4.75% for a ten year term.

The remainder, $3,157,586, will be met via equity of $40 0,000 from the proposed members of SGRNC, LLC and a personal loan of $2,757,586 at an interest rate of 5% for a ten year term. BFA Attachment A is the personal net worth statements of t he proposed members of SG RNC, LLC, which indi cates the availability of sufficient funds for the equity contributions. The proposed members have sufficient funds, which includes real estate and operational interests in other nursing homes, to pay off the personal loan. BF A Attachment C is the pro-forma balance sheet of SGRNC, LLC as of the first day of operation, which in dicates a positive net asset position of $6,515,172. It is noted that assets include $6,000,000 in goodwill, which is not an available liquid resource, nor is it recognized for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. Thus member's equity would be a positive $515,172. The submitted budget indicates a net income of $7 38,084 during the first year after the change in operator. The submitted budget appears reasonable. BFA Attachment B is the financial summary of Seph ardic Home for the Aged from 2010 through 2012. As shown, the facility had an average positive working capital position and an average positive net asset position from 2010 through 2012.

As shown, the facility had a positiv e working capital position and a positive net asset position. Also, the facility incurred an operating deficit of $175,231 through June 30, 2013. The applicant has indicated that the reason for the losses are the re sult of the facility not adapting to rapidly changing dynamics in the NYC long term care market, primarily with respect to MLTCP contracting in the face of mandating Medicaid managed long term care. After se veral years of losses, the Board of Directors made the decision to sell the nursing home. BFA Attachment E is the financial summary of Hamilt on Park Nursing and Rehabilit ation. As shown, the facility had an average negative working capital position and an average positive net asset position from 2010 through 2012. The applicant has indicated that the reason for the negative working capital position is the result of the facility having had liabilities to re lated parties. Also, the facility achieved an average net income of $1,030,503 from 2010 through 2012. Subject to the noted contingencies, it appears that the applicant has demonstrated the capability to proceed in a financially feasible manner.
