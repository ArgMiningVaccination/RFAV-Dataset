The Community rate cell will be paid for Enrollees who do not meet the State's nursing home level of care criteria and do not reside in a NF or qualify for an HCBS Waiver. 175 4.2.1.2.5 Communi ty Plus. The Community Plus rate cell will be paid as described in Section 4.5.1. 4.2.1.3 Using July 2014 actual enrollment by rate cell, the State's actuary will take the calendar year 2013 Medicaid claims experience for those individuals actually enrolled and stratify them into the same cost cohorts as done when making the selection projections for the initial rates. Actual selection experience for the cohorts will be compared to projected selection and appropriate adjustments to the Medicaid portion of the rat es, up or down, will be. The rate adjustment will be effective for July 2014 payments . Using October 2014 actual enrollment, the State's actuary will conduct a similar analysis in developing 2015 rates. 4.2.2 Underlying Rate Structure for Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.2.2.1 Medicare will pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for the Medicare Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC Model and the CMS -HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2. 4. Medicare will also pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for Medicare Part D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 4.2.2.2 Medicare A/B Baseline 4.2.2.2.1 The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) standardized county rates and the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the target population projecte d to otherwise be in each program in the absence of the Demonstration. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospital wage index a nd physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this 176 adjustment will be fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2014, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. 4.2.2.2.2 Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the M edicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Enrollees in the functioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3 -star county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county. 4.2.2.2.3 Both baseline sp ending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as PMPM standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardized pay ment rates at the time of payment. 4.2.2.2.4 The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual Fee - for-Service (FFS) estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 177 4.2.2.2.5 If an Enrollee elects to receiv e the Medicare hospice benefit, the Enrollee may remain in the Demonstration Plan, but will obtain the hospice service through the Medicare FFS benefit and the Demonstration Plan would no longer receive the Medicare Parts A/B Component for that Enrollee as described in this section. Medicare hospice services and hospice drugs and all other Original Medicare services would be paid for under Medicare FFS. Demonstration Plans and providers of hospice services would be required to coordinate these services with the rest of the Enrollee's care. The Demonstration Plan would continue to receive the Medicare Part D Component for all non -hospice covered drugs. Election of hospice services does not change the Medicaid Component. 4.2.2.2.6 For Enrollees electing hospice service s while residents of a NF, the Medicaid payment to the hospice provider for the \"room and board\" component will be the responsibility of the Demonstration Plan . 4.2.2.3 Medicare Part D 4.2.2.3.1 The Medicare Part D Component is comprised of the Part D direct subsidy set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year, as well as CMS -estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts; these payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. 4.2.2.3.2 The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiplying the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -178 sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. 4.2.3 Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.2.3.1 Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and Medicaid components of the capitated rate herein . 4.2.3.1.1 Demonstration Year 1: 1% 3% 4.2.3.1.3 Demonstration Year 3: 5% 4.2.3.2 Except as otherwise specified, rate updates will take place on January 1st of e ach calendar year. 4.2.3.3 Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of the rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savin gs percentages. 4.2.4 Risk Adjustment Methodology . 4.2.4.1 Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee. Except as specified in Section 4.2. 4.2, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.2.4.2 Coding Intensity Adjustment Factor 4.2.4.2.1 In calendar year 201 4, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees except as indicated in Section 4.2.4.2.3 . This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2014 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2013. Operationally CMS will 179 still apply t he full prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment factor to the risk scores but will increase the Medicare A/B Component for non -ESRD beneficiaries and beneficiaries with an ESRD status of functioning graft, to offset this. 4.2.4.2.2 In CY 2015, CMS will apply an appropriate coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees; this will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration enrollees in CY 2015 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's enrollment phase -in as of September 30, 2014. 4.2.4.2.3 After calendar year 2015, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to al l Demonstration Enrollees. 4.2.4.2.4 The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 4.2.4.3 Medicare Part D: The Medic are Part D national average bid amount will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.2.4.4 Medicaid: The Medicaid Component uses the rate cell methodology described in Section 4.2.1 , which is sufficient to risk adjust Medicaid Covered Services . 4.3 Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) 4.3.1 Medical Loss Ratio Guarantee: The Contractor has a Target Medical Loss Ratio of eighty -five percent (8 5%). If the Medical Loss Ratio 180 calculated as set forth below is less than the Target Medical Loss Ratio, the Contractor shall refund to the Department and CMS an amount equal to the difference between the calcul ated Medical Loss Ratio and the Target Medical Loss Ratio (expressed as a percentage) multiplied by the Coverage Year Revenue . The Department and CMS shall calculate a Medical Loss Ratio for Enrollees under this Contract for each Coverage Year , and shall p rovide to the Contractor the amount to be refunded , if any, to the Department and CMS respectively . Any refunded amounts will be distributed back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs , with the amount to each payor based on the proportion between the Medic are and Medicaid Components . At the option of CMS and the Department, separately, any amount to be refunded may be recovered either by requiring the Contractor to make a payment or by an offset to future Capitation payment . The Medical Loss Ratio Calculat ion shall be determined as set forth below; however, the Department and CMS may adopt NAIC reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the Contractor . 4.3.1.1 The MLR will be based on exce pt that the numerator in the MLR calculation will include : 4.3.1.1.1 All Covered Services required in the Demonstration under Section 2.4 and Appendix A ; 4.3.1.1.2 Any services purchased in lieu of more costly Covered Services and consistent with the objectives of the MMAI ; 4.3.1.1.3 Care Coordination Expense. That portion of the personnel costs for Care Coordinators whose primary duty is direct Enrollee contact that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a Benefit Expense. That portion of the personnel costs for Cont ractor's Medical Director that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a Benefit Expense ; and 4.3.1.1.4 To the extent not already so adjus ted by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 422.2400 et seq. and 423.2400 et seq., when the Contractor has a subcapitated payment to a n Affiliate, only the actual 181 payments to Providers, rather than the full subcapitated payment. 4.3.1.2 The revenue used in the Medical Loss Ratio calculation will consist of the total Capitation rate revenue , due from the Department and CMS for services during th e Coverage Year . Revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4. 4.4, regardless of whether the Contractor actually receives the amount in Section 4. 4.4. 4.3.1.3 Data Submission. The Contractor shall submit to the Department and CMS , in the form and manner prescribed by the Department and CMS , the necessary data to calculate and verify the Medical Loss Ratio within seven (7) months after the end of the Coverage Year. 4.3.1.4 Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Within ninety (90) days following the six (6) month claims run -out period following the Coverage Year , the Department and CMS shall calculate the Medical Loss Ratio by dividing the Benefit Expense by the Revenue. The Medical Loss Ratio shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second decimal point. The Contractor shall have sixty (60) days to review the Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Each Party shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the Medical Loss Ratio. 4.3.1.5 Coverage Year. The Coverage Year shall be the calendar year. The Medical Loss Ratio Calculation shall be prepared using all data available from the Coverage Year, including IBNP and six (6) months of run -out for Benefit Expense. 4.4 Payment Terms 4.4.1 CMS will make monthly, prospective Capitation payments to the Contractor. The Department will make monthly Capitation payments to the Contractor. The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Enrollee's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate or the Medicare Advantage 3 -star county rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Enrollee's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D NAMBA , with the addition of the estimated average 182 monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. The Medicaid Component for each rate cell will be the product of the number of Enrollees in each category multiplied by the payment rate for that rate cell . 4.4.2 Timing of Capitation Payments 4.4.2.1 Enrollments 4.4.2.1.1 CMS and the Department will make monthly per member per month Capitation payments to the Contractor. The PMPM Capitation payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Enrollees with effect ive enrollment into the Contractor's Demonstration Plan as of the first day of that month, as described in Section 2.3.1 . 4.4.2.2 Disenrollments 4.4.2.2.1 The final per member per month Capitation payment made by CMS and the Department to the Contractor for each Enrollee wi ll be for the month in which the disenrollment was submitted, the Enrollee loses eligibility, or the Enrollee dies (see Section 2.3. 2). 4.4.2.3 Timing of Medicaid Component of the Rate 4.4.2.3.1 Capitation paid by the Department for the Medicaid Component is due to the Con tractor by the fifteenth (15th) day of the service month. Payments due from the Department, including late charges, will be paid in accordance with the State Prompt Payment Act (30 ILCS 540) and rules (74 Ill. Admin. Code 900) when applicable. Collection o f underlying amounts owed plus interest shall be the Contractor's sole financial remedy against the Department for late payments by the State. Payment terms contained on the Contractor's invoices shall have no force and effect. 183 4.4.2.4 Adjustments in amounts paid by the Department due to lags in the eligibility system are described in Section 4.2.1 . 4.4.3 Modifications to Capitation Rates CMS and the Department will jointly notify the Contractor in advance and in writing as soon as practicable, but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to processing the change to the Capitation rate, of any proposed changes to the Capitation rates , and the Contractor shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Secti on 4. 7. Any mid -year rate changes would be articulated in a rate report, subject to the signature requirement in Section 4.1.1.3 . 4.4.3.1 Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4. 4.3.2, changes to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines outside of the annual Medicare Advantage and Part D rate announcement and the annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and the Department jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in enrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in Federal law and/or State policy compared to assumptions about Federal law and/or State law or poli cy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes in coding intensity. 4.4.3.2 For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will update baselines by amounts identified by the independent Office of the Actuary necessary to best effect uate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.4.3.3 Subject to Section 4. 4.3.2, if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and the Department to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 4.4.3.4 Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and the Departm ent jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially 184 higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines . 4.4.3.5 Any material changes in the Medicaid State plan, including pertaining to Covered Services, payment schedules and related methodologies, shall be reflected in corresponding capitation payment adjustments. Contractor will not be required to implement such changes without advance notice and correspon ding adjustment in the capitation payment. In addition, to the extent other Medicaid costs are incurred absent the Demonstration, such costs shall be reflected in corresponding capitation payment adjustments. 4.4.4 Quality Withhold Policy for Medicaid and Medica re A/B Components 4.4.4.1 Under the Demonstration, both CMS and the Department will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation Rate, with the exception of the Part D Component amounts . The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the Contractor's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.4.4.2 CMS and the Department will evaluate the Contractor's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. 4.4.4.3 Whether or not the Contractor has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public . 4.4.4.4 Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including the more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in future technical guidance. 4.4.4.5 Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 4.4.4.5.1 Figure 4.1 below identifies core withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Together, these will be utilized as the basis for a 1% withhold. Additional detai ls, including 185 technical specifications, withhold methodology and required benchmarks, will be provided in subsequent guidance. 4.4.4.5.2 For Demonstration Year One, which crosses calendar years, the Contractor will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required quality withhold requirements at the end of CY 2014 and at the end of CY 2015. The determination in CY 2014 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual enrollment volume during CY 2014. Consi stent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each CY.

The Medicaid Component payment implications for Enrollee move ment among rate cells are described below . 4.5.1.1 The Department will pay the HCBS Waiver Plus rate for the first three (3) months following the month of an NF discharge for an Enrollee who had been in a NF for at least ninety (90) days and moves to a HCBS Waiver . 4.5.1.2 The Department will pay the HCBS Waiver Plus rate for the first three (3) months that an Enrollee , first eligible for NF services or HCBS Waiver services, is served in a HCBS Waiver without being admitted to a NF . 4.5.1.3 The Department will pay the Community Pl us rate for the first three (3) months following the month of NF discharge for an Enrollee who had been in a NF for at least ninety (90) days and moves to the community without enrollment in a HCBS Waiver. 4.5.1.4 For NF admissions on or after October 1, 2014, for the first three (3) months an Enrollee is a Resident of a NF following the month of admission to a NF, the Department will pay the Capitation rate being paid during the month of admission, and not the Capitation rate for the Nursing Facility rate cell. If the Capitation rate paid during the month of admission was the Waiver Plus rate or the Community Plus rate, that Capitation rate will be paid only until it has been paid for three (3) months in total. The Capitation rate will then revert to the HCBS Waive r rate or the Community Plus Capitation rate, as applicable, until after the first three (3) months the Enrollee resides in a NF. However, if an Enrollee transitioning to a NF had previously been transitioned out of a NF after a stay of greater than 90 day s, the Department will pay the NF Capitation rate without the 3 month delay. 189 4.5.2 Medicare Risk Score Changes. Medicare CMS -HCC, CMS -HCC ESRD, and RxHCC risk scores will be updated consistent with prevailing Medicare Advantage regulations and processes. 4.6 Recon ciliation 4.6.1 Medicaid Component Reconciliation . 4.6.1.1 Within thirty ( 30) days after the 820 Payment File is made available, the Contractor shall notify the Department of any discrepancies, including Enrollees who the Contractor believes are in its Demonstration Plan and not on the 820 Payment File, Enrollees included on the 82 0 Payment File who the Contractor believes have not been enrolled with Contractor, and Enrollees included on the 820 Payment File who the Contractor believes are in a different rate cell. The Contractor and the Department will work together to resolve the se discrepancies. Payments to the Contractor will be adjusted for retroactive disenrollment of Enrollees, changes to Enrollee information that affect the Capitation rates (e.g., eligibility classification), monetary sanctions and penalties imposed in acco rdance with Section 5.3.14 , rate changes in accordance with Section 4.3.3 , or other miscellaneous adjustments provided for herein. Adjustments shall be retroactive no more than eighteen (18) months, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Dep artment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment for retroactive disenrollment of Enrollees shall not exceed two (2) months except in instances of the death of an Enrollee or when the Enrollee moves out of the State. The Department will make retroa ctive enrollments only in accordance with Medicare Capitation Reconciliation 4.6.2.1 Medicare capitation reconciliation will comply with prevailing Medicare Advantage and Part D regulations and processes. 4.6.3 Audits/Monitoring 4.6.3.1 CMS and the Departmen t will conduct periodic audits to validate rate cell assignments or other coding.
