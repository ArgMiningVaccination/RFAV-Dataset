It was in - troduced by the sages and seers who lived their life in hill tops, valleys, dense forests and remote places where normal humans couldn't even step in. They always thought about the goodness of mankind . They went in search of herbal plants, seeds and fruits which could remedy each of the sickness the common man was undergoing. With - out any scientist or researcher to experi - ment using chemicals, these see rs with their in depth knowledge identified such plants which could cure any disease per - manently. Truly, all these herbal remedies were considered Godsend! The boon of Ayurveda is that it eradicates the rootcause.In modern era , western medicine has spread its wings into technology and innovation towards every disease that is reported on the earth. With the everlasting contribution of scientists ,this form of medicines has been a call away for every person's emergency medical conditions. Various component s and chemicals are worked on to bring the best out of it and then the medicine is produced. Western form of medicine with its intense effect from such chemicals is said to have spon - taneous effect on the sufferer in no time, relieving him/her from the su ffering. AIM:To study Ayurveda and Modern in relation with treatment. OBJECTIVES Review Article International Ayurvedic Medical Journal ISSN:2320 5091 ABSTRACT Ayurveda is a comprehensive scientific system of medicine evolved in India. Initially it was developed through ancient wisdom, clinical experiences and experimentation in scien - tific manner. The term \" Ayurveda \" meaning ' the knowledge of life' comprises of two San - skrit words viz. ' Aayu ' meaning 'Life' and ' Veda ' meaning 'Knowledge' or 'Science'. Chikitsa is not only treating the disease, it also keeps health in healthy condition and treating the disease relating to physically, mentally and spiritually. Western med icine also known as Modern Medicine and Allopathic Medicine, Allopathic, this is the term originated from a Greek root where allopathic means -which brings different effects not related with the pa - thology of the disease. This s ystem which has made a \"conv entional system of medicine\", allopathic is a disease care system and its job is to manage the disease. Key Words: Ayurveda , Modern, Chikitsa, Treatment, Concepts.Nagesh Gandagi & Shubhangi Patil : Concepts Between Ayurveda And Allopathy In Relation With Treatment 10www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 4; Issue 02; January -2016To study the concepts of Ayurveda and Modern in relation with origin, develop - ment,1*Health of an individual is shaped by the complex interplay of biology, be - havior,socioeconom ic and environmental factors.As per World Health Organiza - tion(WHO) definition, health is not merely the absence of a disease or infir - mity, but a state of physical, mental a nd social well being. Spiritual, emotional and environmental health isthe additional components that must be taken care of while talking about true health .Allopathic , this is the term originated from a Greek root where allopathic means -which brings different effects not related with the pa - thology of the disease. A syste m of medi - cines-full of side effects, in lay man's words but anyhow this has become a syn - onym for evidence based system of medi - cine or modern medicine. This is the glit - tery of this s ystem which has made a \"conventional system of medicine\" and the powerof money behind this has brought it as a front line medicine and now frontline systems of medicines have become alter - native medicine. Western medicine also known as Modern Medicine and Allopa - thicMedicine has helped save millions of lives. Through the advancement of sci - ence, modern medicine is the perfect tool in cases of trauma and serious illnesses. However, allopathic is a disease care sys - tem and its job is to manage the disease. When you walk into a doctor's office, they will ask you your symptoms, check your temperature and blood pressure, and then write a prescription. That prescription will often come with many side effects and that same prescription will not be a cure, but rather a symptom suppres sor. So in reality, most drugs never really take care of the problem. Ayurveda is a combination of two wordsAyuandVeda, meaning theknowledge of life. Their qualitative dis - turbance leads to doshasdisharmony, re - sulting in the occurre nce of various dis - eases. Hence, for control and regression of the disease, balance in the tridosha has been considered as a basic target for thera - peutics in Ayurveda.The concept of pan- chamahabhutas has been found responsi - ble for origin of all the living and non-living things, which means that every substance in this universe is made up of five basic elements; hence, every sub - stance in nature has the potential to be a medicine. Despite using harsh chemical substances as in Allopathy, Ayurvedauses natural medicinal substances that are safer for human body. Knowledge base of Ayur- vedaoriginates from years of experience, observation, empiricism and intuition that arepassed over generations. Ayurveda works by 'defense strategy' rather than 'offense s trategy' by making the host body strong to deal with various physical and mental stresses to human body. By under - standing the origin of the disease ,Ayur- vedatargets eating, breathing, digestion, thoughts, memory and sleep, which are easy approaches helpful to gain good health. It works at mind level and is there - fore able to motivate the patient at mental level, which is very important for improv - ing treatmen t outcome in drug dependence and lifestyle disorders like diabetes melli - tus, hypertension, insomnia and acid peptic diseases.Despite the huge advancement in technological and pharmaceutical sector in modern healthcare system, the world is witnessing a ri sing trend in global dis - eases. The basic reasons are allopathic medicine's incomplete approach towards health, inability to reach the root causes of chronic diseases and its general failure to provide safety and affordability. What is needed is a novel ef fective, safe and eco - nomical approach to assure completeNagesh Gandagi & Shubhangi Patil : Concepts Between Ayurveda And Allopathy In Relation With Treatment 11www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 4; Issue 02; January -2016health in the s ociety. In lieu of the fact that no medicine system is complete in itself and that, besides this, no integration exists between the traditional and modern medicine system until now, it seems im - perative to introduce the concept of sym - biohealth in today's world, which means symbiotic interactio n of allopathy and ayurveda.The origin of life from pre-existing living things, , 'nasato vidyate bhavo, 'omne vivum ex ovo' of modernscience.It focuses on diagnosis, treatment and cure for acute illnesses via potent pharmaceutical drugs, surgery, radiation and other treatment modalities. Allopathy is based on major three steps: Hypothesis, experimentation and observation and fi - nallythe theory or the conclusion. It works in hand with technology that aid to devise diagnostic procedures, drugs with specific actions, vaccine, sophisticated surgical procedures and tran splants, hence, im - parting it the top position among all medi- cine systems . 2*&3*Here is the brief study of the points where Ayurveda andAllopathy differs from each other : Points Allopathy Ayurveda Side EffectsThe name and its derivation suggest that ,this is a system of side effects.Completely natural, so there is no issue of the side effects. Approach Holistic approach is absent Aims at holistic approach EvidenceConsidered as evidence based system of medicine - but not that true. The way allopathic physicians launches and withdraws medicines it never seems to be an evidence based system of medicines.WhenAyurveda follows the nature it directly means that it is following some natural wisdom and a universal truth, which need not to be launch and withdraw. This is the reasonAyurvedic Scholars have emphasized on the thought that Ayurveda has no end and no beginning even \u2014 no launch and no withdraw. WholesomenessBelieve to replace/change of the organs or systems in name of treatment, not much worried about the CURE.ForAyurveda wellness is a complete package, not a scattered issue. NaturalThey believe in chemicals and synthetic things alone.To follow the natu re is the only way to achieve the complete wellness. Therapeutic LevelOn therapeutic level, modern day sciences seem to be con - fused for most of the time. These talk about the treat - ments and management...but never think about the CURE and REPAIRAyurveda considers Cure of a disease as the only way to go for the treatments. According toAyurveda there cannot be less than the Cure in a medi - cal science. Root CauseYou keep on plucking the leaves of a tree and this tree will never end...because growth seems on its leavesAyurveda understands the root cause first and then ap - plies the same understanding to root out the disease fromNagesh Gandagi & Shubhangi Patil : Concepts Between Ayurveda And Allopathy In Relation With Treatment 12www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 4; Issue 02; January -2016and branches but the reason for this growth is only one - the Roots. Same applies on Diseases! Modern day medical sciences never understand this thing and they keep on suppressing the signs and symptoms alone-not concerned with the Root Cause of a disease.the body, this is the reason . Ayurveda achieves the com - plete wellness and a state of cure and back to normalcy very easily. Diet& LifestyleModern sciences are never successful against the dis - eases neither in curing these completely nor in preventing these.Ayurveda is all about how to live-life. So diet and lifestyle are main concerns of Ayur- veda. Medicines are not that important as important is diet and lifestyle according to Ayurveda and this is being followed completely by Ayurveda . Compiled from chemicals naturally available and artifi - cial onesCompiled from the naturally available plants a nd herbs Brings spontaneous relief.Brings permanent cure for the suffering by penetrating deep into the cells or organ causing ill health. It is tested on animals to prove its efficiency. The ef - fect of chemicals can lead to inefficiency and irreversible side effects both on the hu - man and animals. Very few effects can be reversed to normal.It is not tested on animals for its effect and action. Since it is all natural, it does not bring huge amounts of harm to the human kind. When it comes to the plant extracts, every opposite action has a plant to reverse the intensity. Modern western medicine grew up along with age and technology to treat the man - kind.Its existence dates back to centuries ago. Has cure to most of the dis - eases, whil e other life killing diseases are still under re - search to obtain the right medicine.Has cure to almost every dis - ease invariably. Starting from a simple fever to a complicated cancer, the medicines taken for the ill - ness continue to give further sideeffects, which have to be treated with other medicines.Has no side effect on the suf - ferer after the course of medicine is over.

Identification of a doshadisharmony in terms of its deficit, excess or qualitative disturbance and con - sequently ofMahabhuta , and then its re - correction to its original state is requiredto restore health. Through the \"nanaushad - hibhutam jagati kinchit dravyastiti\" dic- tum,Ayurveda identifies every object in the universe as a potential medicine based upon its Panchbhautic composition. The panchabhautic characteristic of medicinal materials used in Ayurveda (herbs and minerals) cannot be identified using the conventional Tridosha theory.Rasaand their elemental composition -The idea of Rasaas an attribute repre senting pharma - cological properties of a substance has re - cently been broug ht under a scientific scrutiny. Ibuprofen and Oleocanthal are found to have similar pharmacological ac - tion despite obvious differences in their chemical structures. These substance s pro- duce a strong stinging sensation in the throat, and irrespective of their structural differences are found to haveCOX-1 and COX-2 inhibiting properties. Their simi - larity of action is attributed to their taste and not to their chemical structure. Rasa, therefore, acts as an intermediary between physician and patient for a logical identifi - cation of right medicine in individual clinical conditions where a diagnosis in terms of elemental imbalance is made. Be- sidesRasa,Ayurveda further identifies a few more attributes to determine pharma - cological property of a substance. These includeGuna(property), Virya(potency), Vipaka(post-digestion property) and Prabhava (special effect) and all these are needed to fully understand the complete pharmacolo gical effect of a substance. The Rasaand corresponding attributes of a substance, independently or in coherence are used in Ayurveda for identifying the pharmacological effect and subsequentlyfor the clinical usage of a medicine. Dif - ferentRasahave also been described to produce variable effects on functions of dosha.This makes the consideration of doshaandrasaof a medicine very crucial in the practice Ayurvedic medicine. 5*Reappraisal of Ayurvedic phyto- chemistry gives a strong support to the Ayurvedicfundamental constructs about the taste ( Guna) of medicinal plants. Ayurvedic pharmaceutics are receiving a new thrust through a reappraisal of Bhasmapreparations (preparations, where herbs, minerals and metals are incinerated to ash under supervised conditions) as novel nano -technological applications. Typical features of Ayurvedic Bhasma have been recently demonstrated through transmission electron m icroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The nano -parti- cle size of Ayurvedic Bhasmas, has been confirmed in another study, where it is proposed that the nano -particles are re - sponsible for its fast and targeted action. These nano -particles are proposed to b e delivered to the target through rapid cel- lular internalization. It is observed that the nano-medical application of various drugs is proportionate to their particle size and shape. Smaller the particle, the quicker is the cellular internalization and c onsequent effects. It is interesting to reiterate here that the pharmacological efficacy of a Bhasmapreparation is largely attributed to the number and type of Puta(traditional incineration process) used in its making. Increased incinerations, therefore, are able to reduce particle size and subsequently give rise to increased efficacy to a given Bhasma.Traditionally, Ayurvedic drugs are purified through Shodhana (biopurifi - cation), which are proposed to reduce drug toxicities through manual, physical or or-Nagesh Gandagi & Shubhangi Patil : Concepts Between Ayurveda And Allopathy In Relation With Treatment 14www.iamj.in IAMJ: Volume 4; Issue 02; January -2016ganic ways. Efficacy of Shodhana meth- ods in reducing toxicity and enhancing safety of Ayurvedic preparations was tested as early as in 1981 when Singh et al. demonstrated an improved pharmacologi - cal property and reduced toxicity in a Sho- dhanatreatedVatsanabha (aconite) sam - ple.Ayurveda also presents some unique clinical applications of its fundamental concepts. Rasayana is one such concept havingextensive potential applications . Rasayana drugs are described to have anti - aging effects. \"Labhopayo hi shastanam rasadinam rasayanam \", is statement from the Cha. Sam. Chik. Sthan. i/i/8that says that Rasayana ,are agents thatare supportive to the qualitative im - provement of tissues. Sharangdhara's statement \"rasayanam cha tajghyeya m yajjaravyadhi vinashanam \" is more apt for its description of the use of Rasayanas inJaravyadhi (progeria), Jara (aging) and Vyadhi(disease). CONCLUSION The very core of Ayurveda is formed from some very basic concepts e.g. panchabhautic theory, the prakriticoncept which is used to describe the predisposi - tion to and prognosis of disease as well as governs the choice of the therapy, balance and imbalance of the th reedosha(vata, pittaandkapha) in the development of disease. Interestingly, Ayurveda further expands on these theories to plan inter - ventions that would correct the imbalance. The actions of medicines are described through their various properties (lik erasa, guna, veerya, vipaka ,andprabhava ) based inherently on their elemental composition. It is the need of the hour to use modern technology to explore the relevance of these concepts, so that they may be inter - preted in light of contemporary scientific language to offer modern Kayachikitsa, Ahalia Ayurveda Medical College & Hospital, Palakkad, Kerala, India E-mail:drnagsvgm@rediffmail.com Source of support: Nil Conflict of interest: None Declared "}
