The document is a comprehensive guide for public purchasers and others interested in influencing the development of requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts in managed behavioral health care. Experts in both the su bstance abuse and mental health fields collaborated in its development. It is generally agreed that strong contracts between purchasers of health care services and managed care organizations (MCOs) form the foundation upon which managed behavioral health s ystems are built. Unfortunately, some public purchasers have left themselves and their clients vulnerable to poor quality services and restricted access due to poorly conceptualized and poorly written RFPs and contracts. This guide provides information tha t will help public purchasers develop RFPs and contracts for managed behavioral health care so as to achieve programmatic success. Although this guide is intended to assist public purchasers in their managed care contracting efforts it should not be used a s a substitute for expert legal or financial guidance. Any recommendations put forth here should be carefully considered by purchasers and adapted with appropriate guidance to meet the needs of the specific State or locality. This TAP is targeted most spec ifically to State and county substance abuse and mental health authorities, State Medicaid authorities, and other payers and purchasers of managed mental health and/or substance abuse services. CSAT hopes, however, that substance abuse and mental health tr eatment providers, MCOs, consumer groups, advocacy groups, academicians, and researchers will find the document an informative discussion of the essential elements of managed care contracting for substance abuse and mental health services. This document wa s developed by CSAT using national experts as an advisory panel. Once published, TAPs generally are not revised, and the development process ends. Traditional ways of developing and disseminating knowledge are changing, though, and CSAT recognizes that a d ocument on a topic as dynamic as managed care contracting must be very accessible and continually updated if it is to continue to be useful. Therefore, CSAT has made this TAP available on the Internet and plans to update the information contained within it on a regular basis. Internet accessibility will provide readers of this TAP with a mechanism for asking questions, contributing new material, and providing ongoing feedback on the guide. We hope that this document will serve as a model for developing and disseminating essential information in an online, interactive, and continually updated manner. CSAT invites you to use this guide to better understand how to develop RFPs and contracts for managed behavioral health care systems that live up to their promis e of providing state -of-the-art services to people with mental health and addictive disorders. We further invite you to use your knowledge and experience to contribute to its continual evolution so that it may better serve others. Nelba Chavez, Ph.D. Admin istrator Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Camille T. Barry, Ph.D., R.N. Acting Director Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Acknowledgments This document reflects the efforts of many contributors: national experts in the fields of substance abuse, mental health, Medicaid, child welfare, consumer advocacy, and the attorneys who represent these fields. The need for managed care contracting information in State and local agencies and the desire to make this document a state -of- the-art guide to contracting for managed care services for people with addictive and mental health disorders brought together individuals and organizations from diverse fields, with affiliations in Federal, State, county, and local governments and in both the p ublic and private sectors. Oversight, guidance, and support for this publication was provided by a Development Panel made up of experts in managed care contracting for substance, abuse, mental health, and medical services from across the country. Developm ent Panel members attended the initial concept meeting, developed outlines, drafted chapters, offered consultation, and provided comments throughout a long and challenging development process. They were very generous with their time, and their knowledge an d dedication helped ensure that this document would have a practical application to public managed care contracting. A special debt of gratitude is owed to Development Panel members Sara Rosenbaum, who provided substantive knowledge of the legal aspects of managed care contracting, contributed the bulk of the sample contract language, and reviewed the entire document for accuracy; Paul Litwak, who played a formative role throughout the project and contributed substantially to the chapters on developing a managed care initiative and management information systems; Rick Ramsey, who played an active leadership role throughout and contributed to many chapters; Robert Mirel and Steve Wood, who made invaluable contributions to the chapter on management information systems; Neal Cash, for sharing his first -hand experience with provider - sponsored networks; and Richard Dougherty, Haiden Huskamp, and Tony Broskowski, for sharing their expertise on financial issues. Important contributions were also made by the staff an d constituents of several national organizations and government agencies, including the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, the National Association of County Be havioral Health Directors, the American Public Welfare Association, and the Health Care Financing Administration. These stakeholders provided guidance early in the development process, making recommendations concerning what they sw s the most -needed inform ation as they confront the challenges associated with developing managed care contracts. More than 50 field reviewers representing the mental health, Medicaid, substance abuse, and managed care fields offered extensive feedback on the document and in many ways shaped its focus. The collective input form these individuals -was invaluable. Finally, thanks go to the dedicated staff of Health Systems Research, Inc., including Project Director Stephen Moss, William Ford, Kathy Jacquart, Dhlia Shaewitz, Cathy Cord er, and Daniel Kent; and to consultant editors Constance Gartner, Betsy Earp, Kerry Kemp, and Carolyn Davis.

Developing requests for propo sals (RFPs)(1) and then contracting for outside managed care services is a significant vehicle for introducing managed care into the public sector while responding to complex financial and political pressures. In most States, the State Medicaid agencies or other public purchasers have already begun contracting with managed care organizations (MCOs), and in many other States managed care initiatives are under way or are being con sidered. Uses and limitations of this guide This document is a practical guide for public purchasers and others involved in the design and development of managed care initiatives involving substance abuse and/or mental health services. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), the Center for Mental Health Services, and their parent agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), developed this publication to help State Medicaid agencies, State substance abuse and mental health authorities, and other p ublic purchasers translate rapidly evolving policy goals into effective RFPs and contracts that are the basis for sound managed care initiatives. To develop this document, CSAT, the Center for Mental Health Services, and SAMHSA sought guidance and directio n from an expert panel and field reviewers that included State Medicaid agencies, substance abuse and mental health authorities, managed care contracting experts, health care attorneys, providers, and consumers. Chapters II through VIII of this guide desc ribe several important issues pertaining to contracts for managed behavioral health care: Chapter II discusses the process of designing, procuring, and implementing a managed care system --from preliminary design, through development of an RFP, through the signing and subsequent monitoring of the contract. Chapter III considers the essential decisions concerning the services to be covered in a managed care plan, medical necessity, and the impact of funding streams on coverage. Chapter IV examines the estab lishment and maintenance of provider networks, including network design, selecting network providers, ensuring enrollees' access to services, subcontracting with network providers, establishing provider standards, and monitoring provider performance. Chapt er V concentrates on the key features of a management information system (MIS) that would be most effective in a managed care system, including data requirements and hardware and software needs. Chapter VI addresses issues pertaining to quality of care, in cluding measures of quality, accreditation standards, report cards, measures of consumer satisfaction, and internal and external quality management systems for MCOs. Chapter VII examines different aspects of financing in a managed care environment, includi ng such topics as risk -sharing arrangements, incentives and sanctions, third -party reimbursement, copayments and deductibles, cash flow management, reinvestment requirements, and financial reporting. Chapter VIII provides an examination of important consum er protection issues, including various consumer rights and the complaints, grievances, and appeals process. At the end of the document, there is a resource list with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of a variety of organizations involved in the fie lds related to managed behavioral health care. There is also a comprehensive glossary of terms. A. The Managed Care Trend In a single generation, we have witnessed a major transformation of the public and private health insurance system in the United Stat es. Twenty -five years ago, thousands of small and mid -sized public and private health care providers sold health services to individuals with commercial health insurance, charging what they believed was appropriate and rendering treatment in accordance wit h individual professional judgment. The insurance companies then paid the health care providers' bills (either fully or nearly completely) and did not question the providers' practice style. Medicaid and Medicare operated in a similar fashion. Today more t han three -quarters of commercially insured persons, more than 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, and almost 40 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries get their health coverage from managed care enterprises that combine the financing of health care services w ith their delivery. Managed care entities affiliate with networks of hospitals, community -based organizations, pharmacies, physicians, and/or other health care professionals and limit payment for covered services to services provided through those networks . The selection of providers for an MCO's network is primarily the responsibility of the MCO, although the purchaser of managed care services can influence these choices. For providers, membership in an MCO's network is dependent upon both an adherence to the MCO's practice requirements and the acceptance of financial risk and/or stringent payment controls. Managed Care and Managed Care Organizations Managed care , broadly defined, is a comprehensive approach to health care delivery that encompasses plannin g and coordination of care, monitoring of care quality, and cost control. Methods for managing care may include the development and implementation of criteria for level of care assignments and medical necessity determinations. Other methods for managing ca re may include use of standardized pretreatment assessment and treatment planning methods supported by practice pattern analysis and provider profiling, and outcomes management. Managed care encourages development of and referral to a complete continuum of care, and use of prior authorization and concurrent review for ongoing care management. Finally, managed care includes new systems of financing health care delivery, such as putting providers at risk for the cost of service delivery. (The above definition is derived from Freeman and Trabin [1994].) Managed care organizations are organized systems of health care that integrate the provision of paying for health services with the provision of health care services. Because MCOs operate in accordance with goo d business principles and expectations, their role is largely to control spending levels within clearly established financial parameters. MCOs typically develop and implement criteria to determine assignment of enrollees to the appropriate level of care ba sed on assessed medical and clinical need. MCOs include a wide variety of for -profit and nonprofit organizations, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), prepaid health plans (PHPs), and other health care systems that provide a full range of hea lth care services, organizations that specialize in the management of substance abuse and mental health services (usually called managed behavioral health care organizations, or MBHOs), government entities (e.g., counties), and organized networks of health care providers. A growing number of State, county, and local agencies are now developing or contracting with MCOs to manage substance abuse and/or mental health (i.e., behavioral health) services for their populations. Approximately 20 States have impl emented some form of managed behavioral health care for Medicaid recipients, serving approximately 5 million enrollees, and the number continues to climb. Many MCOs, which formerly focused only on private sector health care, are eager to enter this emergin g and lucrative market in the public sector. Many State, county, and local agencies have successfully reorganized their infrastructure to implement certain managed care principles and technologies. Yet numerous agencies have chosen to contract externally w ith MCOs to manage the delivery of some or all substance abuse and mental health services. In many cases, the movement toward the purchase of behavioral health care is part of a broad trend to transfer the management and delivery of Medicaid, Medicare, and other publicly funded services to MCOs. As State, county, and local agencies have come to realize the potential value of contracting with MCOs, many have developed specific goals for improving their systems through managed care. These goals often include the following: To improve coordination of and access to a full continuum of substance abuse and mental health treatment and prevention services; To improve the quality of services for populations that have substance use and/or mental health disorders; To allocate limited financial resources more efficiently and effectively; To improve the predictability of costs, thereby increasing the accuracy of budgets; To integrate the delivery of general medical and primary health care with behavioral health care; To expand coverage to a larger proportion of the population; and To increase accountability for and systematically improve consumer outcomes. Well-designed managed care systems can best achieve these goals when purchasers and MCOs clearly understand the needs of the population served, the unique requirements imposed by the fiscal and political environment, and the most effective managed care practices. To meet these conditions, purchasers must use the contract development process and the contract to maximize t heir control over the design, award, operations, and outcomes of the managed care system. B. Challenges for Managed Care Initiatives in the Public Sector There are several challenges faced by those attempting to build successful managed care initiatives i n the public sector: The populations served by Medicaid and other public sector service systems tend to be poorer and sicker than populations with commercial insurance, and MCOs may have little experience with these populations. Federal, State, and local substance abuse and mental health authorities have little experience with managed care practices and must operate under statutory and regulatory limitations not found in the private sector. Many State and local service delivery systems are fragmented, in part because different agencies handle different populations, and separate funding streams for designated populations have created different sets of structures and incentives. The populations served by public sector service systems pose unique challenges to the success of managed health care initiatives because public sector populations generally require a far broader range of services than individuals with commercial health insurance and also tend to make greater use of \"wraparound\" services, such as chi ld care, housing assistance, and vocational training. Many people served in the public sector are poor, elderly, undereducated or uneducated, and/or members of disadvantaged ethnic or linguistic minorities. Many of them seek services only when they are alr eady at a late stage of disability. Individuals depending on publicly funded treatment often have the most debilitating addictions and/or the most serious mental illnesses, as well as co -occurring medical complications. Furthermore, the public sector popul ation includes children with the most serious emotional disorders requiring a broad range of specialized services. MCOs seeking to contract with public sector agencies often have worked exclusively with commercially insured populations consisting primarily of employed adults and their families. The approaches and regimens developed by these MCOs may not fit the special behavioral health care needs of the public sector population. Meeting the ongoing rehabilitation and recovery needs of individuals with the most serious substance abuse and mental health disorders is expensive, and some services do not meet the sometimes restrictive \"medical necessity\" criteria imposed by MCOs (see medical necessity discussion in Chapter III). In addition, many MCOs may have l imited experience with the types of prevention services mandated for individuals served by public sector systems. Differences between traditional public service systems and private sector methods of operation pose another challenge to public sector manage d care initiatives. As Federal, State, and county substance abuse and mental health authorities move away from their former roles as administrators of grants and contracts into new roles as purchasers of managed systems of care, they must work within gover nmental limitations that are not found in the commercial sector. These include legislative and statutory restrictions, such as mandated services for special populations, restrictions on what types of providers can be utilized, set percentages of funding th at must be spent in certain areas (e.g., prevention services) or for specified populations (pregnant women), and underfunding. Another challenge to a successful managed behavioral health care system is the fragmentation of service delivery systems that cha racterizes many State and local systems and causes duplication of and gaps in the service continuum. This fragmentation is due in part to a lack of coordination between agencies and separate funding streams that are designated only for specific populations . This lack of integrated services has additional implications for cost and quality of care for individuals with the most severe illnesses, such as seriously and persistently mentally ill persons. Complicating matters further is the fact that many individu als in public substance abuse and mental health treatment are also served by other public agencies and systems, some of which, like the child welfare system, are setting up their own service management systems. C. The Critical Importance of a Good Contract Sound contracts are at the foundation of successful public sector managed care initiatives, which are likely to consume literally billions of dollars in public financing. A contract defines the expectations of the purchaser, the obligations of the MCO and its network of providers, and the rights of consumers. A contract embodies legally enforceable sets of promises that are crucial to accountability. Therefore, it is essential that the contract clearly state what duties are delegated to the MCO and what du ties remain with the public purchaser of managed care services. Public sector managed care contracts are collectively forming a critical component of the legal framework in which public services are delivered. To some degree, the contract and its associate d documents (such as RFPs) are the only existing legal framework (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Because a contract, by definition, constitutes a legally enforceable promise, virtually every issue addressed in it has legal implications in terms of whether the pr omise is worded in a way that can be enforced by a court of law. When a contract is poorly drafted, the financial consequences can be enormous, because under the principles of contract law, a contract will be interpreted by the courts against the drafter. In the case of public managed care procurements under Federal and State law, the public agency is the drafter. An unfavorable court ruling can leave the agency legally and financially exposed for services that it assumed were part of the contract but that in fact fall outside the scope of the agreement because of vague or erroneously drafted terms. The contract is the means by which compliance with applicable Federal and State mandates and regulations can be established. The Federal laws and regulations gov erning Medicaid, the Federal Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -7-\u00a7\u00a7300x -8), and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -21-\u00a7\u00a7300x -35), for e xample, specify requirements for coverage; if the responsibility for meeting these requirements is not specifically delegated to the MCO in the contract, that obligation remains with the purchaser and may result in unanticipated costs. In addition, contrac ts can address such issues as: the relationship between the contract and the RFP; the relationship between the contract and local, State, and Federal law; the MCO's subcontracts with providers; indemnification; the MCO's accountability and reporting respon sibilities; and conditions of contract termination in the event of nonperformance. These issues are discussed in later chapters of this document. A recent analysis of dozens of State Medicaid contracts covering prevention and treatment services for mental and addictive disorders showed that most had significant weaknesses that may leave the purchaser at financial risk and consumers at clinical risk (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). These weaknesses can be attributed to many factors. Strong contracts for managed car e are intricate and difficult to write. Purchasers must define a benefit package that meets the special needs of diverse populations and then clearly describe the package in specific contract language. In many cases, the purchaser must translate oftentimes arcane regulatory language into precise, legally binding contract provisions. In addition, under a managed care system, the purchaser must address numerous gray areas that are not covered by existing State regulations. Therefore, strong contracting expert ise, an understanding of Federal and State laws and regulations, and public input in the contracting process are crucial as purchasers develop contracts that provide effective services and minimize the purchaser's financial risk. D. Uses and Limitations of This Guide Contracting for Managed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: A Guide for Public Purchasers is intended to provide guidance from both policy and legal perspectives on developing RFPs and contracts between public purchasers and MCOs. This guide is designed to provide strategies for managed care contracting efforts but does not prescribe how these efforts should be developed. Although targeted primarily toward State and county substance abuse and mental health authorities, Medicaid agencies, and other public purchasers of managed care services, this document will prove useful to treatment providers, MCOs, academicians, researchers, consumers, and other stakeholders who will find that it addresses the most pertinent issues in managed behaviora l health care contracting. The reader of this document can gain the following: Familiarity with designing and procuring, and implementing managed care systems, including a review of options for consideration, problems that may be encountered, and key legal issues; Knowledge of RFP and contract issues related to sound clinical care, network development, quality assurance, management information systems, financing, and consumers' rights; and Understanding of the importance of developing a comprehensive set of well-conceptualized and well -written RFP and contract provisions to provide a strong structure for public sector managed care initiatives. Given the rapid evolution of managed care and the many variations with which States and localities are experimenting , no single approach to behavioral managed care contracting can be recommended for all public purchasers. This guide suggests a number of specific issues that purchasers may wish to consider when developing RFPs and controls for behavioral managed care ini tiatives. Purchasers are cautioned that this document is no substitute for expert legal and other analytic consultation in developing RFPs and contracts; and it does not eliminate the need for legal, actuarial, or other expert assistance (e.g., clinical ma tters, organizational public policy) in designing the RFP, conducting the procurement, or negotiating the contract. Purchasers are strongly urged by the project's Development Panel to secure the assistance of legal counsel and of actuarial, financial, and managed care experts throughout the design, procurement, and contract implementation processes. Managed behavioral health care contracting in the public sector is changing rapidly, and to be responsive to public sector purchasers as the field continues to change, Contracting for Managed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: A Guide for Public Purchasers is designed as a \"living\" document. Publishing the guide in a looseleaf modular format makes it possible to periodically update key content areas and contract language to reflect state -of- the-art expertise. In addition, readers will have access to an interactive, electronic version of this guide, located on CSAT's Web site (www.treatment.org) .(2) The electronic version will contain linkages to other Web sites that will allow readers to explore related contracting issues in more depth. Readers will also be able to review contracts developed by public purchasers, exchange info rmation in an online \"chat room,\" and submit comments and local examples of contract -related experiences, which may be included in later revisions of the document. 1. An RFP is a solicitation document issued to obtain offers from contractors that propose to provide products or services under a contract to be awarded using the process of negotiation. 2. Readers may find it helpful to note that specific examples of contract language used in States' Medicaid managed behavioral h ealth care contracts are avai lable through the SAMHSA Web site: www.SAMHSA.gov CHAPTER II Designing, Procuring, and Implementing a Managed Care System Key issues in this chapter: Designing a managed care system Procuring managed care services Implementing a managed care s ystem Although some States and localities permit any managed care organization (MCO) that can satisfy its conditions and is willing to provide care at the purchaser's stated price to participate in their managed care system, others acquire managed care services through a competitive procurement process. In a competitive procurement process, MCOs are selected on the basis of their technical qualifications and the price they charge for the service package. Legal principles dictate that competitive procurement s, which may involve tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business, be fair and open. As a result, competitive procurements create complex organizational and legal tasks for purchasers as they move toward acquiring behavioral managed care ser vices. MCOs treat competitive procurements as an extremely serious legal matter and do not hesitate to challenge a process they consider tainted. As discussed in this chapter, writing and negotiating a managed care contract is actually one of the later pha ses in a complex design and procurement process. In most circumstances, the final managed care contract is based on the results of several efforts: Preparation by the purchaser of a request for proposal (RFP) --that is, a solicitation document issued to obtain offers from contractors that propose to provide products or services under a contract to be awarded using the process of negotiation; The submission of proposals by bidders; Selection of the successful bidder; and Negotiations between the purchaser a nd the successful bidder that take place after the contract has been awarded but not yet signed. Public purchasers of managed care, and the environments within which they operate, vary tremendously, and these differences have a substantial influence on des ign, procurement, and implementation of a managed care system. The public purchaser itself --for example, the State Medicaid agency or State substance abuse or mental health authority -- may have highly variable purchasing power depending on the size, scope, and expenditure level of the program under which it operates. Differences in the local availability of clinical services and financial and staff resources may affect the procurement process. The political environment, population demographics, and geograph ic factors also affect the procurement process. Thus, each purchaser of managed care faces a unique set of challenges. This chapter uses an adaptation of the 10 -step model developed by the Federal Center for Mental Health Services to address issues at var ious stages in managed behavioral health care procurement process (Dougherty, 1996). It also identifies some of the types of legal challenges a purchaser may face when developing a managed care system. As illustrated in Exhibit II -1, the 10 steps in the mo del used to organize the discussion in this chapter can be grouped into three major stages: (1) designing a managed care system; (2) procuring managed care services (includes issuing an RFP, selecting a vendor, and awarding a contract); and (3) implementin g a managed care system (includes implementing the contract and subsequent monitoring and evaluation). Exhibit II -1. A 10-Step Process for Designing, Procuring, and Implementing a Managed Care System STAGE 1: Designing a Managed Care System Step #1: Assemble the development team Step #2: Develop the initial system design Step #3: Analyze historical costs and project future costs of the initial design Step #4: Determine optimal financing mechanisms, payment methods, and financial risk level Step #5: Build stakeholder consensus STAGE 2: Procuring Managed Care Services Step #6: Write the RFP Step #7: Establish fair and legally sound procurement and evaluation procedures Step #8: Select a vendor, negotiate issues of contention, and award the contract STAGE 3: Implementing a Managed Care System Step #9: Sign, implement, and administer the managed care contract Step #10: After procurement, monitor, audit, and evaluate performance under the managed care contract Understanding the tasks and challenges of each s tage is essential to designing a clinically sound and cost -effective managed care model, establishing a successful and legally defensible RFP and contract development process, and implementing an effective managed health care system. A purchaser can expect that political pressures from stakeholders will be brought to bear on the process. Some political pressures are likely to come from within the purchaser's agency and others from external government agencies or officials. There are also likely to be pressu res from consumers and their families, local health care providers, and MCOs. A purchaser should weigh the amount of influence each of these entities should have on the design of the managed care system, because politics can irreparably taint the entire ma naged care procurement process. If adequate safeguards are not taken, political pressures both from within the agency and from outside sources may affect selection of the vendor and allow legal challenges from unsuccessful bidders. Purchasers must carefull y monitor the managed care selection process to ensure that no State, Federal, or other procurement laws are violated. Stage 1: Designing a Managed Care System Key steps in this stage: Step #1: Assemble the development team Step #2: Develop the initial system design Step #3: Analyze historical costs and project future costs of the initial design Step #4: Determine optimal financing mechanisms, payment methods, and financial risk level Step #5: Build stakeholder consensus The first steps for a purchaser in developing a managed care system are assembling a competent development team and developing an initial system design that addresses coverage, service delivery, access, networks, quality assurance, measures of performance, and other key components of the final system. The next steps are analyzing historical costs and projecting future costs of the system design and determining optimal financing mechanisms, payment methods, and risk levels. Soliciting and incorporating stakeholder input, a nd moving toward consensus, are crucial parts of the design process from its outset to its conclusion. Step #1: Assemble the Development Team Assembling a competent development team at the outset of the design process is essential. Team members and other collaborators must collectively bring to the procurement process the appropriate training and expertise to design a managed care system that will best meet the needs of the populations to be served. Tasks for which the development team is responsible in clude analyzing financial data and projecting the new system's future costs, establishing financing and payment mechanisms, and proposing strategies for the use and management of risk. a. Qualifications of the Development Team Development team members sho uld be carefully selected on the basis of their individual skills and potential contributions. Key attributes include a detailed understanding of the needs of the enrollee population; writing, analytic, and financial abilities; a clear understanding of the opportunities, risks, and challenges inherent in developing a managed care system; an understanding of the needs of the stakeholder community; an understanding of the service delivery system; and the capacity to be absolutely discreet. The purchaser's dev elopment team should generally be small --some would say a core of six to eight members --but should be able to call on other individuals as needed. These other experts can be brought into the planning process when they can make an important contribution. To o large a core group will increase the risk of inappropriate disclosures that can taint the procurement process. The development team should also identify staff members from various agencies with interest or expertise in the services to be purchased. For example, when the purchaser is a State Medicaid agency, the team may immediately want to bring in staff from the State substance abuse and/or mental health agencies because of the relevance of their expertise in the delivery of these services and their fam iliarity with the organizational and political matters that may arise during the overall process. The team should be given sufficient time and resources to participate in the planning and implementation process. b. Qualifications of the Development Team Le ader The leader of the purchaser's development team should have a thorough understanding of the purchaser's needs and staff resources and be able to assemble and manage a very strong team. The team leader should be the senior executive of the purchasing en tity or another person designated by the purchaser. The team leader has tremendous responsibilities for the success of the procurement. He or she should have managed care experience or extensive training in issues concerning managed care, as well as suffic ient authority to shape and lead the development team in issues of importance to the purchaser. Ideally, the team leader either should have a background in procurement law or should appoint a legal advisor to the team at its inception. The stronger the tea m is in the area of procurement law, the more likely the purchaser will withstand a legal challenge to the procurement, a reality in any purchasing endeavor of this magnitude. c. Qualifications of Bid Evaluators Bid evaluators are also critical contributor s to the procurement process. The purchaser must rely on the evaluators to assess bidders in a fair and impartial manner and make recommendations to the selection team. The purchaser will need to know that the evaluators: Possess sufficient background and evaluation skills; Are free of conflicts of interest in relation to the bidders (and that they have fully disclosed any information regarding their contacts with bidders before and/or during the selection process); Are fair and impartial; Understand the s coring processes and tools used in the evaluation process; Are given sufficient time to adequately evaluate all the bids submitted. The purchaser should take into account all possible issues that could affect the purchaser's confidence in the bid evaluator panel's recommendations. (These issues are discussed further in Step #7 below.) d. The Use of Expert Consultants Expert consultants can significantly increase the chances of a successful process. The team should consider the use of expert consultants who are able to bring a wealth of expertise from other managed care efforts but do not pose a conflict of interest. The consultants should be chosen carefully, and their references and reputations regarding ethics, expertise, and judgment should be thoroughly reviewed. Using consultants does not in any way diminish the knowledge or talents of staff involved with the effort. e. Legal Precautions Purchasers who design a managed care system may have little or no direct legal expertise in procurement, but many factors in the procurement process put the purchaser at legal risk. Thus, legal experts are essential to the core team to scrutinize the plan's design and identify any possible legal ramifications of policy decisions. In a legally defensible design and procur ement process, information is shared fairly among all prospective bidders and the process contributes to the procurement of quality services at a fair price. Any failure on the part of the purchaser or purchaser's agents to be even -handed, or any act that raises questions of fairness, can result in a legal challenge. A legal challenge can be very expensive and troublesome for a purchaser even if it is ultimately unsuccessful. To avoid such a challenge, the purchaser should adopt strict standards regarding h ow team members, as well as evaluators, expert consultants, and others, may interact with other employees of the purchaser, potential bidders, and the general public. Any contact between the bidder and the purchaser's employees and evaluation team opens th e door for legal problems. The purchaser can avoid some problems by setting forth standards for these communications in the RFP and adhering to them strictly. Guidelines concerning communications with bidders should be developed for purchasing agency staff , also. All communications with bidders should be noted, and any information given to one bidder should be given to all. If the procurement is challenged, such documentation will provide support for the purchaser's argument that all bidders were treated eq ually and fairly. From the outset, the purchaser should clearly describe the ground rules to be followed by purchaser staff, consultants, and advisors during the procurement process, including situations to be avoided (e.g., paying or accepting payment for meals, gifts over a specified amount, tickets to events) and policies to guide communications with potential bidders and other interested groups. All team members, stakeholders, and consultants should understand and be held accountable for these policies. During the pre -RFP period, prospective bidders often send teams to work in the State and may spend considerable time and money acquainting themselves with all players and potential partners. Because of the large size of managed care contracts, the temptat ion for prospective bidders to do more than assess \"the lay of the land\" during this period is very strong. Contacts during this time by the purchaser's staff, consultants, or advisory committee members should be carefully monitored to avoid the appearance or reality of conflict of interest. The purchaser should obtain complete disclosure from all involved consultants and consultant groups regarding their ownership and any formal and informal relationships to MCOs. A consultant or consultant group that has direct interactions with an MCO should be disqualified. Similarly, a consultant or consultant group that has indirect interactions with an MCO --for example, provides services to a firm designing a management information system (MIS) for the MCO --should al so be disqualified. The development team's membership may change or team members may leave the agency during the design process, and the purchaser should take steps to protect the confidentiality of any relevant material and concepts. These protections may be in the form of confidentiality statements signed by employees or requirements in the RFP for bidders to disclose hiring or any use of a former employee of the purchaser. f. Use of a Final Design Team Although team members may change, at some point a fi nal group must be formed to make recommendations to the purchaser on the scope of services and benefits. Forming a final design team with limited membership may help the purchaser guard against conflicts of interest and protect the legitimacy of the procur ement process because communications will be limited to a select few. g. Stakeholder Involvement With the Team Representatives from relevant public agencies, stakeholder groups other than bidders, potential bidders, actual or potential subcontractors to bi dders, and consumers and their families should have the opportunity to provide input during the design phase and to develop a strong stake in the plan. The timing of stakeholder involvement will vary according to circumstances, but it should generally begi n very early so that stakeholders understand the rationale behind decisions and the opportunities and challenges of the evolving plan. Step #2: Develop the Initial System Design a. Clarifying Objectives An essential step in the initial design phase is an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and the identification of goals and objectives for the managed care initiative. These can be expected to vary according to local circumstances. The goals and objectives of managed care initiat ives often include, but are not limited to, the following: Containing or reducing costs for substance abuse and mental health services; Privatizing public services or redefining the role of government; Expanding coverage to new populations; Improving acces s to services; Achieving parity between physical and behavioral health benefits. Improving the allocation of resources; Shifting utilization patterns or level of care patterns; Integrating separate funding or service systems; Redressing historical underfun ding of public substance abuse and mental health services; Protecting special populations and funding dedicated to these populations; Correcting financial or managerial corruption; and Resolving conflicts between government jurisdictions regarding the prov ision of services, funding streams, populations served, or outcomes measured. Clarifying the objectives for redesigning or restructuring the existing system requires a systematic assessment of the purchaser's needs and capabilities and the identification o f problems and strengths in the current system. The team can then target opportunities for improvement, consider solutions, discuss potential barriers to success, establish measurable short -, intermediate -, and long -term goals, and select indicators to mea sure success. Because the design of the new system will have far -reaching ramifications, planners should ensure that this phase of the process is not hurried or skewed by political demands. It is equally important that this phase include stakeholders, such as representatives of other key agencies, providers, and consumers and their families. b. Using Requests for Information (RFIs) To Enhance Design Purchasers are increasingly using RFIs to solicit input from all interested individuals on the design of the managed care plan --from consumers to providers to other agency heads to MCO bidders. Developing and disseminating an RFI can be a very useful strategy for purchasers in the early stages of the design process. Stakeholders tend to take a great interest in RFIs and often provide a substantial amount of useful input. Responses to the RFI may offer detailed suggestions about system design and can also help the purchaser anticipate unforeseen problems and opportunities. However, purchasers should consider advic e from bidders cautiously and take great care to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety or conflict of interest. (The use of RFIs is discussed further in the section on the \"Bidder Qualification Process\" in Step #6 below.) How a purchaser uses the in formation supplied by outside entities has the potential to lead to a legal challenge of the purchaser's procurement. Designing a managed care system to incorporate or address issues that have been supplied by bidders in responding to an RFI may lead to a dangerous legal pitfall. Should the purchaser make changes in the managed care plan that appear to favor one particular bidder, legal challengers may argue that certain bidders had an unfair advantage. Thus, if an RFI is used, it must be structured to allo w the purchaser to receive comments from all interested parties but to reserve final judgment about the comments received until all responses are in --with an eye toward avoiding the appearance of favoritism. Although an RFI can provide the purchaser with v aluable information, the RFI process adds additional time to the design effort. The purchaser should build the timeframe for the RFI into the procurement timetable and cost estimations. Failure to allow for delays that may be caused by this process and att empting to get a managed care system up and running in a shorter timeframe increases the possibility that mistakes will be made. Such shortcuts often set the stage for legal problems. Step #3: Analyze Historical Costs and Project Future Costs of the Initia l Design Analyzing historical costs to accurately project future costs is a crucial task for the development team, because potential bidders will rely heavily on these projections in developing their bids. Accurate data are necessary for bidders to develo p well -informed pricing proposals --unless the purchaser is setting the rates without asking for bids (see below, Step #4). Analyzing historical costs may be difficult because of insufficient data; in traditional systems, individuals are often not tagged by a unique identifier and thus their costs in different systems cannot be determined. The expertise of actuaries or others experienced in analyzing variance levels is necessary to determine whether historical unit cost data can be relied upon for estimating future rates. These analyses generally involve compiling claims data or other reimbursement data from a representative time period. For programs funded with non -Medicaid funds --for example, with Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grants, Subst ance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grants, or discretionary State funds(1) -- historical cost data will generally not be available in the same claim -based format as the Medicaid data. To the extent possible, data for programs with non -Medicaid funding should be summarized in a format similar to that of Medicaid data to make it easier to collate. The summaries should be done by staff who can understand the informat ion fields used in other insurance claims, State reports, or utilization reports. An ongoing effort to gather information in the data collection and analysis phase is needed to assure the development team that the problems identified have been properly und erstood and that the goal of the initiative is properly targeted. All data related to cost analysis and projections should be checked by several individuals in the field for accuracy and completeness before release. Assistance from actuaries, health econom ists, or highly trained claims data staff is essential. If the data are inaccurate or if some component is missing, the payment rates will likely be inadequate and could provide the basis for later lawsuits. Financing and risk in managed care contracting are discussed at length in Chapter VII. One of the points made in that chapter is that there is a continuum of risk -transfer financing models for managed care contracts. The different risk - transfer financing models --including a global budget, capitation pa yment arrangements, case -rate payments, and fee - for-service payment --apportion the major types of financial risk between the purchaser of managed care and an MCO in very different ways. Various approaches to establishing capitation payment rates are discu ssed in Chapter VII. RFPs that call for managed care entities submitting bids to propose a capitation rate generally require claims data that include the number of recipients for each service type by any applicable eligibility category (e.g., families form erly covered by Aid to Families With Dependent Children or Supplemental Security Income recipients); costs; units of services; and any other relevant pricing factors. Determining the number and types of eligible recipients is essential to the establishment of a capitation rate. In non -Medicaid initiatives, where accurate numbers of eligible residents may be difficult to obtain, the number of individuals who are eligible for services can be estimated from census data or from data from epidemiological studies . The purchaser's development team must understand clearly which covered benefits and services will be included in the contract and which will remain the direct financial and coverage obligation of the purchaser. A Medicaid managed care contract, for exam ple, may cover short -term hospitalization for children with mental illness but not long -term stays; in this situation, some portion of a seriously ill child's hospitalization would remain the direct obligation of the State, because under Medicaid law the c hild is entitled to medically necessary hospitalization regardless of the fact that the managed care contract covers only a portion of the necessary care. Thus, the State Medicaid agency should retain sufficient funding to pay for these services that are r equired by law but that are not included in the managed care contract. The development team also must know the cost per unit of service that is included in the contract. Publicly funded systems have historically paid an all -inclusive rate to many classes o f providers. Few data exist about the costs of subcomponents of \"bundled\" services, which has led to wide cost variations among providers, even when claims data are available. The problem of the bundled rate may make development of reliable rates for manag ed care impossible until the service can be unbundled and data collected on the cost and utilization of the service subcomponents. Purchasers should consult with actuaries or other financial experts about whether available historical cost data are reliable measures of the cost of future capitation arrangements. To identify trends in utilization and enrollment reflecting changes in the economy, eligibility levels, and services, it is best to use 3 or more years of data. The more precise the count of covered individuals, the more accurate the cost estimates will be and the more on target the final payment rate is likely to be. The purchaser should call upon actuaries to ensure the purchaser that the rates to be paid to the MCO are sufficient to support the de sired level of utilization in the managed care system and the associated costs. When a large proportion of the data needed to establish payment rates is not current, are inaccurate, or otherwise perceived to be weak, one option is for the State or county t o share some of the financial risk with the MCO (see Chapter VII). Another option is to consider methods of financing (e.g., interim payments with cost settlement) other than risk - transfer payment until adequate baseline data can be developed. Actuarial a nalyses of historical data must also take into account anticipated savings from implementation of the managed care plan, including reductions in the cost of certain services (e.g., medical/surgical costs) by increasing the availability of another service ( e.g., substance abuse prevention or treatment). Oregon officials, for instance, calculated the anticipated savings in medical services that would result from an increase in the availability of substance abuse services, and then used this information to aff ect actuarial results and significantly improve the priority of substance abuse services in that State's health care reform initiative. The Inclusion of Service Utilization Data in an RFP When possible, the purchaser's development team should determine whe ther there is relevant quantitative information on the utilization of the current health services delivery system and should include this information in the RFP for managed care services. Quantitative information on the utilization of services should inclu de a full set of descriptive statistics if possible, including the minimum value, the maximum value, the values for each percentile (e.g., the value for the 10th percentile; the 90th percentile), the standard deviation of the set of values, and the number of values the data set comprises. Averages can be deceptive if the distribution of values is highly skewed (as is often the case in health care). The average number of outpatient visits across all users may be six --but that number could result from a combi nation of a large number of early treatment dropouts and an equally large number of clients with high rates of service utilization. The resulting mean would be misleading. Units of service per unit of time is also a useful statistic --12 visits provided int ermittently over 26 to 52 weeks (episodic drop -in behavior) are not the same as 12 visits provided in a focused way over 8 to 12 weeks (e.g., intensive outpatient care). Purchasers should be aware that transferring historical cost data directly into fut ure capitation rates without adjusting for these cost savings can result in overallocation of resources for managed care services, and high profit margins for MCOs. If key data are missing, or if it is necessary to make too many assumptions to cover missin g data fields, then planners should consider adjusting the timeframes of the initiative until adequate information can be developed, collected, and analyzed. One option sometimes used by States and counties in this situation is initially to establish a con tract with an MCO or other organization to provide specified administrative services only (ASO) in a contracting arrangement that passes no financial risk for the cost of health services to the organization providing administrative services (see Chapter VI I). Such an arrangement can help institute needed management reforms and permit collection of baseline data for a year or more before some or all system funds are put into a risk -bearing arrangement. In order to develop a reasonable cost proposal, bidders may find information on the following useful: Incidence and prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders; Utilization rates by service type; Acute inpatient readmission rates; Length of stay per admission per level of care; Outpatient sessions p er defined treatment episode; Analysis of utilization patterns, including high users of services and their associated costs; Descriptions of the demographic, diagnostic, and utilization characteristics of high users; Analysis and identification of gaps in the treatment continuum, including input from consumers and advocates; Description of known needs and demands for services; Designation of clinical and financial responsibility for pharmacy, laboratory, and emergency room costs; and Identification of servi ce costs that have been supplemented by the following: - Foundation and other philanthropic sources; - Federal, State (e.g., Department of Corrections), and local funds and whether or not these arrangements will apply to the MCO; - Interagency agreements; and - Identification of barriers to current treatment or planned treatment services (waiting lists, pharmacy integration, exclusionary diagnoses). Step #4: Determine Optimal Financing Mechanisms, Payment Methods, and Financial Risk Level The managed care p urchaser's selection of financing and payment methods should be decided based on the goals and objectives of the managed care program. A purchaser whose main priority is to increase accountability, enhance quality, and/or improve efficiency, for instance, might establish a flat payment fee and then challenge bidders to compete based on access and quality of care issues. A purchaser whose main priority is to maximize cost savings and strictly control its financial risk, on the other hand, may want to use fin ancially competitive processes and risk - transfer payment systems. When a quality competition is used alone, (i.e., prices are set and bidders compete on the basis of quality of care), the purchaser must be exceedingly clear about the standards it uses to differentiate one bidder from another because price effectively has been removed as a competitive factor. When the competition includes both price and quality, the purchaser may want to establish clear internal evaluation safeguards so that the award does not automatically go to the lowest bidder. Even in States in which procurement law requires the award of a contract to the lowest bidder, such a law applies only to the lowest qualified bidder. This legal caveat permits the buyer to use measures of quality to select its bidder, even when price may be a driving issue. A purchaser using price competition should know from its actuaries what the lowest reasonable price is and should design a bid evaluation system that makes price only one of several components. When price competition is used, purchasers must recognize that in some systems or for some populations, the chances of obtaining significant savings may be very slim owing to prior cost reductions, the inherent cost of treatment for the target population, or other factors such as extremely low budgets for services. One of the most substantial challenges for the purchaser's development team is to balance the purchaser's objectives and strategic alternatives with financial incentives that best fit the situa tion. One method that States have used to solicit price reductions has been to award their default enrollment population (i.e., individuals who are required to select a plan but fail to do so after being given the opportunity to make an informed choice) to the lowest bidder. Other States have used arrangements that have involved the separate bidding of the State's default business. Step #5: Build Stakeholder Consensus One of the first tasks of the development team is to create and implement a strategy that solicits the input of stakeholders early in the managed care system design process to build a sense of collaboration and partnership and identify troublesome issues. Any managed care initiative undertaken in the public sector will have a substantial clinic al, financial, and political impact on a wide variety of individuals and organizations including the following: The public purchaser (e.g., a State Medicaid agency; a State, county, or local substance abuse or mental health authority; an American Indian o r Alaskan Native tribe or tribal organization); Managed care entities (e.g., managed behavioral health care organizations, HMOs, counties, provider - sponsored organizations); Health care providers (e.g., treatment agencies, individual providers, State and c ounty direct service employees, hospitals, nursing homes); Consumers and their families (e.g., individuals, families, guardians); Consumer advocates; Government agencies (e.g., legislative committees, child welfare and special education, social services, corrections, housing agencies, State vocational rehabilitation agencies, State and county substance abuse and mental health agencies); and Regulators and policymakers. If stakeholders such as these are to be involved in basic design decisions, the purchaser must take steps to guard against conflicts of interest, as noted above. MCOs may face serious antitrust consequences if they organize to provide a collective response to a State's request for comments. Involving health providers in the design of the manag ed care system may raise some of the same conflict -of-interest and antitrust issues that arise with MCOs. The purchaser's development team may want to create an advisory group consisting of representatives of various stakeholder groups who have the ongoing opportunity to make suggestions, voice concerns, and/or participate in the process of decisionmaking. Some modest financial support may be necessary to involve certain low -income stakeholders. It may also be advisable to meet with some stakeholders separa tely to discuss issues of concern to them, such as design elements related to children in foster care. When assembling an advisory group, conflicts of interest are natural and inevitable and are best discussed openly and directly. Consumers and family memb ers or guardians can offer an especially valuable perspective during the early design and planning phase of the managed care initiative. Many consumers and their families have become very resourceful in obtaining information and services on their own becau se they have all too often encountered a lack of resources, fragmented systems, and providers who are ill informed about their needs. As a result, some consumers and family members may be more knowledgeable about treatments, services, and system problems t han are purchasers, providers, MCOs, or other stakeholders. (A more detailed examination of the optimal roles of consumers is presented in Chapter VIII.) In some cases, achieving consensus from a wide variety of stakeholders about the underlying principles and operations that will guide the managed care initiative is very difficult or impossible. Conducting public meetings or hearings and providing the larger community with an opportunity to comment on drafts of documents is one way to help build consensus. A balance must be struck, however, between ensuring the opportunity for sufficient input and creating unnecessary burdens for the development team. Soliciting input from potential competitors and their subcontractors is particularly challenging since the manner in which this occurs can affect the legality of the entire procurement. Regardless of the methods used to build consensus, purchasers should be cautioned that the failure to solicit early input from key stakeholders in a meaningful way can create ve ry serious problems throughout the design, procurement, and implementation phases. In some cases, lack of consensus has derailed otherwise well -designed programs. Special Issues Encountered in the Design Stage The primary tasks of the design stage have bee n outlined above. In the discussion that follows, issues pertaining to decisions about major aspects of the managed care system design phase are highlighted: Decisions about eligibility criteria; Decisions about enrollment strategies; Decisions about di senrollment protections; Decisions about what services to cover in the benefits package; and Decisions about joint purchasing of services (i.e., whether to purchase substance abuse services and mental health services separately or jointly) and decisions about the degree to which managed behavioral health care is to be integrated with general health care (i.e., whether it is to be \"carved in\" with general health care or \"carved out\"). Given the current trend toward more integrated systems, it may be advan tageous to develop models of managed care systems that will facilitate greater coordination of Medicaid and other funding streams (see discussion of funding streams in Chapter VII). One challenge would be to determine the range of services and level of acc ess that the purchaser would like to provide and then to identify the funding streams that can be accessed when creating that package. Combining funding streams for managed care initiatives is a very challenging task. The Medicaid program, for example, is subject to numerous statutory requirements that do not disappear simply because a State Medicaid agency decides to use a private contractor to perform some of its functions. In trying to pool funds from two or more sources, consideration should be given t o the fact that eligibility rules, enrollment practices, and services covered vary tremendously across different government -funded programs. Also, the statutory and regulatory provisions vary across government programs and are very different from each othe r and from the provisions governing Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grants (for further discussion, see Chapter III). a. Decisions About Eligibility Criteria The criteria that will be used t o determine who is eligible for managed care services may be based on a host of clinical, financial, and political considerations that vary in different States, counties, and localities. The development of a managed care system can be an opportunity to est ablish more uniform policies on eligibility for services to special populations that require access to multiple government -funded programs. The attempt to streamline processes and coordinate care within Medicaid could include a consolidation of access requ irements under the direction of a case manager. Targeted case management is a mandatory Medicaid benefit for Medicaid -eligible children and an optional benefit for adults. At the very least, designers will want to ensure the development of policies that pr omote efficient referral between the managed behavioral health program and other government -funded service delivery systems. Some factors upon which eligibility can be based include the following: Insurance status; Diagnosis (i.e., level of functional imp airment); Severity of illness; Risk factors; Income and/or asset level; Age; Geographic variables; Specific clinical subtypes; Disability status; and Involvement in specified systems or groups (e.g., criminal justice system, child welfare system). Once the eligibility criteria have been established, it will be possible to develop a thoroughly researched estimate of the number of likely subgroups, the number of eligible individuals in each, and their probable geographic distribution. If the estimated number of eligible persons or their distribution is unacceptable because of cost or other considerations, the purchaser may decide to adjust the eligibility criteria. The final eligibility criteria and estimate of the size of the eligible population will enable potential bidders to submit informed proposals. Great care should be taken to ensure that eligibility data are as accurate and complete as possible. In some situations, certain eligibility groups may have access to services not available to other groups, f or example, when another entity is sharing the cost of designated services (e.g., educational training, social skills training). That may be the case particularly when the same contract is used to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries and persons whose enrollment is sponsored by other programs (e.g., the CMHS Block Grant), because Medicaid beneficiaries may be entitled to a far broader array of services. Managed Care Initiatives Involving Children's Services Decisions about the purchase of child, adolescent, and fa mily services are often complicated due to the complex needs of these consumers, and the frequent use of multiple funding streams. In managed care initiatives that involve children's services, the regulation of MCOs is sometimes shared by a collaborative p urchasing coalition made up of the government agencies and foundations that financially supported the system of care before managed care was implemented. Thus, for instance, the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health has advised purchasers to establish interagency agreements that detail protocols for sharing responsibilities and costs related to care coordination for children and families who require access to multiple systems at the same time. Since 1992, the Federal Substance Abuse and Menta l Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Child, Adolescent, and Family Branch of its Center for Mental Health Services have supported the development of community -based systems of care for children with emotional disturbances and their families. I n addition, SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) has funded several community action grants that are intended to foster collaboration and cooperation across State and county agencies to prevent the onset of substance abuse among adolescent s and their families. These and related efforts have supported strong coordination and integration of child and family services in locally based comprehensive systems of care. Such services include health care services; services for mental, emotional, and substance use disorders; child welfare services; schools and other educational services; and juvenile justice services. To assist the MCO, governmental agencies, and the provider network gain access to diverse and unencumbered funds that can be used to ma nage a coordinated system of care for children and their families, the purchaser of managed behavioral health care services may want to consider using an entity skilled in identifying such funds. b. Decisions About Enrollment Strategies The development t eam must decide whether enrollment in managed care can be required, allowed, or prohibited for particular subgroups. Because of the clear financial consequences of providing services to someone no longer eligible for services, it also is important to speci fy how promptly the MCO can disenroll members. Eligible individuals can join a managed care plan in person, over the telephone, by mail, or by the recommendation of a designated enrollment counselor. Typically, they enroll in a managed care plan in one of two ways. The first is to enroll in a specific plan and complete the enrollment process within the timeframe established by the State (e.g., 45 days from a designated date). The second, for individuals who enroll late or do not make an enrollment selection , is to be randomly assigned to a plan (autoenrolled) with no personal input into the enrollment decision. People suffering from severe mental and/or addictive disorders may have substantially greater difficulties than healthier people in meeting a short deadline and therefore are likely to be overrepresented in autoenrolled groups. If these individuals are helped by guardians or caseworkers, they may not have as much difficulty in meeting the deadline. Dissemination of information about enrollment is cri tical, and active outreach efforts to enroll eligible individuals should be planned. Outreach may be most needed with populations that are legally vulnerable, such as illicit drug users and drug -addicted women with children. Default enrollment may increas e the chances that individuals actively receiving services for mental or addictive disorders will be forced to terminate treatment because their usual provider(s) is not a member of the assigned plan. Such disruptions in the treatment process can lead to s ignificant therapeutic losses and confusion, increased difficulties in treatment compliance, and uncertain transitions to new and unfamiliar providers. Purchasers can avoid this problem by adding contract provisions for out -of-plan referral benefits or fo r highly specific, time-limited transfer activities. In such instances, purchasers may want to develop detailed transition policies for those in treatment, during enrollment or disenrollment, transfers, or at re -enrollment. For example, the MCO could be required to authorize out -of-network payments for a designated period of time for individuals who must continue care while making the transition to new service providers. Purchasers can ameliorate the impact of involuntary default assignments by assigning ce rtain providers or outreach workers to search for individuals who have not made selections, ensuring that every reasonable effort is made to contact them and help them select an appropriate provider. The child welfare system operates on a no -reject, no -eject policy. Purchasers of child welfare managed care services must be sensitive to the potential impact of the autoenrollment requirement inherent in the statutory mandate to serve and protect all children deemed abused and/or neglected. However, once a ch ild is enrolled in a plan, it is permissible to offer the child different benefits or services intended to protect and facilitate permanency for the child and family in a timely manner. Another enrollment issue arises when purchasers contract for behaviora l health services with more than one plan, providing enrollees with several options for substance abuse and mental health services. When many MCOs compete for enrollees, there may be incentives for adverse selection, meaning that plans may compete for the healthiest people and try to avoid enrolling people with the most expensive treatment needs. This practice is referred to as \"cherry picking.\" It is relatively easy for an MCO to cherry pick among persons with mental and addictive disorders --for example, t he MCO could adapt policies to decrease the number of individuals with high rates of mental health care utilization based on the knowledge that the use of mental health services in a year is highly predictive of high levels of physical health service use i n that year and of high mental health service use in the next year. Thus, purchasers who develop contracts with several MCOs that will compete for a finite pool of enrollees should create strong protections against cherry picking. Purchasers must also take into account changes in public policy that affect eligibility and enrollment procedures, such as the new Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility criteria for children, as contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. Depending on the circumstances, purchasers may want to consider using health benefits managers or enrollment brokers who implement and manage the enrollment function. Examples of the use of health benefits managers are found in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, M aryland, and Nebraska. If a health benefits manager is used, the prime contract between the purchaser and the MCO should clarify who pays for this service, how disagreements between the MCO and health benefits manager are resolved, health benefits manager responsibilities and restrictions, the MCO's responsibilities for providing the health benefits manager with information, and the processes by which the MCO and the health benefits manager are to communicate (Horvath and Kaye, 1995). A health benefits mana ger can reduce cherry picking or other hazards of aggressive MCO marketing and reduce the use of default assignment by actively seeking out eligible individuals and assisting them in making the best choice based on their circumstances. Enrollment practices should be closely monitored. If significant enrollment problems occur, such as those described above, enrollment may need to be suspended. A suspension option should therefore be incorporated into the contract. Since such a suspension has serious financia l consequences for the MCO and service consequences for individuals, this option should be used only if there appears to be no other recourse. In sum, several issues are inherent in any voluntary enrollment situation. To prevent an MCO from cherry picking, some type of independent entity is often needed to ensure a degree of control over who is, or is not, determined eligible. Care must also be taken when transitioning individuals already in treatment into the MCO provider network. This may require authoriz ation of services with the enrollee's current provider and/or establishment of timelines for transition planning. These strategies can be very important for vulnerable populations to ensure that an individual's condition does not deteriorate because medica tions or other key services are not accessible during the transition to a new system. c. Decisions About Disenrollment Protections Individuals with substance use and mental health disorders need contractual protections from disenrollment because they ofte n receive services through managed care systems that are permitted to disenroll them for noncompliance. Some MCOs have used various operational definitions of noncompliance to contain costs, such as failing to follow instructions, being generally uncoopera tive, or failing to regularly keep appointments. The nature of substance use and mental health disorders makes it likely that some individuals who have these disorders will not comply with either general health or behavioral health service requirements. M any consumers with behavioral health problems are noncompliant with treatment due to symptoms of their illnesses or side effects of their medications. Court -ordered clients and other involuntary recipients of care may also be vulnerable to charges of nonco mpliance. The incentive to disenroll people with substance use and mental health disorders for cause is great, because these individuals tend to have very high health care utilization rates. Individuals with alcoholism use health care services at two to f our times the rate of the general population, and family members of individuals with alcoholism use health care services at a rate two to three times that of the general population. The purchaser of a managed care system can discourage the clinically unso und practices of disenrolling people with mental and substance use disorders for noncompliance. One way is to require that the MCO obtain the purchaser's approval before disenrollment for cause can occur (this approach was used in Oregon for substance use treatment enrollees). Another way is to offer specialized enrollment procedures for different categories of individuals (such as those currently hospitalized or non -English -speaking individuals), provide opportunities for families to enroll in a plan as a family unit and be eligible for a package of benefits and coordinated case management services, or develop effective stop loss policies or risk corridors (see chapter VII) that place limits on the amount of losses that can occur. The purchasers may wish to contractually prohibit some or all \"cause -based\" disenrollments initiated by the MCO. The capacity to offer portability of coverage to enrollees is a critical decision for public purchasers if they wish to minimize disruption in services when enrollees m ove. Decisions about portability may influence design considerations that affect location of services, such as the choice between statewide and regional networks. (Chapter VIII provides a more detailed examination of disenrollment and contract development options.) d. Decisions About Covered Services In addition to determining who is eligible for the program, the development team must articulate clinical and other services to be included in the benefits package. Before this can be done, the purchaser must a ssess the adequacy of available funding. Furthermore, because managed care adds an extra layer of administrative costs compared with an unmanaged system, there is less funding available for clinical services. Thus the purchaser must analyze the eligible population, expected use patterns, and the costs of supporting those patterns and begin to make fundamental decisions about what types of services to offer and how access to those services will be managed. This step requires the development of precise servi ce definitions, which may never have been done before, and the inclusion of these definitions in the RFP and the contract. The package generally describes the following aspects of coverage (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): The categories and types of covered and excluded services, providers, and populations, including a description of coordination issues between covered and excluded services; Permissible limits on the amount, duration, and scope of services; Benefit and service definitions; and Definitions and sta ndards for determining medical, clinical, and psychosocial necessity and other means of determining eligibility for a unit of service. The benefit package is the heart of the system. In the case of Medicaid, States remain financially liable for services that are included in the State plan but are not covered in the contract. If services are not described well, MCOs can make excessive profits because they are contractually liable for fewer services than the premium assumes. Poorly described services can also result in unanticipated costs for the State (see discussion in Chapter III). The types and extent of covered services may vary considerably between plans due to differences in existing service structures, regulatory guidelines for units of service (e.g., Title IV -E dollars in the children's system may be used to pay for board and maintenance only), budget considerations, and available funding streams in a given State or county. Requirements attached to funding streams can have a profound impact on the serv ices that can be purchased. See Chapter III for a more detailed explanation of issues pertaining to covered services. e. Separate vs. Joint Purchasing of Services and \"Carve -In\" (2) vs. \"Carve -Out\" Models Embedded in decisions about which services to include and the criteria for determining eligibility are four options that may have some of the greatest long -term ramifications for the evolving system: Whether the purchaser opts to buy mental health services only, substance abuse services only (treatment and/or prevention), or both; Whether to blend behavioral health services with physical health services in a carve -in (integrated health care) purchase, separate these services fr om general health care and build a \"carve -out\" system, or build a carve -out system with planned and effective coordination between medical and behavioral health; Whether to blend behavioral health services with services from other systems of care in a comp rehensive delivery package (e.g., for children and their families); and Whether or not to carve in, carve out, and/or phase in coverage for specified subgroups (e.g., children and/or families, adults with severe mental illness, all SSI recipients). Empiric al data may drive decisions about those options to some extent, but the four decisions are often largely based on the fundamental beliefs and system philosophies of the development team and other decisionmakers about how health care systems are optimally o rganized. While an in -depth discussion of these design decisions is beyond the scope of this document, some of the key points for consideration are identified below. Joint or Separate Purchase of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services. A far-reaching design decision is whether to combine the purchase of substance abuse and mental health services in the RFP under the umbrella of behavioral health or whether these two specialty services will be purchased separately. Jointly purchased substance abuse and mental health services can be managed very closely as one program or alternatively, managed as distinct and separate programs. Many factors can drive the decision to separate, combine, or coordinate the service packages of these disciplines, including the existing organizational structure of government, the relative cost of each benefit, political and personal relationships between officials and departments, conceptual viewpoints of leading decisionmakers, the readiness of either system to be effectively ma naged, and the perspective and strength of advocacy groups (Moss, 1995). The relationship between the substance abuse and mental health fields is complex. Professionals in both fields often have deeply held sentiments and philosophies about the most appro priate way to structure the functional relationship between the systems. Views can differ substantially with respect to the most appropriate governmental organization structures, treatment philosophies, and optimal business relationships with each other in a managed care marketplace. These views can play a large role in all levels of decisionmaking. There are also substantial differences between the two fields in the areas of health care conditions addressed, the emphasis on treatment and prevention service s, and the provider systems used. A significant factor encouraging greater coordination of services is the large number of persons with co - occurring mental and substance use disorders found in both treatment systems, but especially the mental health syste m. Results of such studies as the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study of the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Comorbidity Survey suggest that there are approximately 10 million Americans with co -occurring substance use and mental disorde rs (Regier et al., 1990). Possible advantages and disadvantages of purchasing substance abuse and mental health services together are listed in Exhibit II -2. Exhibit II -2. Joint Purchase of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment Services: Potential Advantages and Disadvantages Potential Advantages Potential Disadvantages Increased efficiencies in management, administration, financing, and other operations; Increased use of common information system infrastructures and data elements; Fewer incenti ves for cost -shifting in treating those with co -occurring mental and addictive disorders; Stronger and more collaborative political influence for both systems; Greater compatibility with existing structures of managed behavioral health care organizations; Greater capacity to meet the needs of individuals with a dual diagnosis of a mental disorder and a substance use disorder. Loss of the distinct identity, treatment philosophies, and/or practices of the smaller substance abuse treatment system within the la rger mental health system; Lack of substance abuse treatment experience/expertise among senior leaders of the combined departments and lack of mental health expertise and training among substance abuse caregivers and counselors; Greater likelihood that t hose with substance use disorders will be treated by those trained in mental health but not substance abuse; Lack of experience, understanding, or focus on substance abuse prevention services; Increased barriers in providing a larger, more diversified bene fit package of alcohol and other drug services; Decreased emphasis on specialized treatment for addiction disorders; Loss of distinct cost data for both substance abuse and mental health services. Carve -In and Carve -Out Models. Purchasers must make decis ions regarding the degree to which managed substance abuse and mental health services are to be integrated with general health care. Most often, managed behavioral health care is carved out from general health care and managed care separately. This usually occurs in one of two ways: (1) a purchaser contracts directly with a managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) to manage the substance abuse and mental health services; or (2) full service MCOs subcontract these services to MBHOs. Officials in New Me xico, for example, wished to foster integration between behavioral and general health care services but feared that behavioral health dollars might be siphoned away to fund general health care. Consequently, they developed a modified carve -in model that re quires HMOs to contract with an independent MBHO for the management of behavioral health services but establishes mechanisms to create an impenetrable barrier between general health and behavioral health dollars. The decision about whether to develop a car ve-out model or a more integrated carve -in model is affected by several factors that vary substantially from purchaser to purchaser. These include the general makeup of the existing health care system, the market penetration of managed care, the availabili ty of HMOs or full -service MCOs in the local health care environment, the ability of these organizations to meet appropriately the behavioral health needs of the eligible population, cost considerations, and the opinions and perspectives of key decisionmak ers. It should be noted, however, that a recent survey of 11 large full -service HMOs showed that all but two provided substance abuse and mental health services by purchasing services from wholly -owned behavioral health subsidiaries or independent vendors (Rudd, 1997). Even the two HMOs that provided some services inhouse used outside contracted vendors for Medicaid enrollees. Designers should carefully consider the type and degree of integration desired if carve -in models are being considered, since often the HMO will carve out behavioral health services. Ensuring that behavioral health services are effectively linked with primary health care remains a substantial challenge in designing managed care systems. Regardless of whether they choose a carve -in or carve -out model, purchasers must develop parameters in the contract that specify any primary care linkages, including performance standards that monitor the degree to which expectations are met. Purchasers opting to buy substance abuse and mental health se rvices using an integrated carve -in model should closely monitor both substance abuse and mental health benefits to ensure that the utilization of these services is comparable to the utilization of physical health benefits provided in the package. Purchase rs of substance abuse and mental health carve -outs should devote substantial resources to ensuring that there is an adequate link to primary health care services. The potential advantages and disadvantages of the carve -in model for substance abuse and men tal health benefits are shown in Exhibit II -3; the potential advantages and disadvantages of the carve -out model are shown in Exhibit II -4. Exhibit II -3. Carve -In Model: Possible Advantages and Disadvantages(3) Possible Advantages Possible Disadvantages Potential for improved coordination and linkages of general health care and behavioral health services; Increased efficiency, including simplified contracting Increased likelihood of underfunding and de facto marginalization of substance abuse and mental health services; Insufficient experience of HMOs (where carve -ins are and rate -setting processes; Potential for more integrated, coordinated, and \"holistic\" treatment of consumers; More achievable and measurable general health care cost offsets that may be more easily reinvested in behavioral health services; Promotion of consumer cho ice by managed care plans that contract with multiple full -service HMOs; Improved access to primary health care services; Increased opportunity for prevention, early assessment, and brief intervention. generally found) with services needed by public sector populations; Danger that HMO(s) will base resource allocations for public behavioral hea lth services on inadequate historical levels rather than on clinical need; Tendency of primary care physicians, acting as gatekeepers, to underdiagnose and/or undertreat addictive and mental disorders; Significant portions of dollars assigned for behaviora l health services may be inappropriately diverted to fund physical health care needs; Primary care physicians may be inexperienced in screening for, assessing, and/or treating addictive and mental disorders. Exhibit II -4. Carve -Out Model: Possible Adv antages and Disadvantages Possible Advantages Possible Disadvantages Increased ability to meet the complex needs of individuals requiring specialized treatment for mental and addictive disorders; Dedicated funds for behavioral health services can establ ish a \"floor\" for spending and protect funds from diversion to general health care; Predictability of spending for behavioral health services; Increased confidentiality in practice because clinical records, billing systems, and treatment systems are separa te from those of general health care systems; More specialized services designed explicitly to meet the needs of the target population; Usually a greater level of clinical experience and expertise regarding the prevention and treatment of mental and addict ive disorders. Decreased capacity to coordinate and link behavioral health services with general health services; Greater administrative costs than if administration was combined with a larger health care organization; Unavailability of onsite, naturally occurring cross -training opportunities; Greater likelihood of consumers' being limited to a choice of one or just a few plans; Possible limitations on access to innovative, more costly medications if the pharmacy benefit is covered in a separately managed primary health contract; Increased ambiguity regarding how to fund laboratory and pharmacy services, when and how to assign risk for these services, and how to establish clear accountability; Increased coordination and linkage problems for more complex ca ses where various case managers and services may be involved; Greater likelihood of consumers not following more complicated referral procedures. Stage 2: Procuring Managed Care Services Key steps in this stage: Step #6: Write the RFP Step #7: Establish fair and legally sound procurement and evaluation procedures Step #8: Select a vendor, negotiate issues of contention, and award the contract The procurement of managed care services is likely to be a hi ghly politicized process and is a complex legal process. A procurement process that is smooth, includes all viable bidders, and is legally defensible will lead to the development of a sound contract and a high -quality managed care system. In this stage of the process, it is especially important that the purchaser's team leader make every effort to control team members' communications with others and to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts. It is also important that the procurem ent process conform to applicable laws and regulations. All States must comply with relevant Federal laws, but each State has specific requirements --such as general purchasing rules and required contract language --that will affect the development of the RF P and contract provisions and, in many cases, the entire procurement process. State insurance and HMO regulations, which vary widely, may also dictate the structure and content of the RFP and contract. These laws and regulations often address fiscal solven cy, network requirements, reporting requirements, certificates of authority to operate within the State, and so forth. Other laws address consumer protections, such as specific grievance procedures, marketing rules, definitions of emergency care, and quali ty of care issues. It is essential that planners ascertain relevant State requirements early in the process of planning a managed care initiative and that any necessary amendments to State law be accomplished so that they can be reflected in the RFP and fi nalized before contract startup (Horvath and Kaye, 1995; Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Planners should also assess the need for changes in legislation and/or regulations that will make desired reforms possible. New legislation is often necessary for Medicaid wa ivers, changes in procurement, licensure, or government personnel approvals before it is possible to implement the changes planned. Step #6: Write the RFP The requirements spelled out in the RFP form the philosophical and operational basis for the contrac t, while simultaneously protecting the clinical, legal, and financial interests of the purchaser. A study by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill clearly showed that there is a great need for carefully constructed RFPs (Huskamp, 1996). Bidders tailor proposals specifically to the RFP requirements, and RFP responses may well become attachments to the managed care contract. (Sample specifications, characteristics, and components contained in a standard RFP are presented in Appendix A.) A clear definitio n of the reform goals planned for under the contract and the problems to be addressed should be clearly stated in the RFP. Because the primary purpose of an RFP is to generate sufficient information to facilitate selection of the best bidder(s) to manage e nrollee care, a primary objective of any RFP is to define a system that is reasonable enough to attract a sufficient number of responsible, qualified bidders. The RFP should outline financially reasonable terms that address the legitimate interests of all parties. Neither the purchaser, the MCO, nor consumers win if competent companies don't bid because the program requirements and/or RFP terms are seen as unreasonable, or if the contracted MCO becomes financially unable to meet enrollees' needs because of inaccurate data in the RFP. Although the contract must protect the legal rights of the purchaser, the goal is not necessarily to gain complete legal advantage over a vendor or over other types of outside or internal partners. One -sided RFPs and contracts m ay not attract desirable bidders. Procurement Proceedings If a State administrative procedures act does not provide for review of the purchaser's procurement proceedings, and if Federal money is used for the managed care plan, the Federal Administrative P rocedures Act, and potentially the Medicaid statute itself, give bidders a cause of action to challenge the award made by a State. A purchaser should review the provisions of the Federal Administrative Procedures Act to ensure that all guidelines are follo wed before undertaking a procurement. There is a substantial case law that interprets both the Federal acquisition regulations and the Federal Administrative Procedures Act. A purchaser should consult legal counsel to address these acts and regulations tha t may affect the procurement process. A subsequent box highlights influential cases in which State procurements were challenged by losing bidders. a. State Bidding Procedures Prior to final design of the managed care program, a purchaser should review St ate bidding procedures to ensure compliance. For example, State law may address required preferences for minority and small businesses. State law may also address preferences for \"home State\" businesses. Purchasers must review all aspects of the bidding procedure to ensure that any required preferences or scoring techniques are followed. This includes a review of any legislation that may relate to the selection process. A purchaser should be mindful of legislative directives, as dissatisfied bidders may use legislative language to try to prove that a procurement did not proceed according to State directives. b. State Administrative Procedures Act Bidding procedures that are affected by State law may be subject to a State's administrative procedures act, whic h ensures that State functions are carried out in accordance with concepts of due process. Generally, a State's administrative procedures act may permit judicial review of discretionary acts (i.e., procurement) performed by a State agency. If the procureme nt conducted by the purchaser falls within the confines of discretionary acts, it may be subject to judicial review. A legal challenge of a procurement based on a State's administrative procedures act may lead the court to examine whether the procurement conducted by the State agency was conducted arbitrarily or capriciously. In the context of this guide, the term \"arbitrary and capricious\" refers to procurements in which the standards to be applied were either unclear or unfairly applied or the process wa s tainted by conflicts, or both. The result is considered arbitrary and capricious because the standards were meaningless and/or because the process was unfair. The court may also examine whether the purchaser can produce adequate evidence to substantiate the selection of a particular vendor. Thus, the purchaser must fully document procurement procedures and selection criteria to ensure sufficient evidence to support its final decision. c. Federal Procurement Law If a purchaser is using Federal money to op erate the managed care plan, not only State procurement laws but Federal procurement laws may apply. Special Federal acquisition regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations should be referenced by the purchaser. d. Precision and Specificity of the RFP and Contract Determining the optimal level of detail in the RFP and contract is a fundamental decision for the purchaser. At one end of the spectrum, purchasers may wish to be very prescriptive in order to clearly convey in objective, measurable ways thei r expectations of the MCO. Some argue that, in the attempt to prevent the MCO from inept or avaricious behavior, this level of prescriptive detail will eliminate creativity or input from the MCO. If the RFP is too detailed and prescriptive, the responder n eed only \"parrot\" the questions in their response. Those advocating for more broadly worded contracts believe that the customer would be better served by engaging the services of a legitimate and ethical MCO and then working out the details of the program collaboratively. Some purchasers may want one RFP process that leads to two contracts with the selected MCO in order to prevent the RFP from being overly detailed and prescriptive. One contract period would be for planning and development and the other fo r operations. To be most helpful, the RFP should describe particular programmatic and policy issues that the purchaser has identified. Formats that request the responder to delineate a plan to deal with the programmatic and policy issues provide the opport unity for vendors to differentiate themselves for the customer. The purchaser's critical task is clearly to articulate specifications of overriding importance and to include with each of these specifications a mechanism for measuring the MCO's performance . When the State/purchaser does not have sufficient information to give precise direction to its contractor, it is perfectly acceptable to permit the contractor to develop its own approach, as long as the purchaser understands that in such a situation it i s effectively defaulting to the industry or contractor standard. For example, a purchaser may want extreme clarity about which services are covered and which are not. On the other hand, the purchaser may elect to give the seller broad latitude to select th e provider network. Case Histories in Managed Care Procurement Possibly the three most influential cases involving a State's procurement of managed care occurred in Ohio, Iowa, and Colorado. There have been challenges in other States (Wyoming, Colorado, Ma ssachusetts, and the District of Columbia, for example), but the Iowa, Ohio, and Colorado cases address topics of concern to all potential purchasers, especially since they are reported cases that may be used by both purchasers and bidders in support of their respective positions. When the purchase of managed care services includes Federal dollars, the purchaser also should be aware of all Federal regulations that govern procurement processes. A key regulation is Part 74 of 45 C.F.R., which requires \"free a nd open competition of the procurement.\" This regulation was found applicable in a successful court challenge in 1996 in Iowa and in 1997 in Ohio. Ohio case --In the Ohio case, Value Behavioral Health, Inc. v. Ohio Department of Mental Health (966 F. Supp. 557 (S.D. Ohio 1997)), one of the Nation's largest managed behavioral health care organizations (MBHOs) challenged Ohio's selection of a partnership involving another large MBHO. The Ohio decision is important as it appears to support the proposition that a bidder may have a Federal right of action to challenge a procurement and is not limited to State -created remedies. The court held that potential contractors have a Federal right to expect a fair process when a Medicaid contract is let and thus, when the process used by the State was alleged to be unfair (in this case the record suggested ex parte communications), the aggrieved bidder could claim a right to Federal review of the State's procedures. This case is also an important tool in teaching purchaser s what types of communications may be allowed with bidders prior to finalization of a contract, including contacts after the vendor has been selected but has yet to sign a contract. In this case, the dissatisfied bidder alleged that the preliminary winner was permitted to alter elements of its bid to bring its proposal into conformity with the State's expectations. A lesson learned from this court action is that contact after the award but prior to finalization of a contract should be limited. The MBHO's su it against the state, currently under appeal, was successful in overturning the award. As a result, the Ohio project has been suspended and neither company is managing the care. This Ohio case is significant as it created a Federal cause of action, opening the Federal courts to litigation from disgruntled bidders for Medicaid contracts. The ruling also required that a Federal monitor oversee future State procurements in all areas of State business. Twenty -four States have joined Ohio in the appeal of this d ecision. Iowa case --The Iowa decision provides insight about conflict of interest and scoring techniques. MEDCO v. State of Iowa (553 N.W. 2d 556 (Iowa 1996)) involved the State's use of a managed care consultant who had a conflict of interest (ownership b y the same company that owned a bidding MCO). Even though the consultant recused itself, the fact that the State used a different consulting group suggested by the disqualified consultant was sufficient to taint the process. In addition, the case involved issues that emphasize that a purchaser must be certain that any scoring tool adequately reflects the capabilities of the bidder as it relates to the specifications of the RFP. Likewise, the purchaser must be certain that the scoring of any such tool by eva luators adds up as the evaluator indicates. Colorado case --While State laws differ, conflicts of interest concerning procurement may be affected by Federal law. An interesting case concerning conflicts of interest took place in Colorado ( QualMed. Inc. v. Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services , 934 F. Supp. 1227 (D.Col. 1996)). The results of this case show that a bidding entity must also take all reasonable steps to mitigate conflicts of interest. Further, a bid must be evaluated based on the merit of the proposal and its consistency with the evaluation criteria. If the purchaser negotiates with a vendor to fill in gaps or address issues that should have been included in the RFP during the negotiation phase, there may be legal impediments to the addition of services to the vendor's bid. If the purchaser negotiates for more or different services than originally outlined, legal challengers may argue that the purchaser did not follow procurement guidelines or the law. RFPs t hat provide detailed program definitions, specific contractor requirements, and expected outcomes will more readily be incorporated into the contract. Because the RFP and the proposal submitted by the winning contractor are often wholly or partially incorp orated into the contract, the importance of these documents should not be underestimated. In some cases, the RFP, with the proposal and other attachments referenced, becomes the contract itself (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). In such cases, the contents of the R FP should explicitly mirror the contract that purchasers expect will eventually be signed. The RFP must specify the format and content of the proposal. In general, the RFP must provide a clear and detailed picture of the evolution and structure of the hea lth care system, the short - and long -term goals of the new managed care program, the population(s) to be covered, and the values that underlie the public system. It must be comprehensive and include detailed descriptions of eligibility and enrollment of co nsumers, access requirements, the nature of the program, the scope of the benefit plan, and consumer rights. It also should outline the processes to be followed in terms of managing utilization and quality, standards for the provider network, the system of grievance and appeals, and how claims are to be paid. The purchaser must outline the methods and standards for payment of the contractor, including rate -setting methods, requirements for the management of funds, and banking and accounting requirements. Me asures of performance should be included with each specification, and the contract should have rules that impose intermediate sanctions in nonperformance. In addition, the purchaser must define the minimum qualifications of the contractor, including financ ial condition, independence requirements, licensure, and other experience. This definition is necessary because the firms in this industry change so frequently that information that is valid one month may easily be out of date the next. In addition, there should be provisions concerning what should happen if there is a change in vendor ownership. Some purchasers, to protect the consumer and the public trust, may wish to define allowable limits on profits and/or to establish guidelines for how a defined perc entage or amount of profits are to be reinvested in the system. The RFP should also include definitions and levels of service and should indicate the expected timeframe and transition requirements for implementing the program. It must also describe the pro cess by which some bidders are asked to submit their \"best and final\" offers if these are allowed in the State; this process must be carefully documented and able to withstand a legal challenge. Purchasers must understand that some private sector firms are accustomed to substantive, last -minute financial negotiations done in the purchaser's best interest. In the public sector, the opportunity for such changes usually must be provided to all finalists and not just to one favored entity, as is often done in t he private sector. Vendors who have been selected for best and final offers will generally not press for equitable treatment of their competitors; ensuring fairness and even -handed treatment is the responsibility of the purchaser, as several State courts h ave found. The development team should use the most knowledgeable staff and/or consultants available to form a writing team for the RFP. This often involves a chief drafter and a small group to review drafts and provide comments and input. After a thoroug h review of model contracts, RFPs, and other State procurement documents, the writing team should begin by developing a general outline for the RFP subject to review and approval by the development team. Stakeholders may also be allowed to provide input on the outline and/or language at this early stage of the process. Consultants with expertise in RFP preparation and other skilled writers are potential resources that the purchaser should use wisely. Because the RFP is often incorporated into the contract, RFP provisions should be drafted in precise language that is not subject to different interpretations. Attorneys can be helpful in this drafting process. However, the State must take care to fully brief any writers or consultants on all of the key decision points, if these individuals have not been part of the planning process. Purchasers may also find it useful to write the RFP and the draft contract at the same time. Any contract language required in State or local regulations should be included in the RFP, including requirements for Medicaid (if applicable). Contract requirements for Medicaid -covered services are outlined in the applicable Medicaid regulations (45 C.F.R. Part 74) and are further described in the Medicaid Manual in Section 2087. These sect ions should be reviewed for possible inclusion in RFPs and resulting contracts. e. Bidder Qualification Process As discussed earlier in this chapter, prior to issuing the RFP, it is often advisable to issue an RFI for review and comment by all interested parties. One purpose of this short evaluation is to ascertain the number of interested bidders and to develop a mailing list of qualified bidders. Thus, the purchaser must decide how to qualify bidders. Ideally, key stakeholders should come to a consensus on these criteria. Bidders who fail to meet qualification criteria via the RFI process should be acknowledged but excluded from the bidding process. Failure to conduct the RFI process may lead to an excess of unacceptable proposals to evaluate and costly u se of staff or consultant time. Some State vendor selection processes that have ended in litigation could have been solved by eliminating some less qualified competitors at the outset. Qualification requirements have been widely used in the private sector and include organizational features such as the following: Auspices (for profit or not for profit), independence, and ownership; Geographic location; Minimum financial disclosure/financial resources baseline; Minimum years in operation; Acceptable referenc es from key clients in similar States; Minimum size, including covered lives, network size, and revenue; Minimum management information system capability; Acceptable audited financial statements; Accreditation; Evidence of current liability insurance and h istory of malpractice litigation; Minimal prior litigation history; and Evidence of stable organizational leadership and ownership. Managed care vendors that pass these tests and sign confidentiality and conflict -of-interest statements can safely be sent R FPs. Although potential bidders frequently ask for exceptions to allow them to enter the process after it has begun, such exceptions should rarely be made. f. Letters of Intent and Transmittal Submission of a letter of intent to compete in the RFP process should be a prerequisite for the submission of a proposal if this is part of the established process in the State. The letter of intent provides the purchaser a written opportunity to: Identify all potential bidders; Manage all contacts by potential bidder s with officials within the agency; and Produce accurate records of distribution of material from the purchaser to the bidders. The letter of intent must have an original signature. Depending on State law, proposals may not be accepted from bidders who fai l to submit a letter of intent by the date established in the RFP. The letter should contain the bidder's name, title, mailing address, telephone number, statement of intent to compete for the contract, and authorizing signature. Senior team members should be available throughout the entire process to answer procedural questions. In addition, each bidder's transmittal letter should contain assurances for the purchasing agency. (The recommended statements and assurances that a bidder's transmittal letter sho uld contain are presented in Appendix B of this guide.) Step #7: Establish Fair and Legally Sound Procurement and Evaluation Procedures a. The Selection Committee The selection committee that reviews the submitted proposals should be small enough for effec tive functioning and may include key internal staff, representatives from the appropriate State (or county) substance abuse and mental health authorities, consumer and family representatives, and outside consultants. This committee is usually chaired by th e manager responsible for program operations or a designated senior staff member. The selection committee's responsibilities and goals may vary but may include selecting acceptable and unacceptable candidates, ranking of acceptable applications, identifyin g strengths and weaknesses, conducting orals, reviewing references, development of a unanimous recommendation, and/or making recommendations to the decisionmaker. Although often there are pitfalls associated with outside evaluation, the existing stakeholde r advisory group or a similar group can provide input to the selection committee. Caution should be exercised because some of those who offer input may be providers associated with the MCO or others with conflicts of interest. The purchaser may wish to con sider liaisons with other government agencies. For example, a child welfare liaison may be needed to ensure the adequacy of MCOs' plans with regard to care coordination pathways for children and families involved with both the child welfare department and the Medicaid managed care program. This decision is particularly critical for States in which some child welfare services have been paid for with Medicaid funds. In such cases, there is a need to ensure continuity in the content and range of services, and these design issues are probably best reviewed by a child welfare professional. b. Validity of Tools Used in the Evaluation Process When the selection committee is charged with recommending and/or selecting the successful bid, the validity of the evaluatio n tool, analysis guidelines, and scoring process is critical. These tools should be developed and published before the RFP is issued. In particular, the evaluation tool is critical in determining the successful bidder. The tool should be designed to fairly and adequately score the bids submitted. It should not be so complicated that the evaluation panel cannot understand and use it. During the RFP process, the development team should have the evaluation tool reviewed by appropriate legal and technical exper ts. Generally, rankings and scores on specific areas of a bidder's proposal should be based on consensus score; individual scoring should be used only for notes and planning purposes. Evaluators should be instructed to keep exhaustive notes so that their r atings of bidders can be understood and compared for uniformity of approach. For example, when evaluators rank one bidder high and another low on network, their notes should reflect what was meant by a \"good\" network (e.g., many providers located in areas of high need, an adequate array of specialists, the inclusion of network members with special skills in treating non -English - speaking members). Evaluators should receive exhaustive guidance from the purchaser regarding the criteria they will be expected to apply in evaluating each element of the contract. All notes and documents created during the selection process, such as ratings, rationales, advisory presentations, and areas of disagreement when unanimity cannot be achieved, should be kept and presented to the director of the purchasing agency. These documents should be reviewed for accuracy by legal counsel as well as procurement staff and should become part of a permanent record. Purchasers should be aware that some RFPs and Federal and State laws allow for a review by the purchasing agency of the decision to select a particular bidder. This also allows a dissatisfied bidder to review the agency's decisionmaking process. In the bidder review, all applicable administrative procedures used by the purchaser may be subject to scrutiny, and score sheets, evaluation tools, and even personal notes may be accessible to an unsuccessful bidder. c. Conducting a Fair Procurement Litigation challenging the legality of procurement processes is becoming increasingly co mmon (see \"Case Histories in Managed Care Procurement\" on page 39). Because purchasers usually select only one vendor in a procurement, competition between MCOs can be intense. Many MCOs are attempting to establish or strengthen their market position. More over, proposal development by an MCO is very expensive. Consequently, losing bidders may have multiple incentives to litigate if they believe they have any chance of success. If they are successful, they may be awarded the contract or at least have another opportunity to compete if the contract is rebid. In addition, the ability to delay a competitor's startup may enhance their own market share. In a Medicaid procurement process, the legal implications of program design center on \"free and open competition\" as discussed in the Federal acquisition regulations (48 C.F.R. \u00a79.504). The procurement process is not completely quantifiable, and where there is room for interpretation, there is room for challenge. MCOs are under tremendous financial pressure to win c ontracts, and challenging a contract award can result in a profitable reversal of a decision. As noted above, unsuccessful bidders in several States (e.g., Iowa, Montana, Colorado, and Ohio) have challenged the legality of the procurement process for Medic aid managed behavioral health care contracts. These challenges have led to costly litigation and delays and project revocation. In finding reasons to challenge the process, aggressive MCOs can often capitalize on State officials' relative lack of knowledge , expertise, and skill in conducting procurements of this magnitude. The fundamental lesson learned in these various lawsuits has been the need for using well -trained staff and precise procurement procedures from the beginning of the process. Avoiding La wsuits: Ensuring a Fair and Legally Sound RFP Procurement Process The RFP should be carefully written and reviewed by knowledgeable persons outside the writing team to ensure that it does not inadvertently contain features that would bias the selection pr ocess. The RFP should designate an issuing officer, the only person a bidder or potential bidder may contact once the RFP is issued. Unauthorized contacts should lead to enforceable disqualifications. The RFP should restrict how long communication can cont inue during the procurement process by announcing an end date for communication between bidders and the issuing officer. If the issuing officer is successfully challenged, a fully briefed understudy must be available to take over. The purchaser must establ ish standard protocols for contacts and document all contacts between each bidder and the issuing officer. It is usually important to involve unbiased outside consultants in the vendor evaluation and decisionmaking process (subject to the same procurement requirements and conflict -of-interest provisions as the rest of the parties involved) to ensure that the team has a sufficient knowledge base related to managed behavioral health care, contract negotiation, actuarial issues, and general financial expertis e. Conflict of interest should be concretely and specifically defined in all documents and vendors should be made aware of the definition and of the State's requirements. Even the appearance of any conflict of interest on the part of any key participants in the process, including State staff, advisory committee members, and/or external consultants must be avoided. All individuals involved with key decisions should sign conflict -of-interest disclosure forms before they are involved in the process. Staff or committee members who are found to violate the conflict -of-interest requirements must be removed before final procurement decisions are made if litigation is to be avoided. The schedule of all events, including a bidders' conference, should be announced we ll ahead of time to allow adequate time for responses. The team should ensure that only designated staff or consultants are available to respond to questions raised following the bidders' conference. A summary of the bidders' conference with detailed writ ten responses to the questions asked should be promptly forwarded to all those who attended. The purchaser's intent should be clear from the outset regarding selection of one or more bidders to negotiate with and the extent to which proposals may be modif ied during negotiations, such as best and final offers. Strict confidentiality about the evaluation process should be maintained, unless information is broadly distributed. All known procedural requirements found in statutes, regulations, or the RFP itsel f should be strictly adhered to, including the use of State procurement agencies or officers/auditors normally involved in large purchases. The purchaser should generally assume that any RFP award will be challenged. Such an assumption will encourage scrupulous behavior and ensure that the purchaser seeks early and ongoing legal advice. Step #8: Select a Vendor, Negotiate Issues of Contention, and Award the Contract Once a bidder has been selected, a number of issues must be addressed before the contrac t is finalized. Most are related to reconciling the RFP, the MCO's proposal, and the frequently divergent \"understandings\" that have developed between key individuals but not recorded. The resolution of these and other issues can lead to best and final neg otiations that usually take 1 to 2 months, sometimes longer. Best and final negotiation parameters should be clearly addressed in the RFP, because legal issues abound when bids or the RFP are altered. These negotiations may or may not be possible depending on the procurement laws in the State. When not allowable, it is possible to build a \"clarification process\" of technical issues before award of a contract. For instance, before the award, the purchaser can require oral and written clarification of technic al issues or a carefully planned visit to a site where the MCO is operating to observe operations and/or discuss issues. Any final negotiations should ensure that the contract between the purchaser and the MCO provides a solid clinical, operational, and le gal foundation upon which the managed care system can be built. All responsibilities identified and agreed to by both parties should be precisely described, because legal disputes between the contractor and the purchaser will be decided on the basis of the se provisions and will generally hold the drafter (i.e., purchaser) responsible for clarifying its requirements (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1995; Horvath and Kaye, 1995). To support the contractor's adherence to the implementation schedule and a smooth transition, detailed objectives and requirements should be included in the RFP, the contractor's proposal, and the contract. Contractors usually begin work immediately in order to be fully operational in a relatively short time. The purchaser shou ld allow at least 3 to 4 months from the contract award before operations formally begin. In anticipation of a signed contract, memoranda of understanding between the purchaser and the contractor are sometimes developed to provide a formal understanding of preparation processes and activities (e.g., development of management information systems, staff recruitment). The purchaser and the contractor should assign project officers to conduct activities during the implementation process. It may also be useful t o place performance guarantees around the efficiency of the contractor's implementation process. Doing so, however, assumes that State personnel have fulfilled their scheduling and resource commitments to the contractor. In general, the managed contract sh ould achieve the following goals: Form an operational basis for the relationship between the purchaser and contractor; Define the specific responsibilities of all parties; Establish clear standards for the discharge of these responsibilities; Establish inc entives for performance and sanctions for noncompliance; Define and establish the payment mechanism(s); Establish the financial basis for the relationship, what will be delivered, what will be paid, and under what schedule; Delineate the goals and philosop hy of the program, as well as its key operational and policy components; Provide structures to resolve disputes, enforce contract provisions, and apply damages; Protect the rights of enrollees and providers; Establish a timetable for discharge of key respo nsibilities during the implementation period, including appropriate incentives and sanctions tied to deliverables; Establish organizational and staffing requirements; Establish a process for operations; Establish a set of performance measures and minimum s tandards; Establish specific fees for specific tasks, as appropriate; and Specify requirements for making the system culturally accessible. The remaining chapters of this document discuss options for meeting these specific goals. Stage 3: Implementing a Ma naged Care System Key steps in this stage: Step #9: Sign, implement, and administer the managed care contract Step #10: After procurement, monitor, audit, and evaluate performance under the managed care contract Step #9: Sign, Implement, and Admini ster the Managed Care Contract A purchaser should not underestimate the challenge involved in implementing a managed care system. Multiple activities must occur to prepare for the transition.Before proceeding, however, a purchaser should consider any event s that may have changed the landscape since the RFP was developed. For example, if any health care legislation was implemented during that time that affects eligibility, the purchaser may want to renegotiate expectations about enrollment and claims targets . It is essential that any renegotiation consideration be informed by legal counsel, as this may put the entire procurement process into question and invalidate the selection. The purchaser should consult with its peers, such as those in child welfare, t o clarify relevant issues prior to implementation of a managed care initiative. During the first weeks and months of the managed care initiative's implementation, the purchaser will be setting a precedent for the manner in which it will handle its relatio nship with the MCO. For that reason, it is important to manage the implementation process thoughtfully. Weekly project management meetings in which problems are discussed and deliverable tasks are assigned and monitored can provide a solid framework upon w hich to build the relationship. Like the RFP, the contract should include detailed implementation plans. The bidder's response to the RFP regarding program implementation should provide a useful plan of tasks and timeframes for making the transition to th e new system. In addition, bidders should be required to provide a detailed and specific workplan when they become finalists. The purchaser should examine each bidders' workplan to determine its feasibility and reasonableness, and the purchaser should then provide input and convey acceptance of a final workplan in writing. The most immediate tasks faced by the MCO may include adaptations to the existing claims system; grandfathering of existing contracts; development of a deliverable schedule; development, refinement, or expansion of MIS capacity; and recruitment or reassignment of staff. Although the responsibilities and timeframes for the transition period should have been covered by the RFP and the successful bidder's response to the RFP, there is someti mes a need to develop a written agreement during the transition from award to contract signing. As mentioned earlier in this section, a memorandum of understanding with the MCO can provide the necessary legal framework for implementation preparation to beg in while the details of a contract are finalized. The memorandum of understanding should summarize key points of agreement and include the stipulation that the MCO covers startup costs if negotiations fail. Points of contact should be identified by both th e purchaser and the MCO, including project officers who are authorized to bind each party to agreements and decisions. Some States see startup costs as an investment made by the MCO. In these cases, the State's payment is in the form of capitation only aft er the program is operational. The rationale behind this model is that it provides a very strong incentive for the MCO to get the program up and running. A memorandum of understanding should be carefully reviewed by legal counsel as it is a binding contrac t and can create substantial problems if no contract is finalized. During negotiations, the purchaser may choose to revisit the issue of staff credentialing and to monitor the hiring process to ensure that the MCO staff reflect both the anticipated level o f competence and the diversity of the population being served. This is the time to make sure that specialists, in areas such as child and family, and substance abuse are on board or being pursued by the MCO. To ensure continuity of coverage for enrollees d uring the transition to the managed care plan, purchasers may direct MCOs to develop and utilize short -term provisional contracts with current providers as needed to allow sufficient time for contracting and credentialing and to facilitate smooth and clini cally appropriate transitions for consumers. Preoperational tasks include developing educational materials for recipients (consumer and family advocacy organizations such as the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health [FFCMH] and State -level a ffiliates of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill [NAMI] can assist); establishing a provider network; developing training and instructional materials for providers and their staff; establishing and testing of the enrollment process; installing a man agement information system (MIS); installing telephone systems; establishing intake and referral procedures, and hiring and training staff. Other tasks and deliverables that can be undertaken at this time include the following: Making final decisions about MCO staff; Testing functions and features of the MIS; Making final decisions about software used to analyze geographic access to services based on population distribution; Performing a readiness review to look at staff, enrollee services, the claims proce ssing system, and the ability to transmit data to the purchaser; Developing written material such as consumer -reviewed enrollee handbooks , marketing information, and provider handbooks; and Preparing reports on ongoing meetings between the MCO and the pur chaser and other key groups (i.e., CEO meetings, marketing staff meetings, medical director meetings, advisory group meetings, and chief financial officer meetings). A file of deliverables, recorded receipt dates, and completion levels should be maintained throughout the project. This record should be set up as the repository of all materials that might be relevant if the purchaser wants to implement penalties for inadequate performance or, in severe cases, terminate the contract. Step #10: After Procuremen t, Monitor, Audit, and Evaluate Performance Under the Managed Care Contract Three different and distinct activities are crucial in the postprocurement review period: monitoring, auditing, and evaluating. Each of these activities has a different but essent ial role in the review process. (Monitoring and quality assurance issues are discussed at greater length in Chapter VI.) a. Monitoring Necessary formal monitoring strategies include regular reporting, formal and informal site visits, ad hoc requests for i nformation from the MCO, and information gathered from staff providers and external agencies. Formal monitoring meetings or visits should be scheduled in advance and focus on specific areas of project performance. The purchaser should use these processes t o set a clear precedent for the MCO to expect followup on deliverables and a sharp focus on completing tasks in a timely manner. Informal monitoring might include casual conversation, attendance at provider meetings, and involvement in consumer and family advocacy meetings. Observation of MCO activities, to witness firsthand the MCO's manner in a variety of situations, can be extremely helpful in anticipating and managing problematic issues. In addition, the purchaser should specify required reports and es tablish a schedule for receipt and response to those reports. Purchasers should be cautious not to overwhelm the MCO with report requests. Reporting requirements should be realistic in scope and based on information that the purchaser will actually use, co nsistent with the ability of the MCO's MIS to generate the reports. These requirements should also be sensitive to the burden that reporting requirements can place on providers, recipients, and the MCO. The purchaser may also consider a role here for other government agency liaisons. For example, a child welfare liaison may meet regularly with the MCO and the purchaser to monitor the implementation of mutually agreed -upon care, such as coordination pathways for children and families involved with both the c hild welfare and the Medicaid managed care programs. b. Auditing Unannounced audit activities include formal reviews in which programmatic and financial data are collected in a systematic manner following predetermined protocols. While financial audits s hould be conducted by a certified public accountant, programmatic audits may be conducted by the purchaser directly or by an independent quality review organization, such as the National Committee on Quality Assurance. Some advantages of independent audits are the perceived objectivity of the findings and the ability to compare the MCO's performance with that of other MCOs. The purchaser may want to audit the potential for cost shifting early in the project. For example, have child welfare costs increased a s Medicaid spending on inpatient care decreased? Has Medicaid spending on outpatient care increased and child welfare expenditures for community -based care decreased as the managed care effort offers more intensive outpatient services for all children? Hav e State mental health hospital costs risen due to overly restrictive clinical practices by the MCO? Monitoring for potential cost shifting should be planned well in advance. The process requires significant time to negotiate because of the need to develop data exchange agreements and protocols among government agencies and with private vendors. Health economists are not used to examining societal cost offsets, as would be called for here, and the selection of an experienced and knowledgeable auditor is crit ical. c. Evaluating Performance Evaluations of the MCO's performance should be performed on an ongoing basis and, if possible, should be based on a valid set of baseline data. The evaluations should be designed to provide the purchaser with useful data, w ithout being too resource intensive, and should be an integral part of a larger overall monitoring system. While evaluation projects can be large or small, purchasers should bear in mind that the cost of such projects may be minor when compared with the ov erall cost of the project. Evaluations during the postprocurement period should focus on the most critical issues that are measurable and that can generate information in a fairly short period of time. Longer term program evaluations, such as those requir ed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) at the end of any 2 -year Section 1915(b) Medicaid waiver and those that are an integral part of any Section 1115 Medicaid waiver, are generally used to determine whether the waiver program has met acces s, quality, and effectiveness objectives and is therefore eligible for renewal. For waiver renewal evaluations, the purchaser may want to consider obtaining consultation or services from independent contractors with evaluation expertise who can provide an objective, scientific assessment of purchaser -determined access, quality, or outcome measures in the new system and help identify and solve implementation problems. Purchasers may want to contract with an evaluator entity early in the project and begin to design the evaluation model. Whenever possible, ongoing evaluation efforts should be blended with larger, long -term studies. Purchasers should be very careful, however, in choosing such technical assistance, espe cially for Medicaid evaluations. Only a few universities and research firms have experienced conducting large - scale evaluations of Medicaid medical and behavioral health programs. It may be advisable to check with appropriate Federal resources to ascertain the location of the centers with experience doing such evaluations. Regardless of the approach used by the purchaser to evaluate the MCO's performance, the monitoring and evaluation of consumer and system outcomes should begin early in the process and con tinues. 1. Medicaid managed care purchasing is governed by detailed Federal statutory and regulatory requirements, so purchasers of behavioral managed care services are cautioned against combining several sources of public funding into a single procurement unless all funds are subject to Medicaid requirements. Even in this situation, non -Medicaid sources of funding, such as the CMHS and SAPT Block Grants, may have their own requirements regarding use of funds (for further discussion, see Chapter III). 2. In some contexts, the term \"carve -in\" technically refers to a reintegration of previously carved out services, back into an integrated health care model. In this document, the term carve -in refers to an integration of behavioral health care services with gen eral health care, whether or not they were previously carved out. 3. These features apply only to managed care systems that do not subcontract for behavioral health services. CHAPTER III Coverage Key issues in this chapter: Coverage options under managed care: defined benefits vs. defined contributions Developing service definitions Defining and operationalizing medical necessity Funding streams and their impact on coverage A central issue in preparing requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts for managed care is defining the scope of the coverage agreement between the purchaser and the managed care organization (MCO). In the absence of express contract language establishing variations from insurance custom an d practice, the coverage a purchaser receives from an MCO generally will be consistent with these customary standards. If the purchaser of defined benefits wants a different level of coverage or coverage furnished in accordance with different standards, th e RFP and contract must explicitly state the purchaser's requirement. Otherwise, the expectation may be held to fall outside the scope of the agreement and will remain the \"residual\" responsibility(1) of the purchaser. Silence or ambiguity in the contract will be construed by the courts against the agency that issued the contract --i.e., the purchaser. Because of resource limitations and political issues, many managed behavior al health benefit plans developed for the public sector include only a portion of the full range of services needed to prevent, treat, and provide rehabilitation for mental and addictive disorders. Thus, in many States, the responsibility for delivery of b ehavioral health services is divided between the purchaser and the MCO(s). Without careful planning and delineation of service responsibilities, this splitting of the full continuum of care can lead to cost shifting, a fragmented delivery system, and lack of any meaningful accountability. MCOs operate in a competitive environment and generally are eager to satisfy purchasers' needs and desires; however, they typically have multiple \"books of business\" and thus may be reluctant or unwilling to tailor their operations and their standard benefit package. A State Medicaid agency or other public purchaser charged with service responsibilities beyond those that any MCO is willing or able to assume retains residual coverage responsibilities and must ensure that it has sufficient funds to properly execute these responsibilities. Special industry practice guidelines offer a particularly good view of what the managed behavioral health care industry considers standard coverage. Accreditation guidelines also offer insig ht into what is currently considered standard operating practice for the industry. Purchasers making coverage determinations should familiarize themselves with these documents so that they can better understand the extent to which their purchasing expectat ions align with or depart from industry standards. This chapter covers several topics of importance to developing and defining the scope of a coverage agreement between a purchaser of managed behavioral health care and an MCO: Coverage options under managed care --namely, defined benefit contracts and defined contribution contracts; Developing definitions for services to be covered --including preventive, treatment, rehabilitation, and ancillary social and rehabilitative support (or \"wraparound\") services --and incorporating these definitions into the contract; Defining the critical concept of medical necessity in public sector managed care contracts and operationalizing this concept through means such as MCOs' utilization management (UM) practices; and Writing contracts to ensure that coverage complies with Federal statutory and regulatory provisions governing the various funding streams used to purchase behavioral managed care services --in particu lar, Medicaid and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -21-300x -35) and the Community Mental Health Services Grant (Public Law 102-321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -7-300x -8).(2) A. Coverage Options Under Managed Care: Defined Benefits vs. Defined Contributions Purchasers can contract for the provision of coverage to enrollees in two ways. They may either buy a defined set of benefits or they may elect to buy a defined contribution. Defined benefit contracts specify a defined set of benefits that managed care enrollees are eligible to receive. A contract for a Medicaid managed care initiative is typically a defined benefit contract. Defined contribution contracts entitle no individual enrollee to any particular service; the MCO's duty is to the covered group as a whole. A managed care contract using State block grant funds is us ually a defined contribution contract. 1. Defined Benefit Contracts Managed care products customarily consist of a defined set of benefits that enrollees are eligible to receive if the benefits are determined to be \"medically necessary.\" Several factor s affect the definition, scope, and \"usability\" of a defined benefit in practice. Under certain circumstances, an MCO may wish to exclude coverage for a defined covered benefit because the MCO considers delivery of the service to be the responsibility of a nother entity and not a medical treatment. For example, the MCO may wish to exclude a type of treatment ordered by a court or recommended in a student's Individualized Education Plan. An MCO may also wish to exclude a covered benefit if it is considered ex perimental under the MCO's definition (Rosenblatt, Law, & Rosenbaum, 1997). An MCO may also want to deny coverage if the requested service is for a condition that does not fall within the traditional range of insurable risks --that is, if it is not seen as medically necessary for the restoration of normal functioning after an illness or injury. Thus, treatments for chronic disabling conditions with little chance of improvement may be denied altogether as not covered. More commonly, the service requested may be covered by the MCO, but only up to a certain amount (e.g., 20 outpatient mental health visits per year) in order to avoid covering services for consumers who may have chronic and incurable disorders and high needs for services. Because of the structure of the Medicaid program and its requirements of State agencies, a Medicaid managed care contract must be drafted as a defined benefit agreement,(3) although the contract may contain memberwide service goals and outcomes, as in a defined contribution agreement. An example of such goals are the measures included in the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) developed by the National Committee for Quality Assu rance (NCQA) (NCQA, 1997), which are discussed in Chapter VI of this document. A State may also use funds from the SAPT and CMHS Block Grants to purchase defined benefits. However, unless the State elects to use significant funds for relatively few members or adds appreciably to the block grant allotment out of its own funding, it is likely that a benefit package financed with block grant funds will be far narrower than one sponsored by Medicaid. Finally, the MCO retains the discretion (and the duty under m ost contracts) to make medical necessity determinations. In the absence of an explicit contractual agreement to the contrary, an MCO will apply its own set of criteria in medical necessity determinations. 2. Defined Contribution Contracts A purchaser may elect to buy a defined contribution benefit rather than a defined service benefit. A defined contribution contract entitles no individual member to any particular service; instead the MCO owes a duty to the covered group as a whole. For example, a defined contribution plan is similar to the State's giving a grant to a community mental health center (CMHC) or addiction treatment center in exchange for performing a specified set of services. The clinic's service obligation is toward the residents of its servi ce area as a group, and there is no enforceable individual right to any level of benefit. The difference between a community clinic grant and a defined contribution managed care plan is that in the former case, the contractor's duty is generally to all the individuals in its service area, while in the latter case, the grantee's duty is confined to its members. In both cases, however, the purchaser asks the seller to take on certain broad tasks for the group as a whole and/or to accomplish certain goals for the eligible population. The purchaser may impose limitations on how the goals are reached (e.g., \"Do not spend less than 20 percent of the funds on preventive services, as defined in this agreement\"). In the case of a community clinic grant, however, the grantee may be forced to reduce or alter services if patients consume a greater than expected level of care or if there is an unanticipated increase in the number of community residents seeking care. This is not true in a defined contribution managed care contract; a contractor is at risk for fulfilling the duties it assumed for the term of the agreement. The purchaser cannot, however, expect the contractor to furnish additional services for the same payment, nor can it expect the contractor to alter its s ervice mix in order to reach additional residents of its service area who are not members of the plan. The State may also use block grant funds to purchase a defined contribution plan under which it pays a certain amount per member per month to finance ge neral activities for members. Under such a plan, performance is best measured by broad intermediate service goals and overall health care outcomes, such as receipt of preventive services by a certain proportion of all members, or a percentage decline in sc hool absentee rates among plan members who are children with a serious emotional disturbance. In addition, a State could use its block grant funds to provide at least some level of benefit or contributed coverage to enrollees during periods when their Medi caid eligibility lapses. Finally, block grant funds also might be used to finance activities that do not constitute medical assistance under the Medicaid statute or for which payment is prohibited (e.g., services to residents of institutions for mental dis ease [IMDs]). B. Developing Service Definitions The purchaser of managed behavioral health care services must precisely define the substance abuse and/or mental health services to be covered by the MCO. In a study of State Medicaid managed care contracts, Rosenbaum and her associates (1997) found that different terms are often used to describe the same types of services and that there is inconsistency among the States in their definitions of federally defined services. Given such variability in definitions of substance abuse and mental health services and the fact that the terms for services are often used inconsistently across regions and by behavioral health professionals, it is essential that the purchaser of managed care services clearly define the subs tance abuse and/or mental health services it wants to cover in both the RFP and the contract. A purchaser can either develop its own definitions of substance abuse and/or mental health services or reference other documents with definitions. The substance abuse and mental health fields have both made efforts to define services (see definitions of both types of services in Appendix C). In addition, purchasers may seek assistance from a variety of Federal and State agencies, national associations, and credent ialing organizations for assistance in developing definitions of substance abuse and mental health services: the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children (COA), the Family Treatment Association (FTA), the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health (FFCMH), the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and the American P ublic Welfare Association (APWA), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO), and the Committee for Accreditation of Rehabilitation (CARF). It is usually safest for a purchaser to adopt very precise descriptions of substance abuse and mental health services, but the definitions should not unduly impede or prohibit the MCO and its provider network from delivering individualized, person -centered care in a flexible and creative manner, especially in risk -based payment systems. A ll service definitions developed by an MCO should be subject to the purchaser's approval prior to implementation. 1. Typologies of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services For purchasers considering what types of substance abuse and mental health services to include in a managed care contract, two existing typologies of services --one published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the other by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) --may offer a useful conceptual framework. a. The Instit ute of Medicine's (IOM) Typology The Committee on Prevention of Mental Disorders (IOM, 1994) proposed a classification system for the full spectrum of services addressing mental disorders, including addictive disorders. This typology has been adopted by th e National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), among other organizations, and is rapidly gaining adherents among State agencies. (See Appendix C for SAPT primary prevention definition.) The IOM typology divi des services into the following three categories: Preventive interventions; Treatment interventions; and Maintenance interventions. Preventive interventions are services designed to reduce the probability of development of clinically demonstrable substance abuse and mental health problems. They consist of (1) universal interventions targeted to a population group that has not been identified on the basis of individual risk (e.g., substance abuse prevention curricula required of all public school students); (2) selective interventions targeted to individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing clinical problems is significantly higher than average (e.g., bereavement support groups for low - income widows and widowers, life skills programs for chronically truant students); and (3) indicated interventions for individuals with minimal but detectable signs or symptoms foreshadowing mental or substance use disord ers (e.g., parent -child interaction training for children identified as having persistent conduct problems). Treatment interventions are therapeutic services designed to reduce the length of time a disorder exists, halt its progression of severity, or if n ot possible, increase the length of time between acute episodes. The IOM typology divides treatment into the categories of (1) case identification; and (2) treatment for the identified disorder, to include interventions to reduce the likelihood of future c o-occurring disorders. Maintenance interventions are generally supportive, educational, and/or pharmacological in nature and are provided on a long -term basis to individuals who have met DSM diagnostic criteria and whose underlying illness continues. The t wo components of maintenance interventions are (1) the provision of rehabilitative aftercare; and (2) support of patients' compliance with long -term treatment to prevent recurrence of acute incidents. Public purchasers of managed care have most frequently purchased services labeled treatment services in the IOM continuum, but an increasing number are purchasing prevention and maintenance services. Thus, for example, public sector agencies have negotiated separate arrangements with such community -based organ izations as Oxford houses, halfway houses, and support groups to provide maintenance interventions for individuals recovering from drug addiction. Similarly, the public sector frequently has maintained contracts or grants with community -based providers to undertake preventive interventions through outreach to the general population or to high -risk individuals. These arrangements can be funded separately but coordinated with the MCO, or can be included as part of the defined benefit package. In either case, purchasers may benefit by analyzing the costs and potential benefits of providing adequate funding for certain preventive and maintenance interventions, in addition to treatment. b. The American Society of Addiction Medicine's (ASAM) Typology The substance abuse field has made substantial progress over the past decade in developing a formal structure that systematically organizes commonly used treatment interventions. In an ongoing effort to establish national standards for defining (1) a continuum of subst ance abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative services; and (2) a set of admission, continuing care, and discharge criteria for each level of service intensity, ASAM, with nationwide input from treatment professionals and others, has been developing Patient Placement Criteria for the Treatment of Substance -Related Disorders. The second edition of this publication, referred to as ASAM PPC -2, was published in 1996 (ASAM, 1996). The criteria in ASAM PPC -2 are the most widely used and comprehensive natio nal guidelines for placement, continued stay, and discharge of patients with alcohol and other drug problems. ASAM PPC -2 specifies five levels of treatment services: Pretreatment; Level I, Outpatient Services; Level I I, Intensive Outpatient/Partial Hospitalization Services; Level III, Residential/Inpatient Services; and Level IV, Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Services. ASAM PPC -2 also describes a range of resources to be used by individuals at each level dep ending on continual assessment of six dimensions: the individual's need for detoxification services, medical complications, emotional/behavioral complications, treatment acceptance or resistance, relapse potential, and recovery/living environment. To deli neate various intensities of services within a particular level, ASAM PPC -2 introduced the concept of \"gradient intensities.\" Thus, for example, a residential or inpatient program (Level III) with ready availability of onsite psychiatrists, a nursing staff , and a high staff -to-consumer ratio might be categorized as Level III.7. Another Level III residential program with minimal on -call medical support might be categorized as Level III.1. ASAM PPC -2 also addresses the increasing need to separate or \"unbundle \" the treatment modality and intensity of service from the treatment setting. Thus, for instance, detoxification, which was once regarded as an inpatient procedure, can be administered in a variety of settings at all levels of care, ranging from hospital -based programs to outpatient clinics and even in the home. ASAM PPC -2 is copyrighted, and purchasers should beware that ASAM historically has denied all requests to modify the criteria. ASAM's literature has made it very clear that the organization intends to maintain and protect its copyright in order to safeguard the integrity of the text. States and other entities may publish supplemental material to augment the criteria in ASAM PPC -2 but may not identify such material as ASAM criteria. 2. Wraparound or Ancillary Services Individuals with mental or addictive disorders served in the public sector often require a wide range of social and rehabilitative support services, commonly referred to as wraparound or ancillary services (see Exhibit III -1), and it is critical to address these services in the RFP and contract for managed care. Ensuring the availability of transportation, child care, employment -related services, and other ancillary services is challenging because such services are usually not funded as h ealth care services; such services generally are funded, managed, and under the jurisdiction of several agencies in different government departments, a situation that can result in significant barriers to access. The purchaser should analyze the current s ystems of care to determine how existing wraparound services can be accessed and how the managed care initiative can be used to improve service access and coordination. In Medicaid initiatives, the purchaser may consider establishing contractual arrangemen ts with wraparound service providers and paying for some of these services with the Medicaid optional services called rehabilitation services and targeted case management. Consumers' complex service needs can be very challenging (see case example in box), and the purchaser must carefully consider the optimal arrangements for meeting these needs. Many questions must be answered: Will the most frequently required wraparound services be included in the RFP? Is there sufficient funding to support these service s? Is the MCO responsible for providing case management to help enrollees gain access to needed services? If so, is this cost included in the payment to the MCO? The overriding question is whether well -conceptualized and well-written contracts, combined wi th strong financial incentives and an MCO's capacity to track and manage services, can create the foundation necessary to successfully coordinate needed services and eliminate fragmentation. Exhibit III -1. Ancillary Social and Rehabilitative Support (or \"Wraparound\") Services Ancillary social and rehabilitative support services for individuals with substance abuse or mental health disorders are often referred to as \"wraparound services.\" The appropriate m ix of wraparound services for an individual should be individually determined as part of the individual's treatment plan. The services listed below are commonly regarded as wraparound services. Transportation Child care Assistance with housing (e.g., Section 8 rental subsidies) Vocational training, job counseling, and other employment -related services Primary health care, with screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculo sis, and other infectious diseases Educational support services Legal consultation and counseling services (e.g., custody, landlord rights, divorce disputes, etc.) Financial counseling and/or assistance Domestic violence support services Nutrition education Parenting courses and training Child/adolescent support services: - After school programs - Teen centers - Mentoring programs - Recreational programs - Arts and cultural enhancement Although some of these services may be covered by hea lth care plans, more often they are funded in other ways. The purchaser may use the opportunities inherent in managed care initiatives to lower interagency barriers or to broaden its definition of health care and include financing for selected wraparound services in the managed care plan. In most States, experienced community -based providers are well positioned to provide wraparound services because they have been serving this population for years and have develope d coordination mechanisms to overcome interagency barriers. This is particularly true in rural areas where substance abuse treatment agencies and mental health programs are often in the same or adjacent facilities. Wraparound Services: Case Example To understand the potential impact of wraparound services on outcomes, consider a young woman seeking treatment who is dependent on cocaine and alcohol and intermittently suicidal. She is a high school dropout with two preschool children. She has no adaptive s upport system, is in a violently abusive relationship, has no transportation, and is facing drug -related criminal charges. Treatment provided without consideration of her circumstances is unlikely to be successful. A comprehensive treatment plan would need to address her multiple needs to support her mental health and/or substance abuse treatment. For instance, arranging for transportation and child care services would enable her to continue in dual diagnosis treatment, and domestic violence support service s would help her address her abusive relationship. To achieve an optimal outcome for her and her children, she may also need legal aid to represent her in court, parenting training to help her build skills as a mother, housing in a \"clean and sober\" enviro nment, educational services to assist her in obtaining a GED, job placement services, and primary health care services for her and her children. If the purchaser desires this level of coordination and comprehensiveness, the RFP and contract should clearly address expectations in terms of process, desired outcomes, and the means by which these will be monitored. Wraparound Services. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Identify wraparound services to be financed within the benefit package. Establish expected utilization rates for wraparound services and the means for monitoring this utilization. Specify who is responsible for financing the cost of these services. Direct the MCO to develop a plan for purchaser review and approval to improve and coordinate access to wraparound services. Specify wraparound services to which the MCO should systematically build access. Identify specific agenc ies, government departments, and other relevant organizations with which the MCO should coordinate services. Direct the MCO to develop detailed memoranda of understanding, in active collaboration with the purchaser and with purchaser -specified agencies reg arding wraparound services. Describe network providers' responsibilities for providing and/or referring to wraparound services. Describe systems to monitor, measure, and evaluate successful access to and coordination of these services. C. Defining and Oper ationalizing Medical Necessity The determination of medical necessity is the process by which a specific service is judged to be necessary in the clinical care of a patient. Services judged necessary are eligible for reimbursement by the payer. Such determ inations often have a subjective component, and differences in interpretation of this concept can be conceptualized along a continuum. At one end is a strict biological interpretation of medical necessity that excludes most psychosocial factors from consid eration and does not recognize several prevention, remediation, rehabilitation, and recovery service needs. At the other end, psychosocial factors are seen as essential considerations in determining whether a service is necessary. For a discussion of issue s related to medical necessity in managed mental health services, see Ford (1998). 1. Importance of Defining Medical Necessity for Public Sector Populations Purchasers of managed behavioral health care for public sector populations with needs for multiple types of services must understand the importance of the concept of medical necessity and thoughtfully integrate this understanding into the RFP and managed care contract. How the contract addresses medical necessity and clarifies the application of this c oncept in clinical decisionmaking will have a profound impact on access to and quality of treatment. In addition, any ambiguity in the contractual definition of medical necessity can leave the purchaser clinically and financially liable for certain types o f care. Clinically inappropriate interpretations of medical necessity driven by purchaser imprecision in contract language, insufficient understanding of enrollee needs, or a need to achieve short - term cost savings have sometimes led to unsound restriction s on access to substance abuse and mental health services and a fragmented and incomplete approach to client care. In past contracts for managed care, most States and counties have provided only basic descriptions of what they consider to be medically nece ssary services, using language modeled on private contracts for managed behavioral health care. This approach grants MCOs considerable discretion in determining when a covered service will be deemed appropriate for a particular individual. Purchasers who w ish to more clearly influence how medical necessity is operationalized can use the RFP and contract to specify who may make medical necessity determinations, the basis for making determinations, the role of scientific evidence, public and proprietary clini cal practice protocols, the relevance of the provider's clinical judgment, and the extent of retention of judgment permitted to the MCO. An emerging approach is to adopt a broad description of medical necessity, drawing from existing State and/or county rules about when a publicly funded service is reimbursable. This approach helps ensure that an MCO will not limit access by using a strict biological interpretation of medical necessity (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1997; CSAT, 1995c). In a few Stat es, some MCOs view court -ordered services as not medically necessary. The contract should address the process to be followed when an MCO is ordered by the court to provide treatment that the MCO believes is inappropriate. Medical Necessity and the Court s Medical necessity determinations and utilization management (UM) policies that emphasize cost cutting over quality of care can severely restrict needed services and, occasionally, lead to tragic outcomes. Much criticism has been leveled at how MCOs make medical necessity determinations, which are seen as overly restrictive. Over the past three decades, several lawsuits have been presented to the courts to make decisions about the appropriateness of medical necessity determination (AHCPR, 1995; Bergthold, 1995). In a study of such cases, Sage (1995) found that consumers prevailed about 60 percent of the time, while insurers prevailed 40 percent of the time. Analysis of these cases suggested that medical necessity criteria developed with meaningful public, consumer, and provider input and using \"well -developed decisionmaking processes\" can help purchasers ensure that coverage decisions are not seen as \"arbitrary\" and thus leave them legally vulnerable (AHCPR, 1995). Courts were found generally to uphold medical necessity determinations if the MCO had a carefully thought -out definition of medical necessity, explained it to the consumer, had several levels of internal appeals, followed the appeals process carefully, and gave consumers th e opportunity to participate in the development and refinement of the managed care initiative. 2. Evidentiary Issues in Medical Necessity Decisionmaking Evidentiary issues are a central aspect of medical necessity decisionmaking. Traditionally, review of the appropriateness of medical coverage has included consideration of accepted standards of medical practice, other evidence of usual and customary practice, and the recommendations of a patient's treating health professional. The use of evidence from c ontrolled randomized clinical trials has been considered relevant in determining whether to move a specific treatment from experimental to accepted practice status, but such evidence has traditionally played very little role in medical necessity determinat ions (in part because few medical treatments have been evaluated for efficacy in randomized clinical trials). However, in recent years, leaders in the managed care industry have increasingly promoted a concept known as \"evidence -based medical necessity.\" S ee Eddy (1994, 1996) for further discussion. a. The Concept of Evidence -Based Medical Necessity Determinations The concept of evidence -based necessity determinations was developed in response to mounting evidence of widespread and potentially unjustifiable variation in medical practices. In evidence -based medical necessity determinations, no weight is given to informal clinical experience, the standards of health professionals, and the opinion of an individual's treating physician. Instead, the decisionmake r relies on evidence gleaned from controlled randomized clinical trials, with coverage based on quantitative evidence of efficacy resulting from the trials. Despite the appeal of making decisions on the basis of evidence -based medical necessity, the relate d issues are quite complex and can be troublesome upon closer examination. Even when the task at hand is to determine whether a certain practice is experimental or accepted, courts have frowned on a decisionmaker's relying solely on quantitative data, part icularly when the coverage agreement itself calls for consideration of existing community practice standards in determining the extent of coverage.(4) When the coverage at issue involves a customarily accepted procedure, application of evidence -based decisionmaking effectively would result in denial of benefits. Because there are so few data on which to base coverage determinations, it is possible that applicatio n of evidence - based decisionmaking would in fact eliminate coverage for most care and services. At some point, the test, if unjustifiable because of the absence of quantitative data, might be considered unreasonable under the Medicaid coverage standards de scribed later in this chapter. b. An Evidence -Based Medical Necessity Test in a Contract At least one State --Nebraska --has specifically incorporated evidence -based tests of medical necessity in its Medicaid managed care contract (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). T he portions of the contract highlighted in bold below (items 3 and 7) are references to evidence -based tests of medical necessity: The term \"medical necessity\" and \"medically necessary\" with reference to a covered servic e means health care services and supplies which are medically appropriate and (1) necessary to meet the basic health needs of the client; (2) rendered in the most cost effective manner and type of setting appropriate for the delivery of the covered service s;(3) consistent in type, frequency and duration of treatment with scientifically based guidelines or national medical, research or health coverage organizations or governmental agencies; (4) consistent with the diagnosis of the condition; (5) required for reasons other than the convenience of the client of his or her physician; (6) no more restrictive than necessary to provide a proper balance of safety, effectiveness, and efficiency; (7) of demonstrated value; and (8) a no more intense level of services th an can be safely provided. The fact that the physician has performed or prescribed a procedure or treatment or the fact that it may be the only treatment for a particular injury, sickness or mental illness does not mean that it is medically necessary. The Nebraska medical necessity standard cited above applies to all requests for coverage; it is not restricted to cases in which the decisionmaker is called on to decide whether the treatment in question is experimental. Moreover, under the Nebraska standard, a party claiming that a service is medically necessary is effectively required to offer evidence from national organizations or agencies that the sought -after service is consistent with the work of national agencies and is of demonstrated value. The decisi onmaker also is free to disregard the opinion of the treating physician. The Nebraska contract is unique because it expressly incorporates an evidence -based medical necessity test. However, such tests may be used increasingly by MCOs. Because the legality of an evidence -based medical necessity in a Medicaid context has not yet been measured, permitting its use either expressly or through silence on the matter may create an unanticipated liability on the part of the State in the event that the test is found to violate Medicaid reasonableness rules. For instance, since there is very little quantitative evidence where medical care is concerned, it is possible that a court might invalidate the approach as an unattainable standard of proof. To the extent that a State does decide to permit use of the test under at least some circumstances (e.g., when the service in question is considered experimental, or for certain services that are of high cost and marginal utility), the State may want to retain the authority, a s discussed above, to override specific coverage decisions under its own evidentiary test. Moreover, the State may want to provide that regardless of the test used by the company, any administrative or judicial decision ordering a State to provide coverage will also bind the MCO to the extent that the service at issue falls into one of the coverage listings in the contract. 3. Drafting Medical Necessity Contract Provisions In drafting medical necessity provisions of a managed care contract, purchasers will have to address the following critical questions: Will the MCO be required to use the purchaser's existing standard of coverage for determining medical necessity or some other standard developed by the S tate for the contract? Will the purchaser retain the right to reverse the MCO's determination when review under its own standards finds that the service is necessary? What evidence will the MCO be required to consider, and what process will it be required to follow, in making coverage determinations? Will the MCO be bound to pay for contract services that are determined to be covered by a court in a judicial proceeding? These issues are discussed in the sections below. a. The Standard of Coverage A State ma y elect to require the MCO to apply specified definitions of medical necessity. For example, the California contract incorporates into the agreement the State's relatively strict existing standard of medical necessity, which has been upheld in the case of adult services in Medicaid litigation (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). The California standard is as follows: Medically necessary means reasonable and necessary services to protect life, prevent significant illness or significa nt disability, or to alleviate severe pain through the diagnosis or treatment of disease, illness or injury. Alternatively, a State could elect to direct the MCO to follow more comprehensive practice guidelines and treatment protocols that have been develo ped to guide the conduct of health care professionals in specific areas of practice. Assuming that the benefits that are needed to institute such programs are covered under the State's contract, these protocols and guidelines might be considered as specifi cations regarding the treatment of persons with these conditions. The Federal Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program provides for coverage of preventive services to children covered by Medicaid. The EPSDT program also specif ically provides for coverage to \"ameliorate\" an illness or condition. Pennsylvania's 1996 RFP contains a comprehensive definition of medical necessity that would satisfy the Medicaid reasonableness test for both children and adults (Rosenbaum et al., 1997) . Following the language of the EPSDT program closely, the Pennsylvania RFP stipulates that one of the following standards must be met: The service or benefit is reasonably expected to prevent the onset of an illness, con dition, or disability. The service or benefit will, or is reasonably expected to, reduce or ameliorate the physical, mental, or developmental effects of an illness, condition, injury or disability. The service or benefit will assist the individual to achie ve or maintain maximum functional capacity in performing daily activities, taking into account both the functional capacity of the individual and those functional capacities that are appropriate for individuals of the same age. b. Purchaser Authority To Re view the MCO's Determinations When a purchaser has particular concerns about an MCO's coverage of certain benefits, one approach may be to provide in the contract as follows: The agency reserves the right to review Contr actor's coverage determinations with respect to the services and items which, under the State's interpretation of this agreement, are enumerated under this contract; and furthermore, to require that the Contractor provide coverage in those instances in whi ch, in the opinion of the State, coverage is medically necessary in accordance with standards and procedures used by the State. This type of provision is common in MCO contracts. While presumably such a provision is used somewhat sparingly, it serves as an important \"backstop\" for the coverage determination process. c. Evidence and Processes in Making Determinations In making a medical necessity determination, the decisionmaker considers certain evidence and uses certain procedures. Such procedures and thei r timelines can be highly important. For example, an MCO might require prospective or concurrent review of services furnished outside the scope of normal clinical activities. In certain instances, however, the use of prior authorization is expressly prohib ited by Federal law. For example, MCOs cannot subject emergency services to prior authorization requirements, and State Medicaid agencies (and therefore their contractors) cannot require prior authorization for EPSDT periodic or as -needed screens for child ren. Furthermore, the Medicaid statute contains certain rules regarding limitations on coverage of drugs. States may use prior authorization for outpatient drugs but only if the prior authorization system is able to provide for a 24 -hour response by teleph one or telecommunication device. Moreover, with the exception of certain drugs enumerated in the Medicaid statute, the agency must provide for \"the dispensing of at least a 72 -hour supply of a covered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation\" (42 U.S.C. 1396r -8(d)(5)). To ensure compliance with these requirements, contracts should identify instances in which prior authorization cannot be used or where interim services (as in the case of prescribed drugs) must be made available. d. Coverage i n the Event of Administrative or Judicial Order A State may want to protect itself in the event that an MCO makes a medical necessity determination that denies coverage for a class of service listed in the contract and either a court or an administrative a gency rules that the service is required to be covered under Federal law or the State plan. The State might consider inserting the following clause into the contract: In the event that the State is ordered by a court or an administrative agency to cover a service which, under the State's interpretation of this agreement, falls within one or more classes of services or items covered under this agreement, Contractor shall be responsible for payment for such service under su ch terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the court or agency. Drafting Medical Necessity Contract Provisions. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Ensure that all terms in the definition of medical necessity are operationally precise to avoid any ambiguities in the interpretation by the MCO. Ensure that the definition provides clear direction to the MCO regarding utilization review policies and proce dures, including the procedures for members to file grievances and appeals. Establish that medical necessity determinations should include consideration of psychosocial factors. Ensure that medical necessity definitions and criteria in the prime contract are included in subcontracts with network providers. Establish the purpose of providing particular services (e.g., assess, diagnose, treat symptoms; prevent progression; rehabilitate; promote recovery) and its relationship to medical necessity determinatio ns. Establish standards for service delivery (i.e., need for an individualized service plan, consumer involvement in treatment planning, consumer choice of service, cultural relevance, least restrictive setting, continuity of care, confidentiality, consist ency with national standards of practice, referrals to other appropriate agencies, etc.). Ensure that services accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities (physical and mental) in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Proceed cautious ly in establishing requirements for demonstrated effectiveness or cost effectiveness. Reference external criteria, such as formal patient placement criteria, for establishing medical necessity standards. Ensure that medical necessity criteria and definiti ons of services for children and adolescents are age appropriate, given the many different factors related to providing care to children (i.e., role of the family, developmental stages and rapid changes as children age, need for parental or guardian consen t for treatment, different goals for treatment, greater need for early intervention and prevention of future disability, etc.). Ensure that medical necessity criteria take into account exceptions to regulations on access, such as dangerous disease clauses for teenagers interested in obtaining certain types of medical and mental health support services without parental or guardian consent. Ensure that the final step in the clinical appeals process is a review by the purchaser (or delegated State or county ag ency) so that any inappropriate decisionmaking processes can be understood and addressed directly (rather than only through subsequent policy changes or contract revisions). 4. Processes for Operationalizing Medical Necessity: Utilization Management and Cl inical Practice Guidelines Even when a purchaser of behavioral managed care services provides clear definition and guidance regarding medical necessity in the contract, the interpretation of this definition in daily practice is ultimately what determines t he services received by enrollees. Two fundamental processes by which medical necessity is interpreted and operationalized --utilization management (UM) and clinical practice guidelines --are discussed below. a. Utilization Management (UM) UM is the means by which an MCO monitors and manages service utilization by enrollees. Utilization patterns can be managed in several different ways. The most common UM methods include: (1) using utilization review staff to monitor the appropriateness of admission into part icular levels of care and the duration of treatment at that level of care; (2) delegating UM to network providers; and (3) using a database of profiles of network providers describing their patterns of delivering care. It should be noted that the UM proces s in public sector managed care differs from the UM process as defined in commercial managed care contracts. Public sector UM typically includes some case management services in addition to field or provider -based case managers whose job it is to improve t he delivery system. In the commercial sector, UM generally relies on the consumer's calling the MCO for authorizations of care; in the public sector, however, authorization for care is typically pursued by a provider on behalf of a consumer who is too impa ired to pursue authorization. Public purchasers can use the contract to influence UM functions. For example, they may wish to contractually address the qualifications of utilization reviewers, their supervision and the qualifications of the supervisor, an d the range of their authority (e.g., a physician may be required to deny authorization). Purchasers of managed care services may want to encourage, mandate, or reserve approval rights for the MCO's use of patient placement criteria and clinical practice g uidelines. Such guidelines are, in effect, the operational definitions of medical necessity on which assessment, placement, and treatment decisions are based. A purchaser may require the MCO and network providers to adhere to purchaser -approved sets of gui delines and to be capable of producing auditable trails of data used in making individual UM decisions. Such data can form the basis for measuring performance and outcomes. b. Clinical Practice Guidelines Clinical practice guidelines, sometimes referred to as practice or treatment protocols, provide systematic recommendations for treating specific health disorders, with the goal of standardizing treatment and increasing the likelihood of good outcomes. Purchasers and MCOs often require providers to adhere to specific guidelines that they believe to be consistent with their medical necessity practices. These guidelines are usually based on some combination of current research findings and expert opinion. For example, the American Psychiatric Association has recently begun to publish a series of clinical practice guidelines, including those for substance use disorders, depression, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. The Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Hea lth Services Administration (SAMHSA) has developed a series of Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) to facilitate the transfer of state -of-the-art guidelines for the treatment of alcohol and other drug abuse from acknowledged clinical, research, and admi nistrative experts. Using a Federal resource panel to review the state -of-the-art in treatment and program management, recommendations from this panel are sent to a second non -Federal consensus panel of experts. A chair for the panel is appointed and is re sponsible for ensuring that the resulting protocols reflect true group consensus. This group meets and makes recommendations, defines protocols, and arrives at agreement on protocols. These recommendations are then reviewed by a third group whose members s erve as expert field reviewers. Once their recommendations and responses have been reviewed, the chair approves the document for publication. CSAT has published over 25 TIPs on topics ranging from State methadone treatment guidelines to treatment for HIV -infected alcohol and other drug abusers. These TIPs may be ordered by contacting the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at (800) 729 -6686 ( www.health.org/ ) or for TDD, (800) 847 the National Library of Medicine ( http://tex t.nlm.nih.gov/ ); or through the CSAT Treatment Information Exchange forum ( www.samhsa.gov/csat/ ). Some MCOs have also developed practice guidelines that are specific to the diagnostic categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Stat istical Manual , 4th edition (DSM -IV). Operationalizing Medical Necessity. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the process by which the purchaser will monitor the MCO's implementatio n of medical necessity. Require the MCO to solicit the input of providers and consumers and their families when developing and refining utilization management (UM) guidelines. Require that the MCO's guidelines be published and available for public review a nd comment. Require purchaser approval of UM guidelines. Require the development of written policies and procedures governing all aspects of the UM process and require that the UM agent maintain and make available a written description of these procedures to enrollees and providers. Establish guidelines regarding any restrictions on financial incentives to the UM agent to deny or curtail approvals for services. Require that guidelines be developed and used for screening and diagnosis, remediation, treatment, and rehabilitation for children eligible for the EPSDT program under Medicaid and that the guidelines also address long -term care issues for children, including access to medications. Require the provision of rehabilitation and supp ortive services for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses, chronic substance use disorders, and co -occurring mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Establish the right of the purchaser to audit performance and to ensure that guideline s and UM criteria are being used appropriately. Ensure that UM procedures are individualized to consumers' needs and are not allowed to create de facto limits on lengths of any specific treatments (for managed care systems without formal upper limits on specified services imposed by the payer). Require sufficient provision of training in the use of the UM guidelines to UM clinicians, providers, designated representatives, government officials, consumer representatives, primary care representatives, and spec ified others. Establish minimum requirements for UM staff in terms of education, professional experience, training, and/or relevant life experiences. Require that the UM guidelines be consistent with other purchaser -specified guidelines. Require that the g uidelines for placement or discharge reflect an understanding of conditions relevant to public sector populations, including homelessness, inadequate or pathological family/social support systems, and coexisting medical conditions. Specify whether the MCO' s UM program must be accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or the Utilization Review Accreditation Committee (URAC). D. Funding Streams and Their Impact on Coverage Funds from a variety of Federal and other sources (see Exhibit III-2) can be used to purchase and/or support substance abuse and mental health services for adults and children. There are requirements attached to each source of funds that can have a significant impact on the services that can be purchased. When a publi c purchaser contracts with an MCO to deliver managed behavioral health care services using funds from one of these sources, it may delegate responsibility for complying with all relevant requirements to the MCO. For that reason, it is essential that purcha sers understand the requirements attached to various funding streams. Most current managed care initiatives in the public sector use Medicaid funds; and Medicaid managed care purchasing is governed by detailed Federal statutory and regulatory requirements. Increasingly, however, Federal CMHS and SAPT Block Grants are being used to fund managed behavioral health care services.(5) The statutes and regulations governing Medicaid impose very different duties on States and create dramatically different rights and expectations in the individuals who are assisted than do the statutes and regulations governing the two block grant programs. Whenever a State or county agency enters into a service agreement with a private company to perform Federal statutory duties, it retains the duty to adhere to Federal law. Thus, a State agency must ensure that any MCO with which it contracts performs the agency's duties under each program in a manner consistent with Federal legal requirements. Exhibit III -2. Sources of Funds That May Be Used To Purchase Public Behavioral Health Services Medicaid Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant Medicare Research -based de monstration grants for secondary prevention from Federal agencies that include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, the National Institute of Mental He alth, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, and the Center for Mental Health Services Child -welfare -related funding - Title IV -E, IV -B, and IV -A - Special education funding through the Individuals With Disabil ities Education Act - Juvenile justice and corrections funding such as the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Community Block Grant Early intervention funding under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and from the Maternal an d Child Health Bureau Housing and Urban Development rental assistance and housing development programs Rehabilitation Services Administration funding for State vocational rehabilitation programs State general revenues State Medicaid matching funds County a nd local contributions; for example, special appropriations for public substance abuse and mental health services such as mil taxes (common in counties); and sales taxes on tobacco or alcohol (California) Agency matches State funding for behavioral health services Charitable contributions The statutes and regulations governing funding streams have a great deal of influence on the day -to-day operations of MCOs and services provided. Recent statutory changes have radically reshaped the way that government programs pay for and deliver health and human services; these changes will have a significant impact on the design and implementation of managed care initiatives in the public sector. Thus, for example, purchasers of behavioral health services must consider new Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility issues that have resulted from welfare reform because they affect eligibility for Medicaid services. They also must consider reforms that introduced the possibility of contracting with for -profit organizations to deliver children's residential treatment services. In States that use Federal Medicaid funds and the SAPT and CMHS Block Grants to purchase managed care, an enrollee may move from Medicaid sponsorship to sponsorship under one or both block grant programs over the course of a single period of enrollment. (Medicaid coverage is quite unstable; in the absence of \"bridge\" financing, a member will be involuntarily disenrolled following th e loss of Medicaid.) Moreover, an individual's coverage may be financed by more than one sponsor; for example, SAPT Block Grant funds may be used to finance the portion of the premium that covers services not allowable under Medicaid, such as services to r esidents of IMDs. It is important to note that purchasers of managed care services paid for from pooled funding should carefully research the legal obligations entailed in delegating full control and/or risk to a private entity for discrete types of publi c sector services. Some regulations restrict the role of private entities in the administration of certain Federal programs, like child welfare. When possible, purchasers may want to consider the desirability of applying for waivers or modifying State Medi caid plans to lift these restrictions. Purchasers also must be aware of the funding ramifications that exist under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Children with an Individualized Education Plan under this act are entitled to a full spectru m of community -based services to help them attain their academic potential. Other relevant regulations for children, such as permanency planning, generally support managed care principles in that they encourage short lengths of stay in out-of-home placemen ts. Avoidance of institutional care is a priority, and there is emphasis on family strengthening, family reunification, and community -based, family -driven service delivery. 1. Medicaid Medicaid is a Federal entitlement program authorized by Title XIX of t he Social Security Act and operated by participating State and territorial governments that provides medical benefits for eligible aged, blind, disabled, and low-income persons. Subject to broad Federal guidelines, States determine who is eligible, benefit s covered, rates of payment for providers, and methods of administering the program. The costs of the Medicaid program are shared by the Federal Government and the States. It is important to note that Medicaid is always the payer of last resort. Medicaid, insurance coverage, and other funding are to complement/supplement Medicaid payment. These other sources of funds for which a Medicaid recipient is eligible must discharge liability before a claim for payment will be accepted by Medicaid. a. Medicaid Coverage Requirements States are required by Federal law and regulations to provide Medicaid beneficiaries coverage for specified services. Minimum coverage requirements vary depending on whether a beneficiary is \"categorically needy\" (i.e., qu alifies for Medicaid because he or she meets certain income and other requirements) or \"medically needy\" (i.e., qualifies for Medicaid because he or she meets certain medical requirements) (42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(10)). The discussion here focuses on required coverage for categorically needy Medicaid beneficiaries, who constitute the bulk of Medicaid managed care enrollees. (Most medically needy Medicaid beneficiaries use the program as a catastrophic coverage program for long -term care.) Mandatory Medicaid se rvices for categorically needy beneficiaries are identified in Exhibit III -3A; Medicaid services that States may cover at their option are identified in Exhibit III -3B. The Medicaid law requires that the amount, duration, and scope of a service be sufficie nt to achieve its stated purpose. If Medicaid funds are used for managed care, this standard requires the explicit delegation of this responsibility to the MCO. If the State does not explicitly delegate this responsibility, it may unknowingly retain residu al clinical and financial liability --and enrollees may not get services to which they are entitled.

These may be provided in any setting, including homes, schools, clinics, and/or group homes. May be used to p rovide a broad range of SA/MH services, including individual, group, and family counseling; physician services; medication management; and emergency/crisis services from a wide variety of agencies and clinics. May be used to provide services in IMDs f or children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances who require acute inpatient care to ensure their safety and/or address serious SA/MH problems. May be used to purchase services of other health care professionals, such as psychological testing or psychiatric social work services. May be used to provide psychotropic medications, methadone/LAAM, and other prescription drugs used in the somatic treatment of behavioral health disorders. May be used to provide case management service s to assist enrollees in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services that are called for in the treatment plan. May be targeted to high -risk geographic areas and population groups. May be used to provide services for indi viduals who require this type of support, such as those suffering from severe psychiatric disorders or those debilitated by HIV/AIDS. Certain services are particularly complex, because although they are described as a single benefit, they are actually a \"bundled benefit,\" each component of which is a service requirement. Examples are Medicaid's mandatory EPSDT benefit for children under 21 and mandatory services provided by federally qualified health cent ers and the rural health clinics (see Exhibit III -4). Both of these benefits have direct implications for children and adults with mental illness and addictive disorders. Exhibit III -4. Mandatory Services Under Medicaid's EPSDT Program for Children and Services Provided by Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics Mandatory Services Under Medicaid's EPSDT Program for Children (42 U.S.C. \u00a71396d(r)) Periodic and as -needed screening services, including a comprehensive health and developmental history; a comprehensive unclothed physical examination; appropriate immunizations according to the Federal schedule establishe d by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); laboratory tests, including testing for elevated blood lead levels; and health education, including anticipatory guidance Vision care, including periodic and as -needed exams, diagnosis, and treatm ent, and eyeglasses Dental care to relieve pain and infections, restore teeth, and maintain dental health Hearing services, including periodic and as -needed exams, diagnosis, and treatment (including hearing aids) All medically necessary health care, di agnosis, services, treatment, and other measures described in 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396d(a)) to \"correct or ameliorate physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services,\" whether or not such services are covered under the State plan Mandatory Services Provided by Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics (42 U.S.C. \u00a71395x(aa)) Physicians' services and services and supplies incident to a physician's services Services furnished by physician assistants or nurse practitioners, clinical social workers, and clinical psychologists Home health and intermittent nursing care in areas designated as having a shortage of such services The rules that apply to Medicaid coverage make the transition to managed care particularly challenging. Medicaid is a third-party financing program; it is not an insurance program, nor does it operate by insurance rules. When purchasing Medicaid managed care, however, State Medicaid agencies use their funds to buy coverage from MCOs that, in the absence of regulatory or contractual modifications, operate according to standard and somewhat restrictive insurance principles rather than the broader and deepe r coverage rules that govern Medicaid. Because States retain full residual liability for all Federal administrative and coverage obligations, their choice is either to require MCOs to carry out these obligations as required under law or to retain a signif icant level of residual and direct responsibility for covered care and services. States and counties throughout the country are struggling with these issues. Moreover, contracts that are unclear or ambiguous about the allocation of responsibilities can lea d not only to less coverage for enrollees, but also to an unanticipated level of direct responsibility on the part of the State for benefits that are covered under the State plan but that inadvertently are not addressed in the contract (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). b. Definition of Emergency Services The State of Florida has attempted in its mental health contract to develop a specific definition of emergency tailored to individuals with serious mental illness (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): Emergency mental health services are those services required to meet the needs of an individual who is experiencing an acute crisis which is at a level of severity that would meet the requirements for involuntary hospital ization pursuant to [Florida law] and who, in the absence of a suitable alternative, would require hospitalization. Note that regardless of the definition, in the case of a particular individual, it is the MCO that decides what meets the definition. The MC O's decision about this is a coverage determination and thus triggers both HMO grievance and Medicaid fair hearing provisions.(6) In deciding coverage cases, courts look to t he Federal definition of services to gauge whether a limitation is reasonable. Therefore, it is important for purchasers to incorporate applicable Federal definitions into their contract with an MCO so that, in the event of a coverage dispute, the MCO's li ability will be coextensive with that of the State and the State can seek recovery in the event that it is ordered to pay for a service. c. Medicaid's Test of Reasonableness Under Federal law, States are prohibited from using Federal Medicaid funds to pay for \"medically unnecessary\" care (42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)). Federal regulations do not define what is medically unnecessary, although they do place certain limitations on a State's discretion to establish its own version of medical necessity standards in e stablishing benefits. The regulations apply to the definition of medical necessity for a specific benefit and is not applicable to a medical necessity determination of an individual enrollee. The regulations establish a test of \"reasonableness\" for Medicai d coverage, with reasonableness defined in direct relation to the purpose of the benefit for which coverage is sought. The regulations provide as follows: Each [covered] service must be sufficient in amount, duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose; . . . The Medicaid agency may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration or scope of a required service because of the diagnosis, type of illness or condition (42 C.F.R. \u00a7440.230 (1997)). As can be see n, the regulations also prohibit the use of coverage limitations that would result in discrimination in the provision of care on the basis of a condition. Medicaid does not permit the types of distinctions between recoverable illness and nonrecoverable chr onic conditions that are a traditional part of insurance theory and practice. In its structure and operation, Medicaid is meant to function as a program not only for healthy low -income persons but also for persons who have chronic disabilities. Therefore, the rules that govern private insurance decisionmaking have only limited application to Medicaid. Thus, for example, a State Medicaid agency cannot deny the services of a nursing facility to an infant after surgery for a severe congenital condition from w hich a full recovery might never occur, while permitting such coverage for a 50 -year-old recovering from a stroke. Medicaid's unique approach to coverage is particularly notable in the case of children. Over 30 years, Medicaid's test of reasonableness has been interpreted by courts to require a preventive standard of coverage in the case of children entitled to benefits under the EPSDT. Because the purpose of EPSDT is to finance early diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental conditions before they bec ome serious, limitations that restrict coverage to cases of severe or extreme necessity have been ruled unlawful in the case of children (Rosenblatt, Law, and Rosenbaum, 1997). For example, restricting dental care except in emergency situations or providin g medical benefits only when an individual is severely ill is unlawful. Consequently, coverage limitations that would be permissible in the case of adults are not permissible for children if the result is to reduce medical assistance to a level that would defeat the preventive purpose of the EPSDT benefit. Finally, courts have ruled that at least in the case of adults, the Medicaid program's medical necessity test of reasonableness permits the imposition of across -the-board limitations on coverage of benefi ts as long as the resulting benefit is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the great majority of recipients. Thus, for example, limiting physician visits to three per month except in emergency situations has been upheld, as have across -the-board limitations on inpatient hospital coverage (Rosenblatt, Law, and Rosenbaum, 1997). However, such across -the-board limitations are not allowed in the case of children, who are entitled to all services determined to be medically necessary regardless of limits that othe rwise would apply to adults (42 U.S.C. \u00a71396d(r)). d. Issues in Medicaid Coverage To meet the challenges raised by the coverage provisions of the Federal Medicaid statute, a State must address several issues. Each of the issues listed below is discussed in the following sections. Classes of covered services. The State must decide which classes of covered services will be included in the contract and which will remain the direct responsibility of the State agency. The amount, duration, and scope of contract services. The State must decide what across -the-board limits are permitted on covered classes of services, particularly those services for which such across -the- board limits are impermissible under Federal law an d for which the State therefore would retain residual coverage responsibility. Service definitions. To guard against unanticipated residual responsibilities, the State must ensure that the coverage definitions used in the contract (or by the MCO) are cons istent with the definitions that exist under Federal Medicaid law. Medical necessity. The State must consider the definition of medical necessity used by the MCO in order to determine whether the definition will or could create unanticipated residual resp onsibilities for the State because of Medicaid requirements. If it does, the State must decide the extent to which it wants to modify the MCO's definition or retain the authority to override certain coverage determinations by the MCO. Limitations and excl usions. The State must consider whether the limitations and exclusions generally used by the MCO can or could result in the exclusion of services that are covered under Federal Medicaid law and, if so, whether to override them in the contract. Conversely, the State must ensure that the MCO honors the exclusions that exist in the Medicaid statute, such as the IMD exclusion. Classes of covered services. In developing a contract for Medicaid enrollees, a State must decide which of the classes of covered servi ces included in its plan will also be included in its contracts. When a single service in the State plan is in fact a bundled service, care must be taken to distinguish which elements of the bundled service will be included in the contract and which will b e left as the direct responsibility of the State. The EPSDT benefit is a particularly good example of a benefit that includes numerous service subcategories. Many State contracts contain significant ambiguities regarding the scope of the MCO's duties, or e lse they appear to leave many covered categories of services uncovered, and thus the responsibility of the State (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). The following is an example of an ambiguous definition of the classes of EPSDT services. This example is taken from a request for information (RFI) issued by the State of Maine (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). The preliminary comprehensive benefit package places a special emphasis on preventive care, including EPSDT services. EPSDT is a federally mandated program of informing/ outreach activities and benefits targeted to Medicaid beneficiaries up to age 21. An effective EPSDT program assures the health problems found are diagnosed and treated early before they become more complex and their treatment more costly. MCOs will be req uired to have written policies and procedures for an EPSDT program. This should include conducting EPSDT screens on all members age 21 to identify health and developmental problems. Under this definition, it is impossible to tell which screening services ( periodic or as needed) are covered. It is also not possible to tell which classes of covered services are covered under the contract other than \"screens\" a term which itself is ambiguous. Nor is it possible to tell which screening elements are required at each screen. On the other hand, the Massachusetts contract contains detailed appendices that list each category of screening (periodic and as needed), diagnostic, and treatment service that is the responsibility of each participating contractor and each re quired element of the EPSDT screen (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). In the treatment of complex conditions such as mental illness or addiction, care should be taken to include every class of service that is covered under the plan and that conceivably could be pa rt of an appropriate treatment regimen. This is not to suggest that services should be covered up to an unlimited level, but only that no essential class of service should be omitted from the contract unless this is the intent of the drafter. Rosenbaum and her colleagues (Rosenbaum, et al. 1997) noted wide variation in the classes of covered services related to the treatment of mental illness and addiction. The variations in coverage include services that are covered in virtually all State plans. The wide v ariation suggests a lack of consensus among States regarding the classes of services that might be used to diagnose, treat, and prevent such conditions. The variation also suggests that States are willing to leave as a direct benefit certain services that are necessary for the treatment of mental and addictive disorders (e.g., prescribed drugs, long -term residential care or inpatient psychiatric care for children with severe mental illness). This variation also leaves it to the MCO industry to determine whe ther certain classes of services (e.g., preventive health services) should be offered to individuals with these conditions. Amount, duration, and scope of covered services. Contracts that permit across -the-board limitations on one or more covered services should clearly identify and describe these limitations. Thus, for example, in the case of nonhospital residential detoxification, the Connecticut Medicaid contract specifies that (Rosenbaum et al ., 1997): Services under the Medicaid program shall be for alcohol dependent individuals and shall be limited to (1) the acute and evaluation phase of the treatment program and (2) a 10 -day period for each occurrence. The Connecticut contract expressly omi ts detoxification for individuals who are dependent on substances other than alcohol. Moreover, the contract limits coverage for persons with alcohol dependency to one short - term treatment per occurrence. To the extent that the State Medicaid plan covers a dditional levels of treatment, payment for such service would be the responsibility of the State. For instance, this additional payment responsibility might arise in the case of alcohol -addicted children, whose treatment would be considered an EPSDT servic e and thus not subject to such across -the-board limits if the resulting limitations reduced coverage below medically necessary levels. Service definitions. As noted, the Federal Medicaid statute and regulations contain numerous examples of service definiti ons. When a contract deviates from Federal law in defining a service, the State retains residual coverage responsibility up to the Federal definition. For example, the District of Columbia's contract defines maternity coverage as follows (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): Prenatal care, examination, tests and education, hospital and delivery services, newborn care, and postpartum care. This definition departs from the Federal definition in its omission of pregnancy -related services. Thus, services for women whose e ligibility is based on their pregnancy could be limited to prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care; the contractor could conceivably eliminate coverage of services to treat an underlying health problem or an addiction. If a State intends to retain such dir ect responsibilities, such an omission makes sense. But when the State has calibrated its premium to the Federal definition, the omission leaves the State vulnerable to additional and unanticipated costs. Medical necessity. As noted, State Medicaid agencie s have had to develop medical necessity standards, because Federal Medicaid funds cannot be used for medically unnecessary services. The issue of medical necessity within Medicaid constitutes one of the most difficult challenges in shaping a Medicaid contr act with an MCO. Insurance approval of reimbursement for services provided is generally based on proven eligibility and demonstrated medical necessity. When medical necessity is inappropriately applied, it can lead to problems of access to and duration of treatment services, access to prevention, remediation, rehabilitation, and chronic care, and to nontraditional services and service providers. The issue of medical necessity is discussed at length earlier in this chapter. Limitations and Exclusions. As not ed, insurance plans traditionally limit or exclude coverage for certain types of services, even when they fall into a covered category of service and are otherwise considered medically necessary. Three important categories of such services for individuals with mental illness or addictive disorders are court -ordered care, services provided in schools, and services provided in accordance with a written plan of treatment prepared by a child welfare agency, an early intervention agency, or another agency with a legal obligation to provide or arrange for services. States vary widely in their approaches with respect to coverage of these services, with some electing (either intentionally or as a result of failing to override the industry practice) to retain a direc t obligation to pay for the service, and others providing for coverage by the MCO. In the case of members enrolled in multiple treatment systems, contracts should reflect the State's express decisions regarding whether to require the MCO to provide service s that are enumerated in the contract and that are found to be necessary by another agency. The contract language should delineate for the contractor: (a) the extent to which the contractor will be required to cover a particular service or a service furnis hed in a particular setting, (b) the right of the contractor to exclude certain services; and (c) the extent to which the contractor is bound by the opinion of the agency ordering provision of the service. For example, it is not enough to merely state that an MCO must cover services specified in an Individualized Education Plan. If the State wishes to make the school district's decision to provide a service legally binding on the MCO, it must specify this in the contract. If, on the other hand, the State si mply wants the MCO to take the other agency's views into account in reaching its coverage determination, then this fact needs to be specified. Delaware has decided to specifically limit the contractor's responsibility for services related to education and early intervention that are covered under the State Medicaid plan (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Delaware's RFP states the following: The MCO will be responsible for: (a) encouraging PCPs [primary care physicians] to participate in multidisciplinary assessmen t teams and coordinating assessments and services with the Department of Health and Social Services; (b) reimbursement of necessary treatments and medically necessary early intervention services identified during the assessment process and approved by the child's PCP. The MCO will not be financially responsible for therapy services (PT, OT, SP) included in an Individual Family Service Plan and provided in the public school setting. However, MCOs will be required to coordinate with [the Department]. This pr ovision permits the MCO to limit coverage to services that it (rather than the early intervention agency) approves, and excludes liability altogether for school services, direct payment responsibilities which are retained by the State. (The Medicaid statut e prohibits denial of coverage for services on the grounds that they are included in a child's Individualized Education Plan or Individual Family Service Plan (42 U.S.C. 1396b(e)). Coverage Under Medicaid. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RF Ps and contracts: Ensure that the delegation of Medicaid amount, duration, and scope requirements are clearly delineated. Clarify whether the contractor carries out all Federal administrative and coverage obligations. Ensure that there are no coverage limitations in the contract that would result in discrimination in the provision of care on the basis of a medical condition. Ensure that if coverage limitations appear in the contract they will still be sufficient to meet th e needs of the great majority of recipients. Ensure that any across -the-board limitations are clearly identified and defined. Ensure that there are no across -the-board limitations for children. Ensure that the contract definition of medical necessity does not create unanticipated residual responsibilities for the State. Ensure that MCO exclusions are consistent with Federal Medicaid law. Ensure that the contract includes applicable Federal definitions so that MCO liability is coextensive with that of the St ate. Ensure that contract language reflects the MCO's responsibility to cover services which arise from the actions of third parties. 2. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Block Grants The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -21- 300x -35) and the Federal Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -7-300x -8) programs provide funding to States to support activities related to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of m ental illness and addictive disorders. Unlike Medicaid, these block grants do not establish an entitlement to coverage for eligible persons. The laws specify broadly how the block grant funds are to be used, but they give States considerable latitude in de termining how best to serve the targeted populations. Neither statute prohibits agencies from providing care through Fisk -transfer contracts with for -profit companies. Regardless of whether a State contracts with an MCO for certain benefits or services, State and county substance abuse and mental health agencies are responsible for ensuring that funds are spent in compliance with Federal law. Key provisions of the CMHS and SAPT laws that are relevant to manage d care contracting are outlined below. a. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Much as the CMHS Block Grant does, the SAPT Block Grant law (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -21-300x - 35) has certain minimum service requirements : Not less than 35 percent of the grant can be spent on prevention and treatment activities related to alcohol, and not less than 35 percent on activities related to drugs. Not less than 20 percent can be spent on substan ce abuse education and counseling and other risk reduction services, with priority given to population groups at risk for substance abuse. A minimum portion of a State's Federal allocation must be spent on treatment for pregnant women and women with depend ent children (this provision can be waived in States that can demonstrate that they are providing an adequate level of treatment services as indicated by a comparison of the number of such women seeking services with the available service capacity). The s tatute specifies treatment timelines for individuals requesting treatment for injection drug use; an individual must be admitted to treatment within 14 days after the request, or 120 days in the event that treatment programs funded under the act have reach ed capacity (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -23(a)). In the case of pregnant women, stricter treatment timelines are established, and preference is given to them when facilities have limited capacities (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -27). The statute requires entities receiving funds t o routinely make available tuberculosis services to each individual receiving substance abuse treatment. The term \"tuberculosis services\" means counseling, testing and providing such services (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -24(a)). The statute requires designated States to carry out one or more projects to make available to individuals early intervention services for HIV disease at the sites at which individuals are undergoing treatment for substance abuse. The term \"early intervention services for HIV disease\" refers to appropriate pretest counseling; testing to confirm the presence of HIV; tests to diagnose the extent of the deficiency in the immune system; tests to provide information on appropriate therapeutic measures for preventing and treating conditions arising fro m the disease; and appropriate posttest counseling. The term \"designated States\" refers to States with an AIDS case rate of 10 or more such cases per 100,000 individuals (as reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and P revention for the most recent calendar year for which such data are available). The law exempts a State from having to offer these services through at least one rural site if there is \"insufficient\" demand (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -24(b)). The statute contains thir d-party liability recovery provisions that prohibit payment if payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs or another insurance program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -31(a)). The SAPT Block Grant places several impo rtant limitations on a State's discretion to contract with an MCO for the delivery of services financed in whole or in part with block grant funds. Unlike the CMHS Block Grant (see below), the SAPT statute does not delineate \"qualified providers,\" nor does it mandate an open -door policy. However, the law does provide for minimum service allotments (e.g., for pregnant women). This provision limits a State's ability to use funds to sponsor enrollment of other individuals unless the State can document that oth er funds are available to adequately serve the target population. The SAPT Block Grant has other restrictions. Funds may not be used to pay for inpatient hospital services, to make cash payments to intended recipients of services, to make capital or major equipment improvements, to satisfy non - Federal spending requirements under any other Federal program, or for care and services not authorized under the Ryan White Act. Finally, the SAPT Block Grant also places a 5 percent limitation on a State's use of Fe deral funds for administrative purposes, and these limitations would have to be reflected in the administrative payment components of the premium. Purchasers can review services and activities included in the benefit plan and then make a determination abo ut the components of the SAPT statutes and regulations that are relevant. Several States (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado, Montana, and Maryland) have experience developing RFPs, reviewing contractor proposals, negotiating and awarding contracts, a nd monitoring MCO performance in relation to SAPT Block Grant funds. (Appendix D provides an example of SAPT Block Grant funding contract language used by Colorado.) b. The Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant The Community Mental Health Ser vices Act (Public Law 102 -321; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300x -7-300x -8) specifies that Federal CMHS Block Grant funds should be allocated to meet the needs of adults with a serious mental illness and children with a serious emotional disturbance (see definitions in Appe ndix E), but it does not regulate how States should spend CMHS Block Grant funds. This law gives the Federal Government less authority over States in terms of shaping contracting practices than the SAPT Block Grant law does. To establish a framework for ho w CMHS Block Grant funds should be used, the Federal Center for Mental Health Services developed a set of 12 \"criteria\" or goals. When States use CMHS Block Grant funds to purchase mental health services from an MCO, they must determine which CHMS criteria apply and ensure that the contract clarifies how the MCO will address the criteria. The Center for Mental Health Services enters into contracts with teams of experts to monitor use of CMHS Block Grant funds by the MCO and its network providers. The Center for Mental Health Services has recently consolidated its 12 criteria for how CMHS Block Grant funds should be used to five criteria. Complying with the new set of criteria is optional until current reauthorization legislation takes effect and mandates com pliance by fiscal year 1999 (see Appendix F for a list of the 12 old and 5 new criteria). The Center for Mental Health Services emphasizes that services should be targeted to populations based on the presence of functional impairment that substantially int erferes with or limits the performance of one or more major life activities, in addition to a qualifying diagnosis. As examples of target populations, the Center for Mental Health Services cites the most seriously disturbed adults with serious mental illne ss and children with a serious emotional disturbance and their families, individuals with schizophrenia and major mood disorders, and individuals with serious mental illness who are homeless or involved with the criminal justice system. The Community Ment al Health Services Act sets forth a series of limitations on how CMHS Block Grant funds can be used: The State must spend funds on \"adults with a serious mental illness\" and \"children with a serious emotional disturbance \" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -1(a)). The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to define these populations in regulations (see definitions in Appendix E). Minimum allocation requirements for services to children with serious emotional disturbances must b e met. The contract must be developed as part of a \"plan for the development and implementation of an organized community based system of care,\" which includes \"quantitative targets\" regarding the number of individuals to be served and the services provide d. At a minimum, the contract arguably must provide case management as a service benefit, since case management is the one service that is identified as required in the State plan (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -1(b)(7)). (Of course, the State could carve out case manage ment and continue to purchase these services from noncontractor providers, but presumably case management services are at the core of this type of contract.) The contract must be part of an overall plan that includes at least some level of service to perso ns who are homeless. The contract must be part of a plan that \"provides for a system of integrated social services, educational services, juvenile services, and substance abuse services for children with serious emotional disorders, along with mental healt h services.\" The contract must be part of a plan that targets defined geographic areas for service. Most notably, perhaps, States are restricted to providing services with funds appropriated under the law \"only through appropriate qualified community progr ams (which may include community mental health centers [CMHCs], child mental health programs, psychosocial rehabilitation programs, mental health peer - supported programs, and mental health primary consumer directed programs)\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -2(b)). To the extent that CMHCs are part of a State's treatment system, the centers must meet certain minimum qualification criteria (42 U.S.C. \u00a7300x -2). These criteria include certain minimum service requirements within a geographically defined service area, including outpatient services for target populations, 24 -hour-a-day emergency care services, day treatment, and preadmission patient screening services. Services must be provided (within the limits of the capacities of the centers) to any individual residing or emp loyed in the service area of the center \"regardless of ability to pay.\" As broadly as it is drafted, the Community Mental Health Services Act appears to place some limitations on a State's discretion to spend service funds through managed care contracts. First, it appears to limit services to those provided through qualified community programs. This requirement appears to limit a State to drafting contracts in which Center for Mental Health Services -financed services are offered thr ough a network that consists only of providers with appropriate \"community program\" attributes, as the term is used in the statute. This restriction does not exist in Medicaid managed care contracting, where freedom of choice on the part of plans is a prim ary component of the law. Second, the act appears in effect to limit a State to drafting contracts to provide services to uninsured persons rather than to provide supplemental services to Medicaid beneficiaries. This is because the required services that must be furnished by qualified community programs are all currently or potentially reimbursable under Medicaid. It is possible, of course, that a State's Medicaid plan would not cover these basic services, although when unbundled, virtually all of the mini mum services represent mandatory Medicaid services (i.e., they consist of physician services, outpatient hospital care, emergency hospital care, and services for children). Consequently, since CMHS Block Grant - sponsored managed care contracts must cover th ese services if a State is to be in compliance with Federal requirements, then presumably block grant funds would be used to buy enrollment for uninsured persons rather than to fill service gaps for Medicaid beneficiaries (unless, of course, the overall fu nding made available through the block grant surpasses the amount needed to make the required services available in the contractor's service area). Finally, reconciling the \"open -door\" policy of the Community Mental Health Services Act with the fundamental principles of managed care is not a simple task. The statute requires CMHCs to serve all residents in their service area without regard to their ability to pay. On the other hand, a managed care service agreement by definition covers specific members, not a geographic area. An open -door policy is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of plan membership and risk contracting. Contracts sponsored with CMHS Block Grant funds could be financed through a small amount of funding set aside for use to purchas e membership. It would appear, however, that the State would have to retain funds to pay CMHCs directly in order to sustain their required open -door policy to nonmembers. In the alternative, the State's contract could include a charitable services provisio n that effectively requires the MCO to maintain its CMHC provider network members in \"open -door mode\" with respect to the mandatory minimum services enumerated in the statute. Because this type of requirement would be fundamentally inconsistent with the pr inciples of managed care, its utility is questionable. In addition to these considerations, certain State expenditures under the CMHS Block Grant statute are not permissible. Impermissible activities include inpatient care, cash payments to intended recipi ents of care, purchase or improvement of land or other major capital construction or equipment purchase, or to supplant non -Federal spending requirements. Thus, a contract should specify these activities as excluded from the scope of the agreement. While t he CMHS Block Grant statute and regulations are often ambiguous, they do contain a prohibition against using block grant funds \"to provide financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity.\" In addressing questions regardin g the use of these funds to purchase services from a for -profit company, legal counsel from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has determined that the contracts would appear to be appropriately referred to as a \"procurem ent contract,\" rather than a form of \"financial assistance.\" Consequently, when a purchaser is seeking to acquire the services of a managed care company to carry out functions that it would otherwise perform under the block grant, the statutes would not ap pear to act as a bar to contracting. Finally, States are prohibited from spending more than 5 percent of their CMHS Block Grant funds on administrative expenses. MCOs' administrative costs are considerably higher than this. Thus, in drafting a managed care contract, a State should clarify that the portion of the premium used by the MCO to administer the plan is derived from separate State funds rather than from the Federal allocation. SAPT and CMHS Block Grants. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specifically identify all statutory and regulatory requirements of the block grant that the MCO is obligated to fulfill, including how relevant criteria are to be addressed. Establish the MCO's reporting responsibilities so that reports will be sufficient to fulfill the purchaser's monitoring responsibilities and Federal oversight needs. Define the MCO's responsibility for any administrative fees related to th e management of the grant. Specify a plan for mediating the differences between the confidentiality regulations of CSAT, the Center for Mental Health Services, and Medicaid, noting that the CSAT guidelines are the most stringent and therefore are the easie st to adhere to universally when administering an integrated system. Determine whether block grant requirements will be met in the aggregate or on a statewide basis or passed on to providers in subcontracts. Specify that all services purchased by the MCO w ith identified block grant funds must be provided by public agencies or private nonprofit entities. Require that the MCO make a separate accounting for these funds to allow the purchaser to determine and demonstrate they were expended in accordance with Fe deral requirements. 1. Residual responsibility is a hallmark of Medicaid managed care purchasing. Since the Medicaid program is far broader and deeper in its coverage than any traditional insurance product, no matter how comprehensive, there are some respo nsibilities that no MCO is willing or able to take on. These responsibilities, which remain with State Medicaid program purchasing services from the MCO, are called \"residual\" responsibilities. 2. As discussed later in this chapter, Medicaid and theSubstan ce Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) and Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grants have their own requirements regarding use of funds. 3. One State, Oregon, received waivers of Federal Medicaid coverage rules under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act in order to conduct a demonstration under which plans are paid a defined contribution for their services and may vary the Federal Medicaid benefit package in accordance with a special State priority -setting system. No other State's Section 11 15 demonstration includes waivers of the defined benefit structure of Medicaid, although certain States may provide fewer defined benefits for their demonstration -eligible populations (Rosenbaum and Darnell, 1997). 4. See, for example, Adams vs. Blue Cros s/Blue Shield of Maryland [757 F. Supp. 661 (D. Md., 1991)]. 5. Because of Federal statutory and regulatory requirements governing Medicaid managed care purchasing, purchasers of behavioral managed care services are cautioned against combining several sour ces of public funding into a single procurement unless all funds can be subject to Medicaid requirements. Even in this situation, non - Medicaid sources of funding, such as the CMHS and SAPT Block Grants, have their own requirements regarding use of funds. 6. A State agency may require first exhausting a plan's grievance process. All Medicaid beneficiaries, regardless of their managed care status, however, are entitled to a fair hearing when they are aggrieved by any decision of the State. Since the MCO is ma king decisions on the State's behalf, enrollees in a managed care plan have the right to a fair hearing. The State's duty to provide a constitutional -level fair hearing is not delegable to an informal grievance system that is part of the plan ( Wadley v. Da niels, 926 , 836 F. Supp. 694 (D. Ariz., 1993)). CHAPTER IV Contracting for Network Services Key issues in this chapter: Specifying the capacity and composition of the MCO's provider network Selecting providers for the network Ensuring enrollees' access to network services Subcontracting with providers Establishing qualification standards for provider staff Monitoring providers' performance The basis of a managed care initiative is often the delivery of contracted services through a network of participating providers, so careful selection of providers in the network is critical. A fundamental feature of virtually all State and county contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) is the MCO's ability to demonstrat e an adequate provider network. However, some States and counties permit the MCOs that win the contract to finalize their provider networks between the time of contract award and actual implementation. This chapter discusses several aspects of the development of effective provider networks: Specifying the capacity and composition of the MCO's provider network; Selecting providers for the network; Ensuring enrollees' access to network services; Subcontracting with providers; Establishing qualification standards for provider staff; and Monitoring providers' performance. A.Specifying the Capacity and Composition of the MCO's Provider Network 1. Provider Network Capacity An effective contract will ensure that the MCO's provider network has the capacity to provide enrollees with access to the full range of contracted service s. In Medicaid managed care initiatives, this feature is mandatory for compliance with Federal Medicaid law. The concept of \"sufficient capacity\" of a network is difficult to define, however, and will certainly evolve over time. Generally, sufficient capac ity can best be understood by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the current provider system, identifying gaps in services and/or in management capability, and soliciting input from consumers and their families, providers, advocates, related agencie s, and other stakeholders. This approach will provide the information necessary to build an infrastructure that can support the goals of the initiative in many areas (e.g., data systems; management, clinical, and financial controls). There are several mean s by which the issue of sufficient capacity can be addressed. Under Federal Medicaid law, it is the State's duty to ensure adequate access and capacity regardless of the type of arrangement the MCO has with the network. Most purchasers address one or more dimensions of capacity and access in their contracts (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Purchasers can use the request for proposal (RFP) to give bidders comprehensive information related to capacity needs; this approach is likely to lead to proposals that are rela tively consistent with the purchaser's expectations and lay the foundation for capacity -related provisions in the contract. Alternatively, the purchaser may require the MCO to submit a capacity -development plan for purchaser approval. The benefit package p rovides the foundation upon which capacity requirements can be determined and should guide the MCO's decisions about the composition of the provider network. Other factors to be considered include current capacity of service programs and existing systems; population -specific utilization patterns, if known; areas of insufficient capacity; anticipated changes in utilization upon implementation of managed care; environmental, geographic, and cultural/ethnic variables that may affect service access; and plans f or equalizing service resources and enrollee access across regions. The RFP and the contract should specify the purchaser's desires for geographic access, access to timely appointments, and access to a full range of appropriate providers and should describ e the mechanisms that will be used to monitor access. (Capacity standards may have to be adapted for rural and frontier areas, as geographic access is more difficult to achieve.) Provider Network Capacity. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish access standards that can be quantified and monitored, and require the MCO to demonstrate the capacity to provide and monitor access as defined by the purchaser. Require the MCO to have full capacity available on the contract start date, or stipulate that specified services may be phased -in on an approved timetable and/or on a regional basis. Specify the MCO's responsibilities for addressing unexpected capacity demands, such as u nforeseen gaps in services, disasters, and newly emerging needs. Establish allowable variations in minimum capacity due to regional factors (such as urban versus rural capabilities), available modalities of care, and/or other purchaser -specified factors. Establish conditions under which enrollees are permitted to use out -of-network providers. Network Services in a Rural Environment* Although 23 percent of the U.S. population lived in rural areas at the time of the last census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1988, 1989), most MCO experience has been developed and refined in urban and suburban environments. The accessibility of behavioral health care services in rural areas is often severely compromised because of a limited supply of providers, inadequate ancil lary services, and substantial distances for enrollees to travel to obtain treatment services. Developing optimal network services in rural areas requires creativity, innovative strategies, and, increasingly, communication technologies. Strategies may incl ude the following: Systematic training of local health care providers in screening, assessing, referring, and treating mental and addictive disorders; Increased use of \"telemedicine\" approaches: video systems, computer -based video hookups, and electronic mail communication to strengthen linkages of rural residents with professional help in urban areas; Mobile units and \"circuit -riding\" providers who regularly visit small town clinics; and Clinically staffed 800 numbers to provide information, screening, assessment, referral, triage, and crisis counseling. Each rural environment offers unique opportunities and challenges in developing the most effective network systems. Purchasers that have a significant number of enrol lees in rural areas should ensure that the RFP and contract specifically address the ways in which the MCO and its provider network will creatively approach the challenges of meeting the behavioral health care needs of rural residents. *According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, a rural area is a county without a central city or without two cities of 50,000 or more in population, or a county or town with areas of open country and fewer than 2,500 people. 2. Composition and Structure of the Provider Network Purchasers can also use the RFP and the contract to shape the overall composition, structure, and characteristics of the provider network. Requirements may vary substantially based on the goals of the managed care initiative and unique characteristics of the enrollee population to be served. For example, a purchaser with a large percentage of enrollees from one or more ethnic groups may wish to require the development or expansion of culturally specific services and/or the active ut ilization of traditional community -based organizations with experience serving those groups. Similarly, a purchaser with a significant percentage of enrollees in rural areas may want to be explicit in the RFP and the contract in terms of rural network need s (see box above). Adults with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) and children with serious emotional disorders (SED) are two other subpopulations who have very specific network needs. These include providers with specialized training and experien ce, coordination with accessible providers of clinically important wraparound support services. Effective mechanisms for referral to such nonreimbursable but necessary services consistently improve treatment outcomes, and network developers may wish to cre ate a more seamless system of care by establishing cost -sharing arrangements with key agencies to help enrollees obtain these services. Network Composition. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Describe the required clinical and administrative capacity of the network, including providers' capabilities and their capacity to accept new referrals, as well as licensure, credentialing, board certification, and accreditation requirements. Establi sh minimum guidelines for providers' competence and experience in serving the covered enrollee population. Establish the means by which consumers will most successfully obtain needed wraparound services. Establish whether providers must meet Medicaid or ot her regulatory requirements regarding certification, licensure, accreditation, and/or eligibility for reimbursement. Establish the network strategy for meeting the cultural - and gender -specific needs of consumers. Ensure that emergency service teams have e xpertise in assessing adults with substance use disorders, children, and other purchaser -specified populations. Ensure that Medicaid management services include child experts, and that mechanisms are in place for reporting child abuse, institutional abuse, and domestic violence. Ensure that there is an adequate safety net so that children and families have a choice of providers in a given region. Specify the desired processes and relationships between the MCO and services provided by State or county employe es (e.g., State psychiatric hospitals). Establish minimum thresholds regarding desired credentialing standards. Permit (as is done in Colorado) or prohibit (as is done in Massachusetts) the MCO from directly delivering care using its own staff or programs. Establish measurable expectations regarding the degree of coordination of substance abuse and mental health treatment services with primary health care services. Establish any necessary antitrust controls, both prior to and after contracts are developed w ith providers. Establish minimum requirements regarding strong functional linkages to housing and rehabilitation providers when serving adults with SPMI. Establish an ongoing mechanism for measurement and monitoring of the adequacy of network composition and capacity. B. Selecting Providers for the Network 1. Selection of Providers The selection of providers for an MCO's network will largely determine the accessibility, range, and quality of services the MCO provides. The provider selection process can vary substantially depending on a number of factors: Whether a competitive procurement process is being established; Whether an MCO bidding on the contract is allowed directly to provide services with its staff and programs (e.g., staff model health maintenance organizations [HMOs]); Whether an MCO develops a business and/or legal partnership with a local provider organization(s); Purchaser philosophies, experience, and perspectives; Availability, willingness, and capacity of providers to serve the target population in a defined area; and Clinical philosophy and approach of the MCO. If the purchaser wishes to establish minimum requirements for the process of selection and deselection, it must do so in the contract. Federal Med icaid standards do not create any substantive requirements in this area, other than a general prohibition against arbitrary discrimination against certain classes of providers (see discussion below), although Federal Medicaid law extensively protects the M CO's selection and deselection process itself. In a number of States, courts have enjoined MCOs from arbitrarily denying admission to networks or deselecting network members (see cases cited in Chapter 2 of Rosenblatt, Law, & Rosenbaum, 1997). MCOs are in creasingly developing partnerships with local provider organizations to bid on public sector contracts. These partnerships are often formed long before the RFP is released. When development of such partnerships is likely, the purchaser may want specificall y to require the providers to comply with applicable specifications in the RFP and contract regarding selection of individual providers. In addition, the MCO must be able to show the purchaser that it has demonstrated due diligence in considering a range o f area providers in its selection process. In many situations, however, network providers are selected in a highly visible competitive procurement process that is likely to be closely monitored by stakeholders. Competitive selection processes must effectiv ely incorporate several, often conflicting, factors, including estimates of capacity needs, desired characteristics of the network providers, clinical needs of the enrollees, regional considerations, stakeholder input, and usually a host of political, legal, and/or business factors. Competing in the network provider selection process may be the first time that providers from the public and private sectors compete openly with one another. The purchaser should ensure in the contract that the MCO's process fo r selecting providers is conducted in an open and objective manner that can withstand public, clinical, and legal scrutiny and is in the best interests of the enrollee population. Since the MCO is effectively undertaking a procurement of publicly financed services on the purchaser's behalf, certain aspects of the State's procurement laws apply. Purchasers should generally consult with legal counsel if they allow the MCO to select provider networks through a competitive procurement. The purchaser must often balance the desire to protect current service providers and to have a broad network with the goals of obtaining favorable financial and clinical arrangements with providers. In general, the greater the number of providers actively participating in a networ k, the more difficult it is for the MCO to monitor practice patterns, to carry out credentialing activities, and to negotiate substantial discounts that rely on patient referral volume. One of the most important factors in the MCO's selection of providers is whether the MCO uses a competitive process, a noncompetitive process, or a combination of both to procure some or all network services. Although MCOs generally use competitive processes to lower costs, to limit the network of providers, and to increase accountability, some MCOs choose a noncompetitive procurement when services are not widely available. These may include specialty services, services for which there is no excess capacity, services that require widespread local availability (e.g., outpatie nt services), and other situations in which there is little likelihood of achieving savings, increasing efficiency, and/or improving quality via a competitive process. Another factor that promotes noncompetitive procurement is \"any willing provider\" legis lation that has been enacted in several States in order to support participation of local and private providers and practitioners. Such legislation stipulates that MCOs must contract with any provider who is \"willing to meet the terms and conditions of the payment contract.\" Purchasers should be aware that MCOs can minimize the impact of such legislation by creating \"tiered\" networks in which \"preferred\" providers are sent the bulk of cases and mandated provider applicants are technically included in the ne twork but receive few, if any, referrals. While such practices may support purchaser and MCO goals of clinical and financial control, efficiency, or geographic access, they may violate the law's intention to maintain open networks with broad access. If a p urchaser is particularly concerned about access for certain types of providers, it should specify inclusion of those providers in the contract and include standards, measures, and sanctions for nonperformance. Selection of Providers. Purchasers may wis h to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify whether the MCO should use a competitive, noncompetitive, or mixed process to procure services, either for all services, or by levels and/or types of care. Establish implementation plans with timelines for procuring network services systemwide, by region, and/or by level of care. Require the MCO to solicit input from consumers and their families and other stakeholders on provider selection procedures and criteria. Ensure that MCO solicitation practices are consistent with applicable State and/or Federal laws. Require the development of comprehensive performance expectations for all procured services. Ensu re that selected network providers meet overall and regional capacity needs for all covered services and special populations. Establish formal, objective, and documentable procedures and criteria for MCO review of providers' proposals for network membershi p. Establish a formal review and appeals process so that providers can address perceived inequities in the solicitation process. Require provider grievance and appeals procedures, with appeal to the purchaser if unresolved, concerning financial arrangement s, referrals, use of utilization management (UM) or utilization review (UR), and advocacy for consumer services. Require that the MCO contract only with specified classes of providers, such as those that are fully licensed and board certified; State -appro ved vendors, practitioners, and facilities; federally qualified health maintenance organizations (HMOs); and community mental health centers. Require that a specified percentage of enrollees be referred to community -based organizations for a defined period of time. Address whether the MCO can transfer legal liability to the provider for any actions that result from MCO decisions, and vice versa. Because \"gag\" clauses are now banned, prohibit any contract provisions between the MCO and the provider that prev ents the health care provider from disclosing to enrollees any information that the provider believes to be appropriate about possible courses of treatment and/or provision of tests. 2. Types of Providers The RFP and the contract can prohibit or encourage the selection and utilization of certain types of providers in the network. A wide range of providers deliver substance abuse and mental health services and can be viable candidates for inclusion in an MCO's provider network. These may include traditional nonprofit and other community -based organizations, public health care institutions, for -profit health care organizations, provider -sponsored networks, State - or county -funded agencies, institutions that provide direct services, hospital -based systems, prim ary health care providers, school -based clinics, group practices, individual practitioners, and consumer -run organizations. Three types of providers are increasingly involved in managed care initiatives and/or addressed in managed care contracts: community -based organizations (CBOs), public institutions, and provider -sponsored networks. a. Community -Based Organizations (CBOs) Given the complex needs of many enrollees in public sector managed care initiatives, purchasers may wish to promote the active involv ement of CBOs to provide substance abuse and mental health services. These organizations have historically been the linchpin of public sector services and usually have substantial experience providing services to some of the most challenging public sector consumers. At least 26 States that maintain full - service managed care Medicaid agreements address to some degree the issue of the safety net and of inclusion of traditional providers in their contracts with MCOs.(1) In recent years, managed behavioral health care organizations (MBHOs) have increasingly made efforts to develop partnerships with CBOs when bidding on contracts and have recruited administrators with strong public s ector experience into their organizations. However, some MCOs are more inclined to establish or maintain contracts with network provider systems that are designed for commercially insured populations (Rosenbaum et al., 1997) or that have administrative and /or clinical staff with little or no public sector experience. This sometimes raises concerns that an MCO will not include a sufficient number of CBOs in the network and that this may negatively impact the consumers' level of functioning. Purchasers can u se the RFP and contract to promote or require the inclusion of CBOs that have historically served clients whose care was supported by public funds. As with the selection of any provider, the purchaser's desire to include community providers needs to be bal anced with an equal concern for the quality of services the provider is capable of delivering. Purchasers should appreciate that many CBOs provided a safety net for the public sector before it was profitable to do so. They may therefore have insufficient f unds to invest in improving buildings, developing more sophisticated management information systems (MIS), hiring high -salaried staff, and so forth. CBOs can be highly vulnerable in the transition to a competitive marketplace. Given this situation, purchas ers and MCOs sometimes face challenging dilemmas about the adequacy of some CBOs to function in a new managed care initiative. Purchasers should be sensitive to the fact that mandated inclusion of providers who are ill -prepared to function in a specific in itiative may result in substandard service, and appropriate safeguards should be established. To help address this issue, the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) has recently established a contract to provide technical assistance and traini ng to CBOs across the country regarding improving business practices and successfully adjusting to a more competitive business environment. Purchasers who want to ensure that CBOs are included in the MCO's initial provider network and receive adequate referrals can require that certain providers or categories of providers be included in the network as \"essential community providers\" (ECPs), usually for a defined period of time. The basic principles underlying this inclusive approach are that many CBOs with extensive experience treating the enrollee population should be given the opportunity to adapt to the managed care environment and that consumers of substance abuse and mental health services should not be expected to make abrupt transitions to new provide rs. b. Public Institutions Many purchasers may wish to include State or other public institutions, such as State hospitals, in the MCO's provider network and to \"re -engineer\" their public system to ensure that government -operated services are one componen t of the new managed care system. It may be the goal of other purchasers to restructure the service delivery system or to reduce reliance on certain providers or modalities (e.g., State hospitals, long -term residential placements for children). The purchas er may use the contract to construct provider networks consistent with these goals. State laws vary on whether public institutions can provide services as part of a managed care network. Purchasers should exercise due diligence, investigate and protect the mselves from liability at unaccredited State facilities. Nearly half the States surveyed by the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law (1997) indicated that they include, or plan to include, public institutions in their managed care initiatives. There are m any ways to include these institutions, including fee -for-service arrangements. Almost all State hospitals are accredited as a requirement for receiving Medicaid reimbursement. Nonetheless, there may be pitfalls depending on State laws, and purchasers shou ld address several questions before requiring inclusion of public institutions in an MCO's network. Inclusion of Public Institutions in an MCO Network: Questions To Ask Does some or all of the public mental health or substance abuse treatment system operate under court supervision, court mandates, or consent agreements that may affect the ability to participate in managed care restructuring? Does State law allow a State institution to participate in a competitive market? Does the institution have to be accredited or licensed? Does the institution have substantial consumer lawsuits out standing? Can State or county employees be held accountable by a private sector MCO? Can State hospitals accept risk -sharing performance contracts from MCOs? Is the legislative appropriation to the State hospital included in or affected by the MCO contra ct? Will the State institution offer services for \"free\" or be reimbursed by the MCO on a fee -for-service or a risk - sharing basis? Will the public institution accept patients for admission after covered benefits are exhausted? How will case management be c oordinated between the public institution and the MCO? Does State procurement law limit the participation of a public institution in a provider -sponsored organization that seeks a managed care contract? c. Provider -Sponsored Networks (PSNs) A PSN is a group of providers who have affiliated to pool administrative, financial, and/or clinical resources to improve efficiencies and strategically enhance their position in the health care marketplace. Providers that wish to establish PSNs must be ca reful about antitrust and restraint of trade issues and should engage the services of legal counsel early in their deliberations. Purchasers can use the RFP and the contract to prohibit, encourage, or mandate the involvement of PSNs in the management or pr ovision of treatment services. PSNs often seek a legal partnership with an MCO, hospital, or other health care organization to strengthen their financial position. Because State laws vary concerning the regulation and legal framework under which PSNs may b e formed and operated, purchasers should ensure that the RFP and contract reflect a full understanding of these issues. Types of Providers. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish req uirements for the MCO to use certain types of providers (e.g., State hospitals, federally qualified HMOs, State or nationally certified substance abuse counselors or prevention service providers, or nonprofit community -based organizations). Establish requi rements for the MCO to establish procedural linkages to certain types of providers for specific services (e.g., acceptance of screening evaluations from specific categories of community -based prevention service providers; referral and transfer to a State - or community -provided list of service providers for aftercare). Establish capitalization requirements that do not functionally prohibit community -based, nonprofit organizations from submitting bids. Establish clinical, administrative, and/or financial requ irements that support active involvement of community -based organizations (CBOs). Clarify the capacity to establish, as needed, different financial arrangements for similar types of State - or county -operated programs. Confirm that the purchaser is able to assume legal liability for clinical decisions made by the public institution, possibly requiring special indemnification arrangements and/or reinsurance. Designate specific provider organization(s) to be included and used in the provider network, including consumer -run and peer -support programs, if desired. Address any issues related to labor unions and/or exclusions regarding outsourcing. Create the operational definition, and define the privileges and expectations of an essential community provider (ECP). Define the types of agencies and/or the criteria that can qualify as an ECP. Establish mechanisms to monitor referral and utilization of the services of ECPs. Establish a minimum amount or percentage of referrals or overall service utilization to occur in ECPs. Establish timeframes for ECP status to terminate. Establish any special means by which ECP performance will be measured. Require the MCO to provide training and/or technical assistance to CBOs, as needed and approved by the purchaser. Define the referral relationship between the MCO and the public institution. C. Ensuring Enrollees' Access to Network Services One of the most important responsibilities of a public purchaser of managed care is to ensure that enrollees in managed care syst ems have prompt and easy access to network services. Such access is a hallmark of a high - quality health care system. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requires a demonstration of access for Medicaid managed care systems operated under Medicai d waivers. Ensuring access to services for individuals who rely on public sector service systems can be very challenging. Individuals served by public sector systems often lack the resources to obtain services from complex and bureaucratic health care sys tems, and their mental and/or addictive disorders often exacerbate access problems. Many of them also lack transportation and/or child care. For reasons such as these, individuals in the population served by public sector systems often require specialized support to gain access to health care and ancillary services they need. A well -designed managed care system can coordinate services and facilitate the movement of enrollees through the clinical care system, creating an opportunity for purchasers to signifi cantly increase access for their vulnerable populations by identifying the components of access that are most likely to be meaningful to consumers. Determining what constitutes good access and developing reliable measures of access is also very challengin g. Performance measures are usually based on quantifiable data, so evaluations are often limited by what is easily quantifiable, limiting their range and meaningfulness. The fundamental components of access that are most likely to be relevant to enrollees are summarized below, along with points to consider when developing RFPs and contracts. 1. Components of Access a. Information/Education Needs Enrollees, providers, and MCO employees require comprehensive and up -to-date information about the services that are available and how to use them. It may be necessary to make this information available in several languages and to ensure that it is written at a basic reading level. The methods by which this information is conveyed to enrollees varies. Consumer handbo oks, brochures, pamphlets, and posters are often used, although educational strategies for those who can't read should also be developed. Information/Education Needs. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the degree to which the purchaser, the MCO, or both, are responsible for ensuring the availability of information to all enrollees, network providers, and other interested parties. Require a handbook that provides guidance to clinicians and provider organizations on difficult or unfamiliar situations. Specify the type of information to be provided at enrollment and re -enrollment, such as services covered (including services for speci alized populations), exclusions, limitations on coverage, explanation of a 24 -hour toll-free line, grievance procedures, disenrollment criteria, procedures for determining the appropriate treatment level, access to representation, and other enrollee rights and privileges. Require that information (including consumer handbooks) is free of technical jargon, formatted in an easy -to- read style, and available in the primary languages of the enrollee population. Specify the reading level at which the information should be written. Require the MCO to develop and maintain an up -to-date list of all organizations, clinicians, and other service providers in the network, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, specialties, license numbers, and other relevant info rmation. Clarify how enrollees are to access and use primary health care services and medications, how these services will be coordinated with behavioral health services, and how access and utilization of these services will be monitored and tracked by the MCO. Require an easily accessed enrollee services unit to provide enrollees with information, answer questions, give recommendations, and resolve complaints. Require that essential materials be adapted to meet the needs of those with disabilities (e.g., a udiotapes upon request, large -print versions of consumer materials). b. Ease of Initial Access The ease with which an enrollee can initially access services is a fundamental component of access. Rosenbaum et al., (1997) found that some enrollees in managed care systems sometimes have to negotiate with as many as three different entities to obtain initial services (e.g., outpatient assessment, detoxification). Increasingly, MCOs are allowing direct access/self -referral for certain types of initial services. A number of States maintain strict specifications with respect to initial access in order to ensure that MCOs begin serving enrollees promptly. Ensuring that MCOs serve enrollees promptly is particularly important given the relatively brief periods of enro llment that many beneficiaries may face because of interrupted Medicaid eligibility, a problem that has grown since the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform legislation. Particularly crucial may be the establishment of minimum performance standards for the selection of a primary care provider, including access to lists of participating providers that are kept up to date and that contain addresses and telephone numbers; assistance in selection; timelines for selection; requirements to honor patients' choice of providers; and permissible procedures for situations in which patients fail to select providers. In the absence of specifications, an MCO may devise its own procedures, including large -scale assignment of nonselecting patients to providers with whom the MCO has negotiated additional discounts. This practice of auto -assigning patients to certain providers may result in the disruption of care in the case of persons who have chosen an MCO because their provider is a member. Most States do not require that M COs honor patients' choice of a primary care provider. Instead, they permit the MCO some discretion in deciding whether or not to assign the patient to his or her provider of choice. The Massachusetts contract establishes particularly stringent specificati ons for the assignment of patients (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): In the event that the Contractor is unable to elicit a PCP [primary care provider] selection from an enrollee, the Contractor shall assign a PCP to such enroll ee within two business days of obtaining enrollment information . . . Such PCP assignment shall meet the following criteria: a. The PCP shall be within a 15 -mile radius and/or 30 minutes' traveling time from the enrollee's home address. Within urban locations this shall take into account walking and public transportation. b. The contractor shall determine whether the assigned enrollee had previously received services under the Contractor's plan, with in the last two years, under either Medicaid or a commercial membership, where the recipient had a minimum of two claims with a PCP during that two -year period. -If the enrollee received a minimum of two services from a PCP in the Contractor's plan, the H MO shall automatically assign the enrollee to the PCP. -If the enrollee did not have a pre -existing relationship with a PCP who participates in the contractor's plan, the Contractor shall determine an alternate methodology to automatically assign enrollee s to a PCP. Ease of Initial Access. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the model(s) of initial access to services to be used by the MCO. Specify whether behavioral health care serv ices can be accessed directly without going through a primary care provider. Require the MCO to have a 24 -hour, toll -free service line available 7 days a week that provides information, assessment, crisis intervention, and referral services and that has su fficient capacity to meet the needs of non-English -speaking enrollees. Establish how enrollees are to access emergency services. Establish how initial access systems will be measured, monitored, and evaluated. Specify how access systems will accommodate en rollees with disabilities (e.g., visually or hearing impaired) or who have low levels of literacy. Specify the types of authorization (e.g., pre -authorization, postauthorization, no authorization) that are required, allowed, or forbidden. c. Geographic Pro ximity Many publicly insured individuals do not have reliable access to transportation, and the travel time or distance to service locations may be prohibitive. While most States specify geographic access standards for primary care, far fewer do so for spe cialty care.(2) Purchasers can develop contract provisions defining the maximum times and/or distances considered acceptable, possibly establishing different standards for som e types of services, and can address the availability of or responsibility for transportation services. Ideally, these provisions should be consensus - derived and/or part of negotiations. State Medicaid plans must assure that beneficiaries have transportati on to medically necessary care, although how this transportation service is implemented varies widely from State to State. Some States do include at least some level of transportation in their contracts as a required service, particularly in cases in which MCOs are operated by community programs that customarily offer transportation services. A Florida Medicaid contract sets the following access standards for mental health providers (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): The Contractor shall make available and accessible facilities, service locations, and service sites and personnel sufficient to provide the covered services (specifically, nonhospital, outpatient, emergency, and assessment services) throughout the geographic area within thirty minutes typical travel time by public or private transportation of all enrolled recipients. (The typical travel time standard does not apply to waiting time for public transportation; it applies only to actual t ime in transit .) Geographic Proximity. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the maximum allowable travel times and distances (or number of bus transfers) enrollees may be required t o travel to specified levels of care and services. Require the MCO to develop strategies for ensuring transportation services by providing these services directly, assigning transportation responsibility to network providers in specified circumstances, or subcontracting this service to a transportation firm (possibly including a maximum cap on the MCO's financial responsibility in this area). Establish special access standards for services that are highly specialized and/or for which there is a limited choice of providers. Establish access requirements for rural or frontier areas based on mileage, time restrictions, or other relevant variables depending on the environment. Require use of software packages designed to assist in the actual measurement of and monitoring of geographic access. d. Timeliness of Access Enrollees' motivation to address their behavioral health problems is often fleeting, and a delay in access can result in a missed opportunity to initiate treatment. The purchaser can establish standa rds for promptness of service delivery in a variety of areas. For instance, the purchaser may wish to establish maximum waiting times for routine, urgent, and crisis/emergency care; specify the response time for the toll -free consumer service line (e.g., c ustomer service line answered within four rings or 30 seconds); stipulate that customer service line staff be familiar with the plan, benefits, and network providers to facilitate assessment; and mandate that trained staff be available around the clock for crisis intervention and assessment. Nearly all States establish timelines for emergency services; fewer do so for other forms of care. Twelve States establish time standards for mental health services.(3) Typical service timeframes used by States are same day/immediate service for emergencies with 24 -hour-per-day, 7 day -per-week availability by the contractors, 24 to 48 hours for urgent care, preventive (non -symptomatic) servi ces within 45 days of request, and non-urgent symptomatic office visits within 2 -7 days of request. Massachusetts establishes certain timeframes for selected services for addiction disorders (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): With regard to acupuncture detoxification, the Contractor shall provide , where Medically Necessary, up to six (6) treatments per week for the first two (2) weeks of treatment and up to three (3) treatments per week after the first two (2) weeks. With regar d to methadone maintenance therapy, the Contractor shall provide, where Medically Necessary, one (1) dose per day and up to four (4) methadone counseling sessions per week. Washington State's contract requires contractors to be able to furnish outpatient crisis mental health service to enrollees \"24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" The contract specifies that \"all other services shall be available during regular business hours and without undue delay.\" Vermont requires plans to make initial mental health services available within 5 working days for treatment of a non -emergency, non -mental -health problem (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). New York's RFP contains relatively extensive service timelines for mental health services (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): The plan will have 24 -hour availability of crisis care . . . [and] availability of psychiatric consultation coverage 24 hours each day to do triage and provide consultations on medication reactions, etc. . . . [The plan w ill have] seven days, 24 -hour access to support and counseling by trained peers and/or other staff, provided in the enrollee's home with the goal of reducing distress while allowing the person to stay in familiar surroundings. Timeliness of Access. Purchas ers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the required degree of promptness of telephone services, such as the number of rings or seconds allowable before a call is answered by a person, the ma ximum amount of time callers may spend on hold, and call abandonment rates. Require the MCO to have urgent and emergency/crisis services available within specified periods of time. Establish maximum times between initial telephone (or other contact) and fi rst face -to-face contact for routine, urgent, and crisis/emergency care. Specify the supervision requirements and level of training and capabilities required of staff who answer consumer service lines. Establish whether the MCO may use an automated attenda nt answering system. Establish maximum allowable times for MCO authorizations and reauthorizations, or allow a certain level of service before authorization must be obtained (e.g., eight outpatient visits). Establish policies concerning waiting lists for c linical services, including whether such lists are acceptable and for how long. Clarify access requirements for designated services (e.g., detoxification). e. Cultural and Linguistic Competence The relationship between culture, language, and health care i s complex and inextricably linked to health outcomes. Most States address this issue to at least some degree. In States or counties where enrollee populations include significant cultural, ethnic, and/or linguistic diversity, it is imperative that the MCO establish systems designed to facilitate access to services for diverse groups. For instance, the Florida mental health contract requires staffing patterns that reflect the racial and ethnic composition of the community in which the plan is located and req uires that services be provided in the language spoken by the enrollees. The contract specifies that the contractor must supply the State with a list of all Spanish -speaking and Spanish -literate staff (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Wisconsin has one of the mos t extensive sets of provisions regarding the language and cultural appropriateness of care, as shown below (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): Provide interpreter services for enrollees as necessary to ensure availability of effec tive communication regarding treatment, medical history or health education. Furthermore, the HMO must provide 24 hour a day, 7 day a week access to interpreters conversant in languages spoken in the HMO's service area, including at least Spanish and Hong. Also, upon a recipient or provider request for interpreter services in a specific situation where care is needed, the HMO shall make all reasonable efforts to provide an interpreter in time to assist adequately with all necessary care, including urgent an d emergency care. The HMO must routinely document all such efforts. This documentation must be available to the Department at the Department's request. Professional interpreters shall be used when needed where technical, medical or treatment information is to be discussed or where use of a family member or friend as interpreter is inappropriate. Family members, especially children, should not be used as interpreters in assessments, therapy, and other situations where impartiality is critical. The HMO will m aintain a current list of interpreters who are on \"on call\" status to provide interpreter services. HMO shall address the special health needs of enrollees who are poor and/or members of a minority population group. HMO shall incorporate in its policies, administration, and service practice the values of (1) honoring members' beliefs, (2) being sensitive to cultural diversity, (3) fostering in staff/providers attitudes and interpersonal communications types which respect enrollees' backgrounds. HMO shall h ave specific policy statements on these topics and communicate them to subcontractors . . .HMO shall encourage and foster cultural competency among providers. HMO shall permit enrollees to choose providers from among the HMO's network based on cultural pre ference. HMO shall permit enrollees to change primary providers based on cultural preference. Enrollees may submit grievances to the HMO and/or the Department related to inability to obtain culturally appropriate care, and the Department may pursuant to su ch grievance permit an enrollee to disenroll and enroll into another HMO . . . . Culturally appropriate care is care by a provider who can relate to the enrollee and provide care with sensitivity, understanding and respect for the enrollee's culture. Cultu ral and Linguistic Competence. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish standards for cultural and linguistic competence required by the MCO and its provider network, including degree d and nondegreed professionals who reflect the cultural and linguistic makeup of the enrollee population. Establish standards for translation and interpreter services for customer service telephone and direct service providers. Require the MCO and/or provi der to develop cultural competence plans. Specify cross -cultural training requirements. Provide guidelines or specific requirements for minority providers. Require the MCO to monitor compliance with any legal or contractual requirements for cultural compet ency, and establish standards, measures, and means for enforcing compliance. Require the MCO to develop and implement standards to systematically evaluate providers' cultural competency. Require the MCO to provide enrollees with written information about access and services in specified languages. Require specialized outreach to certain populations. Require the MCO to develop strategies to accommodate the specific cultural/ethnic -related n eeds of consumers with disabilities. Require the MCO to develop strategies to accommodate consumers who are deaf or hearing impaired. Ensure the availability of linguistic capabilities upon consumers' request. f. \"Gatekeeper\" Competence Managed care system s by definition incorporate some version of a \"gatekeeping\" function to ensure that services are provided in the most appropriate and efficient manner and to protect against unnecessary utilization of expensive services. How this function is implemented va ries substantially. It may involve primary care providers' screening and referring before services are deemed appropriate and reimbursable, phone -based utilization reviewers, MCO - or provider -based utilization management teams, care managers, and so forth. Regardless of the setting or model used, the competence of individuals performing the gatekeeping function is crucial because they must be capable of accurately assessing needs and triaging consumers to the most appropriate set of services. The gatekeeper s must be well trained in and sensitive to the complex biopsychosocial aspects of mental illness and addiction. Gatekeeper Competence. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify how primary care physicians are to conduct screening and assessment for mental and addictive disorders or for risk factors associated with these disorders. Specify the gatekeeper's responsibilities to inform the primary care physician of the patient's treatment plan, in accord with confidentiality requirements. Specify minimum qualifications, training, and experience in substance abuse and mental health assessment and treatment for those who perform a gatekeeper function. Establish guidelines for screening and assessment tools to be used in gatekeeping functions. Establish separate standards for those performing gatekeeping functions for different specializations, such as mental disorders, substance use disorders, children and so forth. Establish restrictions on or limitations for financial incentives of gatekeepers that may unduly affect decisionmaking. Specify availability, consultation, or determination of utilization management decisions by a physician or by a psychiatrist. g. Outreach Capabilities Improving access for hard -to-reach populations may often require outreach services. These services may be directed to addicted pregnant women, homeless individuals with mental and/or addictive problems, injection drug users, severe ly mentally ill individuals, or others who are unlikely to seek out treatment on their own and whose untreated illnesses entail high social and other costs. Some purchasers prefer to contract with agencies other than MCOs to do outreach for hard -to-reach p opulations. If the MCO is to conduct outreach, the contract should be very specific as to what is required and also ensure that the MCO is held accountable for outreach work at the rate anticipated. Outreach Capabilities. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Identify target population groups for outreach. Specify requirements for the MCO to conduct outreach, particularly outreach to vulnerable populations (such as people who are homeless) or difficult -to-reach groups (e.g., rural, specific ethnic/cultural populations). Require the MCO to develop outreach staff guidelines and standards. To clarify both what is expected and what is not, establish requirements for outreach in specific terms (e.g. , how many staff should be devoted to outreach, in what locations and to which populations, and how outreach should be conducted). Establish measures for performance of outreach functions. Stipulate appropriate incentives to encourage the MCO's outreach ef forts. Establish acceptable penetration rates (i.e., access to services). Clarify how outreach efforts will be monitored. 2. Measuring Access Several organizations have developed and continue to refine standards that measure different aspects of access. These standards are likely to form the base upon which access within the field will be built. The accompanying box outlines the standards established by these organizations. Purchasers are strongly encouraged to be spec ific in the RFP and contract about their expectations concerning performance of the contractor. These expectations should have measures attached to them, standards to which the contractor will be held accountable, incentives and sanctions for reaching or f ailing to reach the standards set, and provisions that the contractor use new measures and standards at periodic intervals (e.g., annually or at contract renewal). There should be expectations in the RFP/contract about rates of use by population and a mean s for tracking utilization and access rates in fairly real time (e.g., monthly reports at least) and means for auditing use rates to assure that expectations are being met and that the data reported are accurate. Standards for Measuring Access to Beh avioral Health Services National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) NCQA's Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) (NCQA, 1997) measures waiting time and overall availability by geographic access of mental health and chemical dependency providers. American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA) AMBHA's Performance -Based Measures for Managed Behavioral Health Care Programs (PERMS 1.0) (AMBHA, 1995) as sesses the penetration rate, utilization, and call abandonment rate. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) DEC's standards (1995) are similar to those of HEDIS but specify the expected level of access (IOM, 1996). D. Subcontracting With Providers One of the MCO's fundamental responsibilities is to execute and administer service contracts with providers. Like the prime contract between the purchaser and the MCO, the MCO's subcontract with providers establishes specif ic clinical, financial, and operational responsibilities. The purchaser may wish to include substantive contractual requirements about the content and/or structure of such subcontracts, require their approval by the purchaser, require the MCO to show evide nce of due diligence in soliciting providers, and mandate that the fundamental content of subcontracts between the MCO and providers be made public in the same manner as the prime contract is made public. 1. Devolution of Responsibilities in the Prime Cont ract to the MCO's Subcontracts With Providers The importance of extending the relevant terms of the prime contract to the MCO's subcontracts with providers to ensure the legal devolution (delegation) of many service and performance duties from the MCO to p roviders cannot be overemphasized. The providers in the MCO's network are not parties to the prime contract between the purchaser and the MCO and are therefore not bound by it unless the MCO -provider contract so states. For example, many prime contracts re quire the MCO to develop practice guidelines regarding quality of care; however, these same contracts may neglect to require the MCO -provider contract to address this issue. As a consequence, the MCO may not distribute the agreed -upon guidelines to provide rs, and the providers are under no contractual obligation to follow them. To ensure that network providers are contractually obligated to provide services in a manner consistent with the prime contract, the purchaser may require the MCO to bind providers b y the relevant terms of the prime contract. In addition, at a minimum, to guard against the potential for underservice, the contract should specify that the MCO must provide evidence that it has communicated to its subcontractors the classes of benefits th at will be covered, the standards and procedures for making coverage determinations under the agreement, and a full explanation of the benefits that can be secured for enrollees both through the contract and outside of the contract. One of the great challe nges for a managed care purchaser is ensuring that all subcontractors are aware of its agreement with the contractor. This is especially true in the case of Medicaid managed care agreements, in which the terms of the master contract may depart significantl y from those found in service agreements in the private sector. Devolution of Responsibilities. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to have signed subcontracts with provider s in place before the plan is implemented. Establish guidelines regarding the use of provisional contracts or some other transitional arrangement if necessary (with appropriate malpractice coverage and indemnification provisions) to facilitate contracting, credentialing, and clinically appropriate transitions for enrollees during the implementation of the managed care plan. Ensure the delegation of all relevant service and performance duties from the prime contract to the subcontract. Require purchaser appr oval of all MCO -provider contract language related to the devolution of prime contract terms to the provider. Require the MCO to monitor prime contract terms and ensure compliance of prime contract requirements by the subcontractors. Require the MCO to train providers to ensure clear understanding of the purchaser's contract with the MCO and consequent provider obligations. Require purchaser approval of a standard subcontract base language that clearly reflects the delegation of respon sibilities (e.g., performance standards, recommendations for network membership, medical necessity criteria, quality assurance, consumer protections, and grievance and appeals procedures). Require that all subcontracts, provider performance standards, and practice guidelines be publicly available. Require compliance with 42 C.F.R. 434.70 and 434.67, whereby the MCO may operate a physician incentive plan only if it is consistent with the act's provisions. Establish any requirements regarding timelines and pr ocesses for the recontracting and reprocurement of providers. Ensure that provider contracts are available to the public and that information on financial incentives that might influence care is also publicly available. Establish mechanisms for the purchas er to audit compliance of the MCO with its practice guidelines and utilization review criteria. 2. Provider Payment Requirements Another essential component of the contract is the MCO's payment terms and conditions with regard to network providers. Purchas ers may wish to support the ongoing financial viability of network providers by contractually establishing fair, efficient, and monitorable compensation methods. Provider Payment Requirements. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contr acts: Require the MCO to have signed subcontracts with providers in place prior to the start date of the MCO contract. Require the MCO to specify clear payment terms and conditions in the MCO -provider subcontract (e.g., rates, timeframes for payment, assumption of risk, copayments, deductibles, and service definitions). Establish timelines for payment of providers (especially important during the startup period when providers may not have adequate cash reserves) -- e.g., 90 percent of invoices be paid within 45 days. Establish fees and schedules of services for fee -for-service arrangements. Require the MCO to report any revenue paid to the providers from copayments or charges for noncovered services, or other sources. Requir e the MCO to seek purchaser approval regarding subcapitation to providers, rate -setting policies, or other purchaser -specified reimbursement -related issues. Require the MCO to pay claims for dates of service beginning on the date of contract implementation . Require reporting on all third -party payment activities, or alternatively, encourage the MCO to collect third - party liability payments by designating a percentage to be retained by the MCO for its efforts (e.g., 25 percent). Require MCOs to develop fair payment terms and efficient and monitorable processes in the MCO -provider subcontract. Determine all financial responsibilities for consumers already in treatment when the contract starts. 3. Grievance and Appeals Procedures for Providers Rosenbaum and her colleagues' analysis of State Medicaid managed care contracts found that most contracts, through omission or insufficiently precise language, created a situation in which MCOs held considerable power over providers, giving the providers no recourse to add ress what they may have considered unfair practices (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). To ensure that network providers have viable options for addressing issues with the MCO, a purchaser of managed care services may require the MCO to include dispute resolution, g rievance, and appeals procedures for providers in the MCO -provider subcontract. Such provisions should clearly describe procedures, identify who bears the cost of the procedures, and protect the rights of providers who challenge MCO practices. Policy and l egal issues abound, and purchasers should ensure that the arbitration -grievance procedures comply with all relevant county, State, and Federal laws and regulations. Grievance and Appeals Procedures for Providers. Purchasers may wish to address the followin g in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to develop provider grievance and appeals procedures with levels of appeal available within the MCO and, ultimately, an appeal to the purchaser or its designee (e.g., the State me ntal health or substance abuse authority). Require the MCO to generate written documentation supporting a decision to eliminate or suspend a provider from the network, to be available to the purchaser and provider upon request, ensuring confidentiality whe n necessary. Ensure that providers have access to grievance and appeals procedures, both with the MCO and with the purchaser. E. Establishing Qualification Standards for Provider Staff Another MCO responsibility is to establish, monitor, and enforce standards for training, experience, qualifications, and continuing competency of staff who provide services within their networks. A purchaser can use the prime contract to establish qualific ation standards for network provider staff for implementation by the MCO, or the purchaser can require the MCO to propose a set of standards for the purchaser's review and approval. 1. General Staffing Guidelines Staffing guidelines, such as those specifi ed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) in its behavioral health accreditation standards, can be used to establish minimum requirements in such areas as education, training, experience with the defined population, cultural competence, and licensing and certification. Although these standards are very helpful, it has been argued that they are too oriented to private sector systems and must be supplemented to be useful in public sector systems (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1997). Re quiring accreditation of the MCO is also a way in which minimal credentialing standards for staff can be assured. All licensing and certification standards must be consistent with all applicable local, county, State, and/or Federal requirements. In determi ning staff qualifications, purchasers may want to be careful not to be overly restrictive in order to allow for staffing patterns that make optimal use of licensed professional, certified, and \"experientially trained\" staff. A significant percentage of dir ect service staff in the substance abuse field, for example, are people in recovery who have not pursued academic degrees but are nonetheless highly effective in certain clinical settings (e.g., detoxification, outreach). Overly restrictive standards might prohibit the use of such staff in publicly funded substance abuse services. Similarly, staff qualification requirements should not restrict valuable opportunities to include students, volunteers, and consumers, as long as they are adequately supervised by licensed professionals. (The 1997 NCQA manual includes new language to allow credentialing of programs that have unlicensed staff with licensed supervisors.) These staff can be used well in staffing patterns that achieve treatment goals in ways that are innovative, clinically sound, and cost effective. Use of such staff requires clear policies on appropriate functions, malpractice protection, and appropriate fee structures. General Staffing Guidelines. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs a nd contracts: Specify that the purchaser retains the right to approve all staff standards and any exceptions to those standards before implementation. Require the MCO to be appropriately accredited, or to use the credenti aling standards of NCQA accreditation as a base and then set additional standards to reflect public sector realities. Establish the staffing requirements for managing and/or providing substance abuse treatment and prevention, both for those experientially trained and for those with academic training and/or licensure. 2. Credentialing and Credential Verification Establishing credentialing standards for providers allows the purchaser to ensure the qualifications of professional, licensed, and certified staff within the network. Credentialing is a review process based on specific criteria, standards, and prerequisites to approve a provider or professional who applies to provide care in a number of health care settings, including hospital, clinic, medical group, health plan, or in private practice. Credentialing activities generally include review of original documents submitted by the provider, including contacting references, verifying licensure, and reviewing and verifying insurance and malpractice history. Th ese activities may be carried out by the MCO or contracted out to an organization that specializes in such tasks. Due to the liability risk of credentialing in a manner not consistent with industry standards, which are set mainly by NCQA and the Joint Comm ission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), purchasers should exercise caution in the degree to which they vary from these established standards. Credentialing. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Direct the MCO to develop, implement, and/or oversee credentialing policies and capabilities of network providers and MCO staff. Require purchaser approval of the credentialing policies and process. Identify which categories of pro viders are to be credentialed and methods by which this will take place, and set timeframes for the credentialing process. Establish the credentialing standards to be used, such as those drafted by NCQA, JCAHO, CARF, CAO, or other accrediting organization. Ensure that the standards used are consistent with any State, county, or local requirements. Require the MCO to utilize State counselor certification or credentialing as a staffing standard. Require the MCO to oversee and closely monitor any credentialing work that is contracted out. Establish requirements for credentialing group providers, as contrasted to standards for credentialing individual providers. Require the MCO to provide primary source verification of documentation regarding MCO staff experienc e and training, as well as network providers. Direct the MCO to include providers with specialized training and experience in specialty areas (e.g., substance abuse, children, eating disorders). Establish whether the MCO and its providers must accept refer rals of enrollees involved with the courts or the criminal justice system or referrals that present conditions outside their licensure or competency to treat. Establish a volume or amount of funds that must be provided through essential community providers (e.g., Oregon substance abuse services). Require that substance abuse and mental health service providers establish and maintain formal relationships with each other and with primary health care providers and with social services and supportive services o rganizations. 3. Clinical Specialties The purchaser may wish to require that a sufficient number of staff throughout the network have training, board certification, and/or experience in various specialties. For instance, the purchaser may want the MCO to h ave expertise in -house and within its network to manage the treatment of children with severe emotional disturbances who require the services of board -certified child psychiatrists and child psychologists. The degree to which purchasers choose to address clinical specialty issues will vary depending on the needs of the enrollee population, the availability of specialists, utilization of specialists in the current system of care, and the purchaser's attitudes about the importance of using specialists. Purchasers may wish to require the MCO to submit a specialty services plan for purchaser approval, specifying standards for certain specialties and/or identifying the types of programs that should have specialist s on staff or readily available. Clinical Specialties. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to submit a specialty services plan for purchaser approval. Specify which clinical specialties are required within the network, including waivers or adjustments for rural and frontier areas when appropriate. Establish the settings, situatio ns, and/or programs that should have such specialties. Specify which board certifications are required for physicians, psychologists, and others, both in the MCO and in designated settings and situations. Establish and provide means to monitor access to sp ecialists. Require the MCO to systematically upgrade and improve specialist capabilities throughout the system, taking into account the potential limitations of specialist availability in rural and frontier areas . 4. Consumer Employment Employment of consu mers of mental health services and their families and individuals in recovery from addiction can be an important element in an effective staffing system. Consequently, the purchaser may wish to develop standards that promote the training, hiring, employmen t, and supervision of those with mental disorders, those in recovery from addictive illnesses, and family members of children with emotional disorders, both in the provider network and within the MCO. The purchaser may also wish to promote contracts for se rvices with consumer -sponsored organizations. Consumer Employment. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish guidelines for the use of consumer -based provider systems (e.g., consumer s upport groups or drop-in centers). Establish consumer and family employment goals for internal MCO and/or provider operations. Direct the MCO to systematically promote, monitor, and improve the recruitment, training, and hiring of former or current consume rs and family members by network providers. Establish minimum standards for length of sobriety required for clinical staff and for systems to respond to relapse or psychological deterioration among staff. Require compliance with all applicable State or cou nty laws regarding health status including substance use/sobriety by recovering employees. F. Monitoring Providers' Performance Monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of network providers' performance by the MCO is a crucial and ongoing task of network ma nagement. Effective monitoring and management of providers' performance by the MCO can give the purchaser much critical information. The purchaser may therefore wish to include guidelines and specifications in the contract regarding how this monitoring pro cess should occur and the standards by which the MCO's monitoring strategies will be evaluated. Chapter VI includes an analysis of important issues related to performance monitoring and quality assurance, and these topics are only briefly discussed here in relation to network monitoring. MCOs use a wide variety of strategies to monitor and manage performance of the providers in their networks, which may include placing MCO staff at treatment sites, making intensive site visits, conducting consumer satisfac tion surveys and focus groups, and requiring internal reporting by utilization management staff. Increasingly, however, provider monitoring relies on data -based provider profiling, in which systematic profiles of providers are created using a series of spe cific measures. In claims -based fee -for-service arrangements, a substantial amount of useful information can be developed from which provider profiles can be generated. The profiles can be used to compare the performance of providers of similar services. T hey can also be used to design quality improvement programs, distribute incentives or enact sanctions, establish corrective action plans, and/or provide the basis for continued measurement in the network. Monitoring Providers' Performance. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to submit a formal network monitoring, development, and management plan for purchaser approval, including procedures for corrective action plans and sy stematic follow -ups. Establish clear specifications to support purchaser monitoring and evaluation of specified MCO network management functions (e.g., a report card). Describe any MCO requirements regarding training of network providers (e.g., utilization management, best practices, or management information service development). Implement a tracking system to measure providers' progress. Describe the role of consumers and family members in monitoring provider performance. Describe required provider profil e measures and evaluation criteria. Describe software capabilities that would best meet desired provider -profiling needs. Require that profiling measures and procedures be available to providers and the public. Specify any provider reporting requirements (e.g., State client data systems, outcome reporting systems, or data on placement patterns). Ensure that providers are given feedback on quality and performance data. Require documentation of actions taken to res olve quality concerns. 1.

For a detailed analysis of this issue, see table 3.8 with State Medicaid man aged contract provisions addressing this issue in Rosenbaum et al., (1997). 3. For a detailed analysis of this issue, see table 3.7 with State Medicaid managed contract provisions addressing this issue in Rosenbaum et al., (1997). CHAPTER V The Management Information System Key issues in this chapter: The managed care purchaser's expectations of an MIS Characteristics of an \"ideal\" MIS for a managed care system Data generated by stakeholders in a managed care system Basic MIS operational features Confidentiality considerations Ownership and use of Information management is an essential element of any man aged care system. Advances in hardware and software make it possible to apply technology effectively to support creation of \"patient -centered\" service systems. Whether the purchaser is planning to use the managed care organization's (MCO's) management info r-mation system (MIS) to manage the care system or instead will be purchasing and implementing an MIS in house, it should give careful consideration in both the request for proposal (RFP) and the contract to a number of issues. Many purchasers assume that because they are acquiring the services of an MCO, they can rely on the MCO to provide the necessary MIS support. This is not always the case. The purchaser must identify its needs as clearly as possible in the RFP and contract and then evaluate the bidde rs' ability to meet those requirements. If the purchaser of managed care plans to use the MCO's MIS, it must make a concerted effort to determine whether the MCO's MIS will be adequate. For these reasons, the RFP, and especially the contract, must clearly state all the required functions of the MIS. Lack of attention to detail regarding MIS -related issues can be a costly and disappointing mistake, as it is very difficult and expensive to make changes to a contractual relationship after the fact. If the purc haser is planning to purchase and implement an MIS on its own, the RFP and contract with the MCO should clearly indicate this. data Technical requirements for an MCO's MIS Procurement of an MIS by a purchaser for its own use This chapter focuses on contractual issues related to the exchange of information and the application of technology to support a public managed care initiative. It addresses the following MIS -related topics: The managed care purchaser's expectations of an MIS; Characteristics of an \"ideal\" MIS for a managed care system; Data generated by stakeholders in a managed care system; Basic MIS operational features; Confidentiality considerations; Ownership and use of data; Technical requirements for an MCO's MIS; and Procurement of an MIS by a purchaser for its own use. A. The Managed Care Purchaser's Expectations of an MIS The process of selecting an MCO to operate a managed behavioral health care program is much different from the process of selecting a vendor to supply technology to a State or county government for a managed care system. The legal requirements and contract terms governing the exchange of information between purchasers, MCOs, and providers are different from the legal requirements and contract terms governing a State's purchase of technology from an MIS company. The requirements of a contract between a purchaser and an MCO will vary depending on the degree of influence the purchaser wishes to exert on the way the system is used. The primary concern of some public purchasers may be to ensure that the MCO provides information that allows the purchaser to monitor and evaluate the MCO's performance and to provide reports to the Federal Government and other authorities. Other public purchasers may want to direct the way the MCO manages communications between providers, the MCO, and the purchaser. As discussed later in this chapter, several basic MIS operational issues related to information processing must be addressed before the managed care system is established. Provisions governing these MIS operating issu es (e.g., exchange of information required to verify eligibility), along with a few fundamental legal considerations related to the exchange of information (e.g., as protection of patient confidentiality) are common to all managed care contracts. These MIS operational issues arise regardless of the purchaser's role in the day -to-day operations of the MIS. B. Characteristics of an \"Ideal\" MIS for a Managed Care System To best support an efficient and clinically effective managed care program, an \"ideal\" MIS should be a \"person - centered,\" integrated, and \"operational\" system. The discussion of an ideal MIS here is intended to illustrate the optimal use of technology to support managed care initiatives. It is not intended to suggest that acquisition of a syste m having all of the characteristics discussed is necessary for an effective managed care system. The ideal MIS is a system that could be used by providers, provider -sponsored service systems, MCOs, or government organizations, or by all four working in col laboration with one another. The system is intended to be a truly integrated system with the capacity for many organizations to share the information required to perform interdependent functions. The system should integrate different types of information ( e.g., clinical, social, financial, and administrative), interactively process changes in data elements to trigger action in accordance with user -defined parameters (e.g., fax, request for treatment report, outcomes measurement, clinical consultation), inte lligently \"push\" information to users, and allow individual users to view information and enter and edit data. The ideal MIS also should reinforce cooperative relationships among the purchasers, the MCO, and provider organizations. The system will support risk-sharing arrangements in which providers assume clinical responsibility and financial risk associated with service decisions. This places day -to-day decisionmaking in the hands of those who know the consumers best. It also places financial incentives a s close as possible to direct service providers, lessens time and resources devoted to MCO utilization review of providers' treatment decisions, reduces conflict between the MCO and providers, and minimizes distribution of confidential information. 1. A \"P erson -Centered\" MIS The ideal MIS will support individualized treatment planning and continuity of care as a person moves in and out of treatment and from program to program. Whereas a \"program -centered\" MIS will focus only on the performance of a particul ar function and will \"lose\" consumers as they pass from one program to another, a \"person -centered\" MIS will be able to capture all clinical, social, and financial information related to an individual consumer and track the person across the full continuum of services and programs. (An integrated MIS will be able to group data by program --or by any other function --as a secondary feature of a person -centered MIS.) 2. An Integrated MIS The MIS must create a comprehensive data set containing the relevant info rmation collected from various domains -- enrollees, the MCO, and network providers. The data set should include clinical, demographic, financial, utilization management, and any other data produced from the operation of the system. Different users of the sy stem -- clinicians, utilization managers, financial analysts, and evaluators --need to look through different windows that allow them to view and manipulate information in the way that best meets their needs. The system must be capable of integrating data fro m different domains within the data structure and arranging the information in ways that are useful to those with different roles, tasks, and technical expertise. 3. An \"Operational\" MIS In the past, the primary function of an MIS was to provide data (e.g. , periodic reports or budget information) for retrospective analysis that would help administrators and others carry out planning functions. Essentially, the MIS was used as an electronic filing cabinet. Although retrospective analysis continues to be crit ical, current MIS designers are aiming toward more \"operational\" systems. In an \"operational\" MIS, data collected in the performance of routine tasks are integrated and made available on a real-time basis so the data are accessible and usable by staff. An operational system is designed to support the daily workflow of the system, facilitate the exchange of information between organizations and people who perform complementary functions, and facilitate performance of specific tasks. For example, a utilizati on manager may use the MIS to review a person's previous episodes of care, receive information from the treating clinician regarding the person's progress, and review the cost of services to date relative to the benefits available. All the data required to make such decisions are current and available on the MIS without the need for research or special procedures. Additionally, the system might include clinical decision support technology to alert the utilization manager to the need for a medical consultati on about a possible adverse medication interaction, then automatically alert the consulting physician and route the consumer's file for review. In this way, the MIS saves time, increases efficiency, and enhances accountability, leading to improved clinical service. C. Data Generated by Stakeholders in a Managed Care System Within a service system, the information that must be available to support the work of a direct provider of treatment mirrors that required by an MCO. Both require information about bene fit plan design, member eligibility, provider credentials, reimbursement terms, authorization of payment for specific services, clinical outcomes, and financial performance. Both require information from enrollees regarding clinical and social history, exp ressed needs, functional status, and diagnostic tests. Both providers and MCOs may accumulate highly confidential information regarding a person's status as a patient, personal history, diagnosis, and treatment plan. In a fully integrated system, a common data set will be established, and data will be exchanged in a manner that facilitates clinical operations. However, such exchanges increase the risk of violation of consumer confidentiality. (This issue is discussed further in Chapter VIII.) It is importan t to note that the nature of the information processing requirements of MCOs and providers has changed over time. In the early days of managed behavioral health care, MCOs and providers had a fairly adversarial relationship. MCOs were focused on cost contr ol and engaged in utilization review of treatment decisions for the purpose of cost containment. They did not share information, decisionmaking, or financial risk with providers. Provider -sponsored service systems did not exist. Recently, however, MCOs and provider organizations have moved toward more collaborative relationships. Local provider systems increasingly work in partnership with MCOs and perform managed care functions such as utilization review. MCOs and provider systems sometimes share financial risk and work from a common set of clinical decision support protocols. Both provider systems and MCOs are under increased pressure to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and control costs. Exhibit V -1 lists the types of data supplied by the MCO, provider s, and enrollees in the course of operation of a managed care program. Purchasers also supply some information (eligibility data, benefit limits) essential to managed care operations. Purchasers also generate information essential to analysis of the succes s of the managed care program (actuarial projections, payments to MCOs, clinical grievance reports, and audit reports). Exhibit V -1. Some Key Sources and Types of Data in a Managed Behavioral Health Care System MCO-Supplied Data Claims payment Financial accounting Financial trend analyses Triage and referral records Utilization review and authorization of payment Case management Physician review Clinical appeals Disease management protocols (if any) Credentials verification Outcomes data accumulation and analysis Incident reports Provider -Supplied Data Billing Clinical records Treatment plans, including diagnoses Authorization information from the MCO Disease management information from the MCO Clinical credentials Licensure and accreditation information Outcomes and consumer satisf action data per managed care program requirements Serious incident reports Any performance indicators received from the MCO Enrollee -Supplied Data Eligibility information (such as a Medicaid card) Clinical history Social information (family and work) Expressed needs, including symptoms Information on functioning status Testing data Outcomes reports Satisfaction surveys Complaints, grievances, and appeals Resolution of grievances MCO internal operations quality assurance data (response time and consumer satisfaction) Trend analysis and provider performance (clinical efficacy and financial \"value\") D. Basic MIS Operational Features The contract between a public purchaser of managed care and the MCO must address \"nuts and bolts\" operational questions about the data to be supplied, who will supply it, how the data will be exchanged, what data will be maintained, and how the data will be kept secure. The contract must enable the MCO to support daily operatio ns and monitor the integrity of the service system and the performance of network providers. The purchaser must ascertain whether the MCO has the capacity to perform required functions by ensuring that the contract provides for the continued management and improvement of essential functions. This section reviews 13 basic MIS operational features that must be addressed regardless of the purchaser's role in the day -to-day operations of the MIS. 1. Management of Eligibility Information The MCO, network provide rs, and the purchaser share a strong interest in maintaining a current roster of individuals eligible for coverage under the plan. The set of individuals eligible to receive services is likely to change frequently, and the purchaser controls this informati on. The managed care contract should include provisions describing the manner and frequency with which the purchaser will provide eligibility information to the MCO. Such information is usually provided through a tape -to-tape transfer every 30 days, but up dates could be provided more frequently. In Medicaid programs, eligibility can change frequently, and these changes need to be reflected in the eligibility records. These data may be provided electronically through a direct download of data from the State Medicaid agency to the MCO. Alternatively, the MCO or a provider may install a special computer terminal in its offices with direct access to the eligibility database maintained by the purchaser. Different approaches will be used depending on the technical capabilities of purchasers and MCOs. Often, the optimal approach is not used because the cost of establishing direct electronic linkages between the State system and the MCO is prohibitive. These issues should be considered when establishing the startup b udget for the managed care system. The choices made for transferring and maintaining information on eligibility will have an impact on the financial terms of the agreement. Providers, the MCO, or the purchaser may have financial responsibility for mistakes in verification of a person's eligibility. (Some MCO -provider contracts disclaim responsibility for verification of eligibility until claims are paid --effectively transferring to the provider the financial risk of treatment of an uninsured person.) The purchaser may wish to hold the MCO financially responsible by requiring verification of eligibility at the point of initial contact -- that is, by the intake and case management staff. If electroni c access to current eligibility data is not available, it is difficult to transfer that risk to the MCO. The MCO should have a strategy for systems control of eligibility determination and for tracking eligibility over the course of treatment. Such a strat egy requires software to support the collection and maintenance of enrollee information. The MCO must ensure that the enrollee is uniquely identified (see section below on confidentiality considerations). As disputes may arise based on eligibility for spec ific services at a particular time, the MCO must maintain eligibility records detailing the service array and eligibility criteria for a period of time defined by the purchaser. Management of Eligibility Information. Purchasers may wish to address the foll owing in RFPs and contracts: Identify eligibility information management as a required capability, setting the proposed solution as a minimum standard for contract compliance. Define the manner in which eligibility information will be provided to the MCO and to the providers. Define any work to be done during the startup phase of implementation of the plan, including custom programming by the MCO and/or the purchaser, milestones for completion of work, and compensation (if any) for startup costs. Allow for changes to and upgrades of the MCO's eligibility information management capability. Specify for whom and when (such as at the enrollee's first contact) eligibility can be determined. Specify a time period for which the MCO must maintain electronic records of eligibility determinations, so that the purchaser can review dispute resolutions. If the MCO will be asked to implement algorithms in software that calculate eligibility, reference these algorithms as an addendum to the contract, subject to change by t he purchaser on notice and within a specific timeframe. Require the MCO to use a unique purchaser -defined identifier for each enrollee. Specify a timeframe within which the MCO must respond to providers regarding the eligibility of an individual presenting for treatment. 2. Provider Credentialing The MCO's MIS should maintain data on the credentials of individuals providing services to consumers. The purchaser may require that the MCO verify providers' credentials with \"primary sources\" such as licensing bo dies, educational institutions, and malpractice insurance carriers. Primary source verification of provider credentials is required by the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), both of which accredit MCOs.(1) In addition, the MCO should maintain data on each provider's expertise, office locations, hours of operation, specialized programs, and so forth, to facilitate referrals by case managers and intake staff. The purchaser may wish also to require the MCO to demonstrate that all provider information has been verified periodically. The purchaser may require online access to the MCO's provider database to verify provider information and credentialing. Provider Credentialing. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO's MIS to maintain data on individual providers' (1) licensure status; (2) professional a ffiliations; (3) hospital privileges (if applicable); (4) education and training; and (5) board certification. Require primary verification of credentials. Require the MCO's MIS to maintain data on individual providers' (1) office locations; (2) basic demo graphic information (e.g., age, gender, staff characteristics, cultural/ethnic background); (3) days and hours of operation; (4) intake and/or contact number; (5) fee structure (e.g., sliding scale); (6) Medicare/Medicaid participation; and (7) scheduling availability. Require the MCO's MIS to maintain data for individual providers on (1) services provided; (2) specialization by patient age group, disorder, gender and/or sexual orientation; (3) specialty programs; and (4) treatment patterns. Require the MCO 's MIS to maintain data for individual providers on (1) malpractice insurance coverage; and (2) reported incidents. 3. Exchange of Data Between Providers and the MCO The MCO is often involved in the referral of enrollees to different levels of care, monitoring treatment for appropriateness and medical necessity, and monitoring the quality of care delivered by network providers. Much of the information required to fulfill these responsibilities will come from providers. This raises privacy and co nfidentiality issues, which are discussed briefly in the section below on confidentiality considerations and in more detail in Chapter VIII. Purchasers should specify the basic information about all enrollees that must be gathered by the MCO. This informat ion is required to satisfy the State's need to monitor the success of the managed care program and its obligations to report to the Federal Government and others. At a minimum, this information would include a unique enrollee identifier, diagnosis, treatme nt provided by billing (or CPT) code, and fees paid for treatment. In addition, the MCO could be required to secure a sample of data so that clinical outcomes and consumer satisfaction can be analyzed. The RFP should solicit information from potential ven dors on their ability to gather and manage essential information. Means of information exchange may be over the telephone, through written reports, via fax, or through electronic transfer of data between a provider and the MCO. In assessing the viability o f the system proposed by the MCO, the purchaser should consider practical issues, such as the cost to providers of compliance with the MCO's system and the availability of the required technology. It is also important to determine whether the system propo sed by the MCO actually works. There is often a huge gap between a written description of a system's technological capabilities and how the system works in real life. Purchasers should consider whether or not they wish to establish technology standards th at mandate that MCOs and providers exchange information in a particular manner. The ideal MIS would require the MCO and provider organizations to maintain the technical ability to exchange data electronically. Data exchange can be done in a variety of ways . Ideally, the providers and the MCO would have access to a common software system that integrates clinical and financial data. The capacity of provider organizations to participate in electronic data exchange should be considered by purchasers. Exchange of Data Between Providers and the MCO. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify the core set of information that must be gathered by the MCO for all enrollees, including a unique client identifier, diagnosis(es), treatmen t provided by billing (or CPT) code, and fees paid for treatment. Require the MCO to systematically obtain data that can be used to analyze consumer satisfaction, clinical processes, and clinical outcomes. Establish technology standards mandating tha t MCOs and providers exchange information in a particular manner. Require that the MCO use a software system that integrates clinical and financial data. Require the MCO to build the capacity of provider organizations to participate in electronic data exc hange. 4. Standardization of Clinical Assessments A standardized clinical assessment containing key indicators of enrollees' functioning and status should be used whenever possible. The MIS must be capable of maintaining and managing assessment data that s upports initial placement, continuing -stay reviews, and attainment of desired outcomes. In several currently available systems, the assessment interview is conducted with the assistance of a computer, and the entire assessment is captured electronically. W hile not entirely necessary, raw data from the assessment relating to clinical status and level of care could be maintained on the MIS so that the MCO or purchaser could use those data for analysis. The MIS requirements to support this activity include col lection and maintenance of data on clinical criteria and assessment events as well as analytic and online data retrieval capabilities. Standardization of Clinical Assessments. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require that key data elements from assessments be maintained on the MIS. Require that the MIS be capable of retrieving these data as needed. Require that the MIS maintain data from discrete assessments for use in comparative analysis. 5. Outcome Evaluation A managed care program must be evaluated in terms of the value it offers --that is, the extent to which it provides appropriate, high -quality services at a reasonable price. Judgment of the effectiveness of a managed care program solely on the basis of cost may lead to the denial of necessary treatment. As noted in Chapter VI, managed care systems are increasingly making efforts to evaluate clinical outcomes and managed care consumers' satisfaction with the care and services they receive. Typically, outcomes programs will measure changes in clinical status as measured by standard clinical assessment tools and indicated by critical events (relapse, readmission to inpatient treatment) and functional status (ability to work, attend school, and maintain family relationship s), as well as consumer satisfaction. Outcome measurement includes baseline measures using standardized assessment tools and followup assessments during and after completion of treatment. The RFP should solicit input from vendors about the design of the o utcomes measurement system. The contract should then require the MCO to collect and store outcome data. It should specify measures to be used, sampling methodologies, the manner in which data will be accumulated, analyses to be conducted, reports to be pro vided by the MCO, and raw data to be shared with the purchaser. With regard to information processing, the MCO contract should identify the manner in which enrollees, providers, and MCO staff will supply data. It is usually necessary to transfer data from various sources (claims processing, clinical case management, provider assessments, consumer self-evaluation, and satisfaction reports) to establish and maintain an outcomes database. The contract should specify that such a database will be established and should set a schedule for updating it. The contract should address questions related to the transfer of data from the MCO to the purchaser and specify standard data analyses and reports to be shared with the purchaser, providers, and recipients. Outcome Evaluation. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish the fundamental MIS requirements needed to support evaluation of clinical outcomes and consumer satisfaction. Develop or refine the capacity to measure changes in cli nical status as measured by standard clinical assessment tools and indicated by critical events (relapse, readmission to inpatient treatment) and functional status (ability to work, attend school, and maintain family relationships). Establish baseline meas ures in key areas using standardized assessment tools and followup assessments during and after completion of treatment. Establish minimum capacity requirements for the MCO to collect and store outcome data. Specify the measures to be used, sampling metho dologies, manner in which data will be accumulated, analyses to be conducted, reports to be provided, and raw data to be shared with the purchaser. Identify the system and processes through which enrollees, providers, and MCO staff will supply data. Estab lish and maintain a database to which data from various sources (e.g., claims processing, clinical case management, provider assessments, consumer self -evaluation, and satisfaction reports) can be transferred. Specify a standard set of data analyses and re ports designed to be shared with the purchaser, providers, and recipients. 6. Utilization Management and Treatment Authorization Process Service authorization allows for the individual management of each case by MCO staff. The MCO's MIS must efficiently s upport utilization management (UM) personnel in monitoring treatment and outcomes, performing periodic continuing -stay reviews, authorizing payment, and effectively managing the care of enrollees. Providers must be informed about the authorization for each case to support billing and establish limitations on funding for treatment. Purchasers may require that recipients also receive hard copies of service authorizations. Utilization Management and Treatment Authorization Process. Purchasers may wish to addre ss the following in RFPs and contracts: Require that the MCO's MIS links utilization data with clinical data. Ensure flexibility to record and easily access text describing clinical issues. Ensure capacity to input complex clinical data in an efficient manner. Ensure that clinical standards used to determine appropriate utilization be available electronically. Ensure that the MIS has the capability to verify that standards have been applied a ppropriately. Ensure that the payment authorization process uses precertification and continuing -stay determinations as criteria for payment. Ensure capacity to provide recipients and providers with hard copies of authorization decisions. 7. Case Manage ment Case managers (also called service coordinators) work with individuals to ensure that they gain access to all necessary services and that services they receive from different providers are coordinated. The MIS should give the case manager access to th e information needed to coordinate care, and the contract should specify the manner in which this information will be provided. MIS requirements to support case management involve the collection and maintenance of substantial information about the needs of the individual, resources available from the provider network, the individual's treatment plan, comments from treating providers, and information on the benefits remaining under the terms of the plan. The case manager needs timely access to this wide vari ety of information. Case management functions can be performed by the MCO, providers, or specialized personnel. Case managers may also need information about the availability of wraparound services to meet the client's needs (see Chapter III). Case Managem ent. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish MIS requirements to support case management functions involving the real time collection and maintenance of substantial information about the needs of the individual, the in dividual's treatment plan, and comments from current service providers. Establish MIS requirements regarding access standards for obtaining all necessary information about service providers and other resources available from the provider network and about wraparound services. Establish minimum requirements regarding the maintenance of up -to-date information on the benefits remaining under the terms of the plan. Establish minimum requirements regarding the different case management functions that can be pe rformed by the MCO, providers, or specialized personnel. 8. Services Tracking It is essential that the MCO develop a method to capture information on the provision of services to eligible enrollees. These data must be accumulated regardless of whether the MCO pays a provider a fee for each service event or uses some other payment method (see Chapter VII). Service events must be comparable throughout the service system so that standardized measures of intensity and patterns of service provision and associate d costs can be determined. Data on service events are used to identify services individual consumers are receiving, allow analysis of patterns of treatment by different providers, support clinical outcomes research and quality assurance efforts, and suppor t the purchaser's reporting responsibilities. Services Tracking. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to use a standardized method to collect service event data that supports comparison of these events across the provider network. Require that the method used for collecting service event data supports the analysis of clinical practice. Specify standards for service event data (particularly important if the purchaser contracts with more than one MCO). Include de finitions of services, units of measure regarding time and frequency, and the format for data collection. Require that service tracking data be available to case management staff. Require that the MCO be able to associate costs with each category of servic e provided. Require that the MIS maintain detailed data on service events for a purchaser -specified period of time sufficient to allow for retrospective analysis by the purchaser and authorized research organizations. Require that the MCO transmit service event data to the purchaser and specify the formats and frequencies of transmittals. Require the MCO to ensure that the transfer of records complies with Federal confidentiality statutes and regulations (42 C.F.R. Part II). 9. Claims Processing Claims proc essing supports the flow of funds to the provider network from the MCO; it also supports service monitoring and cost analyses. As a provider system must have cash flow to operate effectively, claims processing is a critical issue. The purchaser may retain financial risk associated with provision of service beyond the scope of the managed care contract. For example, the purchaser may be responsible for payment for a service that is not covered under the managed care plan, continued treatment after the limits of coverage have been exceeded, or payment for service to individuals who are not eligible for treatment under the managed care program. The MCO may have agreed to accept full financial risk through a capitation contract, or risks associated with achievem ent of performance targets. The MCO and provider -sponsored service systems may have agreed to share financial risk associated with treatment of a subset of the eligible population. Adjudication of claims in a managed behavioral health care system is a complex enterprise, heavily dependent upon the MIS. Many MCOs have encountered difficulties in the efficient handling of claims payments. Proper claims adjudication requires the system to have access to information about the following: Coverage available u nder the managed care plan, which requires detailed tables to allow precise definition of covered services; limitations of payment by service (i.e., 20 outpatient visits, 30 days of inpatient treatment); excluded services (e.g., \"Rolfing\" therapy, biofeedb ack); and annual or lifetime limits on coverage; Consumer eligibility status at the time of treatment (by referencing the eligibility files); Provider status as a member of the network, qualifications to provide services for which claim was submitted, affiliation with larger provider organization or service system, tax identification, payment address (by referencing the provider database and credentialing files); Fee schedule for payment for services rendered (by referencing the benefit plan and provider fi les); Utilization review authorization of payment for service rendered, by reference to number of units of treatment, level of care, and period of time during which treatment was to be provided (by referencing the utilization review files); Coordination of benefits (by referencing the eligibility files and records of alternative coverage); and Fund to be charged (by referencing MCO financial accounting files). Claims processing software is among the most expensive that an MCO will maintain. The RFP should solicit information from the vendors on the software system that will be used to support this function. The MCO's claims system should be able to exchange information electronically with its clinical management system to ensure proper adjudication of claim s and to apprise case managers, providers, and enrollees of financial resources available to support planned treatment. Claims Processing. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Ensure that the MCO has the capacity to accept c laims from providers in a variety of forms --i.e., via paper, electronic media, and electronically (EDI, or electronic data interchange, a telecommunication standard). Specify a timeframe for the processing of claims that will ensure cash flow to the provid er network and possible penalties for noncompliance. Specify that claims processing data be available and able to be readily formatted into desired reports. Require that claims processing data be transmitted to the purchaser in an acceptable form that meet s the requirements for the purchaser's analysis and external reporting. Require that the MCO support providers' electronic monitoring of claims received, processed, and adjudicated. 10. Implementation of Performance Criteria The purchaser must establish pe rformance criteria to measure the MCO's effectiveness in implementing and managing the contract. Once criteria are established and key performance indicators are determined, the purchaser must ensure the capabilities of the MCO's MIS to collect, manage, an d maintain these critical data. Because much of the information must be collected from network providers, the MCO should be required to show how the information will be collected and managed and how accuracy will be maintained via review activities (e.g., audits). Implementation of Performance Criteria. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify standards for the evaluation of performance measures. Identify key data elements needed to derive the measures. Identify algorithms used to calculate the measures. Indicate the method of transfer of data between the provider and the MCO. Identify facilities needed by the MCO and the provider to collect, transmit, manage, and secure the data. Specify time intervals for transmission of or availability of data. Specify the reports required and the time intervals for submission of such reports to the purchaser. 11. Reporting The MCO should be expected to produce a wide variety of reports to support management decisionmaking, quality manage ment, and quality improvement. The contract should specify the nature of the reports the MCO will be required to prepare, the schedule for preparation of reports, and the groups to whom various reports will be distributed. Different reports may be prepare d for the purchaser, network providers, enrollees, and the public. For example, the purchaser may require comprehensive reports regarding all aspects of operation of the managed care program. Such reports would include claims data, estimates of claims incu rred but not yet reported, patterns of utilization at each level of care, utilization by provider or provider system, utilization by age category, utilization by diagnostic category, readmission rates, clinical outcomes indicators, consumer satisfaction, a nd so forth. The purchaser may require the MCO to share information with network providers to create a \"feedback loop\" regarding each provider's patterns of treatment and cost of service relative to other providers. A feedback loop is particularly importan t if the MCO makes \"economic credentialing\" a condition of continuing provider participation in the network (see Chapter IV). The MCO may be required to prepare a standard \"report card\" on its own performance, as measured by consumer satisfaction, number of people receiving treatment, pattern of treatment across the entire network, and clinical outcomes. The MCO may also be required to produce similar information on specific providers or case manage rs to assist enrollees in their choices. The RFP should solicit information from bidders on the manner in which they will produce reports and ask them to submit sample reports. Many MCOs use software programs that are specifically designed for statistical analysis of data and production of complex reports. The MCO should be able to produce a number of standard reports upon demand and have the flexibility to produce custom reports. Reporting. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts : Specify the standard reports that will be required. Attach samples of standard reports to the contract as exhibits. Include the schedule for production of standard reports. Describe the scope of distribution of standard reports. Specify timeframes for p roduction of custom reports requested by the purchaser and any charges by the MCO for custom reports. Identify data that will be maintained and available for the purpose of producing custom reports, including any aggregation formulas to be applied in analy zing data. Allow modification of reporting requirements as needed, subject to adjustment of MCO fees in the event that the purchaser demands material changes. 12. Quality Assurance As discussed in detail in Chapter VI, an effective quality assurance progr am is an essential aspect of an MCO's operations. Quality management requires regular review of operations and outcomes to determine the effectiveness of services and to ensure that avoidable treatment omissions are not made. A comprehensive, integrated MI S is an excellent tool for implementing such a program. Quality Assurance. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require that the MIS maintain assessment and outcome data electronically for a specified period. Ensure the capab ility of the MIS to compare baseline assessment data with periodic reassessment data. Require the MCO to implement software -driven triggers that alert quality management staff to out -of-the-ordinary occurrences for enrollees or providers or to predetermine d markers of quality (e.g., insufficient followup after inpatient hospitalization). Require the MCO to report actions taken as a result of quality assurance triggers. 13. Incident Reporting Reporting and tracking critical incidents, such as assaults, suici des, and homicides, is an important aspect of the quality management function of the MCO. Timely reporting of critical incidents should be mandated in the contract with appropriate timeframes and level of detail to be reported. Contract provisions addressi ng MIS needs in this area are related to the MCO's ability to accept electronic input from providers of the incident report, maintain and analyze data on the occurrence of these incidents, report them to the purchaser on a timely basis, and provide the pur chaser online access to current information. RFP and contract provisions should address all of these issues. Incident Reporting. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to have the capacity to report and track c ritical incidents. Require the MCO to have the capacity to maintain and analyze the occurrence of these incidents, report them to the purchaser on a timely basis, and record input by providers. E. Confidentiality Considerations One of the most important el ements and expectations of the therapist -patient relationship is confidentiality. Only an individual who pays cash for all clinical services, however, can reasonably expect that the therapist will not reveal anything about the patient to third parties, inc luding the fact that he or she is receiving treatment. This expectation of confidentiality is embodied in State and Federal law. Exceptions are allowed only in circumstances in which a patient gives the therapist reasonable cause to believe that the patien t is likely to harm himself/herself or a third party, or cases of suspected abuse or neglect. (See Chapter VIII for a discussion of laws governing confidentiality of clinical information.) When a third party is obligated to pay for the patient's treatment, confidentiality issues are not as clear cut. Even in a fee-for-service system, an insurance carrier or government agency has access to information indicating that an identified individual received a particular type of treatment. Federal regulations govern ing substance abuse records strongly protect the confidentiality of this information by requiring that patients authorize its release to third -party payers. State laws govern confidentiality of information relating to mental health treatment. Most State la ws allow release of information without specific written authorization to the extent necessary to enable payment of health benefits (e.g., see New York State Mental Hygiene Law \u00a733.13). The risk of breaches of confidentiality are far greater in the context of managed care. Under managed care systems, a third party may demand access to highly personal information for the purpose of deciding that treatment is \"medically necessary\" and therefore reimbursable (see discussion of medical necessity in Chapter III) . This creates a conflict for providers, who wish to protect the confidentiality of those being served but who know that if personal information about consumers is not shared, the MCO will not reimburse the provider for services rendered. There are many si tuations in which consumers have terminated treatment rather than allow their deepest secrets to be shared with third parties. Thus, it is important that MCOs be required to establish policies and procedures requiring network providers to inform patients a bout their confidentiality rights. It is also important that a standard form, approved by the purchaser, be used by an MCO's providers to inform patients of their rights and to secure a patient's permission to release confidential information. The issue of confidentiality is particularly critical in the context of an MIS because confidential information may be released to the MCO. In a fully integrated service system, using the \"ideal\" MIS, confidential information may be passed electronically among a numbe r of parties. Confidential information could even be stored on server computers that are accessible through the Internet. To ensure confidentiality of clinical information, each enrollee should be given a unique identifier --that is, an alphanumeric code d esigned so that no two people in the system have the same identifier and so that all clinical data collected for an individual can be compiled --which is virtually indecipherable. Such an identifier may be the only means of ensuring confidentiality, because data and information from the MCO's and providers' files can be shared across networks with case managers and other State systems. In a system for substance abuse and mental health treatment records, it is critically important that unique identifiers be u sed, that they be secure, and that they are not easy to decipher. The use of entire identifiers such as a Social Security number or name should be avoided. Nevertheless, claims adjudication usually requires the use of name or social security number for acc umulating benefits properly and for sending an explanation of benefits to enrollees. Confidentiality Considerations. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to establish policies and procedures requiring network providers to inform patients about their confidentiality rights. Require the MCO to adopt a standard form, approved by the purchaser, that can be used by its providers to inform patients of their rights and to secure a patient's permission to release conf idential information. Require the MCO to maintain policies and procedures to ensure that identifying and clinical information about patients is not shared within the MCO, except as necessary to enable the MCO to carry out clinical functions. Require the MC O's MIS to have security clearances built in to limit access to patient identifying information and clinical information to only those persons whose job requires such access. Require the MCO to establish a virtually indecipherable unique identifier coding system for enrollees that permits the sharing of data collected on enrollees while preserving their confidentiality. Require that MCO reports not include any information that identifies individual patients (with the exception of reports on critical incide nts or purchaser audits of individual records). Require that to the extent that the MCO's managed care system requires the electronic exchange of confidential information over the Internet or other public data transfer systems, all files will be encrypted, using an encryption system that is commercially available and approved by the purchaser. Require that any servers maintained by the MCO will have \"firewalls\" built in and require multiple levels of security clearances to protect against breaches of secur ity and leakage of confidential information. Require that the MCO agree to abide by all applicable provisions of State and Federal law relating to the release of confidential information in the same manner as the direct provider of treatment services. Requ ire that the MCO notify a consumer in the event of any subpoena of confidential information about him or her to give the consumer the opportunity to seek a court order prohibiting the release of confidential information. Require that the MCO have all its e mployees sign agreements to be bound by the provisions protecting the confidentiality of information about patients, including information about the consumer's identity. Require that the MCO will pay liquidated damages in an agreed -upon amount for every b reach of confidentiality discovered by the purchaser. Require that the MCO and its network providers maintain compliance with the Federal substance abuse confidentiality regulations. F. Ownership and Use of Data An MCO will accumulate a vast amount of data about the delivery of substance abuse and mental health services in the State or county. These data will have value to the MCO, because they can be used to improve operations. The data may also have potential value to third parties, such as large drug com panies, which could learn about the impact of use of their medications in treatment. Drug companies may also want information about prescription patterns by individual providers to be used for direct marketing purposes. Purchasers should protect against t he unauthorized use of data generated in the course of operation of their managed care program. The contract should indicate that the data generated in the course of administration of the program is the property of the purchaser. The MCO may be allowed to use the data for internal purposes. It is important to distinguish between data that apply specifically to the purchaser's managed care program and data that are accumulated by the MCO in the ordinary course of its business. For example, the MCO may have a list of network providers, including their areas of specialization, office locations, and so forth. These data may belong to the MCO. On the other hand, data about the cost of treatment of enrollees are clearly the property of the purchaser. The followi ng provides example text for contract language covering the ownership of data: Purchaser shall be and remain the sole and exclusive owner of any and all data pertaining to the operation of the managed care program(s) that are operated by the MCO on behalf of the Purchaser. (Such data are hereafter referred to as the \"Purchaser Data.\") This includes all Purchaser Data entered into the MCO's MIS System (including without limitation, all Client information, Eligibility data, Claims reports, Utilization report s, and any information from Purchaser's present data processing and information system which shall be transferred and converted, pursuant to the Implementation Plan, to operate on the MCO's MIS System). Neither the MCO nor any of its employees, agents, consultants, or assigns shall have any rights in any of the Purchaser Data in any form including, but not limited to, raw data, stripped data, cumulated data, usage information, and statistical information derived from or in connection with the Purchaser Data . The parties agree that the Contractor shall promptly download for and provide to the Purchaser, at no cost to the Purchaser, all such Purchaser Data in an electronically accessible form upon the termination of this Agreement. This provision shall survive the term or termination of this Agreement (Litwak, 1997). Ownership and Use of Data. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Identify data that belong to the purchaser (such as claims data, standard reports, custom reports, and service utilization data). Also identify any data that will remain the property of the MCO. Prohibit any release of the purchaser's data to third parties without the written permission of the purchaser. Prohibit any publication of analyses of purchaser's data without the written permission of the purchaser. Prohibit any commercial use of purchaser's data. Prohibit aggregation of the purchaser's data with other data maintained by the MCO, except for the purpose of academic research relating to public health and operation of substance abuse and mental health treatment systems. Prohibit any release of data in any form that tends to allow third parties to learn the identity of patients or reveals confidential information about patients. G. Technical Requiremen ts for an MCO's MIS Unless a purchaser is attempting to develop an ideal information processing environment for managed care programs in its State or county or is acquiring an MIS for its own use, it need not attempt to control the exact manner in which the MCO operates its MIS. Nonetheless, it is necessary for the purchaser to be assured that the MIS used by the MCO will function properly and comply with contractual requirements. The purchaser has the right to identify a number of technical requirements that the MCO's MIS will be expected to meet. Some of the technical requirements are discussed below. 1. Industry Standards and Open Architecture In determining the acceptability of an MCO's MIS, the concept of \"open architecture\" is central. The informatio n systems industry has defined very specific standards for systems design supporting transfer of data and communication protocols between computers. The standards determine the ways that data are structured and communicated, that hardware and software oper ate, and that security of data is maintained. When a system adheres to industry standards, it can be said to have an open architecture. In general, for purposes of the contract, the purchaser should ensure that the MCO's MIS meets industry -established standards and has the ability to negotiate and experiment with new or more refined standards. In setting standards, the purchaser should obtain inhouse or other consultation, especially in determining whether and when standards for systems design should confor m to those used by State and other agencies in the geographic area. Because purchasers may contract for services with several MCOs, it is crucial that the purchaser can communicate in the same way with each and that the data the MCOs collect are standardiz ed for analysis and comparison. Industry Standards and Open Architecture. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Ensure the MCO's MIS adheres to industry standards for open architecture. If contracting with several MCOs, standa rdized methods of communicating are used and standardized data are collected. 2. Access to Data To carry out the monitoring function, the purchaser must have access to data on the ongoing operations of the MCO and network providers. By means of contract pr ovisions, the purchaser should require that all data contained in the MCO's MIS be easily retrievable either by direct access or by standard format extractions. a. Direct Access Many purchasers have begun to require direct online access to data maintained on the MCO's MIS. If this is desired, the contract should identify all data sets and elements to which such access is required, including a definition of screens, reports, and specific files. For example, at a minimum the purchaser should have appropriate access to utilization data (such as the number of persons served), and cost data (such as the per person cost per 1,000 enrollees or costs per service unit). However, most MCOs regard such data as proprietary and will wish to restrict online access in cer tain areas. In this case, it is important that the purchaser require the MCO to have an MIS that is sophisticated enough to allow the purchaser access to specified data sets while protecting the rest of the system. As security is a significant issue, subst antial restrictions on direct access may be appropriate for some purchaser staff (see below). b. Standard Format Extractions Without requiring direct access to the MCO's MIS, the purchaser can require that defined data sets be made available at certain spe cified intervals or on demand in a manner that meets the file format requirements of the purchaser's MIS. Typical industry standard file formats to electronically exchange text include ASCII text, C -ISAM, or DBMS - specific constructs available from independ ent manufacturers. The purchaser must then specify the data to be provided in these files and the method of communication (i.e., electronic transfer via standard tape sent by courier or transfer through a specified telecommunications structure). Access to Data. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify all data sets and elements for online access. Specify file formats for standard format extractions of data. 3. Data Storage Requirements The MCO must have the capability to p rovide online access to sufficient data to perform necessary operational functions and analyses. Rather than specify the amount of storage required in terms of hardware capacity for the MCO's MIS, the purchaser should require the MCO to demonstrate that it s hardware provides a sufficient capacity to store data online for a defined period. The MCO will know the size of the data set based on the number of members served, the transactions recorded, and system maintenance storage. When the purchaser specifies a period of time for which these data must be available, the MCO can calculate the amount of storage required. Online availability of data is often required for the current fiscal year and for a defined period before and after the fiscal year to allow for necessary comparative analysis and evaluation. For example, a purchaser may require online storage of 2 years' worth of data (i.e., not archived). Given some defined period, the MCO will be able to calculate its hardware requirements. Archived information should be accessible within a timeframe defined by the purchaser, and the system must be capable of accommodating loading and use of archived data by auditors and other evaluators. Data Storage Requirements. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to demonstrate that its hardware provides sufficient capacity to store data online for a defined period. Specify the timeframe for retrieving archived data. 4. Data Backup The purchaser should require the MCO to protect against loss of the purchaser's data. It can do this by requiring daily, weekly, and monthly backups by the MCO of portions of the data used to operate the managed care program. Backup data should be maintained offsite at a secure location. Similarly, the purchaser should require the MCO to ensure that it maintains offsite backup copies of the software systems used in its operations. Many purchasers also require MCOs to maintain backup power generators in the event of a power failure, or to establish redun dant operating systems at multiple locations to ensure that service to enrollees is not interrupted. Data Backup. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify backup requirements for data. Specify backup power requirements for the MCO's MIS. 5. Security Standards Security is a primary concern in networked systems. Both MCO employees and third parties (including employees of the purchaser) must give careful consideration to security regardin g access to the MCO's MIS. The contract should include provisions requiring strict enforcement of industry security standards and technology. Because of the confidential nature of information about behavioral health care treatment, only authorized persons should have access to data about patients. The contract should require the MCO to demonstrate its capability to adhere to industry -established security standards, with multiple levels of security clearance related to user category and point of access. Secu rity clearances should be tied to specific system functions, data elements, screens, and reports. Security Standards. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require adherence to industry security standards and technology. Speci fy security clearances tied to specific system functions, data elements, screens, and reports. 6. Telecommunications Capabilities Telecommunications is a critically important part of the managed care information processing system. The RFP should solicit in formation about the telecommunications capabilities of the bidders. The MCO telecommunications system should be capable of handling a large volume of telephone calls, appropriately transferring calls within the MCO system, and monitoring the source of call s, the number of rings before a call is answered, the \"call abandonment\" rate (hang ups before a call is answered), and the duration of calls by MCO employees. The MCO should be able to provide detailed reports in each of these areas. This information can be invaluable in monitoring the responsiveness of the MCO to enrollees and providers and the nature and quality of the work performed by the MCO's clinical staff. Many MCOs are now connecting telephone switching systems with computer systems. When the pho ne rings, the computer automatically calls up records that tie to the phone number of the caller. This allows more personal interaction with the caller. If the caller is transferred to another staff member of the MCO, the computer file is automatically tra nsferred as well. The RFP and contract should establish minimum criteria for the telecommunications capability of the MCO. In addition, they should define expectations related to the transfer of electronic data between the purchaser and the MCO, between t he MCO and network providers, and specified government agencies. Some purchasers may require MCOs to maintain dedicated high -speed telecommunications lines for that purpose. The MCO's telecommunications system should be installed and tested well before the startup date of the managed care program. Telecommunications Capabilities. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require that the MCO's MIS meet industry -established standards and be able to negotiate and experiment with new or more refined standards. Require that all data contained in the MIS be easily retrievable either by direct access or by standard format extractions. Require that hardware provides a sufficient capacity to store data online for a defined period. Require that archived information be accessible within a timeframe defined by the purchaser. Require that the archiving system be capable of accommodating the loading and use of archived data by auditors and other evaluators. Require protection against loss of th e purchaser's data through a purchaser approved backup schedule. Require adherence to industry -established security standards, with multiple levels of security clearance related to user category and point of access. Establish minimum criteria for the tele communications capability, including the capability of handling (and reporting on) the management of a large volume of telephone calls, including appropriately transferring calls within the MCO system, monitoring the source of calls, the number of rings be fore a call is answered, the \"call abandonment\" rate (hang ups before a call is answered), and the duration of calls by MCO employees. Establish minimum expectations related to the transfer of electronic data between the purchaser and the MCO, between the MCO and network providers, and the MCO and specified government agencies. Require dedicated high -speed telecommunications lines for the transfer of electronic data. H. Procurement of an MIS by a Purchaser for its Own Use This chapter is not intended as a comprehensive guide for purchasers wishing to acquire an MIS for their own use or as a standard for use by providers in their jurisdiction. However, some State and county governments may be interested in acquiring an MIS to enable them to play an active role in the operation of a managed substance abuse and mental health service system. Federal financial participation in the cost of design and procurement of \"Automatic Data Processing\" (ADP) systems used to manage public assistance programs (including Me dicaid) is available to State and county governments. Procedures for Federal approval of MIS plans developed by States and counties, and conditions of Federal participation are described in the Code of Federal Regulations (45 C.F.R. 95.601 et. seq.). Fede ral funds are available to offset the cost of MIS planning, MIS design, and procurement of MIS software and equipment. The Health Care Financing Administration must approve in advance any plans involving an Medicaid expenditure greater than $5 million doll ars ($5,000,000.00). Federal regulations require that States or counties will have all ownership rights in all software or software modifications (including documentation) that is custom developed for the State or county, and for which Federal financial pa rticipation is claimed. In addition, the Federal Government reserves a royalty free, perpetual license to use the software to support Federal operations. These requirements do not apply to pre -existing software sold to the State or county at established pr ices. Federal financial participation is not, however, available to offset the cost of purchasing proprietary software \"developed specifically for the public assistance programs covered under this section.\" The \"ideal\" MIS described in this chapter is atta inable. It requires a cost commitment, a great deal of planning, and a commitment to install the system in cooperation with key agencies and provider organizations over an extended period of time. However, the more sophisticated the system is, the more dif ficult it will be to attain the ideal. Complex systems will be more dependent on data standards. Nevertheless, most of the objectives of the ideal system are obtainable. Reliable software designed to support \"mission critical\" functions is usually the hard est piece of the MIS to find. Mission critical functions are functions that enable an organization to complete essential work processes. The capabilities necessary include recording essential clinical information about service recipients, maintaining finan cial information about the mental health and/or substance abuse health benefit plan, accessing and analyzing data about the service system, and allowing those who work together in the service system to communicate effectively and work more efficiently. In addition to meeting technical requirements, the software licensing agreement should include the elements shown in Exhibit V -2. Though mission critical software is an important component and may be quite expensive, software represents a fraction of the cost of implementing a complex MIS. Hardware, local and wide area network communications systems, training, and local system maintenance are the most expensive to develop and maintain. Implementation plannin g and the technical ability to maintain systems locally are critically important to successful deployment of a new MIS. Procurement of an MIS. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require software vendors to use an \"open syst ems\" architecture to allow easier exchange of data with other systems. Require software vendors to use a system built on a relational database to ensure that it can be scaled upwards to meet the requirements of the purchaser. Require software vendors to be in compliance with JCAHO, American Hospital Association, and other accreditation standards applicable to health care software systems. Require software vendors to be in compliance with various generally accepted standards for software design, including: H L7, OLE 2.0, MAPI 1.0, TAPI 2.0, and SAPI 1.0 standards. Require software vendors to maintain the ability to generate all reports required by the NCQA, including HEDIS (the Health Employer Data and Information Set) 3.0 and successors. Require the software vendor's software license agreements include appropriate provisions pertaining to the scope of the license, acceptance testing, performance standards, ownership of the product, maintenance, indemnification, data integrity, year 2000 functionality, documentation, and \"help\" systems. The decision by a State or local governmental agency to purchase an inhouse MIS rather than to purchase the MIS services of an MCO is a critical one. The purchase of an inhouse MIS means that all of the functions described in this chapter should be considered during the procurement of a vendor to provide software, hardware, and/or telecommunicat ions products and support. The purchase of an inhouse MIS puts much more control of the process into the hands of the purchaser but also brings with it accountability and responsibility for the end result. Exhibit V -2. Software Licensing Agreement: Key Elements The software licensing agreement should include the following elements: Scope of license. This can be based on references to the number of users of the software, the number of workstations, the number of servers upon which a networked software system is installed, or by reference to the scope of activities of the purchaser. Other than price, this is the most critical financial component of the agreement. Acceptance testing. The purchaser should have the opportunity to test the software to be sure that it mee ts agreed -upon performance standards before being obligated to pay the full price for the product. Performance standards. The system should meet minimum standards for speed of data processing and changing of software scr eens, given the purchaser's hardware, network, and communications configuration. Ownership of the product. Protection for the purchaser should be ensured in the event that a third party claims that the software vendor mi sappropriated intellectual property. Maintenance. An agreement by the vendor to repair \"bugs\" promptly and to respond to problems experienced by the purchaser in accordance with their severity should be included. Indem nification. Indemnification of the purchaser against the vendor's violation of the trade secrets or other intellectual property rights of third parties, as well as violation of the Health Insurance Accountability and Portability Act of 1996, should be incl uded. Data integrity. The purchaser should receive assurances that the software will not corrupt the integrity of the purchaser's data. Year 2000 functionality. The purchaser should be protected against inaccurate functioning on or after January 1, 2000. Documentation. Complete and accurate documentation of all software functionality should be included. \"Help\" systems. Both written and electronic \"help\" systems for users should be included. 1. JCAHO accreditation and NCQA review are voluntary. The purchaser may wish to require primary source verification independently. CHAPTER VI Quality Management Key issues in this chapter: Framework for evaluating quality: structural, process, and outcome measures Accreditation of MCOs and other providers Report cards on MCOs Measures of consumer and family satisfaction Quality management systems for MCOs Although cost cont ainment has been the dominant catalyst behind the move to managed care systems, there is now strong and growing interest in evaluating and improving the quality of care. Quality of care has been defined as the degree to which health services for individual s and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge (IOM, 1990a). Driving the new interest in quality of care are improved methods for assessing quality; increased competition for con tracts; concern about the effects of incentives in managed care contracts for undertreatment and restricted access ; and a growing demand for accountability by Federal, State, and county governments (IOM, 1996; Meyer, 1997; Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Quality standards can vary, but there is a consensus emerging about the aspects of service delivery and treatment outcomes that should be measured to assess the system of care. The measures and mechanisms chosen in different managed care initiatives to ass ess and improve the quality of care and increase the accountability of managed care organizations (MCOs) will vary substantially depending on the circumstances (IOM, 1996). A purchaser of managed care can use a well -written contract to establish what stan dards of quality it expects from an MCO and to specify how quality will be defined, monitored, and managed. One of the most notable developments in purchaser contracting practices in recent years is the increased reliance on establishing minimum standards of MCO performance and the development of measures to determine whether MCOs are meeting those standards. The following language from a contract between the State of Massachusetts and a health maintenance organization (HMO) illustrates how a purchaser may provide an MCO with detailed contract language on both the standard it expects the MCO to meet and the measure that the purchaser will use to determine whether the MCO is meeting the standard (Rosenbaum et al., 1997): Standard: \"The HMO shall maintain an o ngoing formal process to develop and adopt clinical practice guidelines for conditions which have traditionally exhibited high cost and/or high variation among Provider treatment methodologies. Guidelines should combine the best available scientific eviden ce, outcomes, and expert opinion in the specialty for which the guideline is being developed and should be developed in conjunction with the Provider network to assure maximum acceptance. The HMO shall further demonstrate that such protocols have been impl emented and that measurement of compliance with the guidelines is occurring. Measure: The HMO shall select two clinical practice guidelines, including at least one of the following: asthma management, prenatal care, substance abuse or pregnancy, and a seco nd guideline of the HMO's choice. For each of the two clinical guidelines selected, the HMO shall document: (a) the process for the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines to participating Providers and members; (b) how the HMO incorp orates scientific evidence, expert opinions, and the opinions of network providers and expert clinicians outside of the network into such guidelines; and (c) an ongoing evaluation process for the purpose of updating and revising the clinical practice guide lines, as indicated by current medical practice standards.\" This chapter presents a framework that may help purchasers in thinking about quality. It also discusses issues that purchasers should consider when developing provisions related to quality managem ent in requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts. The chapter covers the following topics: Framework for evaluating quality: structural, process, and outcome measures; Accreditation of MCOs and other providers; Repor t cards on MCOs, such the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0); Consumer and family satisfaction measures; and Internal and external quality management systems for MCOs. A. Framework for Evaluating Quality: Structural, Process, and Outcome Measures When purchasers are developing their strategies for using a contract with an MCO to ensure a certain level of quality, they may find Donabedian's conceptual framework for evaluating the qua lity of care useful (Donabedian, 1980, 1982, 1985). Donabedian identified three distinct categories of measures used to evaluate the quality of care: (1) structural measures; (2) process measures; and (3) outcome measures. Process measures are currently t he dominant type of quality measures in managed behavioral health care contracts. As discussed below, however, there is growing interest in the use of outcome measures, and MCOs are increasingly allocating resources to outcome measures to maintain a compet itive position in the industry. There is less emphasis on the use of structural measures of quality in managed behavioral health care contracts than on the use of either process or outcome measures. The use of each of these three types of measures of quali ty in managed behavioral health care is discussed further below. Framework for Evaluating Quality: Structural, Process, and Outcome Measures Structural Measures Measures pertaining to the capacities, technologies, and infrastructure that make up the structure of care (e.g., management information system, number and types of staff, types of facilities, size and composition of an MCO's provider network) Process Measures Mesures pertaining to the administrative, clinical, and other processes by which care is provided Outcome Measures Measures pertaining to the orucomes of care(e.g.,reductions in drug use, amelioration of symptoms of depression) SOURCE: Donabedian,1980,1982,1985. 1. Process Measures of Quality Process measures of quality --which in the field of behavioral health care are frequently referred to as \"performance measures\" --are generally of three main types: (1) measures of administrative processes (e.g., an MCO's customer service practices, and clai ms payment proficiency); (2) measures of clinical processes (e.g., an MCO's compliance with patient placement criteria, provision of relapse prevention training, continuity of care); and (3) measures of financial/utilization processes (e.g., population pen etration rates, utilization patterns, and claims targets) (Oss, 1994). Process measures typically measure activities that are believed to lead to positive outcomes. The use of process measures is based on a belief that improving the process of care will yi eld improved outcomes. Purchasers should recognize, however, that not all process measures relate to, or even correlate with, outcome measures. Although the managed behavioral health care industry is attempting to develop a consensus on the most valuable p rocess indicators to use (see the April 1997 issue of Behavioral Healthcare Tomorrow ), little research has been directed toward the relationships between specific process measures and actual outcomes. Furthermore, little is known about the efficacy of proc ess measures to predict outcomes consistently across patient groups (McLellan et al., 1996). Some of the potential benefits and limitations of process measures of quality are identified in Exhibit VI -1. To be most useful, process measures must be based on reliable, accurate, and complete data and relate clearly to the outcome being sought. If process measures are used properly, they can provide purchasers of managed substance abuse and mental health services, MCOs, consumers, and others with valuable inform ation that can facilitate efforts to monitor, evaluate, and improve the quality of care. Exhibit VI -1. Process Measures: Benefits and Cautions Potential Benefits Measures provide operational and measurable representations of performance. Measures establish a base upon which to set standards to be attained by the MCO. Measures increase overall accountability of the MCO. Measures create opportunities to monitor and improve performance over time. Measures provide a vehicle for implementing quality improvement initiatives or corrective action plans. Measures provide a structure for financial incentives and sanctions. Measures est ablish a framework for comparing performance in specified areas across health care systems. Measures provide useful information to individuals and businesses to aid in their Cautions/Limitations Measures can easily be based upon data that are not complete, accurate, reliable, and/or valid. Measures based on data from an MCO's management information system (MIS) are subject to distortion, misinterpretation, and, in some cases, misrepresentation. The validity of many measures may be questionable; some measures may be imperfect representations of the issues they attempt to address. Case-mix risk adjustments, critical in accurately interpreting process and outcomes measures, are seldom included. 2. Outcome Measures of Quality Outcome measures of quality have begun to receive much attention in the behavioral health care field. Although there is much evidence to support the effectiveness of prevention, treatment, a nd rehabilitation for substance abuse and mental health disorders (Hubbard, 1989; IOM, 1990a; McLellan et al., 1996; Simpson & Sells, 1990) evidence developed in other States or systems of care is often not perceived by State legislatures and the public as applicable to local systems of care. Consequently, the purchasers of behavioral health care services are often challenged to defend the expenditures to a skeptical legislature and public and to demonstrate that such services are resulting in positive outc omes and measurable societal benefits. Furthermore, some MCOs are beginning to propose outcome - based reimbursement arrangements as a means to circumvent what they perceive to be purchasers' overemphasis on price factors (Meyer, 1997). Neither the mental he alth nor the substance abuse fields have achieved a high degree of consensus about specific outcome measures to use and what indeed constitutes treatment success.(1) Thus, for example, the addiction treatment field continues to struggle with the controversial issue of whether treatment goals for persons with substance use disorders should be directed toward abstinence from all substance use or whether reduced use can be a viabl e goal for some populations. In the mental health field, a similar struggle is sometimes noted over whether symptom reduction or symptom recovery (\"cure\") should be the ultimate goal for those with mental illnesses. For an adult with severe mental illness , individually determined goals might include securing a job, regular housing, enough income to live on, and a social network. For a child with a serious emotional disturbance, goals might include an improved level of functioning in school, at home, and wi th peers. For an individual with severe substance dependence, goals may include decreased quantity and frequency of substance use, reduced symptoms, reduced involvement with the criminal justice system, lower medical costs, and improved vocational or emplo yment status (as currently measured in the States of Minnesota, California, and Oregon) (McLellan et al., 1996). Exhibit VI -2 lists some research -based behavioral health care outcome measures from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Managing Managed Car e (IOM, 1997). (Appendix G lists examples of other potential outcome measures in behavioral health care, along with several potential process measures.) Exhibit VI -2. Research -Based Behavioral Health Care Outcome Measures 1. Percentage of individuals who show reductions in symptoms; 2. Percentage of patients who show improved functioning; 3. Number of patients who return to work; 4. After return to work, average number of consecutive days worked without absences; 5. For ch ildren and adolescents, number who return to school; 6. For children and adolescents, average number of consecutive days in attendance at school; 7. Number of clients returning to earlier levels of treatment; 8. Number of clients who are able to live indep endently in the community; 9. Number of clients whose substance -free status is validated through regular breath and urine testing; and 10. Number of clients who increase participation in community activities. SOURCE: IOM, Managing Managed Care: Quality Imp rovement in Behavioral Health, 1997. The purchasers of managed behavioral health care should be prepared to include a well -defined plan for outcome measurement in the contract. Given that the development and use of outcome measures in managed behavioral health care systems are still in the early stages, a purchaser should use caution in selecting the outcome measures. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining outcome data must be weighed against t he value of the data. Factors to take into consideration include the validity of the data and the reliability and accuracy of the information they provide, costs of data collection, its utility for making corrective decisions, and consistency with confiden tiality requirements. In addition, outcomes must be selected that can be precisely measured, such as psychiatric hospitalization readmission rates, or the percentage of increase in school attendance among children, or a decrease in criminal justice system involvement. If available resources are very limited, the purchaser may wish to consider implementing the outcome measurement system in stages; building on it as resources become available and experience is acquired. A Resource for Information on Outcomes Monitoring Purchasers interested in developing outcome -measurement systems for substance abuse and mental health treatment services may wish to review the Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) developed by the Center f or Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) titled Developing State Outcomes -Monitoring Systems for Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment (CSAT, 1995a). This TIP describes useful principles and techniques for designing outcomes - monitoring systems, establishing policies and viable infrastructures for monitoring and evaluating the outcome measures designed, and selecting a feasible number of outcome measures that best reflect the goals of the contract. Examples of outcomes -monitoring systems developed in various States ar e described in the TIP. In selecting outcome measures, the purchaser should be aware that different stakeholders --for example, the legislature, the courts, the health care system, consumer and family groups, various social and public health agencies --may take a substantial interest in the types of outcome measures used. Their goals and expectations, which often vary dramatically and may conflict, can result in strong pressures on the purchaser of managed behavioral health care services to devote finite resources to an expansive, all -inclusive set of measures that does not include a measure of whether individuals receiving care actually get better. Clinical outcomes for individual patients (e.g., improvements in cognitive functioning, reduction in cocain e use) may not be of primary interest to some stakeholders. In an analysis of outcomes desired by various stakeholders, McLellan and Weisner (1996) found that few stakeholders sought \"direct\" treatment outcomes; rather, they called for broader societal ben efits such as \"reduced crime, improved health status, prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, reduction of unsafe sexual practices, improved employment, and improved family functioning.\" Because measurement of outcomes is a complex undertakin g and can require significant financial and staff resources, only a limited number of measures may be feasible. Alternatively, purchasers may want to limit the tracking of certain outcomes to specific population groups rather than all enrollees. 3. Structu ral Measures of Quality Structural measures of quality refer to a wide range of \"tangibles\" that are part of the health care system and are believed to be positively related to outcome, or at least increase the chances that outcome will be positive. Struct ural measures of quality include capacities, technologies, and infrastructure that, when present, would be perceived by most to be related to higher quality processes and outcomes of treatment. Thus, for example, better facilities, telecommunications, offi ce equipment, a management information system (MIS), and staffing in a hospital would seem to enhance the institution's capacity to provide high -quality services, all things being equal. Licensing of facilities usually relies heavily on structural measures of quality. Requirements concerning the size of rooms and hallways, sanitation, medical records, fire detection, staffing, etc. ensure that the physical facilities and clinical support systems are adequate to support the program. Although meeting these re quirements does not ensure a good treatment outcome, not meeting them could potentially create conditions that would ensure a poor outcome, for example, an undetected fire. Accreditation standards (discussed later in this chapter) also consider structural features, such as staff training, staff size, medical record organization and content, infection control, and quality assurance/improvement systems. These standards are extremely important in encouraging the development of systems that will actually improv e outcome. Facilities and programs are increasingly understanding the value of nicely landscaped grounds, good lighting, and decorative art. These structural features help create the perception, or an expectation, that the program has the potential to provide quality outcomes. These \"placebo\" effects may be quite effective at improving the potential for good outcomes. Purchasers should specify what structural measures will be required as part of the managed care system under development. F or example, having comparable facilities for serving private - and public -pay clients, living in different areas, might be required. 4. Quality Measures for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: Similarities and Differences It is important for purcha sers of managed behavioral health care services to distinguish between quality measures that can be applied effectively to both substance abuse and mental health populations and those that are appropriate for one population or the other (as well as those t hat are appropriate for children). While many process and outcome measures can be applied both to mental health and to substance abuse treatment, an optimal set of measures for individuals with severe mental illness will differ in many ways from a set of m easures for individuals with addictive illness. Similarly, the most appropriate measures for children and adolescents may be quite different from those used for adults. An IOM committee that studied managed behavioral health care identified the following g eneral outcome areas that can be applied to a broad cross -section of consumers of both substance abuse and mental health treatment services (IOM, 1996): improvement in employment or vocational status, medical status, family and social functioning, legal problem status, cognitive functioning, and quality of life. Expected outcomes and the processes necessary to achieve given outcomes may differ depending on an individual's diagnosis, the severity of the problem, the drug(s) of abuse, age, and the stage of il lness or recovery. Thus, for example, the purchasers should not expect all process and outcome measures to be equally applicable for severely mentally ill adults, individuals with long -term heroin addiction, adults with major depression, children with seve re emotional disturbances, and adolescents with comorbid mental and addictive disorders. Structural, Process, and Outcome Measures of Quality. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Include the input of consumers when establish ing measures that are relevant to them; patient satisfaction data alone are insufficient and easily \"gamed\" by surveyors. Ensure that outcome measures are measurable and limited enough so they can be tracked and used to improve treatment. Identify, precise ly define, and/or provide all performance measures that the MCO is required to develop and/or implement (e.g., claims paid, clinical records, satisfaction, and per capita cost analysis). Specify performance measures and standards to which incentives or san ctions are attached. Clarify purchaser quality monitoring activities, including reviews of performance measures, clinical records, grievance and appeal data, enrollment/disenrollment data, terminations, utilization and financial data, and management system s and procedures. Require that the MCO have or develop the technological capacity to fulfill all contractually stipulated responsibilities related to the collection and measurement of performance indicators and outcome measures. Define the process by which disagreements, misinterpretations, or ambiguities about measures will be resolved. Delineate the MCO's responsibilities about the integrity of the data and reporting requirements. Establish standards for validation and verification of reported performance data. Require compliance with State and/or Federal reporting requirements. Specify the processes and mechanisms by which the quality management staff and structures of the MCO and purchaser will communicate. Require that funds be set aside by the MCO to c onduct outcome studies. Specify the required capabilities, flexibility, and resource intensity of the MCO's outcomes measurement system. Require the MCO to collect, analyze, and develop periodic reports with data on specified outcomes for specific subpopul ations. Specify appropriate outcome measures for different populations (e.g., persons with long -term mental illness, individuals who are homeless and abuse substances, children with severe emotional disturbances). Require that the MCO collaborate with the State, county, and/or local mental health and/or substance abuse authorities in outcome -related evaluation initiatives. Require that the MCO make staff, data, and other relevant resources available to the evaluators representing the purchaser. Establish gu idelines for phasing in outcome measurement, using established baseline measures wherever feasible. B. Accreditation of MCOs and Other Providers The purchaser of managed behavioral health care services must decide whether to require an MCO to have specific accreditation to be eligible to bid for the contract and whether to require accreditation for all or some types of network providers. A number of organizations systematically assess the clinical and administrative operations of individual providers, MCOs, and other health care delivery systems and institutions and accredit them if they comply with predetermined standards. Many of the standards used in accreditation are structural measures of quality (see earlier discussion in this chapter). Public and priv ate payment programs often require accreditation as a condition of payment for covered services. The activities of four of the most well -known national accrediting organizations that review behavioral health care organizations --the Joint Commission on Accr editation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation (formerly the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, or CARF), and the Council on Accre ditation of Services for Families and Children (COA) --are described in Exhibit VI -3.(2) In many cases, accreditation by these organizations has become a necessary, but not suf ficient, requirement to be competitive in a managed care environment. However, very few MCOs serving persons with substance abuse and mental health disorders have been accredited by these organizations. Exhibit VI -3.

Built on strong consumer -centered philosophy that enco urages active consumer involvement in all activities, including collaborating in the development of individual treatment plans. Developed program standards regarding access issues. As of June 1997, over 13,000 programs accredited. Council on Accre ditation of Services for Families and Children (COA) 120 Wall Street, 11th Floor New York, NY 10005 Created quality standards for more than 5 0 types of services more closely related to behavioral health care and social services than to the medical model of delivery. Services include individual outpatient programs, day treatment programs, developmental disabilities services, day Phone: for children, and numerous others. Accredits about 3,000 social service programs and 1,000 behavioral health programs . Apart from national accrediting organizations, States accredit and license organizations, such as those based on the PACT (Program for Assertive Community Treatment) model, consumer -run clubhouses, and those providing partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, and intensive case management services for persons with severe men tal illnesses and substance abuse disorders. Accreditation of these organizations generally involves systematic assessments of clinical and administrative structures. In some cases, jurisdictions have moved to or are experimenting with national accreditati on as a replacement for State or local licensing (e.g., Michigan, North Dakota pilot program, and the Veteran's Affairs mandate for CARF accreditation for all behavioral health and vocation programs under their Prescription for Change initiative). Mandatin g the accreditation of MCOs and/or service providers may have both benefits and drawbacks for a purchaser of managed substance abuse and mental health services. The obvious advantage of requiring MCOs and/or service providers to obtain this \"seal of approv al\" is that it provides reasonable assurance that the clinical and administrative operations of the accredited organization have met basic standards of quality in terms of process and outcomes. However, several problems related to current accreditation pra ctices have been noted (Horvath and Kaye, 1995; IOM, 1996; Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1997): The costs of going through an accreditation process can be prohibitive, especially when personnel costs and time are considered and requiring accreditat ion could eliminate viable MCOs or programs from bidding on the contract. There is redundancy among accreditation standards from different accrediting agencies. National MCOs, managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs), and other health care delivery systems often obtain accreditation from several different agencies to meet the requirements of various purchasers, which results in costly duplication of effort. Private accreditation standards are frequently vague and do not take into account many issues particularly important in the public sector (e.g., access, grievance procedures, and enrollee rights); additional standards may need to be developed. Accreditation standards often duplicate State licensing requirements. Current accreditation standards for behavioral health care are generally less refined than general health care measures and often emphasize structural and administrative process issues that do not adequately address the quality of clinical services. In response to these and other issues, t he Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1996) has questioned the utility and validity of accreditation in the current health care environment and has encouraged accreditation agencies to focus their standards on the most relevant issues, to examine the use of \"deem ing\" (accepting another entity's standards and/or review process in place of one's own in some or all areas), and to consolidate the multitude of accreditation standards from various organizations to reduce overlap and redundancy. Accreditation. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify whether the MCO, network providers, and/or subsets of network providers must be accredited. Specify the type or types of accreditation required. Establish any timeframes within which an org anization(s) must obtain accreditation, if not already accredited. Specify the consequences of losing accreditation, having the accreditation downgraded, or not achieving it within a specified period. Ensure compliance with relevant State licensing require ments and other applicable standards for MCOs, HMOs, and substance abuse and mental health treatment providers. Specify policies regarding \"deeming,\" and clarify how providers can request that an existing accreditation be deemed acceptable. C. Report Cards on MCOs Purchasers are increasingly using \"report cards\" to monitor the performance of MCOs. Report cards present systematically organized data on standardized sets of measures, often with associated minimum standards, about MCOs and/or health care providers. Purchasers, MCOs, consumers, and others can then examine and compare objective information about the clinical and administrative processes of different MCOs. Widespread use of report cards on MCOs promises to increase standardization of me asures and data -gathering procedures across a variety of behavioral health care systems. It should be noted, however, that most report cards are designed for adult services rather than services for children or adolescents. Report cards can be developed by any purchaser or organization. Four nationally recognized report cards that are increasingly being used by purchasers to assess the quality and performance of those MCOs managing behavioral health care services are these (see Exhibit VI -4): The Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) prepared by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA); Performance -Based Measures for Managed Behavioral Health Care Programs (PERMS) prepared by the American Manag ed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA); County Behavioral Healthcare Measures prepared by the National Association of County Behavioral Health Directors (NACBHD); and The Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) prepared by the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS). Industry norms such as HEDIS and PERMS are developed on the basis of data from the existing administrative database (e.g., telephone answering rates) that does not necessarily include data on certain types of outcomes tha t may be important to purchasers. Improvements in social functioning or employment, for example, are not part of an administrative database. Should a purchaser want to obtain data on these types of outcome measures, it must be willing to invest in both inf rastructure development and the collection of data. The acquisition of standardized and reliable information about these outcomes would require a significant commitment and investment on the part of the purchaser. Exhibit VI -4.

Measures of Consumer and Family Satisfaction Measurement of consumer and family satisfaction with behavioral health care services is increasingly becoming an integral component of quality monitoring efforts. Purchas ers are therefore including these measurements as a quality - monitoring tool in contracts with MCOs. Indeed, the voices of consumers, their families, and others who support consumer recovery can provide valuable information to the purchaser about the streng ths and weaknesses of an MCO and its network of providers. Consequently, a growing number of purchasers are attaching financial incentives or sanctions to MCO performance in this area (Petrila, 1996; Ruggeri, 1994). Assessment of consumer satisfaction can empower consumers and send a strong message to providers that such a focus is valued. Yet despite the value of consumer satisfaction measures for assessing quality, the purchaser should be aware that many challenges are associated with such measures and t hat findings related to satisfaction may need to be interpreted with caution. Some evidence suggests that even when MCOs primarily serving Medicaid beneficiaries have weaker ratings on performance measures for quality and access, enrollees are still as lik ely to indicate satisfaction with these plans as are individuals enrolled in private insurance plans that have significantly higher performance ratings (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). A recent literature review of the measurement of consumer satisfaction summar ized the challenges currently associated with measurement of consumer satisfaction. These challenges are identified in the box below. Challenges in Measuring Consumer Satisfaction There is no widespread consensus about the definition and appropriate measurement of satisfaction. Very complex relationships exist between consumer satisfaction and quality of care, consumer demographics, provider profi les, and treatment outcomes. Design and implementation of surveys for special populations (such as those with substance abuse and mental health problems treated in the public sector) are far from exact sciences. Tools used to measure satisfaction with be havioral health treatment have been less rigorously evaluated for reliability and validity than tools for general health care. Satisfaction surveys often yield high and undifferentiated levels of satisfaction. Consumer responses are sensitive to the meth od of administration and can be affected by social desirability (the tendency of respondents to answer in a way that would please the person administering or issuing the survey). Survey questions and results are often more a reflection of basic access (e. g., answering phones) and administrative efficiency of the MCO than of the quality of clinical services. Surveys require sufficient brevity to generate adequate response rates, yet they must be specific enough to suggest actions that may be taken to impro ve the particular situation. Some researchers have found no relationship between consumer satisfaction and quality of care and some have even found an inverse relationship. Given the challenges of conducting consumer satisfaction surveys, many purcha sers are now including alternative mechanisms to assess the experience and satisfaction of enrollees with the MCO and its network providers. These include focus groups, in -depth interviews from samples of enrollees, and face -to-face surveys using consumers or family members as interviewers. Consumer satisfaction teams can also be used. These teams, which are consumer - run programs, serve as a monitoring and feedback mechanism in the system and can be given the authority to provide feedback to upper managemen t of the MCO and/or purchaser. In addition, there is a current effort to adapt for behavioral health care the Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Study of the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). The purchaser may also wish to consider periodically assessing, or having the MCO assess, the satisfaction and opinions of key providers in the MCO's network as well as other organizations with which the MCO has an ongoing relationship. In the private sect or, such mandated provider surveys are generally conducted by external parties. Surveyed organizations may include network providers; State and county mental health, substance abuse, social service, and other government agencies; consumer and family advoca cy groups; and any other organization whose perspective would help illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the MCO's performance. If the purchaser wants the MCO to conduct the surveys, the purchaser should define its role in approving the surveys and co ntrolling how survey results can be used in marketing initiatives. Measuring Consumers' Satisfaction. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to include input from providers, consumers, families, and other stake holders in the development, implementation, evaluation, and refinement of satisfaction measurement systems and tools. Require that all satisfaction measurement tools and processes have the approval of the purchaser before implementation. Ensure that any su rveys used, and processes followed, are methodologically sound (e.g., use adequate sampling and weighting techniques). Determine the frequency of surveys based on the intended use of the information. Specify that a standardized base of questions, data elem ents, and measurement processes (including guidance on sample size, timeframes, and response rate) must be used on surveys and other tools to facilitate comparisons across all levels of care (additional questions and data elements for different levels can be added to this base to allow programs and health care systems to individualize their tools). Require the MCO to supplement any surveys it conducts with additional, possibly more meaningful, mechanisms for understanding consumer views, such as focus group s or in -depth interviews conducted by family members or consumers. Require the use of nationally standardized report cards (e.g., HEDIS, PERMS) or the use of selected consumer - oriented measures, to allow comparison to other health care systems. Require per iodic assessment of complaints, disenrollments, and requests to change facilities and providers. Require systematic followup of survey findings, including identification and investigation of sources of dissatisfaction, development and implementation of a c orrective action plan, dissemination of findings to providers, enrollees, and legislative oversight committees, and a reevaluation of the survey process. Require regular reviews of the MCO's performance by conducting unbiased surveys of providers and other stakeholders. Ensure that providers and enrollees who provide negative feedback about the MCO are not threatened or penalized in any manner for their action. E. Quality Management Systems for MCOs A promising strategy for establishing and maintaining a m anaged care system based on quality principles is to use the RFP and contract to ensure that the MCO has a well -supported internal quality management (QM) system. The resources supporting and sophistication of an MCO's internal QM efforts vary tremendously among MCOs. However, MCOs are increasingly adhering to NCQA's comprehensive standards for QM. NCQA's accreditation summary reports provide detailed guidance to MCOs who seek accreditation. 1. Internal Quality Management All Medicaid managed care contract s require the MCO to have an internal QM system. Rosenbaum et al. (1997) found that most State Medicaid programs set out extensive specifications for the structure and performance of such systems, not leaving it to the MCO's discretion.(3) Purchasers of managed behavioral health care should make sure that the RFP and contract clearly state the expectations, capabilities, and responsibilities of the QM system, even in cases wher e the details for developing and/or refining the MCO's internal QM system are primarily the responsibility of the MCO. Provisions requiring mandatory compliance with NCQA's standards will give the purchaser leverage to require changes in the MCO's internal QM system if needed. Other contract provisions may require the establishment of an MCO QM team; require an independent quality review council composed of providers, consumers, and other stakeholders; or require the MCO to develop and maintain a continuous quality improvement program. Internal Quality Management. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Require the MCO to create a quality management team, accountable to the governing body of the organization. Develop, implement, and systematically refine a comprehensive quality management plan that is consistent with the RFP and all applicable State and Federal requirements. Incorporate a process for continuous improvement of quality across QM activities. Establish a system to mon itor the completeness, accuracy, and appropriateness of service authorization decisions and ensure compliance with the utilization control requirements of the U.S. C.F.R. 456. Develop a comprehensive set of procedures for network providers and specify the MCO's responsibilities for management and reporting of serious incidents (i.e., deaths, suicide attempts, injurious assaults on provider premises, use of seclusion or restraints, medication errors, felony arrests, and convictions). Develop and implement sy stematic procedures for monitoring, managing, and improving the quality of individual network providers and of the provider network as a whole. Require the MCO to establish, facilitate, and empower a community -based monitoring council that includes provide rs, consumers, and family members. Require the MCO to actively cooperate with any external quality monitoring team as it develops, implements, and monitors quality improvement goals, objectives, and activities for the provider network and the MCO. 2. Exter nal Quality Management Some purchasers may opt to supplement the MCO's QM program with an external agency that specializes in monitoring and auditing quality in health care settings to increase credibility and accountability (Huskamp, 1996).(4) HCFA requires that all States administering Medicaid managed care waiver programs under Section 1915 or Section 1115 of the Social Security Act provide for external qualit y assurance oversight. 1. In September of 1997, the American College of Mental Health Administration (ACMHA), concerned that the rapid proliferation of process/performance measures and strategies is counterproductive for the behavioral health care field, held a summit in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to address outcome measurement. Representatives attended from such organizations as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the National Alliance for th e Mentally Ill (NAMI), the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation (CARF), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA), and the National Mental Health Association (NMHA). Partici pants were divided into working groups reflecting the following domains: prevention, access, process/performance, outcomes, and structure. Over the course of 2 days, each group produced a set of core values for each domain, with recommendations for next st eps. Participants are actively collaborating with key agencies to refine the work initiated at the summit. 2. For more information, see the Institute of Medicine report (1996). 3. For a detailed analysis of this issue, see Table 5.1, Rosenbaum et al. (199 7), which presents State Medicaid managed contract provisions addressing quality assurance. 4. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) mandates that all State Medicaid waiver programs provide for external quality assurance programs to assist in man aging, collaborating with, and/or monitoring the MCO's quality improvement systems without any vested interest in the outcome. CHAPTER VII Financial Issues Key issues in this chapter: The shifting of financial risk from the purchaser to the MCO Applying incentives and sanctions to MCOs Public purchasers often have a variety of goals when developing, implementing, and overseeing a managed care program for mental health and/or substance abuse services --typically, some combination o f containing or reducing costs, expanding access to services, and improving the quality of care. Although a managed care organization (MCO) may share many of the purchaser's goals, it operates under a different set of incentives and consequently may have s ome very different goals. The vehicle by which the purchaser defines its goals and objectives is the contract; but the structure required to achieve those goals is a carefully designed financing and payment system. Dealing with third -party payments Making decisions about copayments and deductibles Managing cash flow Specifying reinvestment requir ements for MCOs Requiring financial reports by MCOs The development of a financing and payme nt system to achieve the purchaser's goals and objectives in a managed behavioral health care contract can be one of the greatest challenges a purchaser faces. The selection of approaches ought to be strongly influenced by the purchaser's primary goals and objectives. This chapter provides an overview of the key financial issues and options that a purchaser of managed substance abuse and mental health services should address when developing requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts: The shifting of fina ncial risk from the purchaser to the MCO; Applying incentives and sanctions to MCOs; Dealing with third -party payments; Making decisions about copayments and deductibles; Managing cash flow; Specifying reinvestment requirements for MCOs; and Requiring financial reports by MCOs. A. The Shifting of Financial Risk From the Purchaser to the MCO Traditionally, \"risk\" in insurance means the cost of the health services. The entity paying for the se rvice is said to assume the risk for that service. The shifting of financial risks from the purchaser of managed care to an MCO or a provider is one of the defining characteristics of managed care and represents a major departure from the traditional fee-for-service system that has dominated health care in recent decades. Under the traditional fee -for-service payment system, the purchaser reimburses providers for services after their provision; furthermore, the purchaser assumes the bulk of four major types of financial risk: namely, risks due to variation in (1) rate of membership and enrollment, (2) the cost of producing units of health services, (3) the volume and type of units used, and (4) service users per 1,000 enrollees (see Exhibit VII -1). In manage d care contracts, the purchaser prospectively pays --that is, pays in advance --a negotiated fee to an MCO to provide all medically necessary covered services to an individual or defined population for a treatment episode or an established period of time. De pending on the type of prospective payment arrangement the purchaser selects --a global budget, capitation payment, or case -rate payment --the purchaser thus transfers or shifts some of the four types of financial risk to the MCO. Exhibit VII -1. Four Ma jor Types of Financial Risk Borne by Purchasers and/or MCOs Risk due to variation in the rate of membership and enrollment (e.g., 8% increase in membership); Risk due to variation in the cost of producing units of services (e.g., 6% decrease in operating cost); Risk due to variation in the volume and type of units used (e.g., 12% increase in outpatient use); Risk due to varia tion in service users per 1,000 enrollees (e.g., 14% decrease in user rate). The purchaser usually begins with all or most of the four major types of financial risk described above. There is broad continuum of models available for the transfer of financia l risk from the purchaser to the MCO and its network: (1) a global budget; (2) capitation payment (full or partial); (3) case -rate payment; and (4) fee -for-service payment. (These models are discussed in detail later in this chapter. See also Table VII -1 on page 178.) Once the purchaser has transferred financial risk to an MCO, the MCO may in turn pass some of the financial risk on to others (e.g., to physicians or other providers in the MCOs provider network, or to consumers). This practice is known as ri sk transfer. The structure of the contractual financial risk -transfer arrangement between a purchaser and an MCO must be carefully negotiated and clearly understood by the parties so that unexpected service costs or savings risks are predictably born by the appropriate party. Failing to clearly identify the risks in a risk -transfer arrangement may cause unexpected cost shifting between providers and MCOs or between different components of the same organization. Although the purchaser can tailor a managed care contract with risk transfer to create the desired constellation of incentives for the MCO, any contract that exposes the purchaser to risk should be carefully reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that all risks are properly balanced as intended by the parties. To establish the necessary foundation for devising the optimal risk -transfer strategy in a managed care financing package, a purchaser must thoroughly analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and the unique attributes of the particular environme nt (such as the financial resources available, the capacities of the existing provider pool, the demographic and utilization characteristics of the eligible population). The capacity to bear financial risk varies widely among MCOs and providers, and it is imperative that public purchasers of managed care not assign risk to any MCO or providers that lack sufficient capacity to absorb and manage that risk. The following section will present methods of managing risk, issue related to risk -transfer financing, and risk -transfer financing models. 1. Managing Financial Risk There are several approaches that can be used by purchasers to assist in managing the financial risk: (1) limits on profits and losses; (2) specifications for reinvestment of excess savings; and (3) requirements for risk reserves/reinsurance. a. Limits on Profits and Losses The purchaser may contractually limit the profits and/or losses an MCO may experience. In the case of profit limits, the purchaser must determine early the amount of profit it is willing to allow the MCO to make and how this profit may be achieved. The contract documents between the parties should address the degree to which each party keeps any MCO profit in excess of the a greed -upon amount. A purchaser can also limit the level of MCO profits or losses, based on a percentage of the budget. Thus, for example, a purchaser might place a cap on total profits or losses of 10 percent of the total payment; then, no matter how far a bove or below the target the MCO's actual costs were, the MCO would not incur a loss or profit of more than 10 percent of the total payment. Alternatively, a purchaser may choose to limit the losses an MCO will incur. This approach can serve three importan t purposes: It reduces financial incentives for an MCO to provide insufficient services (because the purchaser will share some of the costs of care above a target claims level); It protects an MCO from extreme financia l risk, so there is less concern about the financial viability of the MCO; and It reduces the incentive for an MCO to include a \"risk premium\" (i.e., higher payment for assuming risk) in a competitive bid by shielding the MCO from some potential financial risk. One approach to lessen an MCO's incentives to undertreat is the use of stop -loss arrangements (also referred to as \"catastrophic stop -loss\"), under which losses are capped at a specified level. Two types of stop -losses exist: (1) an aggregate -level stop-loss, and (2) an individual -level or per -case stop -loss: An aggregate stop -loss is identical to a cap on the MCO's losses mentioned above and creates similar incentives . Under a per -level case stop -loss, a limit on expenditures per consumer per time period (often a year) is set. After the consumer's costs reach that level, the purchaser pays 100 percent of that enrollee's claims costs for the rest of the year. For example, if an individual stop -loss of $30,000 per year is set, the purchaser is responsible for any costs for an enrollee that exceed the stop -loss amount. An individual stop -loss reduces the incentive for an MCO to restrict services provided to individuals with the most severe illnesses, since the purchaser shares responsibility for the costs of the most expensive cases. Rather than pay 100 percent beyond the designated expenditure limit, the purchaser may opt for a risk -sharing arrangement with the MCO. In this case, the purchaser would pay, for instance, 90 percent of the costs and the MCO would pay 10 percent of the costs beyond the expenditure limit. The purpose of such an arrangement is to impose some incentive on the MCO to manage care even after the expendi ture limit has been reached. b. Specified Reinvestment of Excess Savings Purchasers may require that MCOs reserve a specified portion of savings for reinvestment in the public system. Doing this tempers the incentive to limit access, withhold care, or com promise quality to contain expenses, because the MCO has less to gain financially from such practices. It is important that the contract specifically address the mechanisms and procedures to be used by the MCO to account for savings and reinvestment activi ties. If the parties require a reinvestment of funds into the delivery system, careful attention should be paid to Federal funds. The Federal Government may assert that it is entitled to the portion of profits or savings of the managed care plan attributab le to the Federal funds. The contract should carefully reflect the intent of the parties and, in the case of Medicaid funds, provide written assurances from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) concerning any such surplus or reinvestment. (Reinv estment requirements are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.) c. Requirements for Risk Reserves/Reinsurance The purchaser must determine whether it will require the MCO to maintain a sufficient sum of money to cover any reasonable costs that ma y be incurred (risk reserves), or to obtain reinsurance to protect the financial integrity of the managed care program. Some States' insurance regulations may require the MCO to maintain a predetermined amount of risk reserve or to purchase reinsurance. If so, the purchaser must explore the applicability of these insurance rules and regulations to the managed care program. In some cases, purchasers may require the MCO to purchase reinsurance or may determine through the RFP process whether the MCO plans to purchase such insurance. Under a typical reinsurance arrangement, the reinsurance policy pays all claims costs above a certain threshold. This arrangement does shield the MCO and the purchaser from a portion of the financial risk for claims, but it also i ncreases direct costs for the purchaser who ultimately pays for the cost of reinsurance. Also, how risk reserves are identified and evaluated in the RFP is of critical importance. For instance, are the risk reserves part of administrative expenses? Do the risk reserves revert to the purchaser upon termination? A good example of problems relative to risk reserve issues is found in the recent Ohio procurement challenge (see Value Behavioral Health, Inc. v. Ohio Department of Mental Health, 966 F. Supp. 557 (S .D. Ohio 1997)). 2. Issues in Risk -Based Payment There are several issues related to risk transfer financing that should be considered, including: (1) cost shifting; (2) MCO risk sharing with providers/subcontractors; (3) separating service costs from admi nistrative costs; (4) duration of risk-based contracts; and (5) setting appropriate payment rates. a. Cost Shifting Giving different health care organizations responsibility for different subpopulations with different payment rates can encourage substantia l cost shifting. Thus, for instance, recent analyses in Missouri have found that the relatively low - cost population of enrollees in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program is overrepresented in health maintenance organizations (HMOs), while the high-cost severely and persistently mentally ill population is overrepresented in community mental health centers (CMHCs) (Broskowski, 1997). For these reasons, many observers believe that only a single organization is appropriately positioned to be respo nsible for achieving the optimal balance of resources for a diverse population. b. MCO Risk Sharing With Providers/Subcontractors A fundamental financial decision of the purchaser is whether, or to what degree, to allow the transfer of financial risk from the MCO to the providers through subcontracts. Whatever risk is transferred must be carefully monitored by the purchaser, as there is the potential for the MCO to transfer an unreasonably large component of the risk to other parties. The purchaser must m ake clear its policies about transferring financial or other risks from the MCO to providers in the contractual agreement. The purchaser should contractually ensure that the obligations and responsibilities in the prime contract between the purchaser and t he MCO devolve to all provider subcontracts. In addition, the purchaser should retain the ability to oversee the amount of risk that is transferred to providers and subcontractors. Doing this is particularly important in Medicaid managed care contracts bec ause of the Federal prohibitions against illegal physician incentive plan arrangements. These prohibitions outlaw the use of physician incentive plans that create excessive risk, which HCFA has defined as risk levels that surpass 25 percent of the physicia n's anticipated revenues. Purchasers should be aware that a wide -open policy regarding the transfer of financial risk in subcontracts with providers can result in the MCO's transferring virtually all of the risk associated with the provision of care to pr oviders, thus assuring the MCO of a predictable profit. This situation can be dangerous, because most providers are not likely to have large capital reserves and thus are not likely to be able to absorb large cash flow fluctuations or periods of unusually high utilizations; when such providers bear the bulk of the financial risk, their incentives to withhold or minimize services during a financially difficult time could be great. Federal Law and Physician Incentive Plans Federal law prohibits MCOs with Medicaid contracts from operating \"physician incentive plans\" that fail to meet Federal requirements. Federal requirements for physician incentive plans are as follows (U.S.C. \u00a71903(m)(2)(A)(x)): A plan may not make any spec ific payment either directly or indirectly to a physician or a physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary care for an enrollee. If a plan places the physician or physician group at substantial financial risk (greater than 25 pe rcent of the physician's anticipated income under the agreement) then the organization must provide stop -loss that takes into account the size of the physician practice and the number of enrollees. A plan must conduct periodic surveys of enrollees (both cu rrent and previous) to determine access and satisfaction. A plan must file sufficient information with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the State to permit a determination as to whether it is in compliance with Federal requirements. It also should be noted that the purchaser exerts control over a managed care program mainly through the MCO, which is subject to financial and possibly insurance regulation; the purchaser's ability to monitor a subcontracted provider's financial position and service management practices is far more limited (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). To reduce the risks of substandard care, purchasers should consider including monitoring and performance standards for subcontractors in the prime contract. Specific contractual ter ms can allow the purchaser to review, modify, and terminate subcontractual terms, conditions, and relationships. Regardless of any subcontracts entered into by the MCO, the prime contract should require the MCO to remain financially liable for the delivery of the goods and services negotiated in the contract throughout its term. Largely because many providers' management information systems (MIS) are detailed financially but not clinically, providers with at -risk subcontracts are sometimes unable to develop detailed and accurate reports on the delivery of care and financing to the contracting MCO. The MCO, in turn, may be unable to obtain much detail on capitated providers' levels of service or utilization and/or quality management activities, leaving both t he purchaser and MCO with few or no data upon which to base evaluations, establish accountability, and/or improve quality. Consequently, purchasers should be very attentive to the capacity of providers to assume risk and build and/or manage sophisticated M IS when considering strategies regarding subcontracts. Purchasers may also want to require on -line use of the provider of the MCO's MIS, if it is sufficiently comprehensive (see Chapter V). If the contract lacks specificity about risk transfer to providers , MCOs may create financial incentive structures that encourage inappropriate limits on services. Purchasers may wish to limit or prohibit risk -transfer or incentive -based arrangements and require MCOs to offer (or require the purchase of) stop -loss insura nce for network providers (Rosenbaum et al., 1997) . Many States place limits on the level of risk that can be assumed by providers without insurance licenses . Both of these mechanisms maintain at least some degree of financial risk with the MCO, where it can be more adequately monitored. It should be noted that despite the many challenges associated with providers absorbing too much of the financial risk, many purchasers, MCOs, and/or providers are interested in establishing, or are required by legislation to establish, risk -transfer contracting arrangements between MCOs and providers. Providers may be interested in establishing a risk -transfer arrangement in return for flexibility in making decisions about treatment and about service mix, accessing capitat ion payments up front to permit investment, and developing rollover authority to build up reserves. Letting providers have a stake in the quality and quantity of care (i.e., sharing risk with the MCO) has many associated risks but also may have benefits. I ncreasing numbers of providers are interested in and capable of assuming risk. Providers can act more creatively and rapidly to intervene on a patient's behalf when they do not have to deal with the time - and resource -consuming aspects of an external autho rization process. Creative and prompt responses are generally more likely to produce better outcomes at lower costs (e.g., a relatively minor intervention at a moment of crisis can be far more effective than a more expensive and intensive intervention days afterward). c. Separating Service Costs From Administrative Costs For each type of financial risk -sharing arrangement mentioned above, a purchaser can choose to separate payments for administrative costs and for service costs (e.g., under a pure capitatio n contract, a purchaser can pay a per capita rate for administrative costs and a separate per capita rate for service costs). The purchaser can also choose to use different types of risk -sharing arrangements for each type of cost. For example, a purchaser could use a pure capitation arrangement or global budget for administrative costs and use a partial capitation arrangement for service costs. This combined arrangement would provide strong incentives to control administrative costs, but would temper somewh at the financial incentives to reduce service provisions that are inherent in a global budget or full capitation arrangement for service costs. Separating payments in this manner allows purchasers to keep a more careful watch over the different types of co sts and to more precisely target incentives for each. Administrative services only (ASO) contracting arrangements are common in employer -sponsored health plans, but the use of this model is relatively new in the public sector. Several public purchasers now use ASO contracts, including Maryland's public mental health system, San Diego County's mental health system, and portions of Florida's Medicaid behavioral health program. Under an ASO contract, the purchaser pays the MCO (or an entity providing one or mo re standard managed care services), a set of performance -based fees to perform specified administrative or management functions, passing no financial risk for health service costs to the MCO. For example, a purchaser may pay an MCO a designated fee per enr ollee per month to provide such services as recruiting and maintaining a provider network, processing claims, completing financial reports, conducting utilization management activities, and/or providing various quality management functions. Under this arra ngement, the MCO bears no financial risk for the cost of health services. At first glance, an ASO model appears to provide no risk to the purchaser and the MCO. Frequently, however, the purchaser will also put the ASO administrative fees at risk or include financial incentives and/or sanctions tied to key measures (e.g., timely processing of claims, percentage of claims that are fully filled out, error -free, and able to be processed upon submission). Consequently the volume, complexit y, and quality of the submitted claims can have a significant influence on the MCO's risk. Clearly written provisions can be especially important as they relate to claims and the definition of a \"clean\" claim. An ASO contract provides minimal financial inc entives(1) to an MCO to control health service costs because the MCO is not responsible for these costs and there is no limit or target set on spending for covered services. Thus, an ASO contract arrangement may make it difficult for the purchaser to control costs or to accurately predict annual expenditures for budgetary purposes. Purchasers also should be aware that an ASO arrange ment can discourage needed investments in quality -improving technology for the purchaser's management information system (MIS) unless the system is set up in such a way as to provide incentives for building or refining the purchaser's MIS. Purchasers shoul d ensure that the ASO contract does not create several opportunities for bundling additional costs (e.g., quality improvement efforts in MIS performance) into the administrative fee and thus artificially inflating administrative expenses. ASO arrangements can provide purchasers an opportunity to gain valuable experience with managed care practices and technologies, to buy and/or learn how to best use available technologies, and/or to obtain crucial data that facilitates accurate estimates of future utilizat ion. An ASO arrangement can eventually evolve into a purchaser -based management services organization, in which the purchaser assumes responsibility for many or all of the ASO functions. d. Duration of Risk -Sharing Contracts Purchasers should not underest imate the importance of the time period used in the contract. In general, quality improvement initiatives take a fair amount of time to have their influence felt in the system and will usually not be pursued if there is not a long -term mutual commitment be tween the involved parties. For instance, 1 -year contracts provide strong incentives for MCOs and others involved in risk -transfer arrangements to seek quick, short -term gains, while longer -term contracts with built -in renewability options are more likely to encourage the development of quality - driven, systemic improvements that will produce savings. While 1 -year contracts make sense when purchasers seek technology or supplies (\"keep shopping for a better vendor\"), they can be quite destructive for a commod ity like health, that by its very nature requires a long -term perspective. e. Setting Appropriate Payment Rates The actuarial science of setting appropriate public sector capitation rates for behavioral health is still in its earliest stages, available da ta used to develop rates is often very weak, and actuaries must depend on the validity of numerous assumptions throughout the development process. Rate setting, as a result, seems to be proceeding largely by trial and error, leaving some systems seriously underfunded. Providing relevant information to the actuaries can influence their assumptions and is a key task for those involved in this process. An inappropriately low rate will inevitably lead to significant problems for consumers, providers, MCOs, and ultimately, the purchaser. 3. Risk -Transfer Payment Models Many States, counties, and regional authorities have now begun to develop and refine risk -transfer payment systems with MCOs. These include Massachusetts, Oregon, Iowa, Colorado, Washington, Utah, Nebraska, Ohio, and San Diego County. A continuum of financial risk -sharing arrangements for managed care contracts --including a global budget, capitation payment, case -rate payment, and fee -for-service payment --is shown in Table VII -1 below. These arrange ments allocate the four major components of financial risk --that is, risk due to variation in the rate of enrollment, in the cost of producing services, in the volume and types of units used, and in service users per 1,000 enrollees --between the purchaser of managed behavioral health care services and an MCO in very different ways. a. A Global (or Fixed) Budget A payment arrangement that transfers full financial risk for the components of financial risk mentioned earlier from the purchaser of managed care t o an MCO (or from an MCO to a network provider) is a global (or fixed) budget. Under this model, the purchaser of managed care pays a fixed dollar amount to the MCO both to administer the managed care program and to provide all services for which the MCO i s responsible. No matter how high the costs of providing care to enrollees are, or how many additional enrollees join or leave the plan in a given year, the MCO is paid the agreed -upon global budget payment. Table VII -1. Risk Transfer Payment Models Payment Model Variations Comments Global Budget (Payment for total population) No excluded services Limited excluded services Under a global budget arrangement, the MCO is at full risk for all of four components of financial risk --(1) variation in the rate of membership and enrollment; (2) variation in the cost of producing services; (3) variation in the volume and types of units used; and (4) variation in service users per 1,000 enrollees. Capitation Payment (Payment per enrollee) Full capitation No risk/reward corridor Risk reward corridor Partial capitation No risk/reward corridor Risk reward corridor Full capitation payment arrangements involve payment to an MCO of a predetermined fixed fee per capita to provide all necessary services for a defined population of enrollee s. The MCO is at financial risk for variation in the cost of producing services, as well as for variation in the volume and type of services and variation in users per 1,000 enrollees. It is not at risk for variations in rate of enrollment. Partial capi tation refers to situations where one part of the population is capitated and the other is not. Case -Rate Payment (Payment per user of services) Period of time Episode of care Under case -rate payment arrangements --involving payment to the MCO (or provider*) of a fixed \"case rate\" per user to provide a defined set of services as needed to a specified group of users --the MCO is at financial risk for both variation in the cost of p roducing services and for variation in the volume and type of services required by the individual Fee-for- Service Payment (Payment per unit of service) Bundled services Discounted Not discounted Under fee -for-service arrangements, the MCO is not at financial risk for any of the four types of risk. The purchaser, however, assumes all of the risk. An MCO paid through a global budget, capitation, or case -rate may pay providers using a form of fee -for-service. In this case, the Not bundled services Usual and customary charges Billed charges MCO is at risk. *As discussed later in this chapter, case rates are used most often to pay service proviers, either when they are functioning as an MCO or when they are subcontracting to an MCO. Note, however, that if a public purchaser is held financially responsible for any shortfall in the global budget (as is currently the case in some jurisdictions), the planned global budget process becomes largely irrelevant. A global budget arrangemen t allows the purchaser of managed behavioral health care to predict with certainty the level of expenditures on mental health and/or substance abuse services in a given year. Global budgets are often used when the number of eligibles is unknown and are usu ally based on the prior year's costs, less a predetermined percentage for savings. They are more especially likely to be used when the purchaser is a State or county substance abuse and mental health authority. A global budget creates very strong incentiv es for an MCO to control costs and improve the efficiency of its service delivery and administrative practices, especially if the MCO is to retain all savings as profit or as new operating capital. However, the very strong incentives to the MCO to achieve savings can encourage the entity to provide less than the therapeutically appropriate level of care or to reduce overall access to care, particularly when enrollment is greater than expected. Examples of Public Purchasers Using a Global Budget Californi a State contracts with counties for mental health services Massachusetts For mental health acute inpatient treatment for seriously mentally ill persons without insurance Montana Fixed budget for non -Medicaid eligibles and capitation for Medicaid eligibles Iowa For substance abuse services to non -Medicaid citizens A fixed budget places the MCO at the highest level of financial risk. If managed care enrollment is higher than expected and/or claims costs greatly exceed the amount in the global budget, the financial viability of the managed care initiative may be put in jeopardy. For an MCO with low financial reserves, the result could be very serious financial difficulties or insolvency. The risk of insolvency is particularly great for small regional MCOs o r providers whose budget is dependent on the managed care contract. The loss of such a contract could lead to serious financial troubles. Several States have seen their CMHCs suffer such a misfortune when they have acted as underfunded MCOs. Because an MC O may assume a relatively high degree of financial risk under a global budget arrangement, the MCO is likely to seek higher payment rates from the purchaser for assuming this risk.(2) Thus, a global budget arrangement may actually result in higher overall costs for the purchaser, especially if the purchaser has insufficient data to accurately estimate need, utilization, and costs. Because of the potentially higher costs of a f ixed-budget arrangement, some purchasers have chosen to use a global budget arrangement for selected services or populations only and to use other payment strategies to pay for other types of services or groups of recipients. The greatest legal concern in a global budget arrangement is ensuring that the MCO can safely assume the risks associated with it. In determining the rates that are to be paid to the MCO, the purchaser should consider including provisions in the contract to allow for renegotiation of t he rates in the event the amount reimbursed proves to be unrealistically low or high. Allowing some renegotiation options may allow a managed care program to remain a viable option for the purchaser if the MCO is on the verge of bankruptcy, pushing risk to o far down to the provider pool, or is taking too much profit from the system. b. Capitation Payment Under a fully capitated, full -risk arrangement, the purchaser pays the MCO a monthly per capita rate to cover all costs associated with providing behavior al health care services to a population of enrollees. The per capita rate for each enrollee is fixed, regardless of whether an enrollee uses any services. It may be set by the purchaser in advance or determined in the context of a competitive bidding proce ss. The MCO assumes all financial risk for variation in the cost of producing services but assumes no risk for variation in enrollment. The latter risk is assumed by the purchaser, who pays an additional per capita payment for each additional enrollee, or who pays less in aggregate if enrollment reverses. Fully capitated payment arrangements are like a fixed -budget arrangement in that they provide a strong incentive to control costs and improve efficiency. Although full capitation can create strong, short -term financial incentives to unduly restrict enrollee access and use of services, it also can provide equally strong incentives for the MCO to provide high -quality services and to secure effective linkages with other types of service providers to support po sitive outcomes. The strength of the contract access monitoring and quality monitoring mechanisms, and effective use of incentives and sanctions will in large part determine the way in which a full capitation payment system impacts the success of the manag ed care initiative. Purchasers should understand that accurately estimating capitation rates is an actuarial art, not a science. Errors in judgment or erroneous assumptions are common and can cause an otherwise well designed program to fail due to insuffic ient capitation rate(s). In attempting to establish the most valid rates, different purchasers have used different approaches. One option to use when there is insufficient data to make highly accurate estimates for capitation rates is to develop a \"floatin g\" capitation rate that is adjustable based on the actual utilization data in the new system. See Exhibit VII -2 for three different approaches to arriving at capitation payment rates. Exhibit VII -2. Three Approaches to Establishing Capitation Payment Rates* Approach #1: Specify in the RFP the exact capitation rate to be paid. Under this approach, the purchaser announces the rate in the RFP. This approach allows the purchaser to maintain responsibility for establishing the most appropriat e rate instead of allowing market forces to determine the rate. Only those MCOs interested in accepting the contract at the specified rate will submit bids. Interested MCOs compete not on price, but on other criteria determined by the purchaser such as adm inistrative fees, provider networks, quality assurance mechanisms, and outcomes management capacity. The challenge for the purchaser is setting an appropriate capitation rate that both attracts qualified plans and meets the purchaser's fiscal goals. If th e capitation rate in the RFP is too high, the purchasers' expenditures will end up being higher than necessary and generate excessive profits for the MCO. (The purchaser may, if it chooses, require the MCO to reinvest excessive savings in the care system, mitigating the risk of a \"too -high\" rate.) If the specified capitation rate is too low , many qualified MCOs may choose not to submit a bid, and those that do bid may later begin to restrict access or provide lower quality services to maintain financial via bility. Approach #2: Specify the maximum capitation rate and allow bidders to bid this amount or a lower amount. Under this approach, the purchaser sets a maximum capitation rate and allows MCOs to bid at this capitation rate or less. Setting a maximu m rate allows the purchaser to limit maximum expenditures, retaining some control over future costs while simultaneously allowing for competition among MCOs with respect to price, potentially resulting in lower costs. Because the market is highly competiti ve, some MCOs may deliberately underbid to obtain greater market share, resulting in a greater danger of undertreatment or other quality -of- care problems. Approach #3: Provide no guidance on preferred capitation rate in the RFP and allow MCOs to bid a rate of their choice. Under this approach, the purchaser allows full market competition among the bidders with respect to the capitation rate. Again, increasing competition can result in the lowest cost to the purchaser and possibl y the greatest levels of service innovation. The purchaser must be careful, however, not to agree to a capitation rate that is below a level that would ensure appropriate provision of services. (This option is technically not possible under Medicaid waiver s, which are subject to upper payment limit restrictions.) The purchaser must also decide how to weight a low capitation rate, given other considerations, such as access and quality. *These approaches can also be used for negotiating a variety of different payment structures. The contractual agreements between the parties should identify the following: (1) MCO per capita fees and claims target; (2) the risk -sharing ratio; and (3) the risk -free corridor. MCO per capita fees and claims target. Often, a per capita fee paid to the MCO is specified in the contract as a portion of the total capitation rate. This fee covers the administrative costs of the contract and should include overhead and any applicable p rofit. The contract then specifies a per capita claims target for substance abuse and mental health services covered under the plan. The claims target is based on the benefit plan and average per - person claims expenditure for the population, as well as the utilization management rules used. To establish a claims target, purchasers can start with previous average per capita spending levels and adjust these levels using numerous assumptions about the appropriate or desired impact of the managed care program o n expenditures for mental health and/or substance abuse services. If the purchaser wants to create a stronger incentive for the MCO to limit costs, it can choose a lower target; to create a weaker incentive to limit costs but a stronger incentive to improv e access and quality, the purchaser may select a higher target. Risk-sharing ratio. Once a claims target has been set, the purchaser defines a risk -sharing ratio that specifies how the costs of claims above the target --or savings, if expenditures are below the target --will be shared by the MCO and the purchaser. As an example, a 50:50 sharing ratio for savings requires the two parties to share equally in any savings or losses if expenditures are below or above the targeted capitation amount. To create a str onger incentive for cost containment or reduction, a purchaser can choose a sharing ratio that allows the MCO a greater share of savings and assigns the MCO greater responsibility for losses (e.g., 90:10, under which the MCO keeps 90 percent of savings and assumes 90 percent of losses). To temper the incentive to restrict service provision, a purchaser could choose a sharing ratio that places less responsibility for losses on the MCO and allows the MCO a greater share of savings (e.g., the MCO keeps 50 perc ent of the savings, but assumes only 25 percent of the losses). This is known as asymmetrical risk. Above or below the set rate, other financial arrangements prevail (refer to the section on stop - loss arrangements below). Risk-free corridor. Many purchaser s also use a risk -free corridor above or below the claims target to specify a portion of the claims risk for which the MCO is not responsible. For example, if the target is $10 per enrollee per month and the risk -free corridor is \u00b1 5 percent, the MCO is no t responsible for claims costs between $10 and $10.50 and cannot keep any savings between $9.50 and $10.00. (The purchaser gains or loses the $.50.) The use of risk -free corridors acknowledges that the development of capitation rates is not a perfect scien ce, and that, as long as the MCO's claims costs fall within a particular range around the target, the negotiated fee will still be paid without penalty or bonus. This arrangement, which has been used in many private sector managed behavioral health organiz ation (MBHO) contracts, can minimize the need for extensive negotiations when costs are reconciled at the end of the fiscal year. c. Case -Rate Payment Case rates are used most often to pay service providers, either when the service providers are functionin g as an MCO or when they are subcontracting to an MCO. Under the case -rate model of payment, the purchaser of managed care pays a fixed rate for each \"case,\" that is, each designated individual who enters the system and uses services. The case -rate approa ch to payment was developed in part because of the difficulty of accurately estimating service users per 1,000 enrollees. The case rate is calculated by estimating the expected average expenditures for service users only. Thus, a case rate is typically hig her than a full capitation rate, because a pure capitation rate is calculated as an average of expected expenditures over a population of enrollees that includes both service users and nonusers. Calculating case rates. The following basic formula can be us ed to develop a baseline case rate for a defined event: Case rate per defined event = (Cost per day/visit) \u00d7 (Mean length of stay/mean frequency of visits) This baseline rate can then be adjusted as desired by included service(s), definition of the episod e or time, user characteristics, region, and so forth. When setting case rates, the purchaser should make every effort to obtain all relevant national and regional data to begin to establish norms. Determining what case rates to pay is difficult given the paucity of national cost and utilization data on both substance abuse and mental health services. The paucity of data is particularly acute in the addiction field. In the context of managed behavioral health care, case rates can be formulated to cover eith er a defined episode of care or a defined period of time (see Table VII -2): - Case rate for a defined episode of care: The case rate covers a precisely defined episode of care for an individual with either a single level of care (e.g., a detoxification or intensive outpatient treatment episode) or multiple levels of care (e.g., detoxification plus outpatient services). Case rates for discrete treatment episodes (e.g., detoxification) are the easiest to design. Alternatively, an episode of care can begin wit h an acute treatment experience (generally requiring continuing care afterwards) and continue until the consumer has no treatment episodes for a specified period (e.g., 8 to 12 weeks). - Case rate for a defined period of time: The case rate covers a define d period of time (e.g., 6 months, 1 year) for an individual with multiple levels of care (e.g., all covered levels of care per individual per year). Precise definitions are needed regarding all responsibilities. For instance, a provider could be responsibl e for the provision of all detoxification and outpatient treatment for a specified individual for 1 year. Whether based on an episode of care or a period of time, case rates can be based on either a single case rate unadjusted for level(s) of care, severit y of illness, or region; or a stratified case rate adjusted by a defined variable or variables (e.g., level of care, severity of illness, region, or all combined). Table VII -2. Illustration of Two Approaches to Designing Case Rates Rate for Defined Episode of Care Examples Rate for Defined Period of Time Examples Single case rate (applies to all users) $1,000 per ASAM Level III.1 detoxification episode (base payment) $2,500 for all detoxification and outpatient services for 1 year (base payment) Stratified case rates that vary by: Level of care/type of service used Severity of condition/illness Region Combined: level, severity, & region $1,100 per ASAM Level III.7 detoxification ($100 increased fee over base payment for a higher level of care) $1,150 per ASAM Level III.1 detoxification for a pregnant woman ($150 increased fee over base payment for a higher level of care) $1,040 per ASAM Level III.1 detoxification in Region 4 ($40 increased fee over base payment for Region 4) $1,290 per Level III.7 detoxification for a pregnant woman in Region 4 $3,200 for all ASAM Level IV detoxification and outpatient services for 1 year ($700 increased fee over base payment for a higher level of care) $4,500 for all detoxification and outpatient services for an individual who is seriously and persistently m entally ill (SPMI) and addicted for 1 year ($2,000 increased fee over base payment for a higher level of care) $2,700 for all detoxification and outpatient services for an individual in Region 2 for 1 year ($200 increased fee over base payment for a higher level of care) $5,400 for all ASAM Level IV detoxification and outpatient services for an individual with SPMI and addicted in Region 2 for 1 year Distinctions between case rates for substance abuse and mental health services. In considering case rates, it is important to make a distinction between case rates for mental health services, case rates for substance abuse services, and case rates for combined behavioral health services. In comparison with substance abuse se rvices, mental health services (both for Medicaid and non -Medicaid funded services) generally can be more easily blended into actuarial processes and development of case rates. In comparison to substance abuse, mental health cases generally: - Are associat ed with less frequent admissions, discharges, and readmissions (and thus have more predictable treatment costs); - Involve more medical personnel and related medical services and are thus more comparable with case -rate experience in the medical sector; - Have more frequently been offered in the context of managed care; and - Are more likely to have more predictable expenditures because of the larger database on mental health services. The case -rate data established for mental health services may prove neith er valid nor helpful when trying to establish appropriate case rates for substance abuse services. Monitoring and managing case rates. Purchasers should be aware that a case -rate system can encourage an increase in outreach services, thereby increasing acc ess of certain subgroups into the service system, because the MCO or provider receives a full case -rate payment for each service user. A case -rate system provides strong economic incentives for the MCO or provider to identify people who need mental health and/or substance abuse treatment, some of whom might not have been enrolled or diagnosed in the same way if the MCO or provider were under a different payment system. Careful monitoring of service patterns is therefore a crucial component of effectively ma naging this type of payment. Similarly, MCOs and providers have incentive in a case -rate system to restrict ongoing care. In unregulated, unmanaged circumstances, there is also considerable danger that an MCO or provider will seek out individuals who are u sers but have the least severity of illness (see Chapter II on enrollment). Purchasers must analyze the inherent incentives of each case -rate variation and take steps to avoid problems (e.g., independent gate keepers, random assignments, case mix adjustmen ts). One way for a purchaser to guard against inappropriate identification of cases is to perform periodic clinical audits of cases to assess service appropriateness, and/or create guidelines or criteria that enrollees must meet to enter the service system (e.g., no case -rate payment will be given for detoxification if this service is not followed by other services). If MCOs and providers with case -rate arrangements have an incentive to enter enrollees in the treatment system, but not necessarily to keep th em there or ensure that the appropriate type or amount of services are provided, such clinical audits would identify them, putting them at high risk of losing their contracts in the future. Other strategies that a purchaser can use to provide an incentive for MCOs or providers to give enrollees appropriate care under case -rate payment arrangements include blending some degree of fee -for-service reimbursement into the model. For instance, the entity could be paid on a fee -for-service basis until the reimburs able amount totaled the amount of the case rate. Alternatively, the purchaser could pay for discrete amounts of services (e.g., pay for first five outpatient visits, then for the next five, etc.) up to the case rate. Case -rate contracts can cover both admi nistrative and service costs, or they may be structured to cover only service costs, with administrative costs paid for separately by the purchaser. Typically, different case rates are used for different diagnoses or eligibility categories; different rates might be used for enrollees categorized as having SPMI children in foster care, and women with dependent children. In Delaware, for example, the Medicaid program pays a case rate to the Department of Children and Families to provide services to children w ith moderate to severe emotional disorders. In analyzing options and making decisions regarding the use of case rates, it may be easiest to develop baseline data around utilization of specific levels of care (e.g., mean cost -per-detoxification or intensive -outpatient episode). Case rates which cover a broad range of services for an individual over an extended period of time are probably the most difficult to determine accurately. Determining the number of distinct rates. When choosing a risk -transfer paymen t system, purchasers of managed behavioral health services must determine how many distinct subpopulations, and thus distinct rates, to develop. Some purchasers have chosen a single rate blended for all enrollees, while others have used several different r ate categories. When more than one rate category is used, they can be based on many different types of variables. In many situations, the purchaser may also want to divide the total population of eligible persons and services into two or more different ris k-sharing arrangements (e.g., adults with serious and persistent mental illness [SPMI], children with serious emotional disorder [SED], chronically addicted individuals). Indeed, using multiple categories of rates can result in more appropriate matching of payment to estimated costs of service provision, and, ideally, can be used to mitigate incentives for the MCO to undertreat those with highest needs. The use of several categories, however, can also be cumbersome, and some States that initially used such an approach later simplified or abandoned it (e.g., Washington and Tennessee) because it was too difficult to be properly programmed or administered. Artificial boundaries drawn to divide responsibility for care based on anticipated costs or needs (i.e., stratifying enrollees by diagnoses, costs, or needs) can lead to problems with continuity of care and cause the system to lose focus on meeting the overall needs of the enrollee population. Multiple categories based on diagnosis or severity of illness also provide incentives for unethical MCOs on providers to claim that enrollees are more severely ill than they actually are or try to classify them in a different, more profitable rating category in order to receive higher payment rates. d. Fee -for-Service P ayment Fee-for-service payment systems generally are not used to prospectively pay an MCO, but may be used by a prospectively paid MCO to pay its providers. This system shifts risk from the purchaser and providers to the MCO. Here fee -for-service payment systems provide an interesting legal issue. The fee -for-service payment to providers gives them economic incentives to provide access to the delivery system to enrollees because the provider is paid a fee each time the enrollee accesses the system. The iss ue that must be addressed is whether the purchaser or MCO can determine by a review of records whether a medically necessary treatment was paid for. The contract must allow for such a review and for the purchaser's or MCO's ability to recover funds spent f or services other than those the purchaser or MCO determine were not medically necessary. General Financial Requirements and Risk -Sharing Arrangements. Purchasers may wish to address the following in the RFPs and contracts: Include all applicable Federal, State, and local accounting and actuarial requirements, including analysis of the financial stability of the vendor and its financial reserves. Stipulate, where appropriate, that all payments are \"subject to available funds \" of the purchaser. Indicate how often, when, and how the MCO will be paid, including any incentives. Stipulate separation or integration of administrative and service costs and the basis for each. If using an ASO arrangement, specify the frequency and met hod of fee payment and include performance guarantees. For case rates and capitated payments, indicate the criteria an enrollee must meet to be considered for a certain rate category (e.g., by severity of illness, age, gender). Clearly explain all paramete rs of a partial capitation arrangement , including risk -sharing ratios and risk -free corridors. If using an individual stop -loss arrangement, indicate how and when the MCO would be paid for costs above the stop - loss, or what reinsurance arrangements the MCO must make. If reinsurance is to be required, indicate the exact level of insurance the MCO is expected to have, what form of proof of insurance is necessary, and the renewal period of the reinsurance policy; include a requirement for providing proof of reinsurance. Indicate what process is to be used for reconciling costs at the end of the contract year (e.g., calculation of claims incurred, but not reported and a method of accounting for any adjustments of errors). Specify what is to be done with savings and their potential reinvestment in needed State, county, or local services (such as financing and development of housing for people with severe and persistent mental illness that may be outside of the scope of the contract) or expansion of the eligible po pulation. Stipulate the right of the purchaser to audit. Establish whether --and if so, to what degree --financial and clinical risk may be transferred from the MCO to providers. Require the MCO to be in compliance with the physician incentive plan prohibiti ons against financial incentives to reduce care, the provision of stop -loss coverage, and disclosure of the incentive plan and stop -loss arrangements. Ensure that all legal, financial, and clinical responsibilities related to the risk agreement between the MCO and the subcapitated provider are precise, specific, and publicly available. Specify insurance coverage requirements, if any, for providers assuming risk. Establish what types of incentives and incentive structures for providers are allowed. Require t hat, if the MCO places providers at risk, data must be submitted and reviewed that indicates the risk -bearing capabilities of those providers. Require purchaser approval of financial arrangements between the MCO and providers, including rates, payment terms, risk arrangements, and other terms. Require the MCO to seek approval from the purchaser for subcapitation or rate -setting policies. Mandate that in capitated subcontract arrangements, MCOs must receive detailed reports from providers, which will enable the MCO to provide adequate information to the purchaser. B. Applying Incentives and Sanctions to MCOs Financial incentives and sanctions can be used by a purchaser to shape an MCO's behavior in desired directions, such as toward cost containment. Financi al incentives and sanctions are common in commercial sector managed care contracts, but the use of incentives and sanctions to achieve a managed care initiative's goals in a publicly funded behavioral health system is in its infancy, though likely to grow rapidly. As of 1996, only a few States -- Massachusetts, Arizona, and Hawaii --included incentives in their contracts with MCOs (Frank & McGuire, 1995; Huskamp, 1996; IOM, 1996). Pennsylvania permits its counties to include incentives in their contracts with MCOs. Incentives and Sanctions in Contracts With MCOs Incentives: Incentives are predetermined rewards, usually financial in nature, that are given to an MCO for successfully meeting targeted, contract -specified performance goals. They provide the purchaser with an effective means to motivate an MCO to achieve valued clinical, access, administrative, and/or financial goals. Incentives are especially useful when the behavior being rewar ded is likely to result in significantly improved quality of care. Sanctions: Sanctions are predetermined penalties, usually financial in nature, triggered when an MCO fails to meet specified performance standards or other conditions of the contract. They provide the purchaser with a powerful means to ensure that an MCO complies with key contractual provisions or standards crucial to quality care or operations. Sanctions should provide for a range of options of varying severity depending on the seriousness and nature of the contract violation. For extreme or repeated substandard performance, options include: suspension of new enrollees, suspension of payments, the appointment of temporary management to oversee operation of the plan, and suspension or even c ancellation of the contract (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1995; Horvath and Kaye, 1995). Contracts should specify conditions that will result in early contract termination. 1. Specifying Standards and Associated Incentives or Sanctions As dis cussed in Chapter IV and elsewhere, standards can be created to measure the performance and timeliness of various administrative, management, or clinical functions performed by an MCO (e.g., completion of financial reports, claims processing accuracy, or c ollections from third -party payers) and to measure quality of and access to care (e.g., hospital and admission rates, homelessness, criminal justice involvement, suicide -related behaviors, access to newer psychotropic medications, follow -up after inpatient discharge). Once the purchaser sets a standard, it can assign an incentive or sanction to that standard or to a group of standards. Standardized definitions and measurements should be used whenever feasible. Incentives and sanctions usually take one of t wo forms: A flat dollar amount for failure to meet the standard (e.g., a $1,000 penalty if a report is not submitted by a specified deadline) or for exceeding the standard (e.g., a $1,000 penalty for too high a call aba ndonment rate); or A percentage of the MCO's fee (e.g., the MCO loses 2 percent of its fee for each percentage point the level of enrollee satisfaction falls below the standard of a selected percent). A significant challenge for the purchaser will be determining the dollar amount of financial incentives and sanctions. Amounts should be large enough to influence behavior but not so large as to be unfeasible. Unfortunately, no solid guidelines exist at th is time on determining the ideal amount of an incentive or sanction. Some managed behavioral health contracts place limits on the level of penalties that can be incurred by the MCO. For example, a purchaser can specify various sanctions based on performanc e standards, but note that the total penalty incurred for all performance standards combined cannot exceed 20 percent of the MCO's ASO fee. In this scenario, regardless of how poor the MCO's performance is with respect to the standards, the MCO could never earn less than 80 percent of its administrative fee. Performance standards, together with financial penalties or rewards, can help to align the MCO's goals for administrative performance, quality of care, and access to care with those of the purchaser. Ho wever, choosing appropriate standards and definitions can be difficult, particularly standards that accurately, validly, and reliably measure quality and access to care (see Chapter VI). Another way of handling incentives and sanctions is \"withholding\" --which involves establishing a percentage of the MCO's fees, such as 10 to 15 percent, and withholding that amount and placing it in a reserve. The monies held are then paid out if and when the MCO has met a specified performance standard. However, the provis ions of the contract must be negotiated carefully to ensure that the parties understand when an incentive payment is necessary or when a sanction is to be withheld. The contract must clearly define a measurable event that results in an incentive payment or sanction and must specify which party determines that the event has occurred. 2. Contract Termination In the event that the MCO's poor performance becomes so persistent and serious that corrective action is no longer possible, purchasers should have the option of termination. There are two key issues in relation to contract language and termination: How and under what circumstances the contract can be terminated; and The effect of State or other laws and regulations o n contract provisions about termination. Virtually all purchasers provide for contract termination in the event of nonperformance (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Included in some termination provisions are descriptions of events or circumstances that could trig ger termination and the termination process, including timelines and notice provisions. In some States, purchasers are confronted with the problem that a State law or constitution limits the operation of contract clauses. This situation sometimes arises wh en the law treats MCOs as providers and regards them as having due process property rights in the contract and in the enrollees. That treatment prevents purchasers from terminating contracts with an MCO until the MCO has had an opportunity to exercise all of its pretermination hearing rights under State law. Example of State Law Limitations on Contract Termination The State of Illinois was enjoined from terminating the contract of an MCO that had presented substantial problems with payment of network providers, because enforcement of a termination provision amounted to State action to deprive the contractor of property and required observance of all due process requirements. The enrollees were considered the property of the MCO, and the State was prohibited even from informing the enrollees of their rights to change plans, since such conduct would interfere with the plan's property rights ( MedCare HMO . 1992]) (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). It is important to note that not all State purchasers face this external legal constraint. But States that do may experience the paradox of being treated as a private party (with none of the favorable presumptions tha t would be given to a government agency in the construction of the duties of the MCO) while at the same time bearing the legal burden of State action in attempting to terminate the contract. States that find themselves in this situation need to explore leg al avenues for expediting pretermination review, as well as general limits due to emergency on the scope of State due process law. In fact, the court in the MedCare HMO v. Bradley case described above specifically noted the lack of any facts suggesting an emergency (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). States may also wish to revise State law on due process in the context of contracts with MCOs to ensure that contract terms enable termination (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). Incentives and Sanctions. Purchasers may wish to ad dress the following in RFPs and contracts: Specify, where possible, the measures and standards for all requirements in the contract; sanctions and/or incentives should be attached as appropriate. Specify the manner in which, and at what intervals, incentiv es and sanctions will be applied, and when and by whom performance will be measured. Incorporate a set of incentives and sanctions that can be incrementally applied to exert increasing influence and that allow some flexibility in their application. Specify actual measures, the means to determine compliance with these measures, and the triggers for incentive payments and sanctions. Specify the amount, if any, to be withheld, reserved, or refunded from the MCO's fees. Select a sufficient number of standards t o motivate performance but not so many that interpretation or prioritization becomes prohibitive. Specify who will be the auditor or evaluator. Clarify the degree of the purchaser's flexibility (if any) regarding application of incentives/sanctions. C. Dea ling With Third -Party Payments The management of third -party payments is an important financial issue for a purchaser contracting with an MCO. If sources of support (e.g., commercial insurance) must be exhausted before the purchaser must pay for services, the purchaser must clarify this in the contract. For instance, because Medicaid is generally a payer of last resort (an important exception being with respect to school -based services), all other sources of support must be exhausted before the purchaser ca n access Medicaid payments. In a Medicaid managed care initiative, the MCO will have to bill Medicare or any commercial insurers before it can pay for services. Procedures for ensuring appropriate billing sequences must be in place prior to implementation of any managed care program. The purchaser also should ensure that the MCO has an incentive to pursue third -party payment aggressively. In the case of Medicaid, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requires that certain documentation be submitted for dually eligible individuals (those eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare) prior to the payment of Federal claims, and that third -party payments be collected in order to offset the Federal Medicaid costs. Only then will the purchaser receive the Federal \"match.\" To document exhaustion of these third -party sources, HCFA requires the purchaser (and the purchaser generally requires the MCO) to submit an \"explanation of benefi ts\" (EOB) with a denial of services, including the reasons for the denial by the third -party payer or Medicare. The purchaser must consider the relative costs and benefits of holding the MCO responsible for collecting third -party payments. If the capitati on payments to the MCO include an allowance for anticipated collection of third -party payments, then the MCO bears the risk for these payments. Purchasers and MCOs should require providers to obtain documentation of denied claims and/or benefit limitations . When using these third -party payments to help finance the managed care system, a purchaser has two basic options: The purchaser may subtract the anticipated amount of third -party recovery from the capitation payment, and then, to rid itself of this respo nsibility, contractually require the MCO or providers to collect these payments. This is sometimes referred to as a \"net out\" contract style. The anticipated amount must be reasonable, documented, and based on historical collection rates. It should be note d that the MCO and/or provider may or may not want to devote the necessary resources to collecting these monies, but it is important both that (1) there be a clear understanding about any role of these funds in the planned income stream of the MCO; and (2) responsibilities are clearly stated. The purchaser can pay the MCO up front for the full cost of services, including anticipated or historical levels of third - party payments, and then either adjust future payments based on actual collections, or retain t he responsibility for collecting these payments itself. This style of contract (sometimes called \"pay and chase\") provides less incentive for the MCO to ensure that providers will obtain the documentation needed to collect third -party revenue or to seek payment from third -party payers. Experience across the country with such contracts has shown that collection of third-party revenues is lower than those under other payment arrangements. The purchaser can provide financial incentives for recovery of third -party payments, including bonuses and penalties for certain performance targets. Third -Party Payments. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Explain the responsibility and process for collecting third -party payments. Require the MCO to pursue third -party payments, if applicable. Mandate that the MCO require providers to secure documentation for payment denial (and of coverage, in general) based on third -party liability. Indicate the process for reconciliation of third -party payme nts. Require the MCO to document its third -party collection capability, subject to audit. D. Making Decisions About Copayments and Deductibles Many commercial managed care plans require that consumers contribute a copayment (\"flat,\" scaled to income, or a percentage of charges) or be financially responsible for a certain deductible, both of which must usually be paid upon receipt of services. A primary purpose of copayments and deductibles (and sliding fees in the public sector) is to discourage the unneces sary use of services (e.g., inappropriate emergency room utilization). Public purchasers can sometimes adopt such requirements. However, copayments and deductibles should be designed and implemented carefully so they are high enough to limit unnecessary us e of services but low enough so they do not inhibit access to services for low -income individuals. Collecting copayments and deductibles from low -income individuals is often difficult or impossible. Indeed, it is important to note, regarding insurance cop ayments in general, that many providers of services, whether dentistry, chiropractic, or auto body repair, routinely waive the copayment, making the impact of having a copayment at all somewhat moot. In some States, however, waiving copayments is illegal. Generally, providers' only recourse if a low - income individual does not pay a copayment or deductible is to stop treatment. Stopping treatment may exacerbate the conditions of seriously ill individuals and is likely to be counter to the public policy inten t of a public managed program. Providers are often reluctant (or prohibited by statute) to discontinue treatment for such individuals. Because providers often end up responsible for footing the bill for them, copayments and deductibles are sometimes catego rized as a \"provider tax\" rather than a cost -sharing mechanism for consumers. Copayments and Deductibles. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Indicate whether and how copayments, deductibles, and/or sliding fee scales will be used and for which services and settings. Specify the dollar amount(s) of any copayments, deductibles, and/or sliding fee scales. Specify the copayments, deductibles, and/or sliding fees that are permitted and indicate how and when consideration will be given to waiving any such requirements. Stipulate the allowable limits of copayments and deductibles and the structure of sliding scales and the actions that may be taken if consumers do not pay. Specify which entity has responsibility for collection of s uch payments. Include information regarding any copayments and deductibles in consumer and provider handbooks with the rationale for copayments explained. Specify whether the provider or the MCO is allowed to keep the copayment. E. Managing Cash Flow The t iming of risk -transfer payments affects the purchaser's and MCO's cash flow management and is another financial issue that should be addressed in the managed care contract. In fee -for-service payment arrangements, purchasers usually pay vendors up to 30 da ys after services are invoiced, which occurs only after the actual delivery of services. In many public sector arrangements, payments are made in advance. Thus, advance payments to the MCO may have the effect of increasing cash requirements on the part of the purchaser in any fiscal year by 1 to 2 months' worth of total expenditures. In general, capitation payments are made one month in arrears, after the number of eligibles is known. In addition, interest earned by an MCO from payments made to it by the pu rchaser, but not yet forwarded to providers, can be a substantial source of revenue for the MCO and can create a loss of revenue to the purchaser. In this case, the purchaser can require that the MCO use these funds to offset future premiums, to reinvest i n community -based services (see section on reinvestment requirements below), or as refunds to the purchaser. If the MCO is allowed to retain the interest, that revenue should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the profits of the MCO. To min imize the interest received by the MCO, the purchaser can delay the payment of fees until providers are scheduled to be paid. Fees paid by the purchaser can also be deposited into a special account maintained by the MCO as a resource or trust account. Dep ositing the fees permits easier reconciliation of payments, avoids many of the reserve accounting requirements associated with States' insurance regulations, and minimizes the risk of loss of funds in the event of MCO bankruptcy or termination of contract. Managing Cash Flow. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Stipulate the timing of capitation payments to the MCO. Indicate rules for the use of interest earned by the MCO from payments made to it by the purchaser. Specify the use of a reserve account to simplify reconciliations and minimize the risk of the recovery of these funds by other creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Stipulate the date by which the MCO must reimburse providers each month. Specify banking an d accounting standards, subject to audit. F. Specifying Reinvestment Requirements for MCOs The purchaser must make a decision early in the design stages of the managed care program concerning the MCO's reinvestment of money into the delivery systems. The R FP and contract must clearly specify whether the MCO is expected or required to place any portion of profits back into the delivery system. If the MCO is required to place profits back into the delivery system, the contract should address how the money is spent and what programs may be affected. Merely agreeing to agree is not sufficient. The purchaser will have to make a policy decision concerning how much input it desires in the process and whether it has final authority over the reinvestment. One of the legal concerns a State Medicaid agency must consider is whether the use of such reinvestment violates Medicaid law in that it diverts money from the Medicaid program in violation of the waiver approved by the Federal Government. The Federal Government may assert that any savings attributable to Medicaid money belongs to it. The contractual terms between the purchaser and MCO should reflect the Government's authority in such situations, if applicable. Finally, the purchaser must ensure that contractual provi sions do not appear to violate the kickback provisions of the Federal Medicaid program. The reinvestment of Medicaid money cannot appear to be a kickback for withholding medically necessary care. Further, some are developing arguments to support the propos ition that the use of managed care may violate the False Claims Act when underutilization is proven. The argument exists that the failure to make a claim for services that were medically necessary in order to achieve a profit under a capitated system amoun ts to a false claim in violation of the Federal False Claims Act. Purchasers should be aware of possible contractual provisions that appear to further incentives not to make a claim. HCFA's reimbursement rules mandate that the Federal Government recover it s share of cost savings due to savings related to managed care, unless the reimbursement procedures and the contract specify that savings are to be reinvested in other, specified services. (Under certain Medicaid waivers, HCFA has permitted alternative ser vices, such as various types of self -help programs, to be funded from savings in the plan.) In a managed care initiative, purchasers may decide to expand old and/or develop new, alternative services, in lieu of the more medically oriented programs that are traditionally covered by Medicaid. For example, in Iowa, the MCO that provided behavioral health services had $1 million in allowable profits in its first year and planned to forward the additional profits to the purchaser. But, rather than refunding the profits to the State and eventually to HCFA, the purchaser directed the MCO to reinvest the money in new services within the plan, i.e., to put the money back into the delivery system. The purchaser effectively made arrangements so that the State never took possession of this money. Such an arrangement can be used with or without capitation. The method Iowa used required a HCFA waiver. Reinvestment Requirements. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Establish requirements for returning savings to the purchaser. Set up parameters for reinvestment of savings in building the service array to ensure timely and effective startup of new programs. Specify responsibilities for identifying, approving, and auditing the investment, the ti ming of actions to be taken, the methods of starting up programs (seed money, grants, etc.), and the amount of money (a percentage of savings) available for reinvestment. Clearly explain any requirements for the use of savings on the part of the MCO (e.g., administration, salaries, services). Solicit stakeholder input on how reinvestment funds will be used. G. Requiring Financial Reports by MCOs The ability of a managed care system to operate is grounded on the financial stability of the MCO as well as the delivery system used by that organization. The contract should provide for financial reporting based on both the provider's and the MCOs' needs. The purchaser's only means of ensuring the continued financial stability of the managed care program may be its ability to review current financial data. The contract should include specific provisions for reporting the financial condition of the entities involved in the plan at established intervals. This includes reports concerning utilization, denial of claims, denial of services, requests for payment, and requests for authorization --just to identify a few. The contract should clarify what information must be included and the timeframes for submission of different types of reports. Sanctions should be available t o the purchaser in the event that the reports are not submitted in a timely fashion or do not include the information required. Depending on the circumstances of the particular public purchaser , the managed care contract may be subject to the financial rep orting requirements included in the public purchaser's insurance regulations. Whenever feasible, accountability can be immeasurably enhanced by the linking of financial and clinical data. Financial Reporting. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: Indicate all Federal, State, and county insurance and other regulations related to financial reporting. Clearly indicate deadlines and required format for all financial reports. Clearly spell out the requirements for reporting financia l expenditures for both administrative and service costs. Require reporting of program administrative costs pursuant to OMB Circular A -87 and the principles for cost accounting in OMB Circular A -133, which require the reporting of costs by program and set standards for the allocation of overhead and shared administrative costs. Specify different reporting requirements for each of the applicable funding sources (e.g., Medicaid, block grants, State funds). Specify audit procedures and selection of auditor. Determine which organization is responsible by statute for assuring fiscal solvency (in addition to the purchaser). Specify an action plan if the MCO experiences financial problems with contract delivery. Specify reporting requirements of expenditures for b oth substance abuse and mental health services as a percentage of premium spent for integrated health/behavioral health plans. 1. Maintaining a competitive position may provide incentive to the MCO to control service cost. 2. Economists would call this add -on to the payment a \"risk premium.\" CHAPTER VIII Consumer Protections Key issues in this chapter: Managed care consumers' rights MCOs' consumer complaint, grievance, and appeal procedures: intersection with the Medicaid fair hearing process The need for consumer protections in the managed care contracting process has been emphasized in the preceding chapters. The most important consumer protections may be those that are not specifically labeled as such in the contract, including: # Clear requirements for coverage, network composition, and system capacity that create a duty on the part of the managed care organization (MCO) to make services accessible; # Financial arrangements that do not transfer excessive levels of risk or create other deterrents to medically necessary care; and # Quality assurance systems based on carefully developed practice guidelines and procedure s for external review and review of complaints and grievances. This chapter focuses on additional matters pertaining to the protection of the interests of consumers and their families in publicly funded managed behavioral health care plans: # Managed care consumers' rights with respect to managed care plan enrollment, confidentiality, involvement in treatment planning, and other areas; and # MCOs' procedures for handling consumers' complaints, grievances, and appeals. In publicly funded programs, consumers with mental and addictive disorders and their families are typically low - income people who often lack resources such as reliable transportation, child care, and stable living arrangements. Consumers in publicly funded p rograms include individuals who are homeless, adults with severe mental illness, caregivers of children with serious emotional disturbances, and individuals with long -term substance use disorders. Some of them have severe impairments, so obtaining access t o services and advocating on their own behalf is particularly difficult or virtually impossible. As many MCOs lack experience with consumers in publicly funded programs, it is up to the purchaser of managed care services to consider the interests of all of these consumers in drafting requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts. Report Card on For -Profit Managed Behavioral Health Care Companies The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), a strong voice of advocacy for mental health consumers and t heir families, recently released a report based on a survey conducted with nine of the largest for -profit managed behavioral health care companies in the United States (NAMI, 1997). The report concluded that for -profit managed care companies contracting wi th States or counties to care for people disabled by severe mental illnesses have failed to provide basic clinical and support services. The NAMI report assigned grades of pass, fail, or incomplete for nine components of care. It gave the overall industry a failing grade in each of the nine areas of care, although some companies received passing grades in several areas: # Presence of scientifically up -to-date guidelines for treatment; # Access to and adequacy of inpatient care; # Availability of intensive case management and of alternatives to hospital care; # Access to the most effective medications; # Response to suicide attempts; # Involvement of consumers and families in treatment planning and delivery; # Measurement of pa tient outcomes; # Access to rehabilitation services; and # Access to housing. In light of its findings, NAMI recommended that States and the Federal Government implement quality standards for public sector managed care and develop consumer protection leg islation for people with severe mental illness in managed care plans. A. Managed Care Consumers' Rights Past practices by MCOs that ignored or minimized consumers' rights sometimes resulted in inadequate or dangerous care. This led the President's Commis sion on Model State Drug Laws in 1993 to develop the Model Managed Care Consumer Protection Act, which sets a standard that \"allows responsible managed care firms to continue to carry out their functions, but creates much -needed consumer protections [again st] those firms whose policies or fiscal incentives can lead to less than adequate care\" (CSAT, 1995c). In addition, many advocacy and professional organizations have established comprehensive \"bills of rights\" linked to the full spectrum of services to wh ich the consumers of managed behavioral health care and their families may be entitled. Current Medicaid law provides Medicaid enrollees in managed care plans with \"a wide variety of [rights], many of which are not enjoyed by most commercial enrollees\" (Fr ied, 1996). The discussion below focuses on several rights of consumers of managed substance abuse and mental health services that are often touched upon in consumers' bills of rights: o The right to be given choices and p rotections in the managed care plans; o The right to confidentiality; o The right to be involved in treatment planning; o The right to be protected from disenrollment by a health plan; and o The right to representation. The section closes with a discussion of involuntary commitment and court -ordered treatment. Two examples of consumers' bills of rights \u2014one developed by the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and one developed by the American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA) \u2014are shown in Exhibits VIII -1 and VIII-2 below. The general themes of these documents are that the basic rights of consumers (and, by implication, of consumers' families) are to be protected, that consumers and families have an easy way to file grievances with an MCO, and that a system of appeals ensures speedy resolution of problems (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1995). Exhibit VIII -1. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law's Consumer \"Bill of Rights\" No managed care entity may discriminate on the basis of disability, race, religion, national origin, income, gender, or sexual orientation. Consumers have the right to be fully involved in all treatment decisions and to participate in the d evelopment of their service plan. Consumers have the right to give or withhold consent to their service plan and to amend their consent as their plan is modified. Children with a serious emotional disturbance should be in an interagency, interdisciplinary service plan developed with their family and approved by their parent or guardian. Treatment plans must respect the individual consumer's choice of service and service setting. Consumers have the right to refuse any treatment they do no t feel is appropriate and may not be disenrolled because they have refused treatment. Consumers may not be denied services that are appropriate to their needs because of their decision not to accept other services. Managed care entities must ensure confi dentiality of records, guarantee consumers full access to their own records, and protect individual privacy. Consumers have the right to establish psychiatric advance directives or durable powers of attorney specifying how they wish to be treated in an em ergency or if they are incapacitated. The managed care entity should be required to educate its providers on the use of advance directives. Consumers have the right to appeal decisions about their treatment when they disagree. The managed care entity must have an effective, expeditious, accessible, fair, and uniform grievance procedure to allow consumers to appeal decisions about care they receive or services they are denied. Consumers have the right not to be disenrolled from the plan without just cause. SOURCE: Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1995. Cited with permission from Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Exhibit VIII -2. AMBHA's Bill of Rights for Consumers* Accessing Behavioral Health Services Parity : Benefit plans for the treatment of mental/psychiatric and addictive disorders, in both the public and private sectors, shall be comprehensive; i.e., they shall cover the entire continuum of clinically effective an d appropriate services provided by all competent licensed professionals, and should provide identical coverage and funding to those benefits covering physical illness, with the same provisions, lifetime benefits, and catastrophic coverage. Choice : Consume rs shall have access to services and a choice of providers within a full continuum of network -based services, including recovery and peer support programs.

Consumer Choices and Protections in Managed Care Plans Both the Bazelon Center's bill of rights and AMBHA's bill of rights assert that consumers and families have the right to choose health plans, as well as to choose the services, service settings, practitioners, and providers within a health plan. Disregarding consumer preferences in these matters can adversely affect consumers' adherence to a treatment plan, resulting in poorer outcomes. MCOs routinely make decisions that have an impact on consumers' choices. MCOs that arbitrarily assign consumers and families to a practitioner or practitioners are denying consumers and families the right to have as much choice as possible within the system. The size of an MCO's provider panels, including group practices, may affect the number of options for consumers and families from which to select (IOM, 1996). Some States have ena cted \"any willing provider\" laws that require MCOs to contract with any provider willing to meet the terms and conditions of the MCO's contract (AMBHA, 1997), thus giving consumers a greater choice among providers and services. It should be noted, however, that requiring MCOs to subcontract with any willing provider does not necessarily mean that every provider the MCO contracts with will receive referrals from the MCO. Consumer Choices and Protections in Managed Care Plans. Purchasers may wish to address t he following in RFPs and contracts: # Reference existing State laws or regulations that address consumer protections. # Prohibit any limitations on practitioners concerning the discussion of clinically appropriate treatment options with patients and families or designated advocates (in accord with confidentiality laws [see below]). # Provide each enrollee in the plan with the option of choosing a specific primary care provider within the MCO network (with the provision that if one is not selected one will be assigned). # Ensure that each enrollee has the right to select an alternative provider if he or she so requests. # Allow the enrollee to disenroll and join another MCO if one is available. # Require consumer choice among network practitioners and f acilities. # Offer clients a choice of providers within specific levels of care and if deemed clinically appropriate. # Reference State laws with respect to provider -consumer communication. # Require the MCO to give enrollees a choice of at least two case managers. # Require the MCO to give consumers and families a choice of at least two providers in each category of benefits (some exceptions may have to be made in the case of highly specialized benefits). 2. Confidentiality Although the need for confidenti ality is not an issue unique to managed care arrangements, consumers of substance abuse and mental health treatment services and their families are especially vulnerable to being stigmatized by information that may be disclosed when they seek authorization for treatment or are referred from one practitioner or provider to another. On the other hand, the use of multiple practitioners (and prescription drugs) by consumers without an integrated service plan may be dangerous to the consumer and not cost effecti ve. The right of consumers and families to confidentiality often conflicts with the MCO's need to access information about the consumer, through utilization and case management activities designed to ensure appropriate and coordinated care. Purchasers must be aware of all Federal and State laws and regulations affecting confidentiality. Federal substance abuse treatment regulations (42 C.F.R. Part 2) require that providers of substance abuse services maintain confidentiality of consumers and families, prohi bit unauthorized disclosure of consumer -specific information, and limit ways in which disclosure can occur. These regulations protect the privacy of individuals entering treatment and help ensure that information about participation in treatment, even the fact of participation, cannot be disclosed without consent (IOM, 1996). Whereas regulations governing substance abuse treatment are based on Federal law, mental health confidentiality regulations are based on State law, and they may be quite different fro m the laws governing substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, the degree of confidentiality of data from one jurisdiction to another may also be affected by a number of other relevant laws, such as HIV confidentiality statutes, Aduty to warn@ court decision s and statutes, abuse, and neglect reporting and decisions about the special status of provider -patient communications (privilege decisions). Confidentiality in a managed care setting can be particularly problematic when MCOs ask for extensive disclosure of a consumer's records. Even though the Federal confidentiality regulations state that disclosures must be limited to only that information needed to accomplish the disclosure's purpose, MCOs sometimes ask for years' worth of records. Many MCOs will not a pprove care or reimburse for services delivered unless they obtain those records. Therefore, the purchaser may wish to stipulate in the contract the extent of information an MCO is allowed to ask a provider to disclose. Confidentiality. Purchasers may wis h to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Require the MCO to establish strategies that maximize patient confidentiality. # Require the MCO to install confidentiality protections in the management information system (see Chapter V). # Ensure qua lity assurance mechanisms to safeguard consumer records. # Specify who is allowed to release and receive consumer information and how it will be used. # Reference 42 C.F.R. Part 2 of the Federal regulations pertaining to confidentiality regarding substance abuse treatment. # Reference all applicable State confidentiality and privacy laws. # Ensure that the confidentiality section of the RFP shall survive the termination of the contract and will apply as long as the MCO maintains any identifiable information relating to enrollees. # Ensure that the MCO instructs its employees to keep confidential any information concerning the business of the State's contract and the beneficiaries it represents. # Require informed consent from the consumer for the release of any consumer information. # Require the MCO to give consumers and families an opportunity to consent when their records will be shared outside the MCO network (i.e., do not permit the MCO to ask consumers to sign a blanket waiver of their privacy rights). 3. Consumer Involvement in Treatment Planning A Arecovery -oriented@ philosophy views adult consumers and their caregiving families as partners with professionals in planning for treatment and service delivery, as long as the consumer consents to family involvement. Many believe that involving consumers and their families will generally facilitate consumer decisionmaking, help shape viable service plans, and lead to better consumer cooperation. As a partner in treatment, a consumer may face the difficult decision of refusing treatment if he or she feels that the recommended treatment is inappropriate. In reviewing RFPs for managed behavioral health care, NAMI found that most RFPs did not specifically stipulate participation by either the consumer or the f amily in treatment planning or service delivery. Three States that did stipulate such participation included the following provisions (Huskamp, 1996): # The 1991 Massachusetts substance abuse and mental health RFP specified that the MCO must develop an Ain tegrated aftercare plan upon discharge@ and that consumers and families, family members, providers, and other Aidentified supports@ should be involved in developing that plan. # The 1994 Oregon mental health RFP stipulated that the MCO Aexplain how input from service recipients and their family members (where involved) will be used to adjust service delivery.@ # The 1993 Washington mental health RFP specified that both the consumer and Aappropriate others at the recipient's request@ be involved in treatme nt planning. Consumer Involvement in Treatment Planning. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Ensure that the consumer will not be denied other potentially appropriate treatment if he/she has refused another service. # Requ ire the MCO to involve enrollees in the development of their individualized service plan. # Allow consumers to sign off on their treatment plans in an unpressured environment. # Require that family caregivers of minors and legal guardians of adults also be fully involved in the development of the service plan and have the authority to sign off on it. # Stipulate that the MCO institutionalize a system whereby consumers and families may develop advance directives that provide instructions on treatment decisio ns and that network providers should be required to check such documents before making treatment decisions for individuals found to be incompetent. # Ensure that services are provided by individuals who speak the same language as the consumer and that ther e are no other cultural barriers to full participation by consumers and families from ethnic minorities. # Ensure compliance with State licensing rules concerning client involvement in treatment planning. # Require signed treatment plans to document consen t and involvement. # Establish and monitor performance specifications for treatment plans with consumer involvement. 4. Disenrollment Protections for Consumers Consumers of behavioral health services may be difficult to treat, and appropriate treatments ma y be very expensive, creating incentives for MCOs to disenroll them. Disenrollment from a managed care plan can cause problems for consumers if there is only one plan (that is, if re -enrollment in another plan is not an available choice) or if there is no default to fee -for-service reimbursement. Rosenbaum and her associates found numerous examples of State Medicaid managed care contracts in which disenrollment for noncompliance with the treatment plan was permitted (Rosenbaum, et al., 1997). This contract provision was particularly common for health plans that integrated general and behavioral health care. If the purchaser of managed care services decides to allow the MCO to disenroll clients, the process should include multiple, well -monitored steps. Conve rsely, the process allowing consumers to voluntarily disenroll from a health plan should be simple and easy. Disenrollment Protections for Consumers. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Specify the criteria that must be me t by the MCO to proceed with disenrollment, or # Prohibit MCOs from disenrolling any individual from the plan; retain this authority for the purchaser, or # Allow some discretion for the MCO to disenroll individuals, but prohibit disenrollment due to all o r some of the reasons listed above. # When disenrollment is permitted, require the following: - Multiple and well -monitored steps established by the MCO or the provider; and - A simple process for consumer -initiated disenrollment. # Require the MCO to repo rt disenrollments and the reasons for them to the purchaser. # Specify that disenrollment is not allowed for some or all of the following reasons: - Diagnosis or perceived diagnosis; - Adverse changes in the enrollee's health or because of pre-existing conditions; - High treatment costs or inability to pay deductibles, co -payments, or other fees; - The consumer's refusal of treatment, rate of missed appointments, or other challenges to implementing the service plan; - The consumer's not h aving completed necessary forms or paperwork; - The consumer's difficult or unpleasant behavior, if such behavior is related to the individual's disability; and - The consumer's attempt to exercise his or her rights under a grievance or appeal system. 5. Consumer Representation and Advocacy Purchasers may want to ensure that consumers and families retain the right to representation, whether by an independent organization or a community advocate, to help them understand their rights and benefits. The Protec tion and Advocacy System, for example, is a federally funded, nationwide initiative to provide legal advocacy to persons with disabilities. Many public health agencies also provide community representation by trained individuals with a history of mental an d/or addictive disorders. These individuals are often effective in working with consumers and families, who are likely to have more confidence in someone who has had similar experiences. Consumer Representation and Advocacy. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Require that the MCO makes clients and their families aware of their rights to be represented by a consumer advocate. # Specify an arrangement with a formal external agent (i.e., not the MCO) or ombudsman to work with consumers, family members, and providers as a representative or advocate. # Designate the Protection and Advocacy System in the State to act as legal advocates for individuals in the managed care program. # Require dissemination of information about bot h internal and external advocacy mechanisms in several ways and ensure that information is accessible and easily understood by consumers. 6. Involuntary Commitment and Court -Ordered Addiction Treatment A court may order treatment and hold entities in contempt if the court's orders are not met. The two types of court treatment orders are (1) orders of involuntary commitment; and (2) orders requiring offenders, especially drunk drivers, to get addiction tr eatment. Orders for addiction treatment of offenders are far more common than orders for involuntary commitment. In the case of addiction treatment orders, the legal requirement is on the offender/client, not the MCO or provider, but such orders pose a pot entially significant demand for services. Court -ordered treatment often evokes much discussion and strong sentiments among the parties involved. Some consumers and families contend that use of involuntary treatment signifies a breakdown in a care system an d that a well-functioning system should not have many involuntary treatment episodes. It is essential that purchasers make thoughtful decisions consistent with State laws and regulations about this particular aspect of behavioral health care treatment. A key issue related to court -ordered treatment is who, ultimately, will be financially responsible. If the State or county remains financially responsible for involuntary substance abuse and mental health commitments, the MCO may have an incentive to shift i ts costs to the State by seeking commitment in cases where the appropriate response is not clear cut. This situation may hinder consumers from getting appropriate voluntary treatment and act as an incentive to allow consumers' conditions to deteriorate to meet involuntary commitment criteria. In the case of court -ordered treatment, MCOs often object to being forced to pay for services they do not deem medically necessary and/or that the consumer may not want (IOM, 1996). Purchasers, MCOs, and the criminal justice system must work together from the beginning of a managed care initiative to ensure clear lines of responsibility. The first step is to create a forum where courts can participate in discussions with the purchaser and the MCO. The MCO's responsibil ity in terms of assessment and treatment for responding to court -ordered referrals must be clarified. The courts must understand that the system provides medically necessary care and does not function as a secure alternative to incarceration. Each may need to adopt a new orientation to court -ordered treatment. Court -Ordered Treatment. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Clarify the clinical, financial, and legal rights and responsibilities of the purchaser, the MCO, and providers with respect to court -ordered treatment. Delineate the relationship between these parties and the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems (i.e., who pays and who determines what services are provided and for how long). # Identify who is financ ially responsible for involuntary commitment. For example, the purchaser can hold the MCO financially responsible for any consumer committed to an inpatient or outpatient facility. # Define criteria that must be met to initiate an involuntary commitment, including reference to applicable State statutes. # Require MCOs to present plans for purchaser approval that are designed to minimize the use of involuntary commitment. # Ensure that regardless of who has responsibility for these decisions, court -ordered treatment decisions are made by counselors with credentials in substance abuse treatment and prevention, qualified health professionals, or approved licensed service providers. # Require the MCO to have defined written relationships with local law enforcement agencies to ensure smooth transfer of enrollees who are assessed to be a danger to themselves or others. # Stipulate whether the MCO will be responsible to pay for court -ordered treatment judged not medically necessary based on establ ished placement, continued stay, and discharge criteria. Clarify whether any supplemental payment plans are available to fund services when the MCO determines that court -ordered treatment is not medically necessary. # Clarify whether enrollees on probation and parole are eligible for the plan. B. MCOs' Consumer Complaint, Grievance, and Appeal Procedures: Intersection With the Medicaid Fair Hearing Process When there are open avenues for managed care enrollees to express their questions, disputes, disagreem ents, and challenges, it is possible for consumers and families to challenge an MCO's decisions about eligibility, diagnoses, medical necessity determinations, types and levels of services, provider choice, and provider treatment procedures. If MCOs have p rocedures for resolving difficulties that are Aeffective, expeditious, accessible, fair, and uniform@ (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1995), consumers will gain reassurance that the MCO is responsive to their concerns. This reassurance may help enco urage consumer participation and cooperation and lead to satisfactory settlement of disputes. Protecting the rights of consumers and families to file grievances and appeals allows purchasers of managed care to have final control over issues that arise fro m the MCO's performance and its approach to problems related to quality of care. In addition, a well -functioning grievance and appeal process can also provide the purchaser with evidence of problems in the quality of care. Such information can be used to m onitor the degree to which the MCO has addressed these problems. Medicaid recipients are entitled to fair hearings in accordance with constitutional principles of due process and fundamental fairness whenever a State agency makes a fact -based decision to d eny, reduce, or terminate Medicaid benefits. (Across -the-board reductions in Medicaid benefits resulting from changes in a State plan necessitate advance notice but not a fair hearing.) The denial, reduction, or termination of medical assistance that is co nsidered medically necessary constitutes the type of State action that triggers the constitutional fair hearing requirements. Extensive regulations governing fair hearings for Medicaid recipients are set forth in the Federal Regulations (42 C.F.R. '431.20 0). When a fair hearing is requested in a timely fashion (within 10 days of the notice of intended action), services must be continued until a decision following the fair hearing is reached. The initial notice of intended action must state the actions bein g taken and the reasons for them. The fair hearing itself must comport with due process standards. Enrollment in an MCO does not annul Medicaid beneficiaries' fair hearing rights, because the MCO is acting as an agent of the State in making coverage determ inations. Several court decisions have now held that managed care enrollment leaves Medicaid recipients' fair hearing rights untouched ( Wadley v. Daniels [926 F. Supp. 1305 J. K. v. Dillenberg [836 F. Supp. 694 (D. Ariz., 1993)]. A rap id and fair managed care complaint and grievance process represents an important means for reducing the number of fair hearing requests and achieving more rapid resolution of enrollees' problems. Federal regulations require MCOs to maintain internal grieva nce procedures that are approved in writing by the agency, provide for prompt resolution, and ensure participation by individuals with the authority to order corrective action (42 C.F.R. '424.53). State Medicaid agencies should consider adopting for their Medicaid contracts the expedited review procedures required for Medicare+Choice plans, which procedures apply to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care arrangements. The expedited review procedures are designed to ensure rapid determinations and reconsiderations in situations where a health maintenance organization (HMO) determines that Athe application of the normal time frame [60 days] for making a determination (or a reconsideration following a determination) could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function@ (Social Security Act '1852(g)(3)). The provision gives the HMO 72 hours from the date of the request to make a determination or a reconsideration of the need for the expedited review, as well as a decision on the merits of the Medicare beneficiary's claim. Coverage denials are then reviewed by an independent organization. MCO Consumer Complaint, Grievance, and Appeal Procedures. Purchasers may wish to address the following in RFPs and contracts: # Mandate that the MCO develop written policies and procedures that adequately address complaint, grievance, and appeal processes for the system of care. # Require the MCO to provide consumers and families with information at the time o f enrollment that explains how to file a complaint, grievance, and appeal with the MCO or directly with the State. Ensure that this information is also supplied to advocacy organizations. # Require that the MCO monitor and log grievances and develop action plans based on recurring problems. # Require an expedited appeal for benefits if their denial could seriously jeopardize an enrollee's life or health or ability to regain maximum function. # Ensure that the consumer has representation rights in any compla int, grievance, or appeal procedure; this representative may be a community advocate, an ombudsman, an attorney, or any other individual chosen by the consumer. # Require that the MCO's written procedures list situations when consumers and families may wan t to file an oral or written complaint or grievance, such as the following: - Delay or denial of service; - Poor quality of care; - Pressure to accept unwanted treatment; - Not receiving services in the most appropriate and/or least restrictive setting; - Lack of access to necessary specialty services; - Cultural insensitivity; and - Not having access to newer medications proven to be the most effective in treating an illness (e.g., receiving haloperidol rather than clozapine or olanzapine for schizophrenia ). # Stipulate that the MCO has a formal process for review of all complaints and grievances concerning all administrative activities, such as information and referral activities, contracting procedures, claims payment, third -party revenue generation activ ities, and other aspects of the MCO's scope of administrative services. # Require the MCO to ensure that procedures for filing grievances and complaints are accessible and responsive. # Require the MCO to determine a means to provide immediate reconsideration of authorization decisions when necessary, which should take place within a specified time period (e.g., 1 day) so that clients in crisis do not experience a delay in treatment due to a disagreement between the provider and utilization mana gers. # Require the MCO to establish procedures for accepting and resolving consumer complaints, grievances, and appeals in a manner that is linguistically accessible and culturally appropriate. # Require the MCO to establish reasonable timeframes subject to purchaser approval for response to a consumer's complaint and resolution of a grievance or appeal. # Require the MCO to provide an expedited appeal process when a consumer's health is at risk. # Require the MCO and its provider network to systematically record and report to the purchaser complaints and their resolution. # Require second -level external, independent review of appeals, such as required in the U.S. Department of Defense's health care contracts. # Develop a monitoring plan for complaints, gri evances, and appeals that may include incentives or sanctions based on the MCO's performance in this area. Purchasers should be aware of the challenges that managed care procedures and requirements present to those in need of substance abuse and mental hea lth services. These are the same consumers who challenge the system because of their extensive need for services. Consumers, their families, and advocates want to be, and should be, involved in designing plans of care for these individuals. Purchasers shou ld make consumer protection a top priority and be vigilant in ensuring that systems are in place to guarantee that these vulnerable populations receive needed service in a timely, efficient, and competent manner.

Acute C are: Services provided to protect the decompensating patient and/or resolve his/her urgent and severe problems so that he/she can return as quickly as possible to the previous level of function. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC): The basis of reimbu rsement to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts; the average monthly amount received per enrollee is currently calculated as 95 percent of the average costs to deliver medical care in the fee -for-service sector. Administrat ive Capitation: Establishment of per member payments for services required to administer a health care delivery system, calculated by dividing the projected costs of administrative services by the projected number of enrollees, in order to tie an MCO's ris k and payments to enrollment. Administrative Services Only (ASO): A type of contract in which the contracted organization provides only administrative or management services (e.g., claims processing, utilization review) but not direct treatment services, which are provided by the purchaser or by another organization. Adverse Selection: When a payer has a disproportionately large share of high -risk enrollees (i.e., those with high service use and high costs) due to offering relatively generous benefits for certain types of care; to avoid adverse selection, some plans limit coverage of certain services.

Caps on Profits (see also Risk Corridors ): A contractual limitation on the amount of profit and/or loss that an MCO can realize in a risk -transfer system; designed either to minimize an MCO's financial incentives to excessively reduce service utilization or to limit their financial risk in high utilization situations. Risk corridors can be set up to limit profit and reduce risk (e.g., in a too high utilization situation, the purchaser or reinsurer might pay; in a too low utilization, the MCO might pay the purchaser back). Carve -Out: An arrangement whereby a particular type of health care s ervice, such as behavioral health care, is managed and/or provided separately from the total health care benefit package, generally so that the payer can maintain greater control of the costs. Services for certain populations or patient groups are also som etimes \"carved out\" of the overall package. Case Management (see also Intensive Case Management, Utilization Management ): Coordination and monitoring of an individual patient's treatment by a third party, either by a single case manager or a case managemen t team. The goals of case management are to ensure that a patient receives and makes the best use of needed services and adheres to the treatment plan, so that he or she maintains a stable life in the community and avoids costly care, such as inpatient tre atment. Case management can occur at the provider level or the payer level. Case Mix: The overall clinical profile of a particular group or subpopulation of consumers, determined by assessing such factors as diagnosis, severity of illness, and service util ization patterns; case mix is a key variable in establishing capitation rates and estimating costs.

Community Rating: A method of calculating a health plan premium or cap itation rate for all enrollees within a specific geographic area, based on average actual or anticipated costs for the entire group; under this method the premium or capitation rate does not vary for different subgroups of subscribers based on their previo us service utilization. Community Rating by Class (Class Rating): An adjustment to a community rated premium or capitation rate whereby certain subscriber subgroups may have different rates based on factors such as age, sex, family size, marital status, a nd industry classification; such adjustments are permissible in federally qualified HMOs. Concurrent Review: A kind of utilization review using predetermined patient placement criteria, conducted while the consumer is receiving services to determine whethe r the care being delivered is medically necessary or appropriate, and eligible for payment; performed either by an internal or external reviewer. Consumer (see also Beneficiary, Enrollee, Member, Subscriber ): An individual who receives health care or healt h-care-related services. Continued Stay Criteria: Predefined conditions or characteristics of consumers to be considered by providers and/or payers in deciding whether a consumer should continue to receive a certain type or intensity of care (e.g., inpati ent services) or should be referred to what is deemed to be a more appropriate level, type, or intensity of care.

Coordination of Benefits: Standard rules and procedur es that help determine which of two or more payers is primary and which is supplementary; such procedures seek to avoid duplicate claims payments. Copayment (see also Coinsurance, Cost Sharing, Deductible ): A cost -sharing arrangement whereby a beneficiary is responsible for paying a fixed fee per unit of treatment service (e.g., $5 per visit, $20 per inpatient day) that does not vary with the provider's charge. Copayments are designed to reduce the third -party payer's costs and decrease service utilization. Cost -Based Reimbursement: A traditional, and sometimes required, reimbursement method between public funding agencies and not -for-profit organizations in which providers are paid for services based on the documented cost of providing them; it generally in volves monthly negotiated payments reconciled to the actual costs of service periodically (e.g., quarterly or annually). Cost -Plus Reimbursement: Similar to cost -based reimbursement with the addition of a profit, or earnings factor, to the reimbursement fo r profit -making organizations. Cost Sharing (see also Copayment, Coinsurance, Deductible ): A feature of a benefit plan that requires enrollees to pay some portion of the costs for services in an attempt to control utilization and to lower premiums.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA): A 1974 Federal law that established new standards and reporting and disclosure requirements for self -insured employers and their h ealth benefit programs; self -funded health benefit plans operating under ERISA are exempt from State insurance laws and regulations. Enrollee (see also Beneficiary, Consumer, Member, Subscriber ): An individual enrolled in a health plan or a dependent of an enrolled individual, who is also covered by the plan. Episode of Care: All treatments provided for a specific condition over a period of time (e.g., an episode of substance abuse treatment is all services provided to a patient after a detoxification admission with a gap between services lasting longer than 90 days); used to analyze service costs, quality, and utilization patterns, and may be used to control the rate of payment. Essential Community Providers (ECPs): Generally, not -for-profit public behavioral health care community -based agencies, which are required to be included in an MCO's provider network, usually with a defined transition period. This permits beneficiaries who had received grant -funded se rvices to continue to receive services from the same provider in a managed care system.

Global Budgets: A method of financing managed care based on a fixed, historically determined overall budget to serve the eligible population, often used when MCOs are unable to predict or reliably determine the number of eligible individuals or the likely number of enrollees; global budgets are often used to purchase a fixed amount of treatment capacity from providers to control the risk of overspending. Group Model HMO (see Health Maintenance Organization ) Group Practice: An organized group of health care providers who generally shar e centralized administration and financial systems and who pool their income from the practice and redistribute it to group members according to prearranged terms; group practices vary widely in size, composition, and financial arrangements.

Six types of HMO models have been defined: Staff model: The HMO delivers health services through a salaried group of physicians and other professionals who are employees of the HMO and provide services only to enrollees. Group model: The HMO contracts with one independent group practice to provide health services. Network model: The HMO contracts with two or more independent group practices, possibly including a staff group, to provide health services. Although a network may include a few solo practices, it is predominantly organized around groups.

Both short - and long -term outcomes are measured. Outcomes Management: Systematic efforts to improve the results of health care ser vices, using established outcome measures. Outcomes Research: Formal studies measuring changes in consumers' status resulting from specific interventions; such studies require careful methodologies to distinguish the effects of care from the effects of the many other factors that influence patients' health and satisfaction. Outlier: Departure from an average, usually defined as at least two standard deviations from the mean; a hospital admission requiring either substantially more expense or a much longer l ength of stay than is typical for patients with a given condition or illness. Under Diagnosis -Related Group payment, patients who are outliers are given exceptional treatment subject to peer review and organization review. Outpatient Care (see also Ambulat ory Care ): Treatment delivered in a noninpatient (i.e., non -24-hour) setting; generally a less costly and less restrictive form of care. Overutilization: Unnecessary or excessive use of services, often said to be a risk in fee -for-service reimbursement systems. Partial Capitation (see also Full Capitation, Per Capita ): A method of payment in which some services are funded based on a risk -transfer contracting arrangement and some are funded through fee -for-service or other traditional forms of payment (e.g., inpatient services may be capitated while outpatient services are provided on a fee -for- service basis).

Per Capita Payment (see also Capitation, Full Capitation, Partial Capitation ): A fixed per person amount paid by a purchaser to a provider for services during a specific time, usually expressed as a per member, per month rate; based on the number of enroll ees or individuals covered, regardless of the number actually receiving services or the amount of services delivered. Performance Goal: The desired level of achievement of standards of care or service; may be expressed as minimum performance levels (thresh olds), industry -best performance (benchmarks), or the permitted variance from the standard. Performance goals usually are not static but change as performance improves and/or the standard of care is refined. Performance Measure: An indicator used to assess a health plan's or provider's delivery of care as it conforms to practice guidelines, medical review criteria, or standards of quality; adherence to performance standards is expected to lead to desirable outcomes, but performance measures do not directly measure these outcomes. Performance Payments: Incentive payments or bonuses to reward managed care organizations and providers for achievement of the purchaser's desired performance goals. Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996: A law t hat turns control of welfare over to the States; limits lifetime benefits to 5 years; requires adults to work after 2 years; and denies assistance to noncitizens.

Plan Administration (see also Administrative Services Only ): Management of a hea lth benefit plan, including accounting, billing, personnel, marketing, legal services, claims paying, purchasing, and servicing of accounts. Point -of-Service Plan: A health plan in which members can choose non -network providers who are reimbursed by a standard indemnity coverage, with members paying a larger portion of the fee. This plan is sometimes called an open -ended HMO. Practice Guidelines: Systematically developed recommendations for the most appropriate diagnostic and treatment approaches for certai n medical and mental illnesses, developed to standardize care and to facilitate decisions about appropriate care; generally, guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. Also referred to as clinical criteria, practice parameters, protoco ls, algorithms, review criteria, preferred practice patterns, and guidelines. Pre-Existing Condition: An illness or condition that is excluded from coverage by a purchaser because the condition existed before enrollment in the plan; coverage may be limited for a period of time, or indefinitely, creating significant obstacles to access to care. Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A formally organized entity of hospital and outpatient providers that agrees to accept discounted fees for treating enrollees o f a managed care plan in return for prompt payment and an expectation of a larger volume of patients. Enrollees may choose non -PPO providers but usually pay a higher portion of the costs than for PPO providers. Premium: Rate that a subscriber (either an em ployer or an individual) pays for a health benefit plan. Prepaid Group Practice (PGP): A group model HMO or multispecialty association of physicians and other health professionals that accepts a fixed payment from a managed care plan to provide a wide rang e of preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services to a defined population; the fixed amount is determined in advance for each year.

Preventive Care: Health care interventions that emphasize wellness, via prevention, early detection, and early treatment, including routine physical examination, immunization, well -person care, and patient education. Preventi ve Interventions: Services designed to reduce the probability of development of clinically demonstrable substance abuse and mental health problems. They consist of (1) universal interventions targeted to a population group that has not been identified on t he basis of individual risk (e.g., substance abuse prevention curricula required of all public school students); (2) selective interventions targeted to individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing clinical problems is significantly higher than average (e.g., bereavement support groups for low - income widows and widowers, life skills programs for chronically truant students); and (3) indicated interventions for individuals with minimal but detectable signs or symptoms foreshadowing me ntal or substance use disorders (e.g., parent -child interaction training for children identified as having persistent conduct problems). Prevention Strategies: Prevention strategies include a broad array of activities including: (1) information, (2) educat ion, (3) alternative activities, (4) problem identification and referral, (5) community -based processes, and (6) environmental approaches. (Reference 96.125 of the Federal Register, March 31, 1993, for definitions of these strategies.) Primary Care Case M anagement (PCCM), Primary Care Gatekeeper Model: A utilization management strategy in which a primary care physician manages a patient's use of health services by acting as a gatekeeper who approves all referrals and monitors all covered services and who i s paid for performing this role. Primary Care, Primary Care Provider: Basic health care services that are generally administered by internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, or obstetricians/gynecologists in an ambulatory setting; usually regarded a s general care received at the point at which the patient first seeks care from a medical system.

Comprehensive primary care involves a primary provider who takes respon sibility for a patient's overall health, whether problems are biological, behavioral, or social. Primary Prevention: Programs directed at individuals and a subgroup of the population who do not require treatment for substance abuse. This includes educating and counseling on such abuse and providing for activities that reduce substance abuse and/or use.

Purchaser (see also Payer ): A person, insurer, employer, h ealth plan, or government agency that purchases health care for an individual. Quality Assessment: Measurement of the structure of care, its processes, and its outcomes using predetermined performance and outcome indicators. Quality Assurance: Objectively and systematically monitoring the process and outcomes of care to ensure and improve its quality by use of frequent performance and outcomes measurement. Quality Assurance Reform Initiative (QARI): A process developed by the Health Care Financing Administr ation (HCFA), which created a health care quality improvement system for Medicaid managed care plans. Quality Improvement: A set of techniques based on a feedback loop that focus on the ongoing improvement of treatment processes and outcomes by identifying problem areas, introducing improvements, and reassessing changes. Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) and Total Quality Management (TQM) use consumer -oriented interdisciplinary teams to gather and assess data and to implement changes to better meet the needs and expectations of consumers. Quality of Care: The degree to which health services meet established standards, are consistent with current professional knowledge, and maximize the probability of beneficial health outcomes while minimizing risk and other untoward outcomes. Quality is often described as having three dimensions: quality of resources (certification and training of providers), quality of the process of service delivery ( the use of appropriate procedures), and quality of outcome of services (improvements in a patient's condition or reduction of harmful effects). Reconciliations: Adjustments, usually retroactive, to capitation rates or other risk -transfer payments and an accounting reconciliation at the end of the agreed -upon period of performance. Referral: The process of a health care provider or gatekeeper sending a patient to another provider for health care services; some health plans require primary care providers to a uthorize referral for specialty services. Reimbursement: The process by which health care providers receive payment for their services. In health care, providers are often reimbursed by third parties who insure and represent patients. Reinsurance: Separate insurance purchased by a health benefit plan from a third party to protect itself against losses that are not easily managed or are unpredictable; it limits the losses of the health benefit plan if expenses exceed the revenues from capitation payments. Report Card on Health Care (see also Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set [HEDIS] ): A systematic presentation of data collected periodically from health plans that profiles their performance and outcomes; it can be used by policymakers and health car e purchasers (employers, government bodies, employer coalitions, and consumers) to compare these plans. Data in major areas of accountability are provided, such as health care quality and utilization, delivery of appropriate services, patient outcomes, con sumer satisfaction, administrative efficiencies and financial stability, and cost control. Request for Information (RFI): A document used to solicit input from interested individuals on such issues as program design and network development and capacity, an d to seek information on potential bidders. Request for Proposal (RFP): A solicitation document issued to obtain offers from bidders that propose to provide products or services under a contract to be awarded using the process of negotiation. Reserves: The practice of withholding a certain percentage of premiums to provide a fund for committed but undelivered health care, uncertainties, contingencies, overutilization of referrals, accidental catastrophes, and other situations; such accounts are sometimes u sed by public purchasers to safeguard public funds in the event of the managed care organization's financial weakness or failure. Retrospective Reimbursement (see also Fee-for-Service Payment ): Payment made after services are delivered on the basis of the costs incurred to deliver them (compare Prospective Payment System ). Retrospective Review (see also Concurrent Review ): A form of utilization review conducted after services are provided to determine if the services met the requirements of the payer to jus tify reimbursement. Rider: A legal addendum or provision that modifies a contract, usually in regard to expanding or decreasing coverage of certain conditions or expanding or limiting certain services. Risk: The cost of health services. In managed care, th e liability and chance of financial loss that a health plan or provider organization assumes when it agrees in a prospective payment system to provide a defined set of services to a specific population for a predetermined fee per enrollee, regardless of th e amount of services eventually provided; loss occurs when the revenues of the purchaser are not sufficient to cover expenditures incurred in the delivery of services. Capitation financing has moved risk, as well as the potential reward, from the purchaser to the provider. Risk Adjustment: A process that takes into account the health status and risk profile of enrollees in certain health plans (e.g., severity of illness, comorbidity, consumption of cigarettes and alcohol) and shifts premium dollars from a plan with relatively healthy enrollees to another with sicker members; this process minimizes financial incentives plans may have to select healthier than average enrollees. Those that attract higher risk enrollees are thus compensated for any differences i n the proportion of their members that require high levels of care. Risk -Bearing Entity: An organization that assumes financial responsibility for the provision of a defined set of benefits for some or all of the cost of care; the entity may be an insurer, a health plan or self -funded employer, a physician -hospital organization, a government agency, or another form of provider -sponsored network (PSN). Risk Corridors, Risk Bands: The practice of limiting to a specified amount an MCO's exposure to losses and potential for profits; for example, losses and profits might be limited to 5 percent of premium or a predetermined dollar amount. Risk Factor: An epidemiological term used in examining and quantifying the likelihood that morbidity or mortality will occur; a risk factor is analyzed along with many such factors and not regarded as a definitive predictor. Risk Load (see also Loading ): A factor incorporated into a capitation rate to adjust for some adverse factor in the population or group in question. Risk Po ol: A defined account (e.g., defined by size, geographic location, claim dollars that exceed the level per individual, etc.) to which revenue and expenses are posted. A risk pool attempts to define expected claim liabilities and required funding to support the claim liability (combines risk for all or several groups of persons); an arrangement whereby part of a provider's payment is withheld and returned in proportion to the financial well -being of a health plan. Risk Sharing: A variation of risk -transfer s ystems in which losses and profits are shared between two or more parties (e.g., between the purchaser and the managed care organization) in a contractually defined manner, rather than being assumed by one entity alone; this method spreads the risk of unpl anned, unexpected financial loss resulting from underestimations of service needs. Risk Transfer Systems: Methods of payment, including capitation, global budgets, and case -rate payment, that transfer the cost of services from the purchaser to an MCO or th e provider. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver: A provision of the Social Security Act that waives, with the approval of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), certain Medicaid requirements, allowing States to implement and evaluate the efficacy and co st-effectiveness of alternative delivery systems as long as the alternatives are likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid. The waivers allow States to radically change Medicaid program provisions, including eligibility requirements, the scope of servic es available, the freedom to choose a provider, a provider's choice to participate in a plan, the method of reimbursing providers, and the statewide application of the program. Section 1915(b) Medicaid Waiver: A provision of the Social Security Act that a llows States to require Medicaid recipients to enroll in HMOs or other managed care plans in an effort improve access to quality services and to control costs. The waivers allow States to implement a primary care case management system, require Medicaid recipients to choose from a number of competing health plans, provide additional benefits in exchange for savings resulting from recipients' use of cost -effective providers, and limit the providers from whom beneficiaries can receive nonemergency treatment. The waivers are granted for 2 years, with 2 -year renewals. Self-Insurance, Self -Funding: A practice by which an organization (employer or group of employers) assumes complete financial responsibility for medical and/or behavioral health treatment costs fo r its members; insurance protection against excessive loss can be purchased. Benefits may be administered by the employer or handled through an administrative services only agreement with an insurance carrier or third -party administrator. Self -insured plans are exempt from State insurance laws and regulations. Service Area (see also Catchment Area ): A geographic area served by a health plan or provider organization, such as a hospital or community mental health center, defined on the basis of such factors a s population distribution, health resources, political boundaries, natural geographic boundaries, and/or transportation accessibility; facilitates effective planning, development, and delivery of health services. Single -Stream Funding (Unified Funding Str eam): The consolidation of multiple sources of funding into a single unified stream; a key approach used in progressive mental health systems to ensure that funds follow consumers and their service needs. Skimming (see also \"Cherry Picking\" ): A practice, u sually in a prospective payment system, by which a health plan attempts to enroll (by selection, policy, or other practices) only the most healthy subscribers and to systematically exclude less healthy individuals at higher risk for difficult or expensive treatment. A variation of skimming is the practice of providing only those services that are most favorably reimbursed by payers. Social Health Maintenance Organization (S/HMO): A health maintenance organization that also provides a variety of social and preventive services to a special -needs population with unique long -term care requirements. \"Soft\" Capitation: A capitation payment method in which the capitation rate can be modified by some form of risk sharing, allowing the rate to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. <Solo Practice: Professional practice as a self -employed individual rather than in a group; also called private practice. It is not necessarily fee -for-service practice, as solo practitioners can be part of provider ne tworks and accept capitated rates. >Staff Model HMO (see Health Maintenance Organization ) Stop -Loss Insurance (see also Reinsurance ): Insurance coverage purchased by a payer to provide protection from losses that result when claims exceed prospective payme nts; used when risk is difficult to predict or manage. Such insurance often covers claims for any enrollee that exceed a predetermined deductible, such as $25,000 or $50,000, or situations in which total claims exceed a predetermined level, such as 125% of the amount expected in an average year. Stop -Loss Provision: A provision in a risk -based contract that caps the amount of money for which an MCO is liable or establishes the maximum expense a provider can incur before the capitation rate structure changes . In a stop -loss agreement, the purchaser agrees to provide additional payment to the MCO in certain situations of loss. Also the maximum amount a beneficiary will have to pay out -of-pocket for deductible or coinsurance or copayments. Subcapitation: A form of payment in which an MCO enters into prepaid agreements with providers, thus transferring some or all of the risk. Subscriber (see also Beneficiary, Consumer, Enrollee, Member ): The individual (or employment group) who contracts for services with a prepaid health plan; the term does not include other individuals (e.g., family members) who may receive services as a result of this contract. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): A U.S. Public Health Services agency whose mission is to provide a national focus for the Federal effort to promote effective strategies for prevention and treatment of addictive and mental disorders.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Title XVI of the Social Security Act established the Social Security Administration's program of direct payments to the aged, blind, and disabled poor. In most States, SSI recipients are categorically eligible for Medicaid. Targeted Case Management: Medicaid term for case management services covered under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (as of November 1995). Federal law defines targeted case management as services that will assist individuals eligible under the State Medicaid plan in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services. Third -Party Payer: The entity (e.g., insurer, State agency) responsible for paying for health care services delivered by a provider to a beneficiary; the first party is the person receiving the services and the se cond party is the provider. Third -Party Payment: Payment for health care by a party other than the beneficiary. Third -Party Revenue: Revenue for health services from commercial payers or from a State or government agency that offsets the costs of the prog ram purchased by the county. Transferability: An agreement between two or more health plans that they will accept the other's enrollees when an enrollee changes residency from one plan's service area to another's. Treatment Interventions: Therapeutic servi ces designed to reduce the length of time a disorder exists, halt its progression of severity, or if not possible, increase the length of time between acute episodes. An Institute of Medicine typology divides treatment into (1) case identification and (2) treatment for the identified disorder, to include interventions to reduce the likelihood of future co -occurring disorders. Triage: The process of determining the degree of urgency of a client's needs and arranging for the appropriate level of care, either through referral or immediate treatment. Underwriting: The process by which an insurer assumes liability for an insured party. Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR): The average fee charged by a type of health care practitioner for a specific service in a geographic area; the amount is often used by payers as the basis for reimbursing providers. Utilization: The extent to which enrollees use a program or service; commonly examined in terms of patterns or rates of use of a single service or type of service (e.g., inpatient care, physician visits). Utilization Management (see also Case Management, Concurrent Review, Prior Authorization, Retrospective Review, Utilization Review ): A set of techniques used by or on behalf of purchasers of health benefits to ma nage health care costs by influencing decisions about patient care made by providers, payers, and patients themselves. Utilization Rates: Patterns of use of a single service or type of service, usually expressed in rates per enrollee, per 100,000 populati on, or for a period of time, such as a calendar year.

Appendix C --Definitions of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Definitions of behavioral health services developed in the field that may be useful to purchasers of managed behavioral health care in developing requests for proposals (RFPs) and contracts are presented below. The definitions of substance abuse treatment services presented here are adapted from the second edition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine's Patient Placement Criteria for the Treatment of Substance -Related Disorders, known as ASAM PPC -2 (ASAM, 1996). More complete definitions can be obtained from the original document. The definitions of mental health services presented here were developed by the mental health community, under the leadership of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, during the failed 1994 national health care reform effort. The hope was that this set of definitions (or something similar) coul d be used as a framework for the mental health services in the health benefit package. Although the wording of these definitions is probably not as precise as that needed by purchasers of managed mental health care services, the definitions do illustrate h ow mental health services were organized and defined by stakeholders in 1994. Definitions of Substance Abuse Treatment Services Level 0.5: Early Intervention Early intervention is an organized service delivered in a wide variety of settings designed to explore and address problems or risk factors that appear to be related to substance use and to assist the individual in recognizing the harmful consequences of inappropriate substance use. Level I: Outpatient Services Organized nonresidential services d elivered in a wide variety of settings that meet State licensing or certification criteria, such as office practices, behavioral health clinics, and primary care clinics. Appropriately credentialed clinicians (e.g., physicians, counselors, psychologists, s ocial workers) and addiction credentialed clinicians provide professionally directed evaluation, treatment, and recovery services to persons with substance -related disorders under a defined set of policies and procedures and provided in regularly scheduled sessions of usually fewer than 9 contact hours a week. Skilled treatment services may include individual and group counseling, family therapy, educational groups, occupational and recreational therapy, psychotherapy, or other therapies. Support systems m ay include medical, psychological, psychiatric, laboratory, and toxicology services that are available through consultation or referral. Medical and psychiatric consultation are available within 24 hours by telephone and, if face -to-face, within a time appropriate to the severity and urgency of the consultation requested. The program is directly affiliated with more and less intensive levels of care and emergency services are available by telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Level II: Intensive Outpa tient/partial Hospitalization Services Outpatient treatment in Level II involves a structured day or evening treatment program that may be offered before or after work or school, in the evening, or on a weekend. For appropriately selected patients, such pr ograms provide essential education and treatment components while allowing patients to apply their newly acquired skills within \"real - world\" environments. Programs have the capacity to arrange for medical and psychological consultation, psychopharmacologic al consultation, and 24 -hour crisis services. In addition, they have active affiliations with other levels of care and can assist in accessing clinically necessary \"wraparound\" support services such as child care, transportation, and vocational training. Beyond the essential services, many Level II programs provide psychopharmacological assessment and treatment, have the capacity to effectively treat patients with complex coexisting substance -related and mental health disorders, and have the capacity to man age outpatient detoxification. Others have the capacity to provide supplementary services such as child care, transportation, meals, and unsupervised overnight lodging. The most common variations are Intensive Outpatient (Level II.1) and Partial Hospitaliz ation (Level II.5). Level II.1: Intensive Outpatient Treatment Intensive outpatient treatment programs generally provide 9 or more hours of structured programming per week, consisting primarily of counseling and education around alcohol and other drug problems. The patient's needs for psychiatric and medical services are addressed through consultation or referral arrangements. Level II.5: Partial Hospitalization Partial hospitalization generally provides 20 or more hours of clinically intensive programming per week based on individual treatment plans. Programs have ready access to psychiatric, medical, and laboratory services, and thus have greater capacity than intensive outpatient treatment (Level II.5) to ef fectively treat individuals who have substantial medical and psychiatric problems. Level III: Residential/Inpatient Services An organized set of services staffed by designated addiction treatment personnel who provide a planned regimen of patient care i n a 24 -hour, live -in setting. Such services adhere to defined sets of policies and procedures, and are housed in, or affiliated with, permanent facilities where patients can reside safely, and which are staffed 24 hours a day. Mutual/self -help meetings gen erally are available onsite. The defining characteristic of all Level III programs is that they serve patients who need, and therefore are placed in, safe and stable living environments in order to develop sufficient recovery skills. These living environme nts may be in the same facility as the one in which the treatment services are provided or separate facilities affiliated with the treatment services provider. In this case, the relationship between living environment and treatment services must be suffici ently direct to allow specific aspects of the individual treatment plan to be addressed in both facilities. Level III.1: Clinically Managed Low -Intensity Residential Services A structured recovery environment offering low intensity professional addicti on treatment services at least 5 hours a week (or as specified by State licensure requirements and staffed 24 hours a day. The services provided may include individual, group, and family therapy. Mutual/self -help meetings usually are available onsite. Inte rpersonal and group living skills generally are promoted in this level of care through the use of community or house meetings involving residents and staff. Treatment is directed toward applying recovery skills, preventing relapse, promoting personal respo nsibility, and reintegrating the resident into the worlds of work, education, and family life. The prime example of a Level III.1 program is a halfway house, and this level is not intended to describe or include sober houses, boarding houses, or group home s where professional addiction treatment services are not provided. Level III.3: Clinically Managed Medium -Intensity Residential Services Frequently referred to as extended or long -term care, Level III.3 programs provide a structured recovery environment in combination with medium -intensity professional clinical services to support and promote recovery. Services generally are considered to be of medium intensity and are presented at a slower pace than in more intensive residential services. Interpersonal a nd group living skills generally are promoted in this level of care through community meetings involving residents and staff. Treatment is directed toward overcoming denial of the presence and effects of addiction in patients' lives, as well as enhancing t reatment acceptance and motivation, preventing continued use or relapse, and promoting eventual reintegration of the individual into the community. These programs require greater staff training and nursing supervision than Level III.1 and are thus able to address the needs of residents with slightly more severe medical or emotional/behavioral problems. Reintegration of Level III.3 residents into the community involves case management activities directed toward networking the residents into community - based a ncillary or \"wraparound\" services such as housing, vocational services, or transportation assistance to attend self-help meetings or vocational activities after discharge. Level III.5: Clinically Managed High -Intensity Residential Services High-intensit y residential programs designed to address significant problems with living skills and providing a highly structured recovery environment in combination with moderate - to high -intensity professional clinical services to support and promote recovery. These programs are characterized by their reliance on the treatment community as a therapeutic agent that introduces and enforces appropriate social values and behaviors, and by a focus on reintegration of the resident into the greater community, with a particul ar emphasis on employment and education. Treatment is specific to maintaining abstinence and preventing relapse but also vigorously promotes personal responsibility and positive character change. Token economies and other behavioral therapies sometimes are incorporated into these intense therapeutic milieus. Programs vary on their capacity to meet the medical needs of those served. The prime example of Level III.5 care is the therapeutic community. Level III.7: Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Tr eatment Level III.7 programs offer an organized service, staffed by designated addiction treatment personnel or addiction - credentialed physicians, that provides a planned regimen of 24 -hour, professionally directed evaluation, care, and treatment for addi cted patients in an inpatient setting. Such a service functions under a defined set of policies and procedures and has permanent facilities, including inpatient beds. Level III.7 care is delivered by an interdisciplinary staff to patients whose subacute bi omedical and emotional/behavioral problems are sufficiently severe to require inpatient care. Twenty -four hour observation, monitoring, and treatment are available. However, the full resources of an acute care general hospital or a medically managed inpati ent treatment service system are not necessary. The treatment delivered at Level III.7 is specific to the substance -related disorder, but the interdisciplinary team and the availability of support services also accommodate detoxification and/or intensive i npatient treatment of addiction and/or conjoint treatment of coexisting subacute biomedical and/or emotional/behavioral conditions that could jeopardize recovery. Level IV: Medically managed Intensive Inpatient Services Level IV medically managed intens ive inpatient treatment is an organized service that involves a planned regimen of 24-hour, medically directed evaluation, care, and treatment of substance -related disorders in an acute -care inpatient setting. It is designed for individuals whose acute bio medical, emotional, or behavioral problems are severe enough to require primary medical and nursing services. Three types of settings typically provide this level of care: (1) an acute care general hospital; (2) an acute psychiatric hospital or psychiatric unit within an acute care general hospital; and (3) an appropriately allowed conjoint treatment of any coexisting biomedical and emotional/ behavioral conditions that need to be addressed and that could jeopardize recovery. The service can provide life su pport care and treatment, as needed, either directly or through the transfer of the patient to another service within the facility or to another medical facility equipped to provide such care. It is staffed by designated addiction physicians or addiction credentialed clinicians, including the following: (a) An interdisciplinary team of appropriately credentialed clinicians (e.g., physicians, nurses, counselors, psychologists, social workers), who assess and treat adult patients with substance -related disor ders or addicted patients with concomitant acute biomedical, emotional/behavioral disorders. Such clinicians must be knowledgeable about the biopsychosocial dimensions of addiction and biomedical and emotional/behavioral disorders. (b) A team of appropria tely trained professionals, daily medical management and physicians available 24 hours a day; primary nursing care and observation available 24 hours a day; and professional counseling services available 16 hours a day. (c) Facility -approved addiction cou nselors or licensed, certified, or registered addiction clinicians to administer planned interventions according to the assessed needs of the patient. Modalities of Substance Abuse Care Provided at Multiple Levels Opioid Maintenance Therapy (OMT) OMT is an organized, usually ambulatory, addiction treatment service for opiate -addicted patients. OMT is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment modalities, including the therapeutic use of specialized o pioid compounds such as methadone to psychopharmacologically occupy opiate receptors in the brain, extinguish drug craving and thus establish a maintenance state. It is delivered by designated addiction trained personn el or addiction credentialed clinicians, who provide individualized treatment, case management, and health education (including education about human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases). The nature of the services prov ided (such as dose, level of care, length of service or frequency of visits) is determined by the patient's clinical needs, but such services should always include regularly scheduled psychosocial treatment sessions. OMT services function under a defined s et of policies and procedures, including admission discharge and continued service criteria stipulated by State law and regulation and the Federal regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 291. OMT is best conceptualized as a separate service that can be provided in a ny level of care, as determined by assessment of the patient's overall needs. Adjunctive nonpharmacologic interventions are essential and may be provided in the OMT clinic or through coordination with another addiction treatment provider. Settings that typ ically provide OMT include permanent freestanding clinics, community mental health centers, community health centers, hospitals, medication units, satellite clinics, or mobile units attached to a permanent clinic site. Support systems include (a) linkage w ith or access to psychological, medical and psychiatric consultation; (b) linkage with or access to emergency medical and psychiatric affiliations with more intensive levels of care, as needed; (c) linkage with or access to evaluation and ongoing primary m edical care; (d) ability to conduct or arrange for appropriate laboratory and toxicology tests; (e) availability of physicians to evaluate, prescribe, and monitor use of methadone or LAAM, and of nurses and pharmacists to dispense and administer methadone or LAAM; and (f) ability to provide or assist in arrangements for transportation services for patients who are unable to drive safely or who otherwise lack transportation. Staff include the following: (a) An interdisciplinary team of appropriately trained and credentialed addiction professionals, including a medical director, counselors, and the medical staff delineated in paragraph (b) below. The team will include social workers and licensed psychologists, as needed. They must be knowledgeable in the asses sment, interpretation, and treatment of the biopsychosocial dimensions of alcohol/other drug dependence. Staff members receive supervision appropriate to their level of training and experience. (b) Licensed medical, nursing, or pharmacy staff, who are avai lable to administer medications in accordance with the physician's prescriptions or orders. The intensity of nursing care is appropriate to the services provided by an outpatient treatment program that uses methadone or LAAM. (c) A physician, who is availa ble during medication dispensing and clinic operating hours, either in person or by telephone. Detoxification Services Detoxification services are a modality of treatment that can be provided at any level of care, depending on the clinical severity of t he individual and the resources of the program. Detoxification services should be designed to treat the patient's level of clinical severity and to achieve safe and comfortable withdrawal from mood -altering drugs (including alcohol) and to effectively faci litate the patient's transition into ongoing treatment and recovery. Level I -D: Ambulatory Detoxification Without Extended Onsite Monitoring Level I -D is an organized outpatient service, which may be delivered in an office setting, health care, or addictio n treatment facility, or in a patient's home, by trained clinicians who provide medically supervised evaluation, detoxification, and referral services according to a predetermined schedule. Such services are provided in regularly scheduled sessions and sho uld be delivered under a defined set of policies and procedures or medical protocols. Level II -D: Ambulatory Detoxification With Extended Onsite Monitoring Level II -D is similar to Level I -D with the exceptions that services are not offered in the home, n ot based on a predetermined schedule, and must include the availability of appropriately credentialed and licensed nurses (R.N., L.P.N.) for monitoring of patients over a period of several hours each day of service. Level III -D: Residential/Inpatient Detox ification Level III -D services are delivered in a variety of Level III settings with varying intensities of clinical services, particularly as demonstrated by the degree of involvement of medical and nursing professionals. Level III.2 -D: Clinically Manage d Residential Detoxification Sometimes referred to as \"social detoxification,\" Level III.2 -D is an organized service delivered by appropriately trained staff who provide 24 -hour supervision, observation, and support for patients who are intoxicated and/or undergoing withdrawal. Some clinically managed residential detoxification programs are staffed to supervise self - administered medications for the management of withdrawal. Clinically managed residential detoxification is characterized by its emphasis on pe er and social support and provides care for patients whose intoxication/withdrawal signs and symptoms are sufficiently severe to require 24 -hour structure and support. However, the full resources of a Level III.7 -D, medically monitored inpatient detoxifica tion service, are not necessary. All programs at this level rely on established clinical protocols to identify patients who are in need of medical services beyond the capacity of the facility and to transfer such patients to more appropriate levels of care . Level III.7 -D: Medically Monitored Inpatient Detoxification Level III.7 -D is an organized service delivered by medical and nursing professionals, which provides for 24 -hour, medically supervised evaluation and withdrawal management in a permanent facil ity with inpatient beds. Twenty -four hour observation, monitoring, and treatment are available. Services are delivered under a defined set of physician - approved policies and physician -monitored procedures or clinical protocols. The full resources of an acu te care general hospital or a medically managed intensive inpatient treatment program are not necessary. It sometimes is provided by overlapping with Level IV -D services (as a step -down service) in a specialty unit of an acute care general or psychiatric h ospital. Level IV -D: Medically Managed Inpatient Detoxification Level IV -D is an organized service delivered by medical and nursing professionals that provides for 24 -hour, medically directed evaluation and withdrawal management in an acute care inpatient setting. Services are delivered under a defined set of physician -approved policies and physicianmanaged procedures or medical protocols. This level provides care to patients whose withdrawal signs and symptoms are sufficiently severe to require primary medical and nursing care services. Twenty -four hour observation, monitoring, and treatment are available. The treatment is specific to acute medical detoxification. Definitions of Substance Abuse Prevention Services For purposes of the Substance Abuse Pre vention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, primary prevention activities are those directed to individuals and a subgroup of the population who do not require treatment for substance abuse. These strategies and services are aimed at educating and counseling individuals and subgroups of the population on substance abuse and providing for activities that reduce the risk of abuse and/or use. 45 C.F.R. Part 96 requires States/Territories to develop and implement a comprehensive prevention program which includes a broad array of prevention strategies. These strategies include: (1) Information Dissemination, (2) Education, (3) Alternative Activities, (4) Problem Identification and Referral, (5) Community Based Process es, and (6) Environmental Approaches. For definitions of these strategies refer to 96.125 of the Federal Register for definitions of primary prevention strategies. All of these SAPT Block Grant prevention activities must be reported under at least one of the primary prevention strategies listed above. Definitions of Mental Health Treatment Services Prevention/Intervention Services Prevention and early intervention services are a set of planned activities, services, or other measures intended to prevent or reduce the prevalence, severity, and/or consequences of mental and addictive disorders. They are intended to prevent or delay episodes of illness and disability in order to avoid more extensive and costly services later on. These services are generally aimed at the general population (primary prevention) or targeted to identified high-risk groups (secondary prevention), and are, from a public health perspective, seen as an essential component of any comprehensive health care system. Screening Services Periodic Screening for Children and Adolescents --Regular periodic screening of children and adolescents in accordance with guidelines established by the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSTD) regulations and the American Academy of P ediatrics. These screenings should be performed on a regularly scheduled basis, with greater frequency at earlier ages. In addition to screening for physical health problems, such preventive screenings should include screening for developmental, mental, em otional, behavioral, and substance abuse disorders. Brief Screening at Life Transitions --Brief sets of mental health and substance abuse screening questions added to health assessments at key transitions; these \"life transitions\" can be defined broadly or more narrowly as naturally occurring opportunities to identify mental and substance abuse disorders. The goal of such efforts is to provide prompt treatment for mental and substance disorders, thus preventing more severe disabilities and dependencies. Outpatient Therapy Psychotherapeutic counseling interventions provided at the most appropriate site including an office, clinic, home, school, or other location in the community as needed for the treatment of mental and substance abuse disorders. Includes: Individual, Family, and Group Therapy --Psychotherapeutic counseling services intended to treat mental and/or substance abuse disorders and delivered to an individual, family, or a group. Includes brief and extended treatment utilizing a variety of therapeutic approaches and may include such approaches as interactive therapy, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and adjunctive therapies.

Appendix E --Definitions of Adults With a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) and Children With a Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) Under the Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant Definition of Adults With a Serious Mental Illness Adults with a serious mental illness are defined pursuant to Section 1912(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 102 -321, as follows: \"Adults with a serious mental illness are persons: age 18 and over, who currently or at any time during the past year, have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteri a specified within DSM-III-R, that has resulted in functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.\" The following is an analysis of this definition: SMIs include an y mental disorders (including those of biological etiology) listed in DSM III (now DSM -IV) or their ICD -9-CM equivalent (and subsequent revisions), with the exception of DSM -IV \"V\" codes, substance use disorders, and developmental disorders, which are excl uded unless they co -occur with another diagnosable serious mental illness. All SMIs have episodic, recurrent, or persistent features; however, they vary in terms of severity and disabling effects. Functional impairment is defined as difficulties that sub stantially interfere with or limit role functioning in one or more major life activities including the following: - Basic daily living skills (e.g., eating, bathing, dressing); - Instrumental living skills (e.g., maintaining a household, managing money , getting around the community, taking prescribed medication); and - Functioning in social, family, and vocational/educational contexts. Adults who would have met functional impairment criteria during the referenced year without the benefit of treatme nt or other support services are considered to have serious mental illnesses. Definition of Children With a Serious Emotional Disturbance Children with a serious emotional disturbance are defined pursuant to Section 1912(c) of the Public Health Serv ice Act, as amended by Public Law 102 -321, as follows: \"Children with a serious emotional disturbance are persons: from birth up to age 18, who currently or at any time during the past year, have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient durati on to meet diagnostic criteria specified within DSM -III-R, that resulted in functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits the child's role or functioning in family, school, or community activities.\" The following is an analysis of thi s definition: \"...from birth up to age 18\" The definition is restricted to persons up to age 18. However, it is recognized that some States extend this age range to persons less than age 22. To accommodate this variabili ty, States using an extended age range for children's services should provide separate estimates for persons below age 18 and for persons aged 18 to 22 within block grant applications. \"...who currently or at any time during the past year\" The reference year in each of the definitions refers to a continuous 12 -month period because this is a frequently used interval in epidemiological research and because it relates closely to commonly u sed planning cycles. \"...have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within DSM -III-R\" DSM -IV is now the appropriate document to use. The 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-IO), developed by the World Health Organization, was published in 1992, but will probably not be officially adopted in the United States until late in the 1990's. These revised nomenclatur es are likely to affect both the language of mental disorders and the types of disorders currently included or excluded from these definitions. As appropriate, the definitions will be updated by the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) accordingly. \"...that resulted in functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits the child's role or functioning in family, school, or community activities.\" Functional impairment which \"substantially\" interferes w ill be operationally defined as part of the process of developing standardized methods for estimation. SEDs include any mental disorder (including those of biological etiology) listed in DSM-IV or their ICD -9-CM equivale nt (and subsequent revisions), with the exception of DSM -IV \"V\" codes, substance use, and developmental disorders, which are excluded unless they co -occur with another diagnosable serious emotional disturbance. All SEDs have episodic, recurrent, or pers istent features; however, they vary in terms of severity and disabling effects. Functional impairment is defined as difficulties that substantially interfere with or limit a child or adolescent from achieving or maintaining one or more developmentally a ppropriate social, behavioral, cognitive, communicative, or adaptive skills. Functional impairments of episodic, recurrent, and continuous duration are included unless they are temporary and expected responses to stressful events in the environment. Children who would have met functional impairment criteria during the referenced year without the benefit of treatment or other support services are included in this definition.
