Understanding Daoist Psychology gives us the ability to see others and ourselves from this unified perspective. It shows us how our human suffering is created and how we can be healed from this universal condition to restore the original humanity that we have since lost. This workshop begins with a lecture followed by a specific acupressure formula designed to allow participants to practice and synthesize this conceptual material. Come prepared to give and receive a Daoist inspired acupressure treatment! Dennis Willmont, Lic. Ac., C.I. Acupressure AOBTA\u00ae Dennis has been practicing Shiatsu, Acupressure, Taijiquan, and Daoist meditation since 1971 and Acupuncture since 1976. He is a graduate of the New England School of Acupuncture, in the first class of acupuncturists trained in North America. Dennis is also an herbalist and dedicated author producing over ten books - driven by his personal quest to heal the world by living and applying the Daoist principles of health and healing through integration of the Mind, Body and Spirit. From 1977 to 1984 Dennis directed the Training Program in Shiatsu and Acupressure at The Acupuncture and Shiatsu Therapy Center in Boston where his program in Acupressure, a synthesis of ancient palm healing and acupuncture energetics became the standard of acupressure tested in national examinations by the American Organization for Bodywork Therapy of Asia (AOBTA). His significant contributions earned Dennis the status of Certified Instructor and Honorary Member. Bringing over 40 years experience to this subject matter, practitioners and students will rarely have the chance to study with such as masterful teacher. Saturday, January 14, 2017 from 10:00-6:00 p.m. Zhang Jie Bin: A Comprehensive Understanding of Spirit and Emotions Guest Lecturer Cindy Banker As a physician and scholar of the Ming dynasty, Zhang Jie Bin had access to the wealth of literature that formulated all of the theory now described as Traditional or Classical Chinese Medicine. Zhang Jie Bin's military background and brilliant mind helped him succeed in the extremely ambitious goal of re-organizing the original \"classic\" the Nei Jing into his own Lei Jing, published in 1624. A comprehensive clinical manual, the Lei Jing was used as a blueprint for the Chinese Medical textbooks that followed. Many sections, including the ones on Qing Zhi Bing (Emotional and Mental Illness) however, were deemed unscientific and purposely omitted. It is here that our own modern scholars can find descriptions of how Spirit, Emotions and the Mind act as primary drivers for both health and physical pathology. In this seminar we will read Zhang's original descriptions and discuss our own clinical experience in finding spiritual-emotional-psychological levels of resonance to be a source of health or physical pathology. With a perspective gained though original translations, combined with a lifetime of clinical experience, Cindy will provide participants the opportunity to explore the brilliance of Zhang Jie Bin's work. Cindy Banker MA, C.I. Five Element Shiatsu (AOBTA)\u00ae, Dipl. ABT (NCCAOM)\u00ae In the 1990's Cindy completed both a bachelor's and master's degree through Lesley University's Independent Research Options with Ted Kaptchuk serving as her professional advisor. Focusing first on the history of Chinese Medicine Cindy included the study of literary Chinese so that she could access the vast resources of Chinese Medicine's original source material. Cindy completed her master's degree in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Language with a thesis that translated the Chapter \"Qing Zhi Bing\" (emotional and mental illness) from Zhang Jie Bin's Lei Jing (categorization of the Classic). Because this text has never been translated into English, Cindy's research and translation of key sections of the text provides a unique resource within the field of scholarly research. After completing her master's degree Cindy continued her studies of literary Chinese at Harvard University and participated in many medical text-reading workshops. These workshops were attended by international scholars who each presented their own original translation work. Sunday, January 15, 2017 from 9:30-5:30 p.m. Harmonizing Shen: An Acupressure Approach Using the Chong Mai Guest Lecturer Barbara Blanchard One of the Extraordinary Vessels, the Chong Mai or the Penetrating Vessel has an important influence on affecting the emotions. Its characteristics have the ability to harmonize the emotions when they are imbalanced. Extraordinary Vessels are the deepest pathways that circulate Yuan Source Qi and connect to the Dan Tien \"elixir field.\" You will review and enhance your understanding of the pathway, characteristics and energetic implications of the Chong Mai. We will discuss how emotions can cause pathology, and best approaches for treatment when using the Chong Mai. Deepen your clinical skills by differentiating hara assessment for the Chong Mai and evaluating how a client with an imbalance in Shen might present. Designed for Acupuncturists and Asian Bodywork Therapists, learn how to harmonize the emotions using an Acupressure treatment to connect and balance the Chong Mai. You will practice basic Acupressure techniques and learn how to open the vessels and access the Qi. Specific Acupoint combinations will be practiced to tap into the resonance of the Chong Mai.
