Newborns are our pride and joy, our hope for the future. Most mothers and fathers do everything they can to promote a healthy and happy newborn. Since we know there are diseases out there that are especially risky for pregnant women and newborns, the Nevada State Immunization Program has created two special programs to promote health and prevent pertussis (whooping cough) and influenza. Both programs are a form of \"COCOONING\". Cocooning is immunizing EVERYONE in close contact to the newborn so that there is a cocoon of safety from pertussis and influenza surrounding the newborn until he/she can develop immunity at around one year of life from their own vaccines. What is pertussis? Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) has been on the rise in the United States and around the world over the past two decades. It is a highly contagious respiratory disease with a prolonged cough and has been called the \"100 day cough.\" In 2012, the U.S. had more than 41,000 cases,18 infant deaths, and 49 states have pertussis epidemics or outbreaks. The majority of the cases have been infants less than 3 months of age. Adolescents and adults losing immunity from their childhood vaccinations over time is the most likely cause for the increase of cases. Unfortunately, newborns and infants less than one year of age are at greatest risk from pertussis. How does pertussis spread? Adolescents and adults can get pertussis, but in many cases it looks just like a cold or the flu and is not recognized or reported. Unfortunately, these same adolescents or adults when around newborns and young infants who are not immunized can infect them with pertussis. The rates of serious complications and death are the very highest in this young age group. All pertussis-related deaths in 2012 occurred in infants less than 2 months of age. Research shows that the majority of these infants caught pertussis from a family member or close contact. We know you don't want to get sick or pass this disease to your newborn. How can I help to stop the spread of pertussis? Get immunized with Tdap!!! Evidence-based research has led the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States, to HIGHLY RECOMMEND a pertussis \"booster,\" called Tdap, for: ALL Adolescents (10-18), especially those who are around infants less than 12 months of age ALL Adults (19 & up), especially those who are around infants less than 12 months of age ALL Pregnant Women with each pregnancy between 27-36 weeks gestation as the BEST and SAFEST option, or right after delivery before discharge from the hospital if not immunized with Tdap during pregnancy ALL Health Care Workers (anyone who works in a clinic or hospital) get your Tdap booster today to protect yourself, your co-workers and to those whom you provide care. ALL New Parents need to encourage family members and friends who will be in contact with their baby to get the Tdap shot 2 weeks or more BEFORE the baby is born to make sure immunity is in place. When we \"cocoon\" the newborn by surrounding him or her with health care providers, parents and family members who have been immunized against pertussis, we dramatically decrease their chance of getting pertussis. Thank you for making this wise choice to protect yourself and your newborn. YOU are making a difference in keeping Nevada healthy and safe for our youngest citizens. How do I know if I need a Tdap booster? The length of protection from the Tdap shot is not known yet. It is important to make sure that you are current. Tdap has been available since 2005, but another immunization, Td, may still be given during emergency room visits. This is a safe vaccine, but it does not contain pertussis vaccine and will not protect you against pertussis. Please ask for Tdap if you need a tetanus shot after an accident, and it is safe to get a Tdap immunization at any time. You can visit izrecord.nv.gov to view and print your official Nevada state immunization record or call the Nevada State Immunization Program's NV WebIZ Help Desk at (775) 684-5954. \"Seeing the commercials and knowing about the outbreak in California, I knew that before bringing my baby home from the hospital that all immediate family members had to get their Tdap shot. If they didn't they weren't allowed near the baby. I didn't want to put her at risk.\" Crystal C., Real Estate Broker and mother of 3, Dayton, NV "}
