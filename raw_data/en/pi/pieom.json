Take great care of it with supportive chiropractic care. At Chiropractic Natural Health Care (CNHC), we realize how important it is to treat the body as a \"whole\". Success depends upon being able to locate the \"cause\" of the problem, then choosing the most appropriate method of correction. We use various methods of evaluation including applied kinesiology to determine specific structural maladies or biochemical imbalances in organ systems, which ultimately result in pain, sickness and disease. Upon determining the origin of the dysfunction, varied techniques are used to correct the cause of the problem. Our doctors network with a Global Healing Team to bring you the latest advanced techniques to stimulate your body to heal itself. Such techniques include Neurolink, developed in New Zealand by Dr. Alan Phillips, D.O. This system is based on the realization that all bodily functions are controlled by the nervous system, which is controlled by the brain. Until the brain is communicating properly with the nervous system and all of the organ systems, the patient will not have complete wellness recovery. Another commonly used technique Total Body Modification (TBM) developed by Dr. Victor Frank, D.C., is used to balance nerves, muscles, and organ systems to achieve synchronicity. TBM is also instrumental in treatment of allergies and thus the elimination of the need for harmful medications. Bio Energetic Synchronization Technique (B.E.S.T) developed by Dr. Morter, D.C., is used at NHC to remove interference / distractions that detract from the body's natural healing potential. Of paramount importance in the healing cycle is the removal of emotional components that are attached to structural and biochemical problems, which create a barrier to the healing process. Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) developed by Dr. Scott Walker, D.C., is a powerful intervention to assess and alleviate internal stressors, and allow the body's own healing wisdom to express itself. At CNHC our doctors are dedicated in their quest to discover the root cause of your pain and dysfunction and ultimately use the proper methods to address correction in an expeditious manner. Our goal is to achieve balance relating to biochemical and emotional situations, which will vastly improve your level of health and enrich your quality of life. Dr. Thad Dall, D.C.
