Effective Date Of Your Coverage \"For specific information concerning Your Effective Date of coverage under this Plan, You should please refer to Your Human Resources or benefits department.\" Coverage for a newborn child is effective from the moment of birt h. Covered Services include the treatment of any injury or illness such as congenital deformity, hereditary complication, premature birth, and routine nursery care. Newborn must be formally added to Employee's policy through \"family status\" change process. please refer to NEWBORN INFANT COVERAGE. Newborn Infant Coverage The benefits payable for covered Dependent children shall be paid for a sick or injured newborn infant of a Covered Person for the first 30 days of his or her life. The coverage for newly a dopted children will be the same as for other covered Dependents. The coverage for the newborn infant or newly adopted child consists of coverage of injury or sickness, including the necessary care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects an d birth abnormalities. Coverage for the newborn infant or newly adopted child shall include, but not be limited to, benefits for Inpatient or Outpatient expenses arising from medical and dental treatment (including orthodontic and oral surgery treatment) i nvolved in the management of birth defects known as cleft lip and cleft palate. The coverage required for a newly adopted child: 1.

Continues unless the placement is disrupted prior to legal adoption and the child is removed from placement ; or 27 3. Continues unless required action as described below is not taken. To be covered beyond the first 30 days, the newborn or newly adopted child must be added to the Covered Person's Plan Enrollment within the first 30 days after birth or adoption. If the Enrollee must change to coverage with a higher fee to add the child, the Enrollee will be liable for the higher fee for the entire period of the child's coverage, including the first 30 days. Federal Laws Related To Your Coverage In the past few years, Congress has passed several laws that have affected our gro up health plans. These laws are designed to reduce Medicare expenditures by requiring that active employees and/or their Dependents who are either age 65 or over, or disabled to elect either: a) our group health Plan, or b) Medicare as their primary coverage. The preference is option (a) since option (b) would require the discontinuance of the group medical Plan. In addition, Medicare no longer requires enrollment in the Part B Supplemental Medical Insurance Benefit for which there is a charge so long as You remain covered under our group medical Plan. 28 HOW YOUR Plan WORKS Note: Capitalized terms such as Covered Services, Medical Necessity, and Out-of-Pocket Maximum are defined in the \"Definitions\" Section. Introduction Your health Plan is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) which is a comprehensive Plan. The Plan is divided into two sets of benefits: Network and Out-of-Network . If You choose a Network Provider, You will receive Network benefits. Utilizing this method means You will not have to pay as much money . Your Out- of-Pocket expenses will be higher when You use Out-of-Network Provider s. To find a Network Provider for this Plan, please refer to \"How to Find a Provider in the Network,\" later i n this section . Providers are compensated using a variety of payment arrangements, including fee for service, per diem, discounted fees, and global reimbursement. All Covered Services must be Medically Necessary, and coverage or certification of services that are not Medically Necessary may be denied. Network Services When You use a Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Services will be covered at the Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, benefits will be denied for care that is not a Covered Service. The Plan has the final authority t o decide the Medical Necessity of the service. Network Providers include Primary Care Physicians/ Providers (PCPs), Specialists (Specialty Ca re Physicians/ Providers - SCPs), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other Facilities who contract with us to care for You. Referrals are never needed to visit a Network Specialist, including Mental Health Providers. If You receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider after we failed to provide You with accurate information in our Provider directo ry at www.anthem.com, or after we failed to respond to Your telephone or web -based inquiry within the time required by Federal law, Covered Services will be covered at the Network level. If You receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider afte r we failed to provide You with accurate information in our Provider directory at anthem.com, or after we failed to respond to Your telephone or web -based inquiry within the time required by Federal law, Covered Services will be covered at the Network leve l. To please refer to a Physician, call their office: tell them You are an Anthem Member, have Your Member Identification Card handy. The Physician's office may ask You for Your group or Member ID number. Tell them the reason for Your visit. When You go to the office, be sure to bring Your Member Identification Card with You. For services from Network Providers: 1. You will not need to file claims. Network Providers will file claims for Covered Services for You. (You will still need to pay any Coinsurance and/or Deductibles that apply.) You may be billed by Your Network Provider(s) for any non -Covered Services You get or when You have not followed th e terms of this Benefit Booklet. 29 2. Precertification will be done by the Network Provider. (Please refer to the Healthcare Management - Precertification section for further details.) Please refer to the Claims Payment section for additional information on Authorized Services. After Hours Care If You need care after normal business hours, Your Physician may have several options for You. You should call Your Physician's office for instructions if You need care in the evenings, on weekends, or during the holidays and cannot wait until the office reopens. If You have an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. Out-of-Network Services When You do not use a Network Provider or get care as part of an Authorized Service, Covered Ser vices are covered at the Out -of-Network level, unless otherwise indicated in this Benefit Booklet. For services from an Out -of-Network Provider: There is no limit to what an Out -of-Network provider can charge unless Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim ; The Out -of-Network Provider may charge You the difference between their bill and the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount plus any Deductible and/ or Coinsurance unless Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim ; You may have higher cost-sharing amounts (i.e., De ductibles and/or Coinsurance) unless Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim ; You will have to pay for services that are not Medical ly Necessary ; You will have to pay for non -Covered Services ; You may have to file claims ; and You must make sure any necessary Precertification is done. (Please refer to Healthcare Management - Precertification for more details.) Surprise Billing Claims Surprise Billing Claims are described in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice in the Health Benefits Coverage Under Federal Law section . Please refer to that section for further details. Use the Mobile App to Connect with Us As soon as You enroll in this Plan, You should download the mobile app (Sydney Health) . You can find details on how to do this at www.anthem.com . The goal is to make it easy for You to find answers to Your questions. You can chat with a representative live in the app or contact us at www.anthem.com . How to Find a Provider in the Network There are three ways You can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Plan. You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training. Please refer to Your Plan's directory of Network Providers at www.anthem.com , which lists the Physicians, Providers, and Facilitie s that participate in this Plan's network. The provider tier can be identified by selecting the \"recognitions/tier\" link within the provider search tool. Search for a Provider in our Sydney Health app. Call Member Services to ask for a list of Physicians a nd Providers that participate in this Plan's network, based on specialty and geographic area. Check with Your Physician or Provider. 30 If You need details about a Provider's license or training, or help choosing a Physician who is right for You, call the Member Services number on the back of Your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with us to help with Your needs. Continuity of Care/Continuation of Care/Transition of Care If Your Network Provider leaves our Network for any reason other than termination for cause, and You are in active treatment, You may be able to continue seeing that Provider for a limited period of time and still get Network benefits. \"Active treatment\" incl udes : An ongoing course of treatment for a life -threatening condition. An ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and post -operative visits). An ongoing course of treatment for pregnancy and thr ough the postpartum period. An ongoing course of treatment for a health condition for which the Physician or healthcare Provider attests that discontinuing care by the current Physician or Provider would worsen Your condition or interfere with anticipated outcomes. An \"ongoing course of treatment\" includes treatments for mental health and substance use disorders. In these cases, You may be able to continue seeing that Provider until treatment is complete, or for 90 days, whichever is shorter. If You wish to continue seeing the same Provider, You should contact Member Services for details. Any decision by the Plan regarding a request for is subject to review. The BlueCard Program Like all Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans throughout the country, Anthem participates in a program called \"BlueCard,\" which provides services to You when You are outside our Service Area. For more details on this program, please refer to \"Inter-Plan Arrangements\" in the Claims Payment section. Calendar Year Deductible Before the Plan begins to pay benefits, you must meet any Deductible required. You must satisfy the Deductible based on the network tier being utilized as explained in the Schedule of Benefits . Deductible requirements are stated in the Schedule of Benefits . Deductibles There are two different types of Deductibles, embedded and non -embedded (True Family) Deductibles. Your Plan has an non -embedded Deductible. Non-embedded Deductible The non -embedded (true family) Deductible means that a family can meet the Deductible by pooling Deductible expenses. Unlike embedded Deductible Plans, there is no limit to the amount one Member can pay toward the family Deductible . If You have a $2,000/ $4,000 (single/family) non -embedded (true family) Deductible, here is how Your Plan would work: 31 In this example, the subscriber met the entire family Deductible, so the entire family moves on to Copays/Coinsurance for Covered Services. Out-of-Pocket Ma ximum An Out -of-Pocket Maximum is the annual limit on the amount of money that You would have to pay for healthcare services, not including monthly premiums or services not covered. After the maximum is reached, all covered health services are paid in full by the health Plan for the rest of that Plan Year. All payments that apply to the Deductible also apply to the Out -of-Pocket Maximum. 32 Non-Embedded (True Family) Out -of-Pocket The non -embedded (true family) Out -of-Pocket means that a family can meet the Out -of-Pocket by pooling Out -of-Pocket expenses. Unlike embedded Out -of-Pocket Plans, there is no limit to the amount one Member can pay toward the family Out -of-Pocket. If You have a $4,000/$8,000 (single/family) non -embedded (true family) Out -of-Pocket. Here's how Your Plan would work: In this example, the subscriber met the entire family Out-of-Pocket , so the entire family moves on to all covered health services paid in full by the health Plan for the rest of that Plan Year. Once the Out -of-Pocket is met, You will pay no cost -share whe n You receive Covered Services. 1 Subscriber: $8,000 Deductible, Copay and/or Coinsurance Spouse: $0 $0 Child 2: $0 2 Family Out -of-Pocket met For entire Family, all covered health services paid in full by the health plan for the rest of that plan year . 33 HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT - PRECERTIFICATION Your Plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigative as those terms are defined in this Benefit Booklet. Utilization Review aids the delivery of cost -effective healthcare by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. Acute Care at Home Programs Anthem has pr ograms available that offer acute care to Members where they live as an alternative to staying in a Facility, when the Member's condition and the Covered Services to be delivered, are appropriate for the home setting. We refer to these programs as Acute Ca re at Home Programs. These programs provide care for active, short -term treatment of a severe injury or episode of illness, an urgent medical condition, or during recovery from surgery. Acute care services are generally delivered by teams of healthcare Providers from a range of medical and surgical specialties. The Acute Care at Home Programs are separate from our Home Healthcare Services benefit, are only available in certain Service Areas, and are only provided if the Member's home meets acce ssibility requirements. Covered Services provided by Acute Care at Home Programs may include Physician services (either in - person or via telemedicine), diagnostic services, surgery, Home Healthcare services, home infusion therapy, Prescription Drugs Admini stered by a Medical Provider, therapy services, and follow -up care in the community. Prescription Drugs at a Retail or Mail Order Pharmacy are not included in these Programs. Acute Care at Home Programs may also include services required to set up telemedi cine technology for in - home patient monitoring , and may include coverage for meals. Members who qualify for these programs will be contacted by our Provider, who will discuss how treatment will be structured, and what costs may be required for the services . Benefit limits that might otherwise apply to outpatient or Home Healthcare services, (e.g., Home Healthcare visits, physical therapy, etc.), may not apply to these programs. Your participation in these programs is voluntary . If You choose to participate , Your Provider will discuss the length of time that benefits are available under the program (e.g., the Acute Care at Home Benefit Period) when You enroll. The Acute Care at Home Benefit Period typically begins on the date Your Acute Care at Home Provider sets up services in Your home , and lasts until the date You are discharged from the Program. Any Covered Services received before or after the Acute Care at Home Benefit Period will be covered according to the other benefits of this Plan. Reviewing Where Services are Provided A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting , or place of service is reviewed, services that can be safely given to You in a lower level of care or lower cost setting/place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care or higher cost setting/place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not Medical ly Necessary for the service to be provided where it is being requested. When this happens, the service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Necessity. At times , a different Provider or Facility may need to be used in order for the service to be considered Medically Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to: A service may be denied on an Inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an outpatient basis at a Hospital. A service may be d enied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free-standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgery Center, or in a Physician's office. A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a hom e setting. 34 Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. The Plan may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent treatment that is more cost -effective is available and appropriate. \"Clinically equivalent\" means treatments that for most Members will give You similar results for a disease or condition. If You have any questions about the Utilization Review process, the medical policies, or clini cal guidelines, You may call the Member Services telephone number on Your Identification Card or visit www.anthem.com . Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if the Plan decides Your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, on the date You get service : 1. You must be eligible for benefits ; 2. Fees must be paid for the time period that services are given ; 3. The service or supply must be a Covered Service under Your Plan; 4. The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under Your Plan; and 5. You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under Your Plan. Types of Reviews: Pre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. Precertification - A required Pre -service Review for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for You to get benefits. The benefit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental/Investigative as those terms are defin ed in this Benefit Booklet. For admissions following Emergency Care, You, Your authorized representative or doctor should tell the Claims Administrator as soon as You are stabilized . For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. Precertification is not required for the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section. Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require Precertification . Continued Stay/Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission fo r a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a Facility or course of treatment. Both Pre -Service and Continued Stay/Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view of the treating Provider or any doctor with knowledge of Your medical condition, without such care or treatment, Your life or health or Your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or You could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. Post -service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service rev iews are performed when a service, treatment or admission did not need a Precertification , or when a needed Precertification was not obtained. Post-service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which the Claims Administrator has a relat ed clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by the Claims Administrator. 35 Failure to Obtain Precertification Penalty : Important Note: If You or Your Out -of-Network Provider do not obtain the required Precertification, a $300 penalty will apply, and Your Out -of-Pocket costs will increase. This does not apply to Medically Necessary services from a Network or BlueCard Provid er. The following list is not all inclusive and is subject to change . Limitations and exclusions may apply.

These Drugs are used to treat complicated and chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis , and other diseases. Health issues like these can be challenging to manage and we want to assure that You receive safe, effective treatment. Providing coverage under the best bene fit (Pharmacy or medical) is the first step. Specialty medications which You can give to Yourself are best managed under the Pharmacy benefit. Drugs which require a medical professional to give to You will be provided under Your medical benefit. Anthem al so requires Precertification for certain Specialty Drugs under the medical benefit. This means that a clinical review is required before the Drug is approved. Precertification assures consistent use of effective medications based on our medical policies an d treatment guidelines. We also review for correct dose and frequency as well. During this time, our pharmacists will work with Your Physician to incorporate additional dose reduction opportunities that are still clinically appropriate for You. Your Physic ian will contact us for Precertification and provide us with the clinical information needed for us to review the request. Our final focus is on the setting in which Your treatment may occur. There are multiple options available to You typically selected b y Your Physician. Did You know that the outpatient Hospital setting can be 2 -3 times more costly than other sites? Receiving care in a lower cost site which can meet Your specific needs can help You and Your Employer save money and can also possibly provi de You with more convenient options in which to receive Your Drug treatment. Anthem's Site of Care program requires that Your prescriber provide information on the level of care that You need. You may be redirected to receive Your care in Your Physician's office, an infusion center, or from a home infusion Provider instead of the outpatient Hospital. All of these approaches work cohesively together to help You with Your medical Specialty Drug needs. 58 Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider This Plan covers Prescription Drugs including Specialty Drugs, that must be administered to You as part of a doctor 's visit, Home Healthcare visit, or at an outpatient Facility when they are Covered Services. This may include Drugs for infusion therapy, chem otherapy, blood products, certain injectables, and any Drug that must be administered by a Provider. This section applies when a Provider orders the Drug and a medical Provider administers it to You in a medical setting. Benefits for Drugs that You inject or get through Your Pharmacy benefits (i.e., self -administered Drugs) are not covered under this section. Covered Prescription Drugs To be a Covered Service, Prescription Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, under Federal law, require a Prescription.

Compound Drugs are a Covered Service when a commercially avai lable dosage form of a Medically Necessary medication is not available, all the ingredients of the compound Drug are FDA approved require a prescription to dispense, and are not essentially the same as an FDA approved product from a Drug manufacturer. Non-FDA approved, non -proprietary, multisource ingredients that are vehicles essential for compound administration may be covered. What's Not Covered 1. Compound Drugs will not be covered unless all of the ingredients are FDA approved and cannot be essentially th e same as an FDA -approved Prescription product already on the market. The ingredients in the compound must also require a Prescription to dispense. This means that if the compound contains ingredients that may be purchased over -the-counter, it would not be covered. Ingredients such as the compound base ingredient (non -proprietary cream, ointment, or like product) or an adjuvant are not subject to these limitations. 2. Drugs not approved by the FDA. Precertification Precertification may be required for certain Prescription Drugs to help make sure proper use and guidelines for Prescription Drug coverage are followed.

For a list of Prescription Drugs that need Precertification , please call the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card. The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time.

Please refer to the section Healthcare Management - Precertification for more details. If Precertification is denied You have the right to file an appeal as outlined in the Your Right To Appeal section of this Benefit Booklet. Designated Pharmacy Provider The Plan in its sole discretion, may establish one or more Designated Pharmacy Provider programs which provide specific Pharmacy services (including shipment of Prescription Drugs) to Members. A Network Provider is not necessarily a Designated Pharmacy Provider. To be a Designated Pharmacy Provider, the Network Provider must have signed a Designated Pharmacy Provider Agreement with the Claims Administrator . You or Your Provider can contact Member Services to learn which Pharmacy or Pharmacies are part of a Designate d Pharmacy Provider program. 59 For Prescription Drugs that are shipped to You or Your Provider and administered in Your Provider's office, You and Your Provider are required to order from a Designated Pharmacy Provider.

You may also be required to use a Designated Pharmacy Provider to obtain Prescription Drugs for treatment of certain clinical conditions such as Hemophilia. The Plan reserves the right to modify the list of Prescription Drugs as well as the setting and/or level of care in which the care is provided to You. The Plan may from time to time, change with or without advance notice, the Designated Pharmacy Provider for a Drug, if in the Plan's discretion, such change can help provide cost -effective, value -based and/or quality services.

You can get the list of the Prescription Drugs covered under this section by calling Member Services at the phone number on the back of Your Identification Card or check the Claims Administrator's website at www.anthem.com.

In determining whether a Service is Experimental/Investigative, the Plan will consider the information describ ed below and assess whether: 1. the scientific evidence is conclusory concerning the effect of the service on health outcomes ; 2. the evidence demonstrates the service improves net health outcomes of the total population for whom the service might be propos ed by producing beneficial effects that outweigh any harmful effects ; 3. the evidence demonstrates the service has been shown to be as beneficial for the total population for whom the service might be proposed as any established alternatives ; and 4. the ev idence demonstrates the service has been shown to improve the net health outcomes of the total population for whom the service might be proposed under the usual conditions of medical practice outside clinical investigatory settings. The information cons idered or evaluated by the Plan to determine whether a Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply is Experimental/Investigative under the above criteria may include one or more items from the following list which is not all inclusive: 1. published authoritative, peer -reviewed medical or scientific literature, or the absence thereof; or 2. evaluations of national medical associations, consensus panels, and other technology evaluation bodies; or 3. documents issued by and/or filed with the FDA or other federal, state or local agency with the authority to approve, regulate, or investigate the use of the Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply ; or 4. documents of an IRB or other similar body performing substantially the same function ; or 5. consent document(s) and/or the written protocol( s) used by the treating Physicians, other medical professionals, or Facilities or by other treating Physicians, other medical professionals or Facilities studying substantially the same Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, t reatment, service, or supply;. or 6. medical records; or 7. the opinions of consulting Providers and other experts in the field.

Therefore, if the BlueCard\u00ae PPO Network Hospitals, Physicians and ancillary Providers are used, claims for their services will generally not have to be filed by the Member. In addition, many Out-of-Network Hospitals and Physicians will also file claims if the information on the Blue Cross and Blue Shield I dentification Card is provided to them. If the Provider requests a claim form to file a claim, a claim form can be obtained by contacting Your local Human Resources Department or by visiting www.anthem.com . Please note You may be required to complete an authorization form in order to have Your claims and other personal information sent to the Claims Administrator when You receive care in foreign countries. Failure to submit such authorizations may prevent foreign providers from sending Your claims and other personal information to the Claims Administrator . How to File Claims Under normal conditions, the Claims Administrator should receive the proper claim form within 15 months after the service was provided. This section o f the Benefit Booklet describes when to file benefits claim and when a Hospital or Physician will file the claim for You. Each person enrolled through the Plan receives an Identification Card. Remember, in order to receive full benefits, You must receive treatment from a Network Provider. When admitted to a Network Hospital, present Your Identification Card. Upon discharge, You will be billed only for those charges not covered by the Plan. When You receive Covered Services from a Network Physician or other Network licensed healthcare provider, ask him or her to complete a claim form. Payment for Covered Services will be made directly to the Provider . For healthcare expenses other than those billed by a Network Provider, use a claim form to report Your expenses. You may obtain these from Your Employer or the Claims Administrator. Claims should include Your name, Plan and Group numbers exactly as they appear on Your Identification Card. Attach all bills to the claim form and file directly with the Claims Administrator. Be sure to keep a photocopy of all forms and bills for Your records. The address is on the claim form. Save all bills and statements related to Your illness or Injury. Make certain they are itemized to include dates, places and nature of services or supplies. Maximum Allowed Amount General This section describes how the Claims Administrator determines the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by Network and Out-of-Network Providers is based on this Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that You receive. Please refer to the \"Inter-Plan Arrangements\" section for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Plan is the maximum amount of reimbursement Anthem will allow for services and supplies: That meet our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under Your Plan and are not excluded ; That are Medically Necessary ; and That are provided in accordance with all applicable Preauthorization , utilization management or other requirements set forth in Your Plan. 66 You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have Coinsurance. Except for Surprise Billing Claims*, when You receive Covered Services from an Out-of-Network Provider, You may be responsi ble for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be significant. *Surprise Billing Claims are described in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice in the Health Benefits Coverag e Under Federal Law . Please refer to that section for further details. When You receive Covered Services from a Provider, the Claims Administrator will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determin e the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect the Claims Administrator's determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. The Claims Administrator's application of these rules doe s not mean that the Covered Services You received were not Medically Necessary. It means the Claims Administrator has determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, Your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other healthcare professional, the Plan may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and subsequ ent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or an Out-of-Network Provider. A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in a special Center of Medical Excelle nce or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with the Claims Administrator. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with the C laims Administrator to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met Your Deductible or have Coinsurance. Please call Member Services for help in finding a Network Prov ider or visit www.anthem.com . Providers who have not signed any contract with the Claims Administrator and are not in any of the Claims Administrator's networks are Out-of-Network Provider s, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary providers. We will calculate the Maximum Allowed Amount for Covered Services You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider using one of the following : 1. An amount based on the Claims Administrator's Out-of-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which the Claim s Administrator has established at its' discretion, and which the Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar Provider s contracted with the Claims Administrator, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data ; or 2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information f rom the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed Amount upon the level or method of 67 reimbursement used by CMS, the Administrator will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less t han annually ; or 3. An amount based on information provided by a third-party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors : (1) the complexity or severity of treatment ; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment ; or (3) comparable Provider s' fees and costs to deliver care ; or 4. An amount negotiated by the Claims Administrator or a third-party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management ; or 5. An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out -of-Network Provider . Providers who are not contracted for this product , but contracted for other products with the Claims Administrator are also considered Out-of-Network . For this Plan, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above . unless the contract between us and that Provider specifies a different amount or if Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . For Covered Services rendered outside the Claims Administrator's Service Area by Out -of-Network Providers, claims may be pri ced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan's non -participating provider fee schedule/rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or Federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of area claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing the Plan would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Claims Administrator's Service Area, or a special negotiated price. Unlike Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount unless Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower Out-of-Pocket costs to You. Please call Member Servic es for help in finding a Network Provider or visit the Claims Administrator's website at www.anthem.com . Member Services is also available to assist You in determining this Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out-of-Network Provider. In order for the Claims Administrator to assist You, You will need to obtain from Your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calc ulate Your Out-of-Pocket responsibility. Although Member Services can assist You with this pre -service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for Your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. Member Cost -Share For certain Covered Services and depending on Your Plan design, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as Your cost-share amount (for example, Deductible and/or Coinsurance). Your cost-share amount and Out -of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether You received services from a Network or Out-of-Network Provider. Specifically, You may be required to pay higher cost-sharing amounts or may have limits on Your benefits when using Out-of-Networ k Providers. Please refer to the Schedule of Benefits in this Benefit Booklet for Your cost-share responsibilities and limitations, or call Member Services to learn how this Plan's benefits or cost-share amounts may vary by the type of Provider You use. The Plan will not provide any reimbursement for Non-Covered Services. You may be responsible for the total amount billed by Your Provider for Non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by a Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of this Benefit Booklet and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits. 68 Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, the Plan may authorize the Network cost -share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive fro m an Out -of-Network Provider (this is referred to as \"In-For-Out Benefit Treatment\") . In such circumstance, You must contact the Claims Administrator in advance of obtaining the Covered Service in order to get approval for In -For-Out Benefit Treatment . The Plan will authorize the Network cost -share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You receive Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider. If the Plan authorizes a Network cost -share amount for Non -Emergency Care for Covered Services p rovided by an Out -of-Network Provider, You also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge unless Your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . Please contact Member Services for Autho rized Services information or to request authorization. Services Performed During Same Session The Plan may combine the reimbursement of Covered Services when more than one service is performed during the same session. Reimbursement is limited to the Plan' s Maximum Allowed Amount . If services are performed by Out-of-Network Providers, then You are responsible for any amounts charged in excess of the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount with or without a referral or regardless if allowed as an Authorized Service . Contact the Claims Administrator for more information. Processing Your Claim You are responsible for submitting Your claims for expenses not normally billed by and payable to a Hospital or Physician. Always make certain You have Your Identificat ion Card with You. Be sure Hospital or Physician's office personnel copy Your name, and identification numbers (including the 3 -letter prefix) accurately when completing forms relating to Your coverage. Timeliness of Fili ng for Member Submitted Claims To receive benefits, a properly completed claim form with any necessary reports and records must be filed by You within 1 5 months of the date of service. Payment of claims will be made as soon as possible following receipt of the claim, unless more time is required because of incomplete or missing information. In this case, You will be notified of the reason for the delay and will receive a list of all information needed to continue processing Your claim. After this data is received, the Claims Administrator will complete claims processing. No request for an adjustment of a clai m can be submitted later than 24 months after the claim has been paid. Necessary Information In order to process Your claim, the Claims Administrator may need information from the Provider of the service. As a Member , You agree to authorize the Physician, Hospital, or other Provider to release necessary information. The Claims Administrator will consider such information confidential. However, the Plan and the Claims Administrator have the right to use this information to defend or explain a denied claim. Claims Review The Claims Administrator has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Out -of-Network Providers could be balance billed by the Out -of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under revie w in these processes. Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss After You get Covered Services, we must receive written notice of Your claim within 15 months in order for benefits to be paid. The claim must have the information we need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough information, we will ask for more details and it must be sent to us within the time listed below or no benefits will be covered, unless otherwise required by law (e.g., Federal law allows exceptions 69 for claims filed by the Veteran's Administration up to a maximum 6 years from the date of service). Member's Cooperation You will be expected to complete and submit to us all such authorizations, consents, releases, assignments and other documents that may be nee ded in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare, Workers' Compensation or any other governmental program. If You fail to cooperate, You will be responsible for any charge for services. Explanation of Benefits After You receive medical care, You will generally receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB is a summary of the coverage You receive. The EOB is not a bill, but a statement sent by the Claims Administrator , to help You understand the coverage You are receiving. The EOB shows: total amounts charged for services/supplies received ; the amount of the charges satisfied by Your coverage ; the amount for whi ch You are responsible (if any) ; and general information about Your appeals rights and information regarding the right to bring an action after the appeals process. Inter -Plan Arrangements Out-of-Area Services Anthem has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter-Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements work b ased on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever You access healthcare services outside the g eographic area the Claims Administrator serves (the Anthem \"Service Area\"), the claim for those services may be processed throu gh one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan Arrangements are described below. When You receive care outside of the Anthem Service Area, You will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"participating providers\") contract with the local Blue C ross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"nonparticipating providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. Explained b elow is how pay both kinds of Providers are paid . Inter-Plan Arrangemen ts Eligibility - Claim Types Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above. Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that You obtain from a Pharmacy and most dental or vision benefits. A. Blue Card\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when You receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, the Claims Administrator will still fulfill its contractual obligations. But the Host Blue is responsible for: (a) contracting with its Providers . and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers. When You receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is pro cessed through the BlueCard Program, the amount You pay is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for Covered Services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to the Claims Administrator. 70 Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider . Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price the Plan used for Your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. B. Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements With respect to one or more Host Blues, instead of using the BlueCard Program, Anthem may process Your claims for Covered Services through Neg otiated Arrangements for National Accounts. The amount You pay for Covered Services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price (please refer to the description of negotiated price u nder Section A. BlueCard Program) made available to Anthem by the Host Blue. C. Special Cases: Value-Based Programs BlueCard\u00ae Program If You receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Ho st Blue's Service Area, You will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Ince ntives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Ho st Blue passes these fees to Anthem throu gh average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request. Value-Based Programs: Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements If Anthem has entered into a Negotiated Arrangement with a Host Blue to pro vide Value-Based Programs to the Employer on Your behalf, Anthem will follow the same procedures for Value-Based Programs administration and Care Coor dinator Fees as noted above for the BlueCard Program. D. Inter-Plan Programs: Fede ral/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, the Plan will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to You. E. Nonparticipating Providers Outside the Claims Administrator's Service Area 1. Allowed Amounts and Member Liabili ty Calculati on When Covered Services are provided outside of Anthem's Service Area by non-participating providers, the Plan may determine benefits and make payment based on pricing from either the Host Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or Federal law. In these situations, the amount You pay for such services as D eductible or Coinsurance will be based on that allowed amount. Also, You may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the non - participating provider bills and the payment the Plan will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this par agraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for Out -of-Network Emergency services. 71 2. Exceptions In certain situations, the Plan may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing the Plan would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price to determine the amount the Plan will pay for services provided by nonparticipating providers. In these situations, You may be liable for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment the Plan make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. F. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae Program If You Plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out Your Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States may be different from services received in the United States. Remember to t ake an up-to-date health Identification Card with You.

If You need Inpatient hospital care, You or someone on Your behalf, should contact the Claims Administrator for Preauthorization . Keep in mind, if You need Emergency medical care, go to the nearest hospital. There is no need to call before You receive care. Please refer to the Healthcare Management - Precertification section in this Booklet for further information. You can learn how to get Preauthorization when You need to be admitted to the hospital for Emergency or non -emergency care. How Claims are Paid with Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae In most cases, when You arrange Inpatient hospital care with Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae, claims will be filed for You. The only amounts that You may need to pay up front are any Coinsurance or Deductible amounts that may apply. You will typically need to pay for the following services up front: Doctor 's services . Inpatient hospital care no t arranged through Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae and Outpatient services. You will need to file a claim form for any payments made up front. When You need Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae claim forms You can get international claims forms in the following ways: Call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae Service Center at the numbers above . or Online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com . You will find the address for mailing the claim on the form. Unauthorized Use of Identification Card If You permit Your Identification Card to be used by someone else or if You use the card before coverage is in effect or after coverage has ended, You will b e liable for payment of any expenses incurred resulting from the unauthorized use. Fraudulent misuse could also result in termination of the coverage. Fraudulent statements on enrollment forms and/or claims for services or payment involving all media (paper or electronic) may invalidate any payment or claims for services and be grounds for voiding the Member 's coverage. This includes fraudulent acts to o btain medical services and/or Prescription Drugs. 72 Assignment You authorize the Claims Administrator, in its own discretion and on behalf of the Employer, to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. In no event, however, shall the Plan's r ight to make payments directly to a Provider be deemed to suggest that any Provider is a beneficiary with independent claims and appeal rights under the Plan . The Claims Administrator also reserves the right, in its own discretion, to make payments directl y to You as opposed to any Provider for Covered Service. In the event that payment is made directly to You, You have the responsibility to apply this payment to the claim from the Out -of-Network Provider. Payments and notice regarding the receipt and/or ad judication of claims may also be sent to an Alternate Recipient (which is defined herein as any child of a Subscriber who is recognized under a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as having a right to enrollment under the Employer's Plan), or that pers on's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by the Claims Administrator (whether to any Provider for Covered Service or You) will discharge the Employer's obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign Your right to rec eive payment to anyone, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as defined by, and if subject to, ERISA or any applicable Federal law. The coverage, rights, and benefits under the Plan are not assignable by any Member without the wr itten consent of the Plan, except as provided above. This prohibition against assignment includes rights to receive payment, claim benefits under the Plan and/or law, sue or otherwise begin legal action, or request Plan documents or any other information t hat a Participant or beneficiary may request under ERISA, if subject to ERISA. Any assignment made without written consent from the Plan will be void and unenforceable. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Claims Administrator will not honor a request to withhold payment of the claims submitted. The coverage and any benefits under the Plan are not assignable by any Member without the written consent of the Pl an, except as provided above. Questions About Coverage or Claims If You have questions about Your coverage, contact Your Plan Administrator or the Claims Administrator's Member Services Department. Be sure to always give Your Member identification number. When asking about a claim, give the following information: Identification number . Patient's name and address . Date of service and type of service received and Provider name and address (Hospital or Physician). To find out if a Hospital or Physician is a Network Provider, call them directly or call the Claims Administrator. The Plan does not supply You with a Hospital or Physician. In addition, neither the Plan nor the Claims Administrator is responsible for any Injuries or damages You may suffer due to actions of any Hospital, Physician , or other person. In order to process Your claims, the Claims Administrator or the Plan Administrator may request additional information about the medical treatment You received and/or other group health insurance You may have. This information will be treated confidentially. An oral explanation of Your benefits by an employee of the Claims Administrator, Plan Administrator or Plan Sponsor is not legally binding. Any correspon dence mailed to You will be sent to Your most current address. You are responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator or the Claims Administrator of Your new address. 73 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL The Plan wants Your experience to be as positive as possible. There may be times . however, when You have a complaint, problem, or question about Your Plan or a service You have received. In those cases, please contact Member Services by calling the number on the back of Your Identification Card . The Claims Administrator will try to resolve Your complaint informally by talking to Your Provider or reviewing Your claim. If You are not satisfied with the resolution of Your complaint, You have the right to file an appeal, which is defined as follows: For purposes of these appeal provisions, \"claim for benefits\" means a request for benefits under the plan. The term includes both pre -service and post -service claims. A pre -service claim is a claim for benefits under the Plan for which You have not received the benefit or for which You may need to obtain approval in advance. A post -service claim is any other claim for benefits under the Plan for which You have received the service. If Your claim is denied or if Your coverage is rescinded: You will be provided with a written notice of the denial or rescission ; and You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial or rescission. The procedure the Claims Administrator will follow will satisfy the requirements for a full and fair review under applicable Federal regulations . Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination If Your claim is denied, the Claims Administrator's notice of the adverse benefit determination (denial) will include: information sufficient to identify the claim involved ; the specific reason(s) for the denial ; a reference to the specific Plan provision(s) on which the Claims Administrator's determination is based ; a description of any additional material or information need ed to perfect Your claim ; an explanation of why the additional material or information is needed ; a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits that apply to them, including a statement of Your right to bring a civil action within one y ear of the grievance or appeal decision if You submit a grievance or appeal and the claim denial is upheld ; information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the claim determination and about Your right to request a copy of it free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision ; information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on Medical Necessity or experimental treatment, or about Your right to req uest this explanation free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision ; and information regarding Your potential right to an External Appeal pursuant to Federal law. For claims involving urgent/concurrent care: the Claims Administrator's notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent review process ; and the Claims Administrator may notify You or Your authorized representative within 72 hours orally and then furnish a written notification. 74 Appe als You have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination (claim denial or rescission of coverage). You or Your authorized representative must file Your appeal within 180 calendar days after You are notified of the denial or rescission. You will ha ve the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting Your claim. The Claims Administrator's review of Your claim will take into account all information You submit, regardless of whether it was submitted or con sidered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims Administrator shall offer a single mandatory level of appeal and an additional voluntary second level of appeal which may be a panel review, independent review, or other process consistent with the entity reviewing the appeal. The timeframe allowed for the Claims Administrator to complete its review is dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g. , pre-service, concurrent, post -service, urgent, etc.). For pre -service claims involving urgent/concurrent care , You may obtain an expedited appeal. You or Your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator an d You by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To file an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, You or Your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at the number shown on Your Identification Card and provide a t least the following information: the identity of the claimant ; the date(s) of the medical service ; the specific medical condition or symptom ; the Provider's name ; the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought ; and any reasons why the ap peal should be processed on a more expedited basis. All other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the Member or the Member's authorized representative, except where the acceptance of oral appeals is otherwise required by the nature of t he appeal (e.g. , Urgent Care ). You or Your authorized representative must submit a request for review to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, P.O. Box 105568, Atlanta, Georgia 30348 You must include Your Member Identification Number when submitting an appeal. Upon request, the Claims Administrator will provide, without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to Your claim. \"Relevant\" means that the document, record, or other information: was relied on in making the benefit determination ; or was submitted, considered, or produced in the course of making the benefit determination ; or demonstrates compliance with processes and safeguards to ensure that claim determinations are made in accordance with the terms of the plan, applied consistently for similarly -situated claimants ; or is a statement of the plan's policy or guidance about the treatment or benefit relative to Your diagnosis. The Cl aims Administrator will also provide You, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated in connection with Your claim. In addition, before You receive an adverse benefit determination or review based on a new or additional rationale, the Claims Administrator will provide You, free of charge, with the rationale. For Out of State Appeals You have to file Provider appeals with the Host Plan. This means Providers must file appeals w ith the same Plan to which the clai m was filed. 75 How Your Appeal will be Decided When the Claims Administrator considers Your appeal, the Claims Administrator will not rely upon the initial benefit determination or, for voluntary second -level appeals, to the earlier appeal determination. The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination. A voluntary second -level review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination or the first -level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination or first -level appeal determination. If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, inc luding whether the treatment is experimental, investigational, or not Medically Necessary , the reviewer will consult with a healthcare professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the judgment. This healthcare professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier determination or who works for one who was consulted in making an earlier determination. Notification of the Outcome of the Appeal If You appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care , the Claims Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours afte r receipt of Your request for appeal. If You appeal any other pre -service claim , the Claims Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of Your request for appeal . If You appeal a post -service claim , the Claim s Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal within 60 days after receipt of Your request for appeal. Appeal Denial If Your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above section entitled \"Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination.\" If, after the Plan's denial, the Claims Administrator considers, relies on or generates any new or additional evidence in connection with Your claim, the Claims Administrator will provide You with that new or additional evidence, free of charge. The Claims Administrator will not base its appeal decision on a new or additional rationale without first providing You (free of charge) with, and a reasonable opportunity to respond to, any such new or additional rationale. If the Claims Administrator fails to foll ow the Appeal procedures outlined under this section, the Appeals process may be deemed exhausted. However, the Appeals process will not be deemed exhausted due to minor violations that do not cause, and are not likely to cause, prejudice or harm so long a s the error was for good cause or due to matters beyond the Claims Administrator's control. Voluntary Second Level Appeals If You are dissatisfied with the Plan's mandatory first level appeal decision, a voluntary second level appeal may be available. If You would like to initiate a second level appeal, please write to the address listed above. Voluntary appeals must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the denial of the first level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appea l prior to submitting a request for an independent External Review. External Review If the outcome of the mandatory first level appeal is adverse to You and it was based on medical judgment, or if it pertained to a rescission of coverage, You may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to Federal law. You must submit Your request for External Review to the Claims Administrator within four (4) months of the notice of Your final internal adverse determination. 76 A request for an External Review must be in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re -send the information that You submitted for internal appeal. However, You are encouraged to subm it any additional information that You think is important for review. For pre -service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, You may proceed with an expedited External Review without filing an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the Claims Administrator's internal appeal process. You or Your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary info rmation, including the Claims Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator and You by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To proceed with an expedited External Review, You or Your authorized representative must contact t he Claims Administrator at the number shown on Your Identification Card and provide at least the following information: the identity of the claimant ; the date(s) of the medical service ; the specific medical condition or symptom ; the Provider's name ; the se rvice or supply for which approval of benefits was sought ; and any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. For Surprise Billing Claims, if Your claim for the date of service starting 01/01/2022 and after is not paid in full and is related to Emergency Services or Air Ambulance Services from an Out -of-Network Provider, or Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at a Network Facility, and You believe the Claims Administrator priced those claims as Out -of-Network B enefits, You have the right to request an external review by an Independent Review Organization. If eligible for an independent external review, there is no cost to You. You have four months from the date You receive this letter to ask for an independent e xternal review. Your request must be in writing to the address noted in this section. All other requests for External Review should be submitted in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement . Such requests should be submitted by You or Your authorized representative to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, P.O. Box 105568, Atlanta, Georgia 30348 You must include Your Member identification number when submitting an appe al. This is not an additional step that You must take in order to fulfill Your appeal procedure obligations described above. Your decision to seek External Review will not affect Your rights to any other benefits under this healthcare plan. There is no charge for You to initiate an independent External Review. The External Review decision is final and binding on all parties except for any relief available through applicable state laws. Requirement to file an Appeal before filing a lawsuit No lawsuit or legal action of any kind related to a benefit decision may be filed by You in a court of law or in any other forum, unless it is commenced within one year of the Plan's final decision on the claim or other request for benefits. If the Plan decides an appeal is untimely, the Plan's latest decision on the merits of the underlying claim or benefit request is the final decision date. You must exhaust the Plan's internal appeals procedure but not including any voluntary level of appeal, before filing a lawsuit or taking other legal action of any kind against the Plan. The Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify the policies, procedures and timeframes in this section upon further clarification from Department of Health and Human Services an d Department of Labor. 77 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when You have healthcare coverage under more than one Plan. Please note that several terms specific to this provision are listed below. Some of these terms have different meanings in other parts of the Benefit Booklet, e.g., Plan. For this provision only, \"Plan\" will have the meanings as specified below. In the rest of the Benefit Booklet, Plan has the meaning listed in the Definitions section. The order of benefit determination rules determine the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan . The Primary Plan must pay benefits according to its policy terms regardless of the possibi lity that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan . The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense . The Allo wable expense under COB is generally the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts. A Network Provider can bill You for any remaining Coinsurance and/or Deductible under the higher of the Plans' allowable amounts. This higher allowable amount may be more than the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount . COB DEFINITIONS Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and the re is no COB among those separate contracts. 1. Plan includes: Group and non group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts . Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) contracts . uninsured arrangements of group or group -type coverage . coverage under group or non group closed panel plans . group -type contracts . medical care components of long term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care . medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts (whether \"fault\" or \"no fault\") . other governmental benefits, except for Medicare, Medicaid or a government Plan that, by law, provides benefits that are in excess of those of any private insurance Plan or other non -governmental plan. 2. Plan does not include: Accident only coverage . specified disease or specified accident coverage . limited health benefit coverage . benefits for non-medical components of long-term care policies . Hospital indemnity coverage benefits or other fixed indemnity coverage . school accident -type coverages covering grammar, high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a twenty -four (24) hour or \"to and from school\" basis . and Medicare supplement policies . Each contract for coverage under items 1. or 2. above is a sepa rate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing healthcare benefits that the COB provision applies to and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing healthcare benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benef its, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. The order of benefit determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when You have healthcare coverage und er more than one Plan. 78 When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense . Allowable expense is a healthcare expense, including Deductibles and/or Coinsurance, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering You. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not cov ered by any Plan covering You is not an Allowable expense . In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging You is not an Allowable expense . however, if a Provider has a contractual a greement with both the Primary and Secondary Plans, then the higher of the contracted fees is the Allowable expense, and the Provider may charge up to the higher contracted fee . The following are non-Allowable expenses : 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private Hospital room and a private Hospital room is not an Allowable expense , unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private Hospital room expenses. 2. If You are covered by 2 or more Plans that calculate their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement methods, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not a n Allowable expense . 3. If You are covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense . 4. If You are covered by one Plan that calcul ates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primar y Plan's payment arrangement will be the Allowable expense for all Plans . However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary P lan's payment arrangement and if the Provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment will be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits. 5. The amount that is subject to the Primary high -Deductible health plan's Deductible , if the Claims Administrator has been advised by You that all Plans covering You are high -Deductible health plans and You intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 19 86. Closed panel Plan is a Plan that provides healthcare benefits primarily in the form of services through a panel of Providers that contract with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other Providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Cust odial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES When You are covered by two or more Plans , the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other Plan. 1. Except as provided in Paragraph 2. below, a Plan that does not contain a Coordination of Benefits provision that is consistent with this COB provision is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. 79 2. Covera ge that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage will be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Example s of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are placed over base Plan Hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a closed panel Plan to provide Out-of-Network benefits. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Rule 1 - Non-Depen dent or Dependent. The Plan that covers You other than as a Dependent, for example as an Employee , Member , policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan, and the Plan that covers You as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan . However, if You are a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of Federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering You as a Dependent and primary to the Plan covering You as other than a Dependent (e.g. , a retired employee), then the order of benefit s between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering You as an Employee , Member , policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan covering You as a Dependent is the Primary Plan . Rule 2 - Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: 1. For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan ; or if both parents have the same birthday, t he Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan . 2. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's healthcare expenses or healthcare coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to Plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court d ecree ; If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's healthcare expenses or healthcare coverage, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits ; If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the healthcare expenses or healthcare coverage of the Depend ent child, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits ; or If there is no court decree assigning responsibility for the Dependent child's Healthcare expenses or healthcare coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: - the Plan covering the custodial parent ; - the Plan covering the Spouse of the custodial parent ; - the Plan covering the non-custodial parent ; and then - the Plan covering the Spouse of the non-custodial parent . 3. For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of item s 1. or 2. above will determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. 4. For a Dependent child who has coverage under either or bo th parents' plans and also has his or her own coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, Rule 5 applies. In the event the Dependent child's coverage under the spouse's Plan began on the same date as the Dependent child's coverage under either or both p arents' plans, the order of benefits will be determined by applying the birthday rule in item 1 above to the Dependent child's parent(s) and the Dependent's spouse. 80 Rule 3 - Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee . The Plan that covers You as an active Employee , that is, an Employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan . The Plan also covering You as a retired or laid -off Employee is the Secondary Plan . The same would hold true if You are a Dependent of an active Employee and You are a Dependent of a retired or laid -off Employee . If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependen t or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. Rule 4 - COBRA. If You are covered under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by other Federal law and are covered under another Plan, the Plan covering You as an Employee , Member , subscriber or retiree or covering You as a Dependent of an Employee , Member , subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or other Federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan . If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. This rule does not apply when the person is covered either: (a) as a non - Depende nt under both Plans (i.e. the person is covered under a right of continuation as a qualified beneficiary who, on the day before a qualifying event, was covered under the group health Plan as an Employee or as a retired Employee and is covered under his or her own Plan as an Employee , Member , subscriber or retiree) . or (b) as a Dependent under both plans (i.e. the person is covered under a right of continuation as a qualified beneficiary who, on the day before a qualifying event, was covered under the group health Plan as a Dependent of an Employee , Member or subscriber or retired Employee and is covered under the other Plan as a Dependent of an Employee , Member , subscriber or retiree). Rule 5 - Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that cover ed You longer is the Primar y Plan and the Plan that covered You the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan . Rule 6 - If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the allowable expenses will be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan . Secondary to Other Coverage The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical paym ents provision, no -fault automobile insurance policy, or personal Injury protection policy regardless of any election made by anyone to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and /or athletic policies. This provision applies notwithstanding any Coordination of Benefits term to the contrary. EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS Plan When a Member is covered under two or more Plans which together pay more than the allowable expense, the Plan will pay this Plan's benefits according to the Order of Benefit Determination Rules. This Plan's benefit payments will not be affected when it is primary. However, when this Plan is secondary under the Order of Benefit Determination Rules, it starts with this Plan's allowable expense, deduct the Primary Plan's payment and then deduct any Deductible s and/or Coinsurance . If You are enrolled in two or more closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -pane l Provider, benefits are not payable by one closed panel plan, COB will not apply between that Plan and other closed panel plans . RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about healthcare coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans . The Claims Administrator may get the facts it needs from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applyin g these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. The Claims Administrator need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must g ive the Claims Administrator any facts the Claims Administrator need s to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. 81 FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan . If it does, This Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan . This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by This Plan is more than should have paid under this COB provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons: 1. the Plan has paid or for whom the Plan have paid ; or 2. any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or serv ices provided for the Member. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. When a Covered Person Qualifies for Medicare Determining Which Plan is Primary To the extent permitted b y law, this Plan will pay Benefits second to Medicare when You become eligible for Medicare, even if You don't elect it. There are, however, Medicare -eligible individuals for whom the Plan pays Benefits first and Medicare pays benefits second: Subscriber s with active current employment status age 65 or older and their Spouses age 65 or older ; and individuals with end -stage renal disease, for a limited period of time. Determining the Allowable Expense When This Plan is Secondary to Medicare If this Plan is secondary to Medicare, the Medicare approved amount is the Allowable Expense, as long as the Provider accepts Medicare. If the Provider does not accept Medicare, the Medicare limiting charge (the most a Provider can charge You if they don't acc ept Medicare) will be the Allowable Expense. Medicare payments, combined with Plan Benefits, will not exceed 100% of the total Allowable Expense . If You are eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicare, and this Plan is secondary to Medicare, Benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced by the amount that would have been paid if You had been enrolled in Medicare. 82 SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT These Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions apply when the Plan pays benefits as a result of Injuries or illnesses You sustained, and You have a right to a Recovery or have received a Recovery from any source. Definitions As used in these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions, \" You\" or \" Your \" includes anyone on whose behalf the Plan pays benefits. These Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions apply to all current or former Plan participants and Plan beneficiaries. The provisions also apply to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a dependent child who incurs claims and is or has been covered by the Plan. The Plan's rights under these provisions shall also apply to the personal representative or administrator of Your estate, Your heirs or beneficiaries, minors, and legally disabled persons. If the Member is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor's trustee, guardian, parent, or other representative, shall be subject to these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions. Likewise, if the Member's relatives, heirs, and/or assignees make any Recovery because of Injuries sustained by the Member, or because of the death of the Member, that Recovery shall be subject to this provision, r egardless of how any Recovery is allocated or characterized. As used in these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions, \"Recovery\" includes, but is not limited to, monies received from any person or party, any person's or party's liability insurance covera ge, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, personal umbrella coverage, workers' compensation insurance or fund, premises medical payments coverage, restitution, or \"no -fault\" or personal Injury protection insurance and/or automobile m edical payments coverage, or any other first or third party insurance coverage, whether by lawsuit, settlement or otherwise. Regardless of how You or Your representative or any agreements allocate or characterize the money You receive as a Recovery, it sha ll be subject to these provisions. Subrogation Immediately upon paying or providing any benefit under the Plan, the Plan shall be subrogated to, or stand in the place of, all of Your rights of Recovery with respect to any claim or potential claim against any party, due to an Injury, illness or condition to the full extent of benefits provided or to be provided by the Plan. The Plan has the right to recover payments it makes on Your behalf from any party or insurer responsible for compensating You for Your illnesses or Injuries. The Plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees fit against any person, party, or entity to recover the benefits paid under the Plan. The Plan may assert a claim or file suit in Your name and take appropriate action to assert its subrogation claim, with or without Your consent. The Plan is not required to pay You part of any Recovery it may obtain, even if it files suit in Your name. Reimbursement If You receive any payment as a result of an Injury, illness or condition , You agree to reimburse the Plan first from such payment for all amounts the Plan has paid and will pay as a result of that Injury, illness or condition, up to and including the full amount of Your Recovery. If You obtain a Recovery and the Plan has not b een repaid for the benefits the Plan paid on Your behalf, the Plan shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on Your behalf. You must promptly reimburse the Plan from any Recovery to the extent of benefits the Plan paid on Your behalf regardless of whether the payments You receive make You whole for Your losses, illnesses and/or Injuries. Secondary to Other Coverage The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no -fault automobile insurance policy, or personal Injury protection policy regardless of any election made by You to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance po licy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. This provision applies notwithstanding any Coordination of Benefits term to the contrary. 83 Assignment In order to secure the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement provis ions, You agree to assign to the Plan any benefits or claims or rights of Recovery You have under any automobile policy or other coverage, to the full extent of the Plan's Subrogation and Reimbursement claims. This assignment allows the Plan to pursue any claim You may have regardless of whether You choose to pursue the claim. Applicability to All Settlements and Judgments Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of Your Recovery made in any settlement agreement, judgment, verdict, release, or court or der, the Plan shall have a right of full Recovery, in first priority, against any Recovery You make. Furthermore, the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions will not be reduced due to Your own negligence. The terms of these Subr ogation and Reimbursement provisions shall apply and the Plan is entitled to full Recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted and regardless of whether the terms of any settlement, judgment, or verdict pertaining to Your Recovery i dentify the medical benefits the Plan provided or purport to allocate any portion of such Recovery to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The Plan is entitled to recover from any Recovery , even those designated as being for pain and suffering, non-economic damages, and/or general damages only. Constructive Trust By accepting benefits from the Plan, You agree that if You receive any payment as a result of an Injury, illness or condition, You will serve as a constructive trustee over those funds. You and Your legal representative must hold in trust for the Plan the full amount of the Recovery to be paid to the Plan immediately upon receipt. Failure to hold such funds in trust will be deemed a breach of Your fiduciary duty to the Plan. Any Recovery You obtain must not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Plan has been repaid in accordance with these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions. Lien Rights The Plan will automatically have a lien to the extent of benefits paid by the Plan for the treatment of Your illness, Injury or condition upon any Recovery related to treatment for any illness, Injury or condition for which the Plan paid benefits. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds from Your Recovery including, but not limited to, You, Your representative or agent, and/or any other source possessing funds from Your Recovery. You and Your legal r epresentative acknowledge that the portion of the Recovery to which the Plan's equitable lien applies is a Plan asset. The Plan shall be entitled to equitable relief, including without limitation restitution, the imposition of a constructive trust or an in junction, to the extent necessary to enforce the Plan's lien and/or to obtain (or preclude the transfer, dissipation or disbursement of) such portion of any Recovery in which the Plan may have a right or interest. First -Priority Claim By accepting benefit s from the Plan, You acknowledge the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions are a first priority claim and are to be repaid to the Plan before You receive any Recovery for Your damages. The Plan shall be entitled to full reimbur sement on a first -dollar basis from any Recovery, even if such payment to the Plan will result in a Recovery which is insufficient to make You whole or to compensate You in part or in whole for the losses, Injuries, or illnesses You sustained. The \"made -whole\" rule does not apply. To the extent that the total assets from which a Recovery is available are insufficient to satisfy in full the Plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by You, the Plan's subrogation claim shall be first satisfied before any pa rt of a Recovery is applied to Your claim, Your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The Plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses or costs You incur. The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney You hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan. 84 Cooperation You agree to cooperate fully with the Plan's efforts to recover benefits paid. The duty to cooperate includes, but is not limited, t o the following: You must promptly notify the Plan of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal Injury or illness to You occurred, all information regarding the parties involved and any other information requested by the Plan. You must notify the Plan within 30 days of the date when any notice is given to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of Your intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to Your Injury, illness or condition. You must cooperate with the Plan in the investigation, settlement and protection of the Plan's rights. In the event that You or Your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan. You and Your agents shall provide all information requested by the Plan, the Claims Administrator or its representative including, but not limited to, completing and submitting any applications or other forms or statements as the Plan may reasonably request and all documents related to or filed in personal Injury litigation. You recognize that to the extent that the Plan paid or will pay benefits under a capitated agreement, the value of those benefits for purposes of these provisions will be the reasonable value of those paym ents or the actual paid amount, whichever is higher. You must not do anything to prejudice the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or Recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the Plan. You must send the Plan copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal Injury or illness to You. You must promptly notify the Plan if You retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on Your behalf. You must immediately notify the Plan if a trial is commenced, if a settlement occurs or if potentially dispositive motions are filed in a case. In the event that You or Your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement provisions, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan.

Payment Innovation Programs The Claims Administrator pays Network Providers through various types of contractual arrangements. Some of these arrangements - Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) - may include financial incentives to help improve quality of care and promote the delivery of healthcare services in a cost -efficient manner. These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be mod ified by t he Claims Administrator from time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of a Network Provider's total compensation to pre -defined quality, cost, efficiency or service standards or metrics. In some instances, Networ k Providers may be required to make payment to t he Claims Administrator under the Program as a consequence of failing to meet these pre -defined standards. The Programs are not intended to affect Your access to healthcare . The Program payments are not mad e as payment for specific Covered Services provided to You, but instead, are based on the Network Provider's achievement of these pre -defined standards. You are not responsible for any Coinsurance amounts related to payments made by or to the Claims Admini strator under the Program(s), and You do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to t he Claims Administrator under the Program(s). Care Coordination The Plan pays Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to You. For example , sometimes the Plan may pay Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they provide. The Plan may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition. Other times, the Plan may pay a periodic, fixed pre -determined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services. In addition, the Plan may pay Network Providers financial incentives or other amounts to help improve quality of care and/or promote the delivery of healthcare services in a cost -efficient manner, or compensate Network Providers for coordination of Member care. In some instances, Network Providers may be required to make payment to the Plan because they did not meet certain standards. You do not share in any payments made by Netwo rk Providers to the Plan under these programs. Program Incentives The Plan may offer incentives from time to time, at its discretion, in order to introduce You to covered programs and services available under this Plan. The Plan may also offer with discre tion the ability for You to participate in certain voluntary health or condition -focused digital applications, or use other technology - based interactive tools, or receive educational information to help You stay engaged and motivated, manage Your health, a nd assist in Your overall health and well -being. The purpose of these programs and incentives includes, but is not limited to, making You aware of cost -effective benefit options or services, helping You achieve Your best health, and encouraging You to upda te member -related information. These incentives may be offered in various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or Member cost -shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as the Plan o ffers the incentives program. The Plan may discontinue a program or an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If You have any questions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to You, it is recommended that You consult Your tax advisor.

It ceases if Your employment ends, if You no longer meet eligibility requirements, if the Plan ceases, or if You fail to make any requi red contribution toward the cost of Your coverage. In any case, Your coverage would end at the expiration of the period covered by Your last contribution. Coverage of an enrolled child ceases at the end of the month when the child attains the age limit s hown in the Eligibility section. Coverage of a disabled child over age 26 ceases if the child is found to be no longer totally or permanently disabled . Coverage of the Spouse of a Subscriber terminates automatically as of the date of divorce or death. Continuation of Coverage (Federal Law -COBRA) If Your coverage ends under the Plan, You may be entitled to elect continuation coverage in accordance with Federal law. If Your Employer normally employs 20 or more people, and Your employment is termin ated for any reason other than gross misconduct You may elect from 18 -36 months of continuation benefits. You should contact Your Employer if You have any questions about Your COBRA rights. Qualifying Events for Continuation Coverage Under Federal Law (CO BRA ) COBRA continuation coverage is available when Your group coverage would otherwise end because of certain \"qualifying events.\" After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, Your Spouse and Your Dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if covered on the day before the qualifying event and group coverage would be lost because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for this COBRA continuation coverage. This benefit entitles each member of Your family who is enrolled in the company's Employee welfare benefit Plan to elect continuation independently. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to make independent benefit elections at the time of annual enrollment. Covered Subscriber s may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their Spouses, and parents or legal guardians may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. A child born to, or placed for adoption w ith, a covered Subscriber during the period of continuation coverage is also eligible for election of continuation coverage. Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage For Employees: Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked 18 months For Spouses/ Dependents: A Covered Employee's Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer's Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked Covered Employee's Entitlement to Medicare Divorce or Legal Separation 18 months 36 months 36 months 93 Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage Death of a Covered Employee 36 months For Dependents: Loss of Dependent Child Status 36 months Continuation coverage stops before the end of the maximum continuation period if the Member becomes entitled to Medicare benefits. If a continuing beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits, then a qualified beneficiary - other than the Medicare ben eficiary - is entitled to continuation coverage for no more than a total of 36 months. (For example, if You become entitled to Medicare prior to termination of employment or reduction in hours, COBRA continuation coverage for Your Spouse and children can l ast up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement.) If You are a retiree under this Plan, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code may be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to Your Employer , and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage, You will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. Your surviving Spouse and Dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under this Plan. If COBRA coverage becomes available to a retiree and his or her covered family members as a result of a bankruptcy filing, the retiree m ay continue coverage for life. His or her Spouse and Dependents may continue coverage for a maximum period of up to 36 months following the date of the retiree's death. Second Qualifying Event If Your family has another qualifying event (such as a legal s eparation, divorce, etc.) during the initial 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, Your Spouse and Dependent children can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months from the original qualifying event. Such additional coverage is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused Your Spouse or Dependent children to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. A qualified beneficiary must give timely notice to th e Plan Administrator in such a situation. Notification Requirements In the event of Your termination, lay -off, reduction in work hours or Medicare entitlement, Your Employer must notify the company's benefit Plan Administrator within 30 days. You must not ify the company's benefit Plan Administrator within 60 days of Your divorce, legal separation or the failure of Your enrolled Dependents to meet the program's definition of Dependent. This notice must be provided in writing to the Plan Administrator. There after, the Plan Administrator will notify qualified beneficiaries of their rights within 14 days. To continue enrollment, You or an eligible family member must make an election within 60 days of the date Your coverage would otherwise end, or the date the company's benefit Plan Administrator notifies You or Your family member of this right, whichever is later. You must pay the total Premium appropriate for the type of benefit coverage You choose to continue. If the Premium rate changes for active associates, Your monthly Premium will also change. The Premium You must pay cannot be more than 102% of the Premium charged for Employees with similar coverage, and it must be paid to the company's benefit Plan Admini strator within 30 days of the date due, except that the initial Premium payment must be made before 45 days after the initial election for continuation coverage, or Your continuation rights will be forfeited. For Employees who are determined, at the time of the qualifying event, to be disabled under Title II (OASDI) or Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act, and Employees who become disabled during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage, coverage may continue from 18 to 29 months. These Empl oyees' Dependents are also eligible for the 18 to 29 -month disability extension. (This provision also applies if any covered family member is found to be disabled .) This provision would only apply if the qualified beneficiary provides notice of disabled status within 60 days of the disabling determination. In these cases, the 94 Employer can charge 150% of Premium for months 19 through 29. This would allow health coverage to be provided in the period between the end of 18 months and the time that Medicare begi ns coverage for the disabled at 29 months. (If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to no longer be disabled , such qualified beneficiary must notify the Plan Administrator of that fact in writing within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination.) Trade Adjustment Act Eligible Individual If You don't initially elect COBRA coverage and later become eligible for trade adjustment assistance under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 due to the same event which caused You to be eligible initially for COBRA coverage under this Plan, You will be entitled to ano ther 60 -day period in which to elect COBRA coverage. This second 60 -day period will commence on the first day of the month on which You become eligible for trade adjustment assistance. COBRA coverage elected during this second election period will be effec tive on the first day of the election period. When COBRA Coverage Ends These benefits are available without proof of insurability and coverage will end on the earliest of the following: a covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period ; a covered individual fails to pay a required Premium on time ; a covered individual becomes covered under any other Group Health Plan after electing COBRA ; a covered individual becomes entitled to Medicare after electing COBRA ; or the group terminates al l of its group welfare benefit plans. Other Coverage Options Besides COBRA Continuation Coverage Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for You and Your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other Group Health Plan coverage options (such as a Spouse's plan) through what is calle d a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . If You Have Questions Questions concerni ng Your Group's health Plan and Your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Employer. For more information about Your rights including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administrati on (EBSA) in Your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa.

Continuation of Coverage During Military Leave ( USERRA) Under the Uniformed Ser vices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the Member may have a right to continuation of benefits subject to the conditions described below. Under USERRA, if the Employee (or his or her Dependents) is covered under this Plan, and if t he Employee becomes absent from employment by reason of military leave, the Employee (or his or her Dependents) may have the right to elect to continue health coverage under the Plan. In order to be eligible for coverage during the period that the Employee is gone on military leave, the Employee must give reasonable notice to the Employer of his or her military leave and the Employee will be entitled to COBRA -like rights with respect to his or her medical benefits in that the Employee and his or her Depende nts can elect to continue coverage under the Plan for a period of 24 months from the date the military leave commences or, if sooner, the period ending on the day after the deadline for the Employee to apply for or return to work with the Employer. During military leave the Employee is required to pay the Employer for the entire cost of such coverage, including any elected Dependents' coverage. However, if the Employee's absence is less than 31 days, the Employer must continue to pay its portion of the prem iums and the Employee is only required to pay his or her share of the premiums without the COBRA -type 2% administrative surcharge. 95 Also, when the Employee returns to work, if the Employee meets the requirements specified below, USERRA states that the Empl oyer must waive any exclusions and waiting periods, even if the Employee did not elect COBRA continuation. These requirements are (i) the Employee gave reasonable notice to his or her Employer of military leave, (ii) the military leave cannot exceed a pres cribed period (which is generally five (5) years, except in unusual or extraordinary circumstances) and the Employee must have received no less than an honorable discharge (or, in the case of an officer, not been sentenced to a correctional institution), a nd (iii) the Employee must apply for reemployment or return to work in a timely manner upon expiration of the military leave (ranging from a single day up to 90 days, depending upon the period that he or she was gone). The Employee may also have to provide documentation to the Employer upon reemployment that would confirm eligibility. This protection applies to the Employee upon reemployment, as well as to any Dependent who has become covered under the Plan by reason of the Employee's reinstatement of cover age. Continuation of Coverage Due to Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) An Employee may continue membership in the Plan as provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. An Employee who has been employed at least one year, within the previous 12 months is eligible to choose to continue coverage for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the following reasons: the birth of the Employee's child ; the placement of a child with the Employee for the purpose of adoption or foster care ; to care for a seriously ill Spou se, child or parent ; or a serious health condition rendering the Employee unable to perform his or her job. If the Employee chooses to continue coverage during the leave, the Employee will be given the same Healthcare benefits that would have been provide d if the Employee were working, with the same premium contribution ratio. If membership in the Plan is discontinued for non -payment of premium, the Employee's coverage will be restored to the same level of benefits as those the Employee would have had if the leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not been missed. This includes coverage for eligible Dependents . The Employee will not be required to meet any qualification requirements imposed by the Plan when he or she retur ns to work. This includes: new or additional waiting periods . waiting for an open enrollment period . or passing a medical exam to reinstate coverage.
