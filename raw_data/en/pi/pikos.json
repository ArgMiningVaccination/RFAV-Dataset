Homeopathic Medicine is based on the theory that \"like cures like.\" An example of homeopathy would be using a very dilute solution of coffee to treat insomnia. Homeopathy was developed by a German healthcare provider, Samuel Hahnemann, in 1807. He treated himself with a small amount of tree bark (cinchona bark) containing quinine, which is used to treat malaria. When he developed the symptoms of malaria, he came up with his law of \"like cures like;\" believing that drugs that cause specific symptoms can be used to cure the illnesses that cause those symptoms.
