Student Success The faculty and staff at Baton Rouge Community College (BRCC) strive to engage students and support their success both in and out of the classroom. The College's world -class f aculty strive for exc ellence in teaching and continue to develop innovative tools to enhance student learning in academic and workforce programs that prepare them for exciting careers in areas like criminal justice, sonography , avionics, automotive technology, computer science, film-making, veterinarian technology, video game design , nursing, construction management , business technology, and accounting. Student Affair s staff provide students with accessible and affordable solutions to support their educational needs through Registration, Financial Aid , Career Services, and Disability Services. The Magnolia Library guides students as they devel op information literacy a nd sharpen their research skills . The College offers a \"First Class\" seminar that orien ts new students to the institution and its programs, and teaches them impor tant academic survival skills. Information Technology Servi ces provide student s with the relevant technological support and resources they need to enrich their educational experience s. BRCC's Offices of Public Safety and Facilities Services provide students with a safe, secure , and attractive educational environment. On January 19, 2016, BRC C received notification from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) that its Bo ard of Trustees had approved BRCC's merger with Capital Area Technical College . The merger expands BRCC 's opportunity to meet the educa tional and workforce needs in the greater Baton Rouge area by build ing deeper employer engag ement, creating pathways to educational credentials within key sectors, and be coming more agile in its responsiveness to the fast-chan ging needs in the economy . BRCC is eagerly anticipatin g the opening of the new John W. McKay Automotive Training Cen ter to students in fall 2016 . The center will offer course s to stu dents seeking degrees and certifications in the areas of automotive and diesel/heavy truck techno logies. Through the leadership of the Divisions of Academic and Student Affairs , BRCC has moved forward on several initiatives aimed at creating process efficiencies, improving student access, and enhancing student satisfaction and success: A Call Center was implemented in fall 2015, and has already improved student satisfaction by expediting responses and solutions to their inquiries about their educational needs and concerns. A priority regi stration process has been implemented and will be availab le to students who have earned 18 or more credits beginning in the summer 2016 and fall 2016 semesters. Checklists for all degree and certificate programs tha t BRCC offers have been restyled and are available to students, faculty and staff online . The checklists are easily accessi ble and have been designed as an intuitive and user -friendly tool for students and advisors to use to efficiently plan course schedules . Knowing what courses to take and when will streamline the time it takes for students to earn their certificate or degree. A comprehensive approach to 'onboarding' new students has been developed and will be implement ed, beginning with the fall 2016 cohort. This initi ative include s: providing students P a g e 2 April 27 , 2016 with a 'revamped' orientation experience that will incl ude an online option; revamping and streamlining the entry services for students in a sequence that better aligns with the enrollment process; and, redistributing the responsibilities of Student Affairs staff which w ill effectively double the personnel available to students seeking advice and assistance . BRCC has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a Predominantly Black Institution and was awarded a Title III grant of $1.3 million dollars for fiscal year 2016. These monies will be leveraged with existing Carl Perkins and in stitutional funds to implement Degree Works \u2014a comprehensive technology that will improve academic advising, transfer articulation , and course auditing, and help students graduate on time. The monies will also be us ed to develop and pilot support services aimed at improving the academic success of African American males in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics programs. Element 1.a. Implement policies established by the institution's management board to achieve cohort graduation rate and graduation productivity goals that are consistent with institutional peers. As an open admission college, BRCC serves all students, regardless of their level of academic preparation. Graduates of state -approved high schools, home -schooled students and individuals who have obtained a high school equivalency are eligible for admiss ion. A complete list of BRCC's academic and student services policies can be found in its catalog . 1.a.(i.) 1st to 2nd year retention rate for first -time, full -time, associates degree -seeking students Report Year (Cohort) Baseline (Fall 2008) Year 1 (Fall 2009) Year 2 (Fall 2010) Year 3 (Fall 2011) Year 4 (Fall 2012) Year 5 (Fall 2013) Year 6 (Fall 2014) Number Retained 585 602 632 705 499 466 584 Number in Cohort 1,224 1,248 access affects its retention rates. In Year 6, the success of BRCC's recruitment efforts brought an increase in the number of first -time, full -time, associate's degree students enrolled. The increased enrollments, however , resulted in a class with signi ficantly higher proportions of studen ts who embodied characteristics associated with academic vulnerability . The fall 2014 cohort , compared to the fall 2013 cohort had significantly higher percentages of students1 who were black (47.5 % compared to 35.5%), Pell grant recipients (67.1% compared to 56.1%) , older than the traditional age of students just out of high school (36.5% compared to 26.3%), had ACT scores that fell below the requirements for a moderately selective institution (34.3% compa red to 24.1%), and were first generation college students 1 Based on the comparison of frequency distributions using a 2 test of significance with p<.05. P a g e 3 April 27 , 2016 (90.5% compared to 71.8% , note that these percentages were derived from the sub-cohort of students who completed financial aid applications ). In addition to being an open access college, BRCC's mission is to prepare pathways for students interested in transferring to four -year institutions. Some students are academically prepared to transfer after completing an associate degree, some are prepared to transfer after completing a year of study, and some are prepared to t ransfer after completing a semester of study at BRCC. It would be an injustice for BRCC to ask students who are academically prepared to transfer to stay enrolled so that the college can pass GRAD Act. To examine BRCC's success in transfer, a list of the students from the Year 6 cohort who were not retained was sent to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) to determine whether they subsequently enrolled at another institution of higher education. Of the 805 students sent to NSC, 146 were found to have s ubsequently enrolled at another institution of higher education. These students are academic successes and should be removed from the cohort, which increases the retention rate to 52.6%. This brings BRCC within 2% of b enchmark on this measure. BRCC is unable to provide individual counseling for each student. Budget cuts have hit student services hard, and the school is forced to rely on how a student self identifies on his or her application. It is possible that several students who self -identif ied as being degree seeking students never actually intended to finish a degree at BRCC or stay more than a semester. This is the unfortunate reality 1.a.(iv.) Institution graduation rate based on revised IPEDS cohort of first -time, full -time, associat es degree -seeking students, who com pleted within 3 years Report Year (Cohort) Baseline (Fall 2005) Year 1 (Fall 2006) Year 2 (Fall 2007) Year 3 (Fall 2008) Year 4 (Fall 2009) Year 5 (Fall 2010) Year 6 (Fall 2011) Completers 26 31 56 57 34 63 123 Number in Revised Cohort 889 950 1,101 benchmark for Year 6 with a 9.2% graduation rate for its fall 2011 first- time, full -time, ass ociate's degree seeking cohort. P a g e 4 April 27 , 2016 Element 1.b. Increase percentage of program completers at all levels each year. 1.b.(i.) Percent Change in program completers at all award levels (certificate and above), f rom the baseline year Report Year (Cohort) Baseline (AY08/09) Year 1 (AY09/10) Year 2 (AY10/11) Year 3 (AY11/12) Year 4 (AY12/13) Year 5 (AY13/14) Year 6 (AY14/15) Certificate Awards 9 150 188 199 343 1,562 845 % Change in Certificates 1566.7% 1988.9% 2111.1% 3711.1% 17255.6% 9288.9 % Associate's Awards 288 318 360 382 376 403 411 % In Associate's 10.4% 25.0% 32.6% 30.6% 39.9% steady increase in the number of certificates and associate 's degree s for five out of the last six years . BRCC has surpa ssed the target for certificate awards , and has passed the associate's award measure by showing increased progress based on the comparison of the two and three year average percentage s over the baseline . The 41.3% two-year average change i n associate's p rogram completers for Years 5 and 6 far exceeds the 29.4% three -year average change for Years 2 through 4. Element 1.c. Develop partnerships with high schools to prepare students for postsecondary education. BRCC continues to offer dual enrollment in public high schools, and is working to increase the dual enrollment population by offering online courses, and expanding its offer ings to home -school ed students and students from private high schools. Currently, BRCC offers dual enrollment o pportunities to 24 schools in 8 parishes. The students in two out of the 24 schools participate virtually, and approximately 45 home schooled students are dually enrolled. These relationships are formalized, at present, through 24 Memoranda of Understand ing. 1.c.(i , ii, & iii). High school students enrolled during the reporting year Semester Baseline Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year Enrolled 263 298 381 338 218 234 1,064 920 864 757 Semester Credit Hours Enrolled 822 969 1,333 1,099 740 783 4,559 3,424 3,811 3,278 P a g e 5 April 27 , 2016 Semester Credit Hours Completed 779 867 1,224 1,053 740 774 4,322 3,300 3,688 3,122 The number of s tudents enrolled in BRCC's dual enrollment program continues to grow, as evidenced by comparing the average number of students enrolled, credit hours enrolled , and c redit hours completed for the last two reporting years (Years 5 and 6), compared to the pri or three years (Years 2, 3 and 4). For the last two years (fall and spring combined), the average enrollment was 1, 803, the credit hours enrolled was 7,536, and the credit hours completed was 7,216 . For the prior three years the average enrollment was 577, the credit hours enroll ed was 1,915 , and the credit hours earned was 1,812 . The average s for the number of students enrolled more than doubled , and the credit h ours enrolled and earned nearly tripled . P a g e 6 April 27 , 2016 Element 1.d. Increase passage rates on licensure and certification examinations and workforce foundational skills . 1.d.(i.) Passage rates on licensure exam ination in Nursing (RN) Report Year (Cohort) Baseline (Fall 2008) Year 1 (Fall 2009) Year 2 (Fall 2010) Year 3 (Fall 2011) Year 4 (Fall 2012) Year 5 (Fall 2013) Year 6 (Fall 2014) Number who took NCLEX N/A N/A N/A NCLEX N/A N/A N/A licensure exam inations in Nursing (RN) was 88.1%, which falls 1.5% shy of the 2% margin needed to meet the targeted benchmark. However BRCC's passage rate was well above the state average for students in associate's degree nursing program s which was 83.1%. Several strategies have been implemented since the fall 2014 c ohort sat for their exams . The c orrective measures are presented below as strategies that are improving the success of BRCC's graduates on the NCLEX -RN examination. The e ffectiveness of these strategies are evident in the 2015 to 2016 increase in the NCLEX pass age rate\u2014of the f orty-eight (48) students tested, 44 passed and BRCC's NCLEX pass age rate i ncreased from 88.1% to 91. 7%. General Strategy: Students Specific Areas Addressed Provide student support Mandatory advising Review and test -taking and critical thinking skills in class, lab and clinical Test review and feedback at course level Identify and track at -risk students Mandatory remediation plan, development of academic contract and tracking developed for students readmitted to nursing program through the appeals process Faculty and nursing department chair involvement in remediation plan General Strategy: Policies Specific Areas Addressed Review and revise admission policies HESI nursing admission examination was revised to include Biology in addition to Math, English, Vocabulary and Grammar P a g e 7 April 27 , 2016 Review and revise curriculum requirements (NURS 240) Senior Capstone course developed with NCLEX -RN review, critical thinking through the use of simulation and exit exam General Strategy: Faculty Specific Areas Addressed Provide faculty training Consulted with Dr. Linda Caputi to conduct Test Item Analysis workshop for faculty.

Performance Objective 2. Articulation and Transfer As an open admission college, BRCC serves all students, regardless of their level of academic preparation. Graduates of state -approved high schools, home -schooled students and individuals who have obtained a high school equivalency are eligible for admission. BRCC's admissions polici es and procedures are available to students and their families on its website . BRCC has 31 articulation agreements with four -year institutions that help to facilitate and maximize BRCC credit course s that transfer. Attachment B lists BRCC's established articulation agreements with four-year institutions. The National Student Clearinghouse data system continues to be utilized by BRCC to process transcript requests, verify enrollment and degree attainment of transfer students and to track the progress of students who enroll at BRCC and transfer to other higher education institutions within the St udent Clearinghouse membership. P a g e 8 April 27 , 2016 Element 2.c. Develop referral agreements with community colleges and technical college campuses to r edirect students who fail to qualify for admission into the institution. 2.c.(ii.) Number of students enrolled Currently BRCC has no students enrol led as a result of any referrals to 4 -year universities. Element 2.d. Demonstrate Collaboration in implementing articulation and transfer requirements provided in R.S. 17:3161 through 3169 2.d.(i.)

BRCC has seen a gradual increase in the number of students completing these degrees over the last five years. This trend should continue as interest in th ese programs continue s, and as initiatives for improvin g advising and transfer rates are implemented. P a g e 9 April 27 , 2016 Performance Objective 3. Workforce and Economic Development The college continues to utilize a revised schedule for conducting annual program reviews . The goal of each review is to identify the areas in which a program may be weak and to rectify the situation , as well as to identify the areas in which a program is successful and to capitalize on that success. The college also uses program advisory boards which are comprised of individ uals who are currently in program specific industries . The advisory boards give their recommendations and ideas pertai ning to the relevancy of courses offered and drive s the cu rriculum into alignment with cur rent regional and state workforce needs . Element 3.a. Eliminate academic program offerings that have low student completion rates as identified by the Board of Regents or are not aligned with current or strategic workforce needs of the state, region, or both as identified by the Louisiana Workforce Commission and Louisiana Economic Development The majority of BRCC's programs are currently aligned with the workforce and economic needs of the state of Louisiana. In order to make this determination, the Louisiana Workforce Commissio n's Louisia na Star Jobs website , and the Board of Regents list of Active Degree and Certificate Programs (as of Apr il 8, 2016) were utilized and it was found that 44% of the 102 degree programs that BRCC offers at its mid-City campus, it s eleven existing instructional sites, and its new John W. McKay Automotive Training Center are five star jobs. An additional 42% are four -star jobs. 3.a.(I & ii.) Programs eliminated, modified or added to meet workforce and economic development needs i.

Increase use of technology for distance learning to expand educational offerings. BRCC continues to increase the availability of innovative learning opportunities through distance learning. The Division of Innovative Learning a nd Academic Support trains and certifies faculty who want to teach courses online, certifies online courses according to Quality Matters guideline s, and requires students to pass an eSkills orientation test before they can register for an online course. Currently, the Division of Academic Affai rs is working to identify and assign faculty in each of its departments to serve as eLearning academic advisors. 3.b.(i., ii.,& iii.) Use of technology for distance learning to expand educational offerings Report Year (Cohort) Baseline (AY2010/ 11) Year 3 (AY2011/12 ) Year 4 (AY201 2/13) Year 5 (AY2013 /14) Year 6 (AY2014/15) Course Sections delivered using distance learning technologies: 50% to 99% 2 17 2 2 17 100% 125 167 127 104 171 Enrollments in Courses using distance learning technologies (Targeted) 50% to 99% 45 380 45 28 427 Benchmark 194 199 distance education in AY201 5/16: Certificates of General Studies in General Studies, Certificate of Advanced Study in Business Technology, and Certificates of Technical Studies in Customer Service and Accounting Technology .

Institutional Efficiency and Accountability BRCC strives to achi eve its mission while maintaining strong stewardship through responsible management of its monetary, physical and human resources. Element 4.c . Upon entering the initial performance agreement, adhere to a schedule established by the institution's management board to increase nonresident tuition amounts that are not less than the average tuition amount charged to Louisiana residents attending peer instit utions in other Southern Regional Education Board states and monitor the impact of such increases on the institution. 4.b. (i.) Total tuition and fees charged to non -resident students Academic Year SREB Non Resident Tuition BRCC Non Resident Tuition & Fees tuition at BRCC remains less than the average tuition charged to Louisiana residents attending other Southern Regional Education Board institutions. The number of students paying nonresident tuition at BRCC has steadily increased over th e last five years . Element 4.d . Designate centers of excellence as defined by the Board of Regents which have received a favorable academic assessment from the Board of Regents and have demonstrated substantial progress. The John W. McKay Automotive Training Center, which is BRCC's Center of Excellence for Transportation Technology , will open its doors for college students, high school students and veteran mechani cs in fall 2016. 4.d.(i.) . Percent of eligible programs with ei ther mandatory or recommended status that are currently discipline accredited. At the beginning of the 2016 calendar year, seven out of the thirteen disciplinary programs with either a mandatory or required accreditation stat us had been approved by their accrediting bodies . The most recent program approval was granted by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing which voted to continue the accreditation of the AS degree in Nursin g at its March 3 -4 meeting. Four of the remai ning programs , with existing accreditation status prior to January 2016 , have applied for accreditation . Self-studies for the AAS in Paramedics and the CTS in Emergency Medical Technician - Paramedics programs were submitted to the Committee for Accreditatio n of Allied Health Education Programs in March 2016 ; the American Council for Construction Education sent a team to evaluate the P a g e 12 April 27 , 2016 AAS degree in Constr uction Management in March 2016; and, the AAS degree in Helicopter Flight Operations program has applied fo r approval from the Federal Aviation Administration . With seven out of the thirteen existing programs approved, BRCC has a 53.8% approval rate which exceeds the Year 6 target of 50.4%. It is anticipated that the four programs that are in the application process will be approved which will boost the rate to 84.6%. Twelve new degree and certificate programs were approved by the Board of Regents in February 2016. Eleven of these are new programs in automotive and diesel/heavy truck technologies that will be offered to students in the new John W. McKay Automotive Tech nology Center beginning fall 2016. The Chair of the Automotive Technology Department has begun the process of seeking approval for these programs from the National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation. The Program Manager of the AAS degree in Avia tion Maintenance Technology is in the process of seeking program approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. In the first year that this performance indicator was benc hmarked (Year 3), only BRCC programs were included in the measure. Beginning in Year 5, both BRCC programs and programs from the former Capital Area Technical Colleg e were included . However, the established target was not updated to reflect the addition . Eight of the 33 programs that have a mandatory or required accreditations statu s are former CATC programs. Of these, two have been approved by their accrediting bodies and 2 more are in the process of seeking approval. 4.d. (i.)
