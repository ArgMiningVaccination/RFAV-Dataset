The regional food was heavily influenced by this knowledge, claimed the Edible Archive team, to keep the population healthy. The team was hosted by the newly-founded Centre for Inter-Asian Research at Ahmedabad University for two-day event on September 17 and 18. The event in 2019 had traveled to China and engaged in culinary conversations with local chefs in Suzhou and Shanghai. \"In 2021, we are now continuing the dialogue in India with both online and offline events. We are bringing in culinary experts and practitioners of Ayurveda and TCM to discuss how health aspects were integrated in the food habits,\" said Prof Tejaswini Niranjana, director of the Centre. The participants cooked both Indian and Chinese dishes using the locally-available ingredients along with spices from both the countries. The organizers said that with heightened awareness about food and medicine after the worst of pandemic, the legacy of traditional medicine can help the citizens. Vd Bhavdeep Ganatra, a city-based Ayurveda practitioner, said that Ayurveda has prescribed food for every Indian season which is so deeply interwoven with our traditions that we don't realize it. \"The milk and poha we consume on Sharad Purnima is associated with pitta. Similarly, the broth we consume during monsoons is to ensure that mild appetite gets support by the spices used,\" he said. "}
