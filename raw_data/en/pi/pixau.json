Ever wondered why? What you need to know: What is rock salt? When an individual observes a fast, they have a list of restricted foods, which includes meat, onion, garlic, and table salt. Rock salt, popularly known as Himalayan crystal salt or sendha namak or kala namak, is an element of the sattvik diet as it is considered the purest salt, free of all chemicals or toxins. This pinkish-colored salt is considered a vegetarian salt because it is not made using seawater and is used for cooking for religious purposes, primarily during fasts.
