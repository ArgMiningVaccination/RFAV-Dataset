(2) Due to the technical adaptation of Annex I to Directive2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community coderelated to medicinal products for human use ( 5), it is appropriate to introduce in this Regulation provisions on variations related to plasma master files and vaccineantigen master files. (3) Some of the procedures laid down in Regulation (EC)No 542/95 should therefore be adjusted but without departing from the general principles on which those procedures are based. (1) OJ L 214, 24. 8.1993, p. 1. (2) OJ L 88, 24.3.1998, p. 7. (3) OJ L 55, 11.3.1995, p. 15. (4) OJ L 153, 27.5.1998, p. 11. (5) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67.(4) It is appropriate to provide for a simplified and rapid notification procedure to enable the introduction ofcertain minor changes, which do not affect the approved quality, safety or efficacy of the product, without prior evaluation by the European Agency for the evaluationof medicinal products (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agency'). However, for other types of minor variations evaluation of the submitted documentation by the Agency should still be required. (5) The various types of minor variation should be classifiedin order to determine the procedure to follow; it is particularly necessary to give a precise definition of thetype of minor variation for which no prior evaluation is needed. (6) It is necessary to clarify the definition of an 'extension'to a marketing authorisation, although it should still be possible to submit a separate, full application formarketing authorisation for a medicinal product which has already been authorised but under a different name and with summary of product characteristics. (7) It is appropriate to allow the Agency to reduce theevaluation period in urgent cases or to extend it in thecase of a major variation entailing important changes. (8) It is necessary to simplify the administrative proceduresfor minor variations regarding the updating of marketing authorisations by allowing the Commission to group these updates every six months in one single decision. (9) The time-frame for the procedure to be followed where the Commission imposes urgent safety restrictions should be clarified.27.6.2003 EN L 159/25 Official Journal of the European Union (10) Further clarification should be introduced as regards revision of the labelling, the package leaflet/insert or thesummary of product characteristics; nevertheless the procedures laid down in this Regulation should not apply to changes to the labelling or to the package leaflet/insert which are not consequential to changes to the summary of product characteristics. (11) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to replace Regulation (EC) No 542/95. (12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are inaccordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Medicinal products for Human Use and the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter 1. This Regulation lays down the procedure for the examin- ation of applications for variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation granted in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. 2. This Regulation also applies for the examination of applications of variations to the terms of a plasma master file and of a vaccine antigen master file, as defined in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC.

For the Commission Erkki LIIKANEN Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1.The urgent safety restrictions shall be implemented within a time-frame, as agreed with the Agency. The corresponding variation application reflecting the urgent safety restrictions shall be submitted immediately and in any case no later than 15 days after the initiation of the urgent safety restrictions to the Agency for the application of the procedures set out in Article 6. 2. Where the Commission imposes urgent safety restric- tions on the holder, the holder shall be obliged to submit an application for a variation taking account of the safety restrictions imposed by the Commission. The urgent safety restrictions shall be implemented within a time-frame, as agreed with the Agency. For the application of the procedures set out in Article 6, the corresponding variation application reflecting the urgent safetyrestrictions, including appropriate documentation in support of the change, shall be submitted to the Agency immediately and in any case no later than 15 days after the initiation of the urgent safety restrictions. The first and second subparagraphs are without prejudice to Articles 18 and 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. Article 10 Repeal Regulation (EC) No 542/95 is repealed.References made to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation. Article 11 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . It shall apply from 1 October 2003. However, as regards the examination of applications of variations to the terms of plasma master files and of vaccine antigen master files, this Regulation shall apply from the date of entry into force of the Commission Directive amending Annex I of Directive 2001/ 83/EC.27.6.2003 EN L 159/29 Official Journal of the European Union ANNEX I LIST AND CONDITIONS FOR MINOR VARIATIONS (TYPES IA AND IB) TO A MARKETING AUTHORIS- ATION AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES 3 TO 5 Introductory statements The titles of the variations are numbered and subcategories depicted by letters and numbers in smaller font. The conditions necessary for a given variation to follow either a type IA or a type IB procedure are outlined for eachsubcategory and listed below each variation. To cover any other changes, it is necessary to submit applications for any consequential or parallel variations, which may be linked to the change applied for, at the same time and to clearly describe the relation between these variations. For notifications including a certificate of suitability from the European pharmacopoeia and when the variation concerns the dossier submitted for the certificate, the documentation required for this change is to be submitted tothe European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM). If the certificate is revised following evaluation ofthis change, any marketing authorisation concerned must be updated. In many cases this can be done through a type IA notification. A biological medicinal product is a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and for which a combination ofphysico-chemical-biological testing and the production process and its control is needed for its characterisation and the determination of its quality. As a result, the following shall be considered as biological medicinal products: immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma as defined in Article 1(4) and (10) of Directive2001/83/EC, respectively; immunological veterinary medicinal products as defined in Article 1(7) of Directive 2001/82/EC; medicinal products falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93; advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Part IV of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. A change in the manufacturing process of a non-proteinaceous component due to a subsequent introduction of a biotechnology step can be made in accordance with the provisions of variations type I No 15 or No 21, asappropriate. This specific variation is without prejudice to other variations listed in this Annex which can be applied in this particular context. Introduction of a proteinaceous component obtained through a biotechnology process listed in Part A of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 in a medicinal product fall within the scopeof said Regulation. Community legislation applicable to specific groups of products ( 1) shall be complied with. There is no need to notify the competent authorities of an updated monograph of the European pharmacopoeia or a national pharmacopoeia of a Member State in the case that compliance with the updated monograph is implemented within six months of its publication and reference is made to the 'current edition' in the dossier of an authorised medicinal product. For the purposes of this document, 'test procedure' has the same meaning as 'analytical procedure' and 'limits' have the same meaning as 'acceptance criteria'. The Commission, in consultation with Member States, the Agency and interested parties, will draw up and publish detailed guidance on the documentation to be submitted.
