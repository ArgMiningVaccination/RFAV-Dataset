Vitamin C is a vitamin that supports normal growth and development and helps your body absorb iron and works as an antioxidant to help prevent oxidative stress. Vitamin C also works with enzymes to play a key role in making collagen. Nevertheless, it has many roles in your body and has been linked to impressive health benefits as a strong antioxidant that may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It is found in many fruits and vegetables, including guavas, oranges, lemons, strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, broccoli, kale, thyme, parsley, and spinach. This key vitamin is also available as a natural dietary supplement in the form of vitamin C pills, vitamin C chewable tablets and intravenous (IV) treatment. IV vitamin C megadose therapy is given by intravenous (IV) infusion (through a vein into the bloodstream). When taken by intravenous infusion, vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the blood and have way better benefits than when the same amount is taken by mouth. In the 1960s, the Nobel-Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling, after contact with Irwin Stone, began actively promoting vitamin C as a means to greatly improve human health and resistance to disease. His book How to Live Longer and Feel Better was a bestseller and advocated taking more than 10 grams per day orally, thus approaching the amounts released by the liver directly into the circulation in other mammals: an adult goat, a typical example of a vitamin-C-producing animal, will manufacture more than 13,000 mg of vitamin C per day in normal health and much more when stressed. Stone and Pauling believed that the optimum daily requirement of vitamin C is around 2,300 milligrams for a human requiring 2,500 kcal a day. For comparison, the FDA's recommended daily allowance of vitamin C is 90 milligrams. Vitamin C megadoses are claimed by alternative medicine advocates including Matthias Rath and Patrick Holford to have preventive and curative effects on diseases such as cancer and AIDS, but the available scientific evidence does not support these claims. Patients showed strong antioxidants that can strengthen your body's natural defenses, vitamin C megadose helps your body's natural defenses fight inflammation. Antioxidants are molecules that boost the immune system. They do so by protecting cells from harmful molecules called free radicals. When free radicals accumulate, they can promote a state known as oxidative stress, which has been linked to many chronic diseases. Vitamin C megadose has been shown to have a protective effect on thinking and memory against conditions like dementia. Vitamin C megadose plays an essential part in the skin's defense system. It is actively transported to the skin where it can act as an antioxidant and help strengthen the skin's barriers. Vitamin C megadose helps encourage the production of white blood cells known as lymphocytes and phagocytes, which help protect the body against infections. Studies have also shown that taking vitamin C megadose may shorten wound healing time.
