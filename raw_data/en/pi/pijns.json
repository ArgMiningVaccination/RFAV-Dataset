However, it remains unclear what factors promote persistence of initial bacterial colonizers in the developing gut. Here, we perform strain-resolved analysesto compare gut colonization of preterm and full-term infants throughout the rst year of life and evaluateassociations between strain persistence and strain origin as well as genetic potential. Analysis of fecal meta-genomes collected from 13 full-term and 9 preterm infants reveals that infants' initially distinct microbiomesconverge by age 1 year. Approximately 11% of early colonizers, primarily Bacteroides and Bidobacterium, persist during the rst year of life, and those are more prevalent in full-term, compared with preterm infants. Examination of 17 mother-infant pairs reveals maternal gut strains are signicantly more likely to persist in the infant gut than other strains. Enrichment in genes for surface adhesion, iron acquisition, and carbohydratedegradation may explain persistence of some strains through the rst year of life. INTRODUCTION Microorganisms rapidly colonize the near-sterile infant gut dur- ing and shortly after birth.1These early gut colonizers have important roles in the maturation of infants' metabolic pathways, especially related to the immune system.2Early life events, such as cesarean delivery and antibiotics administrations, whichcould disrupt microbial acquisition and assembly, 3-5have been associated with increased risks of developing diseases later in life, including asthma and metabolic syndrome.6-8 Certain bacterial commensals can persist within the adult gut for years.9-11Infant gut microbiomes are less stable than adult microbiomes at the whole-community level,12,13and funda- mental questions remain regarding the persistence of their earlycolonizers. There is potential for long-term effect if the rst colo- nizing strains, which are often hospital-associated pathogens in premature infants, 14-16persist as infants develop. Thus, it is important to analyze strain persistence and the sources andcharacteristics of persisting strains, as well as the time required for convergence of premature and full-term microbiomes. Most studies on the infant microbiome have relied on 16S rRNA sequencing, which cannot resolve genomic differences beyond the species level. These studies have advanced ourunderstanding of the early life gut microbiota assembly process. 12,13,17However, to answer questions regarding organ- ism transmissions from various sources, organism persistence through early life, or sharing of organisms among individuals,whole-genome resolution is necessary. Robust detection of sub- tle genomic differences allows one to determine whether strains are identical or merely closely related and to distinguishcommensal from pathogenic strains. 18,19Sequencing cultured isolates is one way to recover microbial genomes, but it is low throughput, targeted to particular taxa, and is unlikely to capture the full strain diversity present.20Genome-resolved metagenom- ics circumvents the shortcomings of 16S rRNA and culture- dependent sequencing by generating genomes for essentially all microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tracts ofinfants early in life without relying on culturing or any public reference genomes. 21-24Recently, there have been several metagenomics studies examining strain sharing among familymembers, among unrelated infants, and within individuals overtime. 25-30However, these studies used public reference ge- nomes and relied on read mapping to sets of species-specic marker genes for taxonomic characterization. This way of identi-fying organisms can ignore species that lack sufcient represen- tative genomes in the public database and, therefore, one can Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 \u00aa2021 1 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).ll OPEN ACCESSonly examine a subset of species and corresponding strains that are present in the database. These studies also used relatively non-stringent denitions of ''identical'' strains that ignore whole-genome information (i.e., considering single-nucleotidepolymorphisms [SNPs] in marker genes only and/or measuring coding regions only), which may confuse closely related, but epidemiologically unconnected, strains. 19 Here, we investigated early life gut microbiome assembly dy- namics using genome-resolved metagenomics and relied on stringent, whole-genome comparisons to dene two organisms as being the same. Our study targeted preterm and full-term in-fants born at the same hospital over a 3-year period and tracked their gut microbiome compositions to age 1 year. We also collected fecal samples from mothers at birth to identify trans-mission of strains between the infant and maternal gut micro- biomes. In contrast to prior work in this area, we examined the early life gut microbiomes using de novo constructed microbial genomes, which allowed us to examine species without closelyrelated representative genomes in public reference databases. Further, we applied a rigorous strain-level resolution when exam- ining the succession of the gut microbiome, which allowed us toaccurately track the persistence and gene content of strains colonizing the infant gut. Taken together, we determined that maternal origin, phylogeny, and functional potential of bacterialinitial colonizers all contributed to strain persistence in infants. Insights regarding traits that enable gut microbiome residency during early life have implications for development of rational mi-crobiome manipulations. RESULTSStudy design and sampling In this study, we followed 23 full-term and 19 preterm infants from birth to age 1 year. A total of 402 fecal samples from these infants and their mothers were selected and subjected to deepmetagenomic sequencing ( /C243.5 tera base pairs [Tbp] of total sequence data in the form of 150 bp paired-end reads) ( Fig- ure S1 ). Reads were de novo assembled to recover 7,521 draft genome bins, which were further dereplicated identity (gANI) ge- nomes that represent unique microbial ''subspecies.'' We use the term ''subspecies'' as a taxonomic rank in between strainand species ( Figure 1 )(STAR Methods ). Detection of identical strains was achieved using inStrain 19and was based on comparisons of read mapping to the same subspe-cies. A bacterial bin was considered identical in two samples if the compared region of the genome from both samples shared more than 99.999% population-level ANI (popANI) based on Our stringent denition of ''strain'' allowed us to discriminate between recent strain-trans- mission events and pairs of organisms that shared a recent evolu-tionary history but originated from distinct sources. In addition to infant and maternal samples, we sequenced ve negative reagent controls (one per extraction plate). The detec- tion of common gut species in two negative control wells promp-ted us to thoroughly assess artifactual sequence sharing among the wells of all extraction plates. We concluded that the contam- ination observed in two negative control wells was a result ofwell-to-well contamination on those two extraction plates (STAR Methods ). Given the importance of strain-level analyses, we rejected all samples on those plates (samples from 10 full- term and 10 preterm infants and 12 samples from mothers). Nocontamination was found in the other three extraction plates. Therefore, the 206 samples on these three plates (9 preterm and 13 full-term infants and 17 from their mothers) were usedfor downstream ( S2 ) of those 22 infants and their mothers are provided. Approximately 11% of bacterial early colonizers persisted throughout the rst year of life Infant fecal samples were grouped into seven windows of time (months 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12) based on infants' chronologicalages at the time of sample collection. Bacterial strains thatarrived during the rst 2 months of life were classied as early colonizers, and they were further subdivided into ''persisters'' or ''non-persisters,'' depending on whether they stayed withinthe infant gut beyond month 8 (persisters) or not (non-persisters) using the 99.999% popANI strain identity cutoff ( STAR Methods ) (Figure 2 A). We found that 274 (47.7%) of the 575 bacterial subspecies de- tected across infants during the rst year of life were early colo- nizers. Those 274 subspecies comprise 560 distinct strains; ofwhich, 59 were persisters, and 501 were non-persisters ( Fig- ure 2 A). The median residence time for persisters was 9.6 months (95% condence interval [CI], 9.0-10.1 months), and the median residence time for non-persisters was 0.4 months (95% CI, 0.3-0.5 months). Of the non-persisters, /C2476% were not detected after month 2. Notably, the relative abundance of non-persisters was signicantly less than that of persisters (p = 1.6e /C019; Wil- coxon rank-sum test). A greater percentage of early colonizers persisted throughout the rst year of life in full-term infants than did so in preterm in-fants (p = 0.032, two-sided permutation test) ( Figure 2 B). This outcome was not confounded by the size or diversity of the initial populations that colonized preterm and full-term infants becauseno statistical difference was observed in either the total numberof early colonizers or the alpha diversity of early colonizers be- tween preterm and full-term infants (p = 0.22 and 0.76, respec- tively; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To identify clinical variablesthat might contribute to strain persistence, we applied a general- ized linear model (GLM) to evaluate the effect of prematurity (STAR Methods ). We noted that a subset of clinical factors (i.e., Prolacta, a caloric fortier received by most preterm infants and no full-term infants) were highly correlated and, thus, was confounded with term/preterm status ( Figure S2 ). Hence, their contributions to strain persistence could not be quantied indi- vidually. Despite that, when controlling for term/preterm status, race, gender, feeding practices, breastfeeding cessation time,rst solid-food introduction time, delivery mode, and antibioticusage after month 2, we found that full-term status had a signif- icant effect on the percentage of initial strains that persist in an infant (p = 0.00024; Poisson distribution GLM). When considering all infants, Bacteroides andBidobacterium strains were more likely to persist than were strains of other bac- terial 2021Articlell OPEN ACCESSexact test) ( Figure 2 C). At the species level, Bacteroides vulgatus andBacteroides uniformis strains were more likely to persist than were strains of other bacterial species (q = 6.0e /C06 and 1.6e /C003, respectively; of Veillonella andClostridium were signicantly less likely to persist than were strains of other genera (q = 0.023 and 0.023, respectively; Fisher's exact test). These observations raised the question of whether the persisting and non-persisting strains differed between pretermand full-term infants. We found full-term infants, whereas Bacteroides uniformis andEscherichia coli persisting strains were enriched in preterm infants (q = 0.016 and 0.022, respectively; Fisher's exact test) ( Figure 2 D). Figure 1. Genome-resolved metagenomics pipeline Fecal samples collected from infants and their mothers (1) were subjected to shotgunsequencing (2). Reads were subsequently pro-cessed and assembled into draft genomes (3),which were dereplicated at gANI to result in1,005 genomes that represented unique microbialsubspecies (4). Reads from each individual sam-ple were then mapped to 1,005 subspecies (5) forsample-specic genome detection and sample-specic relative abundance calculation (6). in-Strain was run to identify same strains of thesubspecies between samples of the same ordifferent infants (7). See also Figure S1 andTables S1andS2. Maternally derived strains are more likely to be persisters in the infant gut microbiome To elucidate the influence of maternallyderived intestinal strains on the develop- ment of the infant gut microbiome, we measured strain sharing between infantsand their mothers. In this study, ''verticaltransmission'' refers to bacterial strains being transmitted from the gut micro- biomes of mothers to infants becauseno samples from other body sites were collected. Of the 22 infants in this study, we collected maternal fecal samplesfrom 17 of them. Of those 17 infants, 9 of the 12 full-term and three of the ve preterm infants inherited strains fromtheir mothers. In total, there were 50 maternally sourced bacterial strains that were detected across 12 of 17 mother-in-fant pairs examined (4.4% of all identiedmaternal strains; Figure 3 A). Strains that were vertically transmitted were signicantly more abundant in thematernal gut microbiomes than were strains that were not passed on to infants (p = 2.4e /C016, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure 3 B). Correspondingly, maternally acquired strains were also more abundant than were non-inherited strains in the infant gut microbiomes across all time windows (q < 0.001, Wilcoxonrank-sum test). Regardless of gestational age or deliverymode, Bacteroidetes were signicantly enriched and Firmicutes were signicantly depleted At the genus level, Bacteroides andParasutter- ellawere more likely to be acquired by infants from their mothers than were other bacterial genera (q = 2.0e /C008 and 0.028, respectively; Fisher's exact test) ( Figures 3 A and 3D). B. uniformis and B. vulgatus were the two most commonly observed species to be maternally transmitted in this cohort(q = 3.7e /C005 and 0.0015, respectively; Fisher's exact test). Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 3Articlell OPEN ACCESSMaternally transmitted strains were found to be signicantly more likely to be persisters in the infant gut microbiomes than strains derived from other sources, suggesting strains acquiredfrom the maternal gut microbiomes are likely to be well adapted to the infant gut (p = 4.0e /C011, Fisher's exact test) ( Figures 3 A and These maternally transmitted persisters were primarily Bac-teroidetes, whereas persisters not detected in maternal fecal samples were mostly Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Impor- tantly, we detected new strains being transmitted from mothersto the infant gut microbiomes throughout the rst year of life,suggesting vertical transmission is not limited to the intrapartum or postpartum periods ( Figure 3 A). Non-related infants rarely shared bacterial strains In addition to examining strain persistence and maternal strain transmission, we also searched for strain sharing betweendifferent infants in the study. When considering all possible pairs of individual infants, 18 of 231 infant pairs shared at least one bacterial strain ( Figure 4 A). Although most infant pairs sharedno more than two bacterial strains, full-term infants 7 and 133 shared 11 strains ( Figure 4 ). Our decontamination analysis ensured that this was not a result of cross-sample contamina-tion. We, therefore, hypothesized, and later conrmed by searching medical record data, that these two infants were sib- lings, with infant 7 being born 2 years earlier. We examined thegut microbiomes of the siblings and their mother in greater detail in the next section. No other infants in our study were biologically related. Excluding comparisons between siblings, preterm infants were far more likely to share strains with other preterm infants than full-term infants were to share strains with other full-term in- fants (p = 4.6e /C004, Fisher's exact test) ( Figure 4 A). Most sharing among preterm infants occurred before the infants were dis- charged from the hospital, pointing to the hospital environment as a potential strain source. Clostridium butyricum was the most widely shared species among preterm infants, and one C. butyricum strain was shared by R5 non-related preterm infants based on pairwise comparisons.AC D B Figure 2.

The two siblings were both born via cesarean section and were breastfed exclusively before weaning. During the rst year of life, when compared with the older sibling, the younger one had fewer Pro-teobacteria and Verrucomicrobia subspecies and more Bacter- oidetes. We speculated that changes in the gut microbiome of the mother around the time of birth of the second child,compared with the rst, might explain the observed composi- tional differences between the siblings. Indeed, the mother'sgut microbiome was nearly twice as enriched in Bacteroidetesand contained about six times less abundance of Proteobacteria and no Verrucomicrobia around the time of second delivery compared with the rst ( Figure 4 B). The 11 bacterial strains that were shared by the siblings ac- counted for /C2420% of the overall gut microbiome of the older sib- ling and /C2450% of the gut microbial community of the younger sibling ( Figure 4 C). Interestingly, only one of the 11 shared strains (B. breve ), not maternally derived, persisted in both siblings throughout most of their rst year of life, and ve of the 11 sharedA B D EC Figure 3.

No other infant pairs shared any bacterial persisters. Because most shared strains were late colonizers in the older sibling but were early colonizers in the younger sibling and they were mostly not detected in the gut microbiome of theirmother, we hypothesize that strains may have been transmitted from the older to the younger sibling ( Figure 4 D). Having collected two fecal samples from the same mother also allowed us to search for bacterial strains present in both samples. Of the 99 and 94 subspecies detected from the rstB A DC Figure 4.

Notably, these 12 strains constituted 20% of the maternal gut microbiome at thetime of the birth of her rst child and /C2450% of her gut microbiome 2 years later ( Figure S3 A). Of those 12 strains, a B. uniformis and aMegasphaera massiliensis strain were acquired by both sib- lings. Both of those strains were persisters in the younger sibling.Two of the other 10 maternal strains were detected when the younger sibling was 1 year old; another one of the 10 strains was detected in the older sibling at age 1 year ( Figure S3 B). Diverse carbohydrate active enzymes are implicated in Bidobacterium and Escherichia persistence We next investigated whether specic capacities of early colo- nizers are associated with strain persistence. Specically, we compared the gene content of persisters and non-persistersduring the rst 2 months of life to identify functional traits that could confer early colonizers with a persistence advantage (STAR Methods ;Tables 1 ,S3,S4, and S5). Because the ability to metabolize a variety of carbohydrates is considered to be important for surviving in the gut, 31,32we hy- pothesized that persister genomes would be enriched with car- bohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) when compared withnon-persisters. To test our hypothesis, we annotated genesencoding CAZymes and measured the diversity of them in the genomes of persisters and non-persisters ( STAR Methods ). (N p= 59) had a signicantly higher CAZyme Shannon diversity than (N np= = 4.1e /C007; Wilcoxon rank-sum primarily Bacteroides andBidobacterium , whose genomes are known to densely encode glycan-metabolizing genes.33-35To address that potential taxonomy bias, we restricted our compar- isons of CAZyme diversity to those between persisters and non-persisters from the same genus or species. Further, we requiredat least three persister and three non-persister strains for com- parisons to retain statistical power. andBidobacterium (Np= 12, N np= 18) persisters encoded a greater CAZyme Shannon diversity when compared with theircorresponding non-persisters (p = 0.030 and 0.014, respectively; Figure 5 A).E. coli (N p=3 ,N np= 25) was the only species that passed the ltering criteria, and itspersisters encoded a signicantly greater Shannon diversity of CAZymes than did non-persisters (p = 0.030; two-sided permu- tation test). We also examined CAZyme in the genomes of persisters and non-persisters ( STAR Methods ) and found Bido- bacterium persisters dedicated a signicantly higher percentage of their genomes to CAZymes than did Bidobacterium non-per- sisters (p = 0.047; two-sided permutation test) ( Figure 5 B). This effect is largely due to the inclusion of glycosyltransferases (GTs) and carbohydrate esterase (CEs) (p = 0.012 and 0.012,respectively; two-sided permutation test) ( Figure 5 C). In addi- tion, we measured the relationship between the number of genes encoding CAZymes and the number of unique CAZyme typesdetected in a genome. In general, both persisters and non-per-sisters showed a positive correlation between the number of genes encoding CAZymes and the number of (Spearman respectively) ( Figure 5 D). Notably, Bidobacterium persisters had a higher ratio of CAZyme-coding genes to unique CAZymes than the related non-persisters had(p = 0.00076; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that these strains generally encoded more duplicate copies of specic CAZyme families than their non-persisting counterparts did. We next searched for specic CAZymes that were enriched in persisters or non-persisters of Bidobacterium andEscherichia (STAR Methods ) because these are the two genera that showed signicant CAZyme diversity differences between their per-sisters and non-persisters. None of the CAZymes were enriched in non-persisters of either genus. Of the 109 CAZymes examined inBidobacterium early colonizers, six were signicantly en- riched in persisters (q < 0.05, Fisher's exact test), and theyTable 1.

InEscherichia , 8 of 63 CAZymes examined were signicantly enriched in persisters (q < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Most CAZymes such as GH33 and PL22 that were enriched inEscherichia persisters were involved in activities such as metab- olizing small molecules, including sugar byproducts of mucin, and dietary polysaccharides degradation carried out by othercommunity members ( Table S4 ). Interestingly, GH153, a involved in biolm formation, 36and GT107, a glycosyltransferase predicted to be also enriched in Escherichia persisters, suggesting Escherichia persisters might carry other traits that enable their stable gut colonization. Surface adhesion and iron acquisition contribute to E. coli persistence E. coli was the only species of Escherichia to be classied as an early colonizer. To identify other functions besides carbohydrate metabolism that could contribute to E. coli persistence in the in- fant gut, we compared the gene content of E. coli persisters and non-persisters present during the rst 2 months of life using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), STAR Methods ). All three E. coli persisters in our study were detected from pre- term infants. Specically, one E. coli persister was detected in a preterm infant who survived two necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) events, and that E. coli strain rst appeared around the time when NEC recurred ( Figure S4 ). Another two E. coli persisters were detected in two preterm infants before the onset of late- onset sepsis (LOS) ( Figure S4 ). Blood cultures were drawn on the day of diagnosis from those two infants and they were bothpositive for E. coli (Table S1 ). Although a previous study has re- ported the translocation of E. coli from the gut to the blood- stream to be the cause of LOS in some infants, 38we could not conrm such a nding by comparing the gut and the blood- stream E. coli strains because no blood cultures were banked for sequencing. Of the KEGG 119 140 Pfams, 37 TCIDs, and 72 VFs were signicantly enriched in E. coli persisters (q < 0.05, Fisher's exact test) ( Tables 1 andS5). Notably, 4 KOs, 19 Pfams, 4 TCIDs, and 18 VFs were present in all three E. coli persisters and absent in all 25 E. coli non-persisters. These were primarily linked to genes involved in surface adhesion.For instance, CdiA and antigen 43 have been shown to enhance cell-cell aggregation and/or biolm formation. 39,40Another func- tion that was found in E. coli persisters only was biosynthesis of the toxin colibactin. Genes involved in colibactin synthesis are located on a 54-kilobase genomic island.41We found 14 genes of that 19-gene cluster to be signicantly enriched in E. coli persisters only, which prompted us to search for the presenceof the complete colibactin biosynthesis gene cluster in E. coli persisters. Cluster detection via read mapping to de novo constructed E. coli representative genomes conrmed that a complete colibactin biosynthesis gene cluster was present in allE. coli persisters and absent in all E. coli non-persisters (STAR Methods ).We also identied genes for functions that were signicantly enriched but not exclusively present in persisters. Many of these are involved in surface adhesion (e.g., type VI secretion system and biolm biosynthesis). Also enriched was the uropathogenicEscherichia coli colicin-like protein (Usp), which has been postu- lated to be a bacteriocin against other E. coli strains and has also been shown to damage mammalian cells. 42,43Other enriched traits included sugar and amino acid metabolism (e.g., pectin-associated metabolism and D-serine detoxication and meta- bolism) and iron acquisition (e.g., manganese/iron transporters and siderophore production) ( Tables 1 andS5). We found adjacent biosynthesis gene clusters involved in the production of the siderophore yersiniabactin and the genotoxin colibactin exclusively in all three coli persisters ( Method ) colibactin and yersiniabactin biosynthesis gene clusters has been found in both extraintestinal pathogenic strains and gut commensal isolates.41,44,45These two gene clusters have been shown to be functionally intercon-nected via clbA , a gene from the colibactin gene cluster that also contributes to siderophore biosynthesis. 46How this genomic structure might influence the persistence of E. coli in the preterm infant gut and the onset of early life diseases remain to be determined. We used comparative genomic analyses to verify that genes that are apparently absent or relatively uncommon in E. coli non-persisters were not simply missed because of missing genome fragments ( STAR Methods ). As expected, we detected insertions/deletions involving enriched/absent genes in other- wise syntenous regions. For instance, we found that genes involved in synthesis of the colicin-like protein (Usp) and its asso-ciated immunity protein, as well as a large region that encodes atype VI secretion system, were absent in otherwise syntenous regions of the persister and non-persister E. coli genomes (Figure S6 ). Overall, we found E. coli persisters encoded a signicantly higher percentage of virulence genes than did non-persisters (p = 0.0032; two-sided permutation test). Because many of thesegenes were involved in surface adhesion and iron acquisition, we assessed the importance of these two functions by measuring their density on the genomes of E. coli early colonizers ( STAR Methods ;Tables S6 ). We found E. coli persisters dedicated signicantly higher percentages of their genomes to surface adhesion and iron acquisition than the non-persisters (p = 0.013 and 0.00030, respectively; two-sided permutation test),suggesting these two functions were particularly important for the persistence of E. coli in the infant gut. Initially divergent gut microbiomes of full-term and preterm infants largely converged by age 1 year To understand how early life gut microbiome assembly might differ between full-term and preterm infants at the communitylevel, we measured the b-diversity of the two infant groups using the UniFrac distance 47(STAR Methods ). Weighted UniFrac, which considers the relative abundances of individual taxa, indicated that the gut microbiomes of preterminfants diverged from those of full-term infants between months 1 and 3. During that period, preterm infants' gut microbiomes were disproportionately dominated by bacteria that are common Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 9Articlell OPEN ACCESSin the hospital environment, convergence between the gut microbiomes of preterm and full-term infants began at month 3 and accelerated betweenmonths 4 and 8 (p = 2.0e /C004, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Overall, weighted UniFrac indicated that the microbiomes of full-term and preterm infants converged by age 1 year (p = 0.0024,Wilcoxon rank-sum test) ( Figures 6 B and S7A). Unweighted Uni- Frac, which excludes relative abundance, indicated that the gut microbiomes of preterm and full-term infants became similar be- tween months 1 and 8 (p = 0.0059, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) butdiverged rapidly after month 8. Altogether, UniFrac suggested that the preterm and full-term infant microbiomes became more distinct by age 1 year (p = 0.014, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) ( Figures 6 B and S7A). To evaluate the contrasting outcomes of the two UniFrac metrics, we also tested for conver- gence of gut microbiomes of full-term and preterm infants usingA B DCFigure 6.

Samples are numbered accord-ing to infant age at the time of collection. PCA isbased on weighted UniFrac distance. See alsoFigure S7 C. Bray-Curtis distance ( STAR Methods ; Figure S7 B). Consistent with weighted UniFrac, Bray-Curtis distance indicatedthat the gut microbial compositions of full-term and preterm infants largely converged by age 1 year (p = 1.7e /C031, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To further examine the maturation of the infant gut microbiome, we measuredtheb-diversity between the gut micro- biomes of infants and mothers. Both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances showed a gradual convergence between infants and mothers ( Figures 6 C and S7A). Development of gut microbiomes of preterm and full- term infants in the context of maternal microbiome composition was further examined via principal component analysis (PCA)(STAR Methods ). Each infant's assembly trajectory was visual- ized in a PCA by tracking the changes in composition between consecutive sampling time points ( Figure 6 D). The gut micro- biomes of preterm infants, full-term infants, and their mothersformed distinct clusters in PCA space (permutational multivar- iate variance [PERMANOVA], p < 0.001) ( Figure S7 C). However, over time, the infant gut microbiomes all moved to-ward the PCA region in which the maternal samples were placed. Indeed, chronological age had a signicant role in driving the gut microbiome changes for both full-term and preterm infants(PERMANOVA, p = 0.040 and p < 0.001, respectively). Notably, the trajectories of preterm infant microbiomes were different from those for full-term infants, possibly because their initialgut microbiomes were more distinct from the maternal gut 10Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021Articlell OPEN ACCESSmicrobiomes than those of full-term infants. Indeed, Jaccard dissimilarity comparing consecutive fecal metagenomes of each infant ( STAR Methods ) indicated that the changes between the early and late gut microbiomes of preterm infants were signif-icantly larger than those of full-term infants (p = 0.0092; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). DISCUSSION We conducted strain-resolved analyses to investigate ecological succession in the gut microbiomes of preterm and full-term in- fants, nding that /C2411% of bacterial early colonizers persisted through the rst year of life. Our study used genome-resolved metagenomics to stringently identify persisting bacterial strains across all phyla in the early life gut microbiome and to investigatefactors that are associated with strain persistence. Prior studieshave identied the existence of persisting bacterial strains; however, many of those studies relied on isolation-based strate- gies, 9,10,15,49which can be biased toward cultivable lineages and strains. Several metagenomics-based studies have reported the detection of strains persisting in the infant gut over time,26,27,29 but they primarily focused on the influence of strain origin (i.e., maternally transmitted) on the fate of strains, relied on public reference genomes, and did not consider whole-genome infor- mation when dening strains, which may fail to discriminate be-tween closely related, but epidemiologically unconnected,strains with genetic differences only resolvable with whole- genome comparisons. We showed that most of the initial gut microbiome is transient, and only a small percentage of the early colonizers persist until age 1 year. This is in contrast with what has been reported in the adult gut microbiome. 9,11High strain turnover in the infant gut microbiome is not surprising. The initial microbial seeding of the near-sterile infant gut largely depends on the environment the infant is exposed to.50-52Observation that non-persisters were signicantly less abundant than persisters suggests that the transient presence of some early colonizers was, in part, due to neutral processes, such as ecological drift,53because, by random chance, low-abundant organisms can be more easilydriven to extinction by drift than high-abundant organisms can. 51 The transient nature of some early colonizers could also be areflection of them being poorly adapted to the gut environment,which is shaped by the host immune system, and some early col- onizers including those that persist. Although constituting a small percentage of the early colonizers, persisters have the potentialto shape the trajectory of the developing microbiome. Through priority effects, persisters can pose inhibitory and/or facilitative effects on late-arriving strains by niche preemption and/or modi-cation. 51,54Although priority effects can also be exerted by non-persisting early colonizers,51given their transient presence, the influence they have on the infant gut microbiome assembly islikely to be less signicant when compared with those of per-sisters. In addition, the stable colonization of persisters implies their intimate interactions with the immune system. Early life mi- crobial colonization is critical for the development of the immunesystem. 52It is plausible that persisters directly influence the maturation of the immune system, which can then further shape the infant gut microbiome assembly. The importance of persist-ing early colonizers in the early life gut microbiome, thus, moti- vated us to identify those strains and to investigate factors that contribute to their persistence. We identied one important factor that seems to dictate whether an early colonizer is in the small subset of strains that persist beyond the rst year of life. By analyzing maternal fecal samples collected around the time of birth, we determined thatstrains derived from the maternal gut (i.e., Bacteroides ) are signicantly more likely to persist than non-inherited strains. Our work extends previous maternal-transmission work con- ducted over a much shorter period and used a combination ofconsensus-SNP calling and gene-based approaches to identify mother-infant shared strains, 26a study that relied on analysis of rare SNPs of abundant species only,29and a study that dened identical strains using SNP differences on species-specic marker genes only.27Persistence of maternally transmitted strains could be a result of continuous seeding from the motherbecause we showed maternal transmission occurred throughthe rst year of life. Persistence of maternal strains may also reflect their adaptation to the gut, which may include the meta- bolism of gut-associated nutrients and interaction with the infantimmune system. 2 Some bacterial taxa were far more likely than others to persist in the developing infant gut. Enrichment of Bacteroides per- sisters could be partially explained by their maternal gut origin. Bidobacterium spp. were less-commonly detected in the maternal gut. Their high likelihood of persisting in the infant gutmay be attributed to their high diversity and density of CAZymes; some of which degrade dietary polysaccharides. 13,55Our ndings suggest that metabolic flexibility is crucial for Bidobac- terium persistence in the infant gut because it enables rapid adaptation when the infant's diet shifts away from breast milk and/or formula. This is in line with prior work that proposed a link between plant polysaccharide metabolic capacity and theability of a strain to adapt by shifting metabolism after introduc- tion of solid food. 32In addition to metabolic flexibility, enrichment of glycosyltransferase-encoding genes, which can participate incapsular and/or exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, suggests that other functional traits, such as host adherence and resistance to bile acids, 56may also be important for Bidobacterium persis- tence in the infant gut. Flexible carbohydrate metabolism might be a common trait linked to persistence in the infant gut because Escherichia per- sisters also encoded a greater diversity of CAZymes than didrespective non-persisters. However, as suggested with the persistence of Bidobacterium , other factors likely influence persistence. We identied an enrichment of virulence factors,such as those coding for surface adhesion, iron acquisition, and colibactin biosynthesis in E. coli persisters, many of which are commonly carried by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). 57,58It is plausible that these virulence factors enhance the competitiveness of E. coli in the gut without causing acute disease. Indeed, long-term intestinal colonizationof commensal E. coli strains carrying virulence factors has been found in healthy individuals. 49,57,59 Although we cannot state whether resident E. coli strains car- rying virulence genes will have long-term negative effects onhost health, their exclusive presence in preterm infants in this Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 11Articlell OPEN ACCESSstudy implies that prematurity can affect the infant microbiome for a span of time. A recent comparison of the gut microbiomes of preterm and near-term infants noted that, even though infants' gut microbiome compositions showed evidence of conver-gence, markers associated with prematurity remained by age 2 years. 15Using cultivation-independent genome-resolved strain analyses, we also found that, although initially distinct gut micro-biomes of preterm and full-term infants largely converged by age1 year, some differences remained. For instance, E. coli strains enriched in virulence genes were found in preterm infants only, which could result in differences in community assembly andimmune system development. The persisting microbiome differences between full-term and preterm infants likely result from a combination of factors, including gestational age, 17 early life antibiotic treatments,14,15exposure to the hospital environment,15,21and lack normal development of the immune system.60 By identifying and tracking individual strains in preterm and full-term infants through the rst year of life and through careful analysis of strain-level functional potential, our study provides a ne-grained view of the early gut microbiome succession. Bydetermining the types of strains that colonize in early life, where they come from, and what persistence-associated genetic traits they carry, we can better understand how the early life micro-biome is assembled and gain insights into potential micro- biome-based therapies when that assembly is disrupted. Limitations of study Our study was underpowered to fully assess all confounding fac- tors when conducting between group comparisons. Forinstance, we were unable to independently evaluate the effectsof variables including Prolacta addition, birth weight, length of stay in hospital after birth, and early antibiotic administrations (before month 2) on strain persistence because many of thesefactors are tightly associated with prematurity. In addition, given the high percentage of preterm infants who survived NEC and LOS in our study, some of our preterm-related ndings, includingpersisting E. coli strains, may not apply to healthy preterm infants. To expand on our observations and to address the relationship between persisting E. coli strains enriched with virulence factors and prematurity, future longitudinal studies recruiting larger and more-balanced cohorts of preterm infants are needed.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Ofce (IRB STUDY19120040). This nested case-control observational study was originally designed to study the gut microbiomes of premature and full-term infants as well as the gut microbiomes of premature infants who developed NEC and/or LOS and age-matched premature infants over the rst year of life. For these purposes, we enrolled a total of 183 infants (35 full-term infants and 148 preterm infants born before34 weeks of gestation). The 148 preterm infants that were followed prospectively comprised 10 NEC infants including one that devel-oped NEC twice, 5 LOS infants, 1 infant that developed both NEC and LOS, and 132 infants that did not develop NEC or LOS. For each infant with NEC or LOS, we identied a member of the cohort that was hospitalized concomitantly, had a similar age, and that had not been treated with antibiotics after the rst week of life. However, some infants had to be excluded from our study due topatient withdrawal, missing samples at key time points, or low sample biomass. Ultimately, we acquired longitudinal samples from 23 full-term and 19 preterm (6 healthy controls, 8 NEC infants, 4 LOS infants and 1 infant that developed both NEC and LOS) from birth to age one ( Figure S1 ). Fecal samples from enrolled infants and their mothers were all collected at the UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital (Pittsburgh, PA) over the course of three years. While full-term infants were discharged from the hospital within 3 days after birth and received no perinatal antibiotics, all preterm infants received empiric antibiotics immediately following birth during an evaluation for early-onsetsepsis and then spent their rst 2-3 months in the hospital. In addition to infant fecal samples, we collected a single fecal sample from 28 mothers of 29 infants within the rst two weeks after delivery. All samples were collected with parental consent and subjects were de-identied before the receipt of samples. Well-to-well contamination was identied on samples from 20 out of 42 infants (seesection Identication of sources of contamination below), and genome-resolved metagenomics analyses were performed on the remaining 13 full-term and 9 preterm infants. De-identied metadata for the 22 infants whose samples were not contaminated is provided in Tables S1 . METHOD DETAILS Sample collection and metagenomic sequencing Throughout the rst year of life, infant fecal samples were collected either at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital by trained nurses or at home by parents provided with detailed collection instructions. Specically, fresh infant stool samples were collected directly from infants while they were actively excreting or from diapers shortly after the stools were released. Maternal fecal samples werecollected using a commode specimen collector, from which fecal samples were transferred into a collection tube. All stool samplescollected at the hospital were immediately stored at /C080 /C14C following collections. Samples collected at home were stored in home freezers until they were picked up by research staff and transferred to the /C080/C14C condition. DNA extraction of frozen fecal samples was performed via the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 DNA isolation kit with modications the manufacturer's protocol. Foreach 96-well extraction plate, a reagent-only negative control was included. Metagenomic sequencing of collected infant and maternal fecal samples was performed in collaboration with the California Insti- tute for Quantitative Biosciences at UC Berkeley (QB3-Berkeley). Library preparation on all samples was performed as previouslydescribed. 79Final sequence ready libraries were pooled into 2 subpools and visualized and quantied on the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer. Four samples did not t nicely into either subpool so their libraries were quantied separately. All libraries were then evenly pooled into a single pool and checked for pooling accuracy by sequencing on Illumina MiSeq Nano sequencing runs. Thesingle and sequenced on were converted to demultiplexed fastq les per the original sample count with Illumina's bcl2fastq v2.20 software. Metagenomic assembly and gene prediction Reads from all 402 samples were trimmed using Sickle ( https://github.com/najoshi/sickle ), and reads that mapped to the human genome with Bowtie2 61under default settings were discarded. Reads from each sample were then assembled independently using IDBA-UD62under default settings. Co-assemblies were also performed for each infant, in which reads from all samples of that infant Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 e2Articlell OPEN ACCESSwere combined and assembled together. Scaffolds that are < 1 kb in length were discarded. On average, 93.2% of the sequencing reads (95% condence interval, 92.4%-94.4%) were de novo assembled into scaffolds R1 kbp in length per sample. Remaining scaffolds were annotated using Prodigal63to predict open reading frames using default metagenomic settings. Metagenomic de novo binning Pairwise cross-mapping was performed between all samples from each infant to generate differential abundance signals for binning. Each sample was binned independently using three automatic binning programs: metabat2,64concoct65and maxbin2.66DasTool67 was then used to select the best bacterial bins from the combination of these three automatic binning programs. The resulting draftgenome bins were the ANImf algorithm, 98% secondary Genomes with gANI R98% were classied as the same subspecies, and the genome with the highest score (as determined by dRep) was chosen as the representative genome from each subspecies. A total of 1005 genomes were selected to represent unique microbial ''subspecies'' and they had an average of 96% completeness and 1.05% contamination. Taxonomy assignment The amino acid sequences of predicted genes of all assembled bins were searched against the UniProt100 database using the usearch ublast command of into taxonomic levels. Briefly, for each taxonomic level (species, genus, phylum, etc.), a taxonomic labelwas assigned to a bin if R50% of proteins had best hits to the same taxonomic label. GTDB-Tk (v1.3.0) 69was used to resolve taxo- nomic levels that could not be assigned by tRep. Detection of subspecies and identication of strains using inStrain Reads from each individual fecal sample were mapped to all 1005 representative subspecies (generated via dRep as described above) concatenated together using Bowtie2 under default settings. inStrain (v1.3.4) prole19was run on all resulting mapping les using a minimum mapQ score of 0 and insert size of 160. Genomes with R0.5 breadth (meaning at least half of the nucleotides of the genome are covered by R1 read) in samples were considered to be present. inStrain compare was run to compare the genome similarity among all subspecies that were present in R2 samples. Specically, inStrain compare was used under default settings to compare read mappings to the same genome in different pairs of samples. Samples were considered to share the same strain of the examined genome if the compared region of the genome from samples shared R99.999% population-level ANI (popANI). Only genomic areas with at least 5x coverage in samples were compared, and sample pairs with less than 50% of comparableregions of the genome orthology groups (KOs) were assigned to predicted ORFs for all fecalmetagenomes using KofamKOALA. 70Carbohydrate active enzymes databases with default settings. Final CAZyme domain annotations were the best hits based on the outputs of all three databases.Domains were also predicted using hmmsearch (v.3.3) /C06) against the Pfam r32 database.80The domain architecture of each protein sequence was resolved using cath-resolve-hits (v0.16.5) with default settings.72The transporters were predicted both hmmsearch (same settings as the pfam prediction and domain architecture was resolved using cath-resolve-hits) and BLASTP (v2.10.0) (keeping the best hit, e-value cutoff 1e-20) against the Transporter Classication Database(TCDB) (downloaded in November 2020). 81SignalP (v.5.0b) (parameters, -f was used to predict proteins' putative cellular localization.73Transmembrane helices in proteins were predicted via TMHMM (v.2.0) with default settings.74Secondary me- tabolites were characterized using antiSMASH (v5.1.2) with default settings.75 To identify E. coli virulence factors, ABRicate ( https://github.com/tseemann/abricate ) was used under default settings to search all predicted protein sequences associated with E. coli persisters and non-persister genomes against the E. coli virulence-associated gene database (EcVGDB).82 Identication of sources of contaminationOne negative reagent control (NC) was included in each 96-well DNA extraction plate, in which no material was added during the DNAextraction step. In total this study involved ve extraction plates labeled P1 to P5. NCs were labeled by the plate number (i.e., NC1 refers to the negative control sample on the extraction plate 1). All ve NC samples were subjected to the DNA extraction and sequencing the same as the fecal samples. Subspecies present in NC samples were detected via mapping reads from NC samplesto all 1005 representative subspecies as described above. Subspecies detection limit was the same as described above. We foundtwo NC samples (NC3 and NC4) had over 50% of their reads mapped to /C2460 out of 1005 representative subspecies. To search for subspecies that was unique to NC samples, we recovered draft genomes from all ve NC samples and dRep (settings were the same as described above) was run on these genomes together with the 1005 dereplicated genomes recovered from fecal samples.Through this approach, we did not nd any subspecies that were unique to NC samples. e3Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021Articlell OPEN ACCESSDetection of bacterial genomes in the NC3 and NC4 could be a result of index hopping, barcode bleeding, reagent contamination, and/or sample spillover (or ''well-to-well contamination''). Since all samples were given Unique Dual Indexes, the observed contam- ination in NC3 and NC4 were unlikely to be a result of index hopping. We also eliminated the possibility of barcode bleeding by re- sequencing NC3 and NC4 alone. The possibility for reagent contamination to occur in our case was also unlikely since not only did wefail to detect any bacterial genomes in the rest of three NC samples, but we also did not nd bacterial strains being shared over 50% of the samples either on the same extraction plates or across all ve plates. We therefore hypothesized that the detection of intestinal bacterial genomes in NC3 and NC4 was a result of sample spillover within plates 3 and 4. Using the strain-resolved methods detailedabove, we detected strain sharing across the extraction plates 3 and 4, but not with the rest of four plates. Given the reliance of ourstudy on robust and accurate detection of strain sharing, we excluded from analysis all samples from plates 3 and 4. We were not able to resequence samples that were contaminated for this study. Beyond cost and lack of sufcient replacement samples, our labora- tory was essentially closed for many months due to the pandemic and the sequencing facility diverted its capacity to COVID testing. Detection of mother-to-infant vertical transmission For each mother-infant pair, every fecal sample from the infant was compared to its maternal fecal sample to search for identicalbacterial strains ( R99.999% popANI and R0.5 percent_genome_compared) via inStrain compare (described above). A strain was considered to be vertically transmitted if it was shared between the maternal fecal sample and at least one infant fecal sample. Persister and non-persister detection ''Beginning-end'' and ''pairwise'' approaches were used to identify persister and non-persister strains among early colonizers. The ''beginning-end'' approach searched for strains which shared R99.999% popANI between the rst two months of life ( %month 2) and the last two sampling windows (around months 8 and 12). 54 persisters and 506 non-persisters were detected usingthis approach. The ''pairwise approach'' identied strains which shared R99.999% popANI across consecutive month windows (%month 2 & month 3, month 3 & month 4, month 4 & Rmonth 8), yielding 36 persisters and 525 non-persisters. These two approaches combined resulted in the total identication of 59 persisters and 501 non-persisters across 22 infants (only 5 persisteswere detected with the ''pairwise approach'' alone). We chose to classify strains as persisters using the month 8 cutoff as we did not want to exclude persisters that would be missed due to lack of a month 12 sample (one infant) or poor genome recovery from month 12 samples (eight infants). We chose the cutoff of99.999% popANI for persistence because we calculated that it is unlikely for a strain to acquire 40 SNPs in one year, given an average bacterial genome size of /C244 Mbp and the expected rate of in situ bacterial evolution in the human gut ( /C240.9 single-nucleotide poly- morphisms (SNPs)/genome/year analysis Genes from persisters and non-persisters of each examined bacterial group (i.e., Bidobacterium spp. and E. coli ) were proled via inStrain prole under default settings. Genes were considered to be present if they had R1x coverage across R70% of their length. Genes were annotated using the CAZy, KEGG, Pfam, (EcVG) databases as described above. Only annotations that were present in more than 65% of all persisters and less than 35% of all non- persisters as well as those that were present in less than 35% of all persisters and more than 65% of all non-persisters were kept forthe enrichment analysis. Fisher's exact test (as implemented using the Scipy module ''scipy.stats.sher_exact'') followed by false discovery rate (FDR) correction were run on genes annotated with each database (CAZy, database that were signicantly enriched in persisters or non-persisters (q < 0.05). To search for traits besides carbohydrate metabolism that were associated with E. coli persistence in the infant gut, genes with annotations that were signicantly enriched in E. coli using the UniProt100 and UniRef databases. In addition, we located genomic positions of differentially enriched annotations and used the functions of surrounding genes to improve the functional predictionfor the gene of interest. The nal datasheet listing annotations that were differentially enriched in E. coli persisters and non-persister is provided in Table S5 . Annotations with p-value s < 0.05 only (q-values > 0.05) are also provided in Table S5 . Detection of the complete colibactin biosynthesis gene cluster and its co-localization with the yersiniabactin biosynthesis gene clusters in E. coli persisters Functional enrichment analysis (described above) revealed 14 out of 19 genes involved in colibactin biosynthesis were exclusivelypresent in E. coli persisters. To conrm the presence of a complete colibactin synthesis cluster in all E. coli persisters, we located the gene cluster on the de novo constructed E. coli representative genome and manually inspected the read mapping on Geneious 76 using reads from infant samples in which E. coli persisters were detected. No reads from non-persisters were mapped to the coli- bactin gene cluster. On the same contig that we detected colibactin gene clusters, we also identied a complete yersiniabactin biosynthesis gene clusters, which were also found to be signicantly enriched in E. coli persisters ( Figure S5 and yersiniabactin biosynthesis gene clusters were veried to be present in all three E. coli persisters by inspecting the read mappings in Geneious. Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021 e4Articlell OPEN ACCESSComparative genomic analysis Infant-specic E. coli persister and non-persisters genomes that were from the same subspecies clusters as the dRep-chosen E. coli representative genomes were used to conduct comparative genomic analysis. Identication of matching scaffolds between E. coli persisters and non-persisters were achieved via BLAST. Specically, scaffolds from E. coli persisters were compared to scaffolds from E. coli non-persisters using BLASTN (keeping the best hit, e-value cutoff 1e-10). For each function that was found to be signicantly enriched in E. coli persisters, we identied the scaffold from E. coli persisters in which the function was encoded on as well as the matching scaffold from E. coli non-persisters. Whole-scaffold alignments between persisters and non-persisters were performed in Geneious. Final alignments displayed in Figure S6 were created via clinker.77 Examination of coding density of surface adhesion and iron acquisition functions in E. coli persisters and non- persistersTo assess the coding density of surface adhesion and iron acquisition in E. coli , we rst manually curated a list of KOs that were asso- ciated with either function based on extensive literature searches ( Table S6 ). We then identied corresponding genes that were involved in either function. For iron acquisition, we further supplemented additional iron acquisition genes that were identied viaFeGenie under default settings. 78For each E. coli persister and non-persister genome, coding density for either function was calcu- lated by dividing the number of genes encoding surface adhesion or iron acquisition by the total number of genes. Community diversity analysis Since the earliest fecal sample was collected several days after birth for preterm infants and around the rst month of life for full-term infants, all beta-diversity analysis between the two infant groups were conducted in the same chronological-age time frame (thus excluding any preterm samples taken before month 1). To measure convergence of the gut microbiomes, if not otherwise specied,a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to compare gut microbiomes at months 1 and 12. Modules from scikit-bio ( http://scikit-bio. org/) were used and ''skbio. diversity.beta.unweighted_unifrac,'' dissimilarity were implemented via''skbio.diversity.beta_diversity''). To calculate UniFrac distances, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by comparing all 1005 dereplicated bacterial subspecies to each other using dRep cluster with a mash sketch size of 10,000. Principal components analysis Principal components analysis (PCA) (performed using scikit-learn [ https://scikit-learn.org ]) was conducted based on the relative abundance of bacterial subspecies in each fecal metagenome as assessed using weighted UniFrac distance. Signicance of theclustering by variables (i.e., mode of delivery, prematurity, and feeding type) was determined by Permutational Multivariate Analysisof Variance (PERMANOVA) with 1000 permutations (as scikit-bio module ''skbio.stats.distance.permanova''). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISTwo-group univariate comparisons Statistical signicance for was calculated using Fisher's exact test (as implemented using the Scipy module ''scipy.stats.sher_ex-act''), Wilcoxon rank-sum test (as implemented using the and two-sided permutation test with 9999 permutations (in-house R script) as reported in the main text and in the STAR Methods . All multiple comparisons were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected with a threshold of q < 0.05. Multivariate statistical analyses Two-sided permutation test with 9999 permutations comparing the percentage of persisting early colonizers among infants indicated that full-term infants had more persisters than preterm infants ( Figure 2 B). To assess whether the outcome was confounded by other clinical variables, we developed a statistical model that takes into account and controls for all clinical data collected from infants enrolled in our study (in-house R script). We rst evaluated the correlation between each pair of variables and found that some are confounded by the sampling design (e.g., all preterm babies received empiric antibiotics immediately following birth and had Pro-lacta added to their diet). Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the influence of those effects independently. In addition, variables including birth weight, extent of hospital stay, whether had NEC and/or LOS, weaning starting time and antibiotic administrations before month 2 are highly correlated with preterm delivery and therefore cannot be quantied individually in our study. We thereforeperformed our statistical analyses excluding these preterm-associated variables and controlling for other clinical factors (term/pre- term status, gender, feeding practices (BRM only versus BRM plus formula), and antibiotics administrations after month 2). To show whether full-term status had a signicant impact on the percentage of persisters in an infant, a generalized linear model (GLM) with aPoisson family was performed using R. e5Cell Reports Medicine 2, 100393, September 21, 2021Articlell OPEN ACCESS "}
