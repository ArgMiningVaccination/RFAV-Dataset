Our approach is very simple...It's all about YOU!!! Since 2008 we have been helping people all over the country who have been suffering from chronic and severe health challenges. Your body is made to be well however a chronic disease process can slowly disrupt the communication between your brain, organs, and glands. This causes your body to slowly adapt instead of thrive, eventually causing the horrible symptoms you are feeling. Our unique healing methods have helped thousands of people regain their health and feel normal again. What makes us unique in our holistic center is our approach towards your health, and YOU as a whole. Unlike many health centers that are symptom based and focus solely on trying to mask the presenting symptom, our office is focused on the cause of the symptom and the relationship it has to your gland-organ-muscle connection. Symptoms are just stories the body tells us and when we listen to what the body needs properly, the symptoms will go away for good. We serve people not only concerned with resolving symptoms of disease, but who also are interested in maintaining wellness. We are concerned with the health and well being of the whole person and have created an open, caring state-of-the-art environment where a patient may take advantage of as many of our holistic health services as they wish. I was so thankful to Dr. Singer when my son tested positive for the flu and I thought he was going to be sick for a week.

I was blown away when my son's fever broke the night I took him to see Dr. Singer! Providing Alternative Solutions for People Suffering with: | | The Flu Coronavirus Auto-Immune Diseases Digestive Problems Food Allergies and Sensitivities Lyme Disease, CFS, & Lupus | | Sinus and Migraines Depression Weight Loss Detoxification Programs Nutrition Programs Athletic Rehab...And much more!!! Holistic care defines itself by its own nature. It is the process of self-evaluation that begins with the patient wanting to take responsibility for his or her own well being. This type of care is not reduction-istic in nature. It does not break a person down into different pieces of dysfunction and try to fix the pieces one at a time. Instead, holistic caregivers strive to take into account the whole person on all levels simultaneously, by looking at the structural, emotional, nutritional, spiritual, and physical components of dis-ease. Then, after doing so, they look for general patterns, that when corrected, will help resolve all levels of symptomology, regardless of which origin they may arise from. This process also takes into consideration the natural process of healing, and the understanding that each person is an individual, and will, therefore, have a schedule of healing all their own. The methods and techniques Dr. Singer brings to his patients make him one of the most unique healers of our time.

Thank you for giving me my life back! G.R. \"I had no energy to work and my medical doctors all gave up on me when my body did not respond to any of the attempted treatments to get me feeling somewhat normal again. I was placed on disability, my marriage and family life was suffering because I was in bed all day for months. Dr. Singer gave me hope when I first met him. After three weeks of detoxification programs to my body I was back to work again. Thank you!\" T.D. \"I was very impressed when Dr. Singer himself sat with me and explained what was wrong with my body and how he was going to help my body heal. I feel empowered and forever know now how to prevent my body from breaking down.\" K.S. \"For 7 years I was told that my stomach pains were incurable and I should just learn to live with it. After only a few months I am a new person, I was given my life back. Thank you Dr. Matt, I am able to live again!\" C.G. \"Dr. Singer has such insight and understand about the body, I always feel as though he knows what my problems are before I tell him! H.T. I was prescribed over 15 different medications, 7 different antibiotics, and countless amounts of antidepressants and pain medication over the past 12 years. I was told countless times that I had Lyme, but the blood tests could never 100% confirm the diagnosis. Dozens of doctors were dumbfounded about my condition, I truly thought I was going to live this way for the rest of my life. There were even days I contemplated suicide from the intense pain and inability to function. I almost lost my job, family, and way of life. I was referred to Dr. Singer a few months ago and within 5 weeks I was back to work, my energy returned, I was happy, healthy, and I had my family life back. I can barely tell this story without crying for such appreciation for what Dr. Singer did to help me get my life back. I recommend everyone to his office. I am forever grateful for your knowledge and assistance, you saved my life! - C.E.
