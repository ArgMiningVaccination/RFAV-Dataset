After 4 years at 301 West Roosevelt, we were forced to relocate as the building was coming down to make way for the [Eco Phoenix Project.](https://abovethemarkllc.com/project/eco-phoenix/) It turned out to be a great opportunity for us as we purchased a 1940's building in the lovely Coronado district, less than 3 miles away in the Uptown Phoenix area. We had to completely gut and renovate the inside, but after 6 months we opened our doors in September 2018. This was a major financial undertaking and it wasn't until April of 2022, with the help of a loan from [Prestamos, part of Chicanos Por La Causa](https://www.prestamosloans.org/), that we started to fix up the exterior of the building. Half of the loan went to renovate the outside to include a block fence along 7th Street and concrete walkways. We also replaced the old [awful (and toxic) asphalt](https://news.yale.edu/2020/09/02/asphalt-adds-air-pollution-especially-hot-sunny-days) with rock and started an organic garden with some fruit trees! With the rest of the loan, we purchased some new state-of-the-art medical equipment, [BrainTap](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-body-mind-therapy/services-body-mind-therapy-sound-healing-braintap/), [UBI blood machine](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-iv-therapies-ozone-ubi/), and coming soon, we'll have an Ozone Sauna!
