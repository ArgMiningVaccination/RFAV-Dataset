Join Sarah to learn the brain benefits and the drawbacks of positivity and connection with the divine, including the role of paradox and holding non-dual complexity. This is primarily a learning and neuroscience content webinar, including a small number of actionable insights and healing process work. If you are seeking healing and resonance practice opportunities, please see Sarah's [upcoming courses here](https://sarahpeyton.com/events/list) The purpose of many spiritual and contemplative practices is to invite our brains into direct experience with the divine. How is it possible that this innocent pursuit could actually have negative consequences for our relationships with others and with ourselves? And what about having a positive outlook - could that actually have a negative impact? When spiritual practice is used to sidestep real-world challenges and unrest, whether internal or external, and when we advocate the use of positive thinking to mask injustice and genuine challenges, we are entering the territory of spiritual bypassing and toxic positivity. In this webinar, we will look at the brain benefits and the drawbacks of positivity and connection with the divine. We will leverage the research to understand how both approaches can help us and draw us ever closer to a mystical relationship with paradox, and we'll explore how holding paradox can join us even more intimately with others and to something greater than self. - This pre-recorded webinar includes 90 minutes of content followed by some Q&A. - Purchase includes access to the recording + slides, including research citations when relevant. - This webinar was part of Sarah's 2021 [Neuroscience and Resonance monthly series.](https://sarahpeyton.com/product/the-2021-monthly-webinar-series-package/)Purchase access to the full series for all of the webinars at a discounted price.
