When vaccination protocols are appropriately developed and properly applied, they can be among the most important lifesaving tools. Vaccination is a medical procedure, so oversight of vaccine protocols and specific patient questions should be directed to a veterinarian. Administration of core vaccines to animals prior to or at the time of intake is a critical disease prevention tool in shelters. The [American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) ](https://www.aaha.org/default.aspx)and [American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP)](https://www.catvets.com/) have developed vaccination guidelines for dogs and cats.
