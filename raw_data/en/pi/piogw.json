So, it's that time of SXSW detox... the last few days have been spent catching up... catching up on sleep, emails, laundry, etc. It's also time to go back to the gym on a regular basis, and cut back on the unhealthy chemicals my body has grown accustomed to. But then, there are the movies and music. Since I've spent the last two or three months swimming in movies and music, it's tough to wade through it all now and make sense of it like a normal person. In other words, I'm taking my time watching arthouse films... sticking to Hollywood schlock to kinda balance out my brain. In other words, I've spent the last few months watching very important films, very meaningful films. So my brain doesn't explode and forget the broad spectrum, I'm eyeing a diet of pure cinema candy like Sahara or Guess Who. Don't get me wrong, I also plan to catch Downfall and Best of Youth, I'll just take my time. Hell, I've already seen most of the arthouse films coming soon (Ballad of Jack and Rose, Oldboy, Layer Cake, Kontroll, etc.) because we programmed them. But have I seen Fever Pitch? No, and the Farrelly brothers sound pretty healthy right about now. Meanwhile, on the music front, it's hard not to see a show here and there, despite the onslaught of music we just experienced. I've already purchased way too many CDs (as my \"Five Albums Worth Your Dime\" column will prove), and looking forward to several tours on the horizon. But still, I'm detoxing, and taking it little by little. My first exploration of live music was last night, when I went to Emo's to catch indie-folk duo The Mountain Goats. I ventured down early, despite the fact that I had never heard of the opening band. I'm glad I did. I discovered a fun and infectious group called Crystal Skulls. They put on a snappy set of indie-pop that reminded me of The Long Winters or, at times, The Shins. Their debut, Blocked Numbers, just hit stores and if you're inclined to see bands like Blakc Mountain or the reunited Wedding Present on their national tours next month, do yourself a favor and come early to see Crystal Skulls. You may have a discovery like I did. And it won't even take a detox.
