Numbers in the text and tables may not add up to totals because of rounding.In Chapter 3, savings for most of the nondefense discretionary spending options are estimated in two ways: relative to the freeze variation of the Congressional Budget Office's baseline, referred to asWODI (without discretionary inflation), and relative to the inflation-adjusted version, or WIDI (withdiscretionary inflation). Savings for most of the defense options are estimated relative to programlevels that are assumed to be roughly the same under WODI or WIDI.Preface This volume\u2014part of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) annual re port to the House and Senate Committees on the Budget\u2014is intended to help inform policymakers aboutoptions for the federal budget. The report has two main components. First, it discusses some major proposals to increase spending or cut taxes that have been prompted by the emergenceof large budget surpluses. Second, it presents some 250 specific policy options to reduce spendingor increase revenues in a wide variety of programs; those options could be used to offset the cost ofnew initiatives, maintain budgetary discipline, reorder priorities, or accomplish other goals. The broad proposals and specific policy options come from many sources. In keeping with CBO's mandate to provide objective and impartial analysis, the discussion of each proposal oroption presents the cases for and against it. The inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposal oroption does not represent an endorsement or rejection by CBO. As a nonpartisan Congressionalstaff agency, CBO does not make recommendations about policy. The report begins with an introduction that discusses the debate over surpluses and explains how to use the proposals and options. Part One of the volume examines a range of major policyinitiatives for increasing spending (Chapter 1) or cutting taxes (Chapter 2) that have been promi-nent in the public debate. Part Two summarizes around 190 specific options for reducing spending(Chapter 3) and about 60 specific options for increasing revenues (Chapter 4). The spendingoptions in Chapter 3 are organized by the functional categories of the budget\u2014national defense;international affairs; general science, space, and technology; and so on. Each functional categoryis introduced by a page of background data and information about recent trends within that func-tion. The report concludes with an appendix listing the scorekeeping guidelines used to enforce thediscretionary spending limits and pay-as-you-go requirement of the Budget Enforcement Act of1990 (as amended). All divisions of the Congressional Budget Office contributed to this report, which was coordi- nated by Arlene Holen. Sandy Davis wrote the introduction.

Eligibility for Social Security and the Earnings Test .......... 1 9 Introduction As the 21st century begins, the Congress con- fronts a fiscal environment that has changeddramatically in a short period of time. For nearly three decades, lawmakers fought persistent defi-cits. Over the past three years, those deficits have dis-appeared and been replaced with large and growingsurpluses. The surprising speed with which those sur-pluses have emerged\u2014and the bright budget and eco-nomic outlook under which they are projected to grow\u2014has caused a major shift in the public and politicaldebate over federal budget policy. The budget debate is no longer dominated by ini- tiatives to reduce the deficit; it is now focused on vari-ous alternatives for using projected surpluses. In gen-eral, that debate involves the extent to which projectedsurpluses should be devoted to paying down publicdebt or used to increase spending and lower taxes.Many lawmakers have concluded that any spendingincreases or tax cuts should not exceed the amount ofprojected on-budget surpluses\u2014that is, excluding theportion of the surplus attributable to Social Security(which accounts for nearly all off-budget spending andrevenues). Social Security surpluses would be used toreduce public debt. Yet the recent turnaround in federal fiscal for- tunes remains uncertain. The budget projections gen-erally do not show large on-budget surpluses untillater years, when the current outlook is the most un-sure. Those surpluses are also based in part on as-sumptions about future levels of total discretionaryspending that may be difficult to attain. 1 A significantdownturn in the economy, or other unforeseen events, could further reduce or even eliminate surpluses anddrive the budget back into deficit. 2 Limiting the cost of new policy initiatives to the amount of on-budget surpluses may prove difficult.The major policy initiatives to increase spending orlower taxes that have been most actively debatedwould involve significant sums of money. Even rela-tively modest spending increases or tax cuts couldsubstantially reduce projected surpluses. If the fiscal outlook remains bright and surpluses are realized as projected, lawmakers will still facebudgetary choices and trade-offs and may decide toreorder federal budgetary priorities. No amount ofbudget surplus justifies waste and inefficiency. Citi-zens should expect value for their tax dollar and a taxburden that is not excessive. In this fiscal environment, it is useful for law- makers to be informed about the range of major bud-get options and choices that they now face. Accord-ingly, this volume has two broad purposes. Part Oneillustrates the possible scope and effect of some of thebroad policy proposals to increase spending or cuttaxes that are now being offered and vigorously de-bated. Part Two provides specific policy options thatlawmakers may adopt to help offset the cost of thosenew initiatives, maintain budgetary discipline, or re-order priorities. 1. Discretionary spending is provided anew each year in a ppropriation acts. It accounts for about one-third of total spending. The remainingtwo-thirds, known as mandatory (or direct) spending, is controlled byother laws that generally are permanent.2. For further discussion about the uncertainty of budget projections, see Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2001-2010 (January 2000), Chapter 5.2 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 The Changing Fiscal Environment The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that fiscal year 2000 will mark the first time since themid-1920s that the federal government will recordgrowing total budget surpluses for three consecutiveyears. The total surplus for 2000, estimated at about$180 billion, would be the largest in history in nominaldollars and the largest since 1951 as a percentage ofgross domestic product (GDP). CBO projects that under current policies and as- sumptions about the economy, total budget surpluseswill grow dramatically over the coming decade andwill total between $3.1 trillion and $4.2 trillion, de-pending on assumptions about the path of discretion-ary spending (see Table 1). 3 Between 2007 and 2009, those surpluses would be large enough to pay off allpublicly held federal debt that is available for redemp-tion. 4 CBO's projections also include growing on- budget surpluses that total between $0.8 trillion and$1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. The off-budgetsurpluses of the Social Security trust funds are pro-jected to total about $2.3 trillion during that period. The projected on-budget surpluses assume spending restraint as well as high levels of tax re-ceipts. Surpluses at the higher end of the range ($1.9trillion over 10 years) assume that the statutory limitson discretionary spending are adhered to through2002\u2014which has not been the case for the past twoyears\u2014or that discretionary spending is frozen at thecurrent level with no adjustment for inflation (a cut inreal resources of over 20 percent by 2010). Surplusesat the lower end ($0.8 trillion over 10 years) assume that discretionary spending grows at an average an-nual rate of 2.7 percent. All surplus projections as-sume no changes in mandatory spending or tax laws,which means in part that some tax breaks that are rou-tinely extended are assumed to expire. Revenues areprojected to remain near historically high levels overthe next 10 years, averaging just below 20 percent ofGDP each year. CBO's budget projections are based on economic forecasts that could turn out worse than expected andon budget policies that are likely to change. Alterna-tive economic assumptions that are also reasonablewould produce surpluses that differ from CBO's pro-jections by hundreds of billions of dollars a year sev-eral years from now. Substantial spending increasesor tax cuts, in the absence of offsetting savings, wouldfurther erode those surpluses. Such changes couldalso make it more difficult to continue paying downfederal debt and to comply with current budget en-forcement procedures. Paying Down Debt Reducing federal debt increases national saving andthereby promotes the economic growth that will beneeded to help meet the long-term budgetary chal-lenges facing the nation. Surpluses that are lower thanthe levels assumed in CBO's baseline variations wouldmake it harder to deal with those long-term budgetaryproblems. Despite the favorable budget outlook over the next decade, budgetary pressures linked to the aging ofthe baby-boom generation loom just beyond that 10-year horizon. For example, about 3.4 workers arenow paying taxes to support each Social Security ben-eficiary. In 2030, that ratio will drop to about 2 work-ers for each beneficiary and is expected to decline fur-ther after 2030. 5 Those and other, related trends could drive the budget back into deficit after 2010 and leadto serious fiscal problems in the future. The timingand magnitude of those long-term fiscal pressures are3. Because discretionary spending is provided anew each year (and for other reasons), projecting its possible future path is more difficult thanprojecting mandatory spending and tax receipts, for which permanentlaws generally are in place. CBO's current projections include threevariations for discretionary spending\u2014levels adjusted for inflationafter 2000, levels frozen at the total enacted for 2000, and levels equalto CBO's estimates of the statutory limits on discretionary spending for2001 and 2002 and adjusted for inflation thereafter. See CBO's re- port The Budget and Economic Outlook , pp. 2-5. 4. Ibid., Table 1-5. Paying off available public debt does not mean that there will be no federal debt in circulation. For example, some out-standing debt with longer maturities will not be available for redemp- tion during the 2001-2010 period. For further discussion, see The Budget and Economic Outlook , p. 19. 5.

Government debt, which wouldbe essentially eliminated with currently projected sur-pluses, may serve a special function in the economy byproviding an asset free of default risk. The loss ofsuch an asset could increase costs for some financialintermediaries and could impose a burden on privateinvestors. Yet despite those concerns, saving the sur-plus would yield significant benefits. The main gainsfrom higher national saving would be a modestlyhigher level of income and wealth over the next 10years and a larger stock of capital and wealth, all ofwhich would help finance the coming costs of the babyboomers' retirement consumption and health care cov- erage. The effects of saving the surplus depend on thebalance between those current costs and future bene-fits. Complying with Budget Enforcement Procedures The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established lim- its on total discretionary spending and a pay-as-you-go(PAYGO) requirement for new legislation affectingmandatory spending or revenues. Under those proce-dures, legislation that would increase baseline deficitsor lower baseline surpluses generally must be offset.The discretionary spending limits and PAYGO re-quirement, which were extended most recently in theBalanced Budget Act of 1997, are scheduled to expireafter 2002. 6. For a discussion of the long-term budget outl ook, see Congressional Budget Office, The Long-Term Budget Outlook: An Update (Decem- ber 14, 1999), available at www.cbo. gov.4 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 For fiscal years 1999 and 2000, lawmakers have enacted total appropriations well in excess of the capsthat were set in 1997. For example, they have enactedrecord amounts of emergency appropriations\u2014about$30 billion each year\u2014for which the caps are adjustedautomatically. Because emergency spending, advanceappropriations, and other devices have been used toenact higher levels of discretionary spending, manylawmakers question whether the caps are still an effec-tive budgetary discipline. For example, CBO esti-mates that discretionary outlays for 2000 exceed theoutlay caps for 2001 by about $25 billion. 7 The CBO baseline variation that projects total discretionaryspending at capped levels implies deep cuts in currentdiscretionary spending programs. Some lawmakers are proposing that a portion of the projected on-budget surpluses be used to increasethe current caps and to set new caps for future years.For example, the President has proposed in his fiscalyear 2001 budget to increase the current caps and setnew caps through 2010. 8 Regardless of whether or how the discretionary caps are revised, proposals thatwould produce budgetary savings are still likely to beneeded to meet those caps or to hold discretionaryspending within any of the three alternative versions ofCBO's baseline. In particular, proposals to substan-tially increase funding for high-priority discretionaryprograms, such as education and defense, may have tobe offset with savings elsewhere in the budget. Reordering Priorities and Improving Federal Programs Budgeting involves making choices among competing priorities. Although large surpluses may widen thepolicy options available to lawmakers, they do not bythemselves justify more resources for federal pro-grams or other activities that are ineffective, ineffi-cient, or unnecessary. For example, under GPRA (theGovernment Performance and Results Act of 1993),federal agencies must now report on their strategicgoals and program performance as part of the Presi- dent's budget. Lawmakers may use that informationto help reorder priorities and improve federal pro-grams. Options to cut spending may also help achieve policy or programmatic goals for which enacting sav-ings is not the only or even the primary concern. Forexample, some options in this volume could be used toreduce the size of government, limit its rate of growth,or scale back activities for which a federal role isquestioned. Other options would enable lawmakers toeliminate programs that may have outlived their use-fulness, may have achieved the purposes for whichthey were created, or might be better performed out-side the federal government. Using This Volume Part One of this volume provides background on and ageneral discussion of a range of major policy initia-tives for increasing spending or cutting taxes that havebeen considered by lawmakers and that have beenprominent in the public debate. Part Two summarizesspecific options for reducing spending or increasingrevenues. A companion CBO volume discusses op-tions to increase funding for defense programs. Thatreport also includes the options for defense savingsthat appear in Part Two of this volume. Part One The set of proposals outlined in Part One is not com-prehensive. Rather, it includes major proposals thathave been actively debated and that would signifi-cantly change federal spending or taxes and be rela-tively complicated to carry out. Proposals for increas-ing spending, which are discussed in Chapter 1, in-clude expanding and reforming Medicare, subsidizingthe purchase of health insurance for people under age65, increasing the adequacy of financing for long-termcare services, and expanding federal funding for alllevels of education. The chapter also discusses waysto increase retirement income and maintain adequatefinancing for Social Security. Proposals for cuttingtaxes, which are discussed in Chapter 2, include 7.

See, for example, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2001: Analytical Perspectives , p. 286.INTRODUCTION 5 broad-based reductions; more narrowly focused cuts intended to reduce existing disincentives or to create orstrengthen incentives affecting work, saving, and mar-riage; and changes that would simplify the tax systemor encourage greater compliance. Part One provides background and perspective on the various proposals, evaluates their possiblescope and effect, and indicates the magnitude of possi-ble budgetary effects. Unlike Part Two, which pres-ents specific options, Part One does not include de-tailed cost estimates. Instead, it is intended to providecontext for lawmakers and others as the budget debateproceeds. Part Two Part Two presents specific spending and revenue op-tions (in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively) that wouldproduce budgetary savings. Spending options are cat-egorized according to the functional categories of thebudget\u2014national defense (050), international affairs(150), general science, space, and tec hnology (250), and so on. Each spending option is further identifiedas affecting either mandatory or discretionary spend-ing. For each function, an introductory page providessummary information and data for the past 10 yearson overall trends in mandatory and discretionaryspending within that function. The options are numbered individually and in- clude, where appropriate, references to related optionsin the volume and to relevant CBO publications.Spending options are numbered beginning with thenumber for the functional category within which theyare grouped. For example, defense spending optionsare numbered 050-01, 050-02, and so on. Closelyrelated options are grouped together under a singlenumber, with individual options identified by a lettersuffix. (For example, 050-01-A and 050-01-B bothcut strategic nuclear force levels.) For each option, the volume provides some gen- eral background, discusses the pros and cons of theproposal, and estimates the annual budgetary savings(that is, the cut in spending or the increase in reve-nues) for the 2001-2005 period. Cumulative savingsare summed both for that five-year period and for the 10-year period that ends in 2010. The projected savings for mandatory spending and revenue options are computed from baseline levelsestimated to occur under current law. 9 Savings for discretionary spending options are calculated from twobaseline levels: the level appropriated for 2000 (theso-called freeze level) and the 2000 level adjusted forinflation. Savings for most defense options are esti-mated relative to program levels that are assumed tobe roughly the same under the freeze or the inflation-adjusted baseline variation. Therefore, only one set ofsavings estimates appears with each defense option. In the nondefense spending options, the freeze variation is referred to as WODI (without discretion-ary inflation) and the inflation-adjusted version asWIDI (with discretionary inflation). The narrativediscussion of each option uses the savings from thefreeze (WODI) level as the basis for analysis. New orincreased fees may be classified as offsets to spending(offsetting receipts or collections) or as new revenues(governmental receipts). 10 The Interactive Volume An interactive version of this volume is available onCBO's Web site (www.cbo.gov) in HTML. That ver-sion allows users to search the specific spending andrevenue options in Part Two in four ways, singly or incombination: 9. For cost estimates of legislation that amends the Internal Revenue Code, CBO is required by law to use estimates provided by the JointCommittee on Taxation. JCT estimated the increased revenue thatwould be collected as a result of all but two of the options in Chapter 4(REV-18 and REV-19). CBO prepared the estimates for those twooptions. In addition, the estimated reductions in revenue proposalsdescribed in Chapter 2 were developed by CBO and should be viewedas approximate. 10. The term \"user fee\" is not a formal budget category. It is an informal term that generally refers to collections from individuals or entitiesthat benefit from or are regulated by some federal program, and thecollections are used solely to support that program. In general, if thefee supports a business-type activity, it is classified as an offset tospending. If it is based on the government's sovereign power to tax, itis classified as a revenue. User fees classified as spending offsets maybe further classified as either mandatory or discretionary, dependinggenerally on the type of spending legislation in which the fee is in-cluded.6 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 o By type of option (spending\u2014by budget func- tion\u2014or revenue), o By spending category (discretionary or manda- tory), o By agency (the federal agency whose programs would be affected by the option), and o By word or phrase.For example, a user could search for all options re- lated to natural resources and the environment (budgetfunction 300) that affect discretionary spending; alloptions that would produce savings in mandatoryspending within the Department of Health and HumanServices; all options that deal with submarines; or alloptions that eliminate something (a program, somekind of assistance, or some other key factor). Exclusions and Limitations The broad budgetary proposals and specific optionsdiscussed in this volume stem from various sources.They are derived from legislative proposals, the Presi-dent's budget, past CBO options volumes, Congres-sional and CBO staff, other government entities, andprivate groups. The proposals and options are in-tended to reflect a range of possibilities; they are nei-ther ranked nor comprehensive. The inclusion or ex-clusion of a particular proposal or option does not rep-resent an endorsement or rejection by CBO. As a non-partisan Congressional staff agency, CBO does notmake policy recommendations. The specific options in Chapters 3 and 4 exclude policy changes that are not counted under the BudgetEnforcement Act (BEA). For example, options thatwould affect off-budget programs (Social Security andthe Postal Service), fully fund existing commitmentsfor deposit insurance, or provide for the sale of federalassets that result in net costs to the federal governmentare not included. 11The savings options are also intended to facilitate the case-by-case review of individual programs. Theytherefore exclude certain types of governmentwide op-tions that would produce savings in many programs oragencies. Such options would, for example, freezespending across the board, eliminate an entire depart-ment or major agency, or make an across-the-boardcut in federal salaries. Savings for such options can-not always be reliably estimated because the optionsmay affect numerous programs and may simply resultin a shift in spending among programs or accounts.Moreover, such options cut effective and ineffectiveprograms alike. Some of the options affecting states, localities, or the private sector may involve federal mandates. TheUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 establishesprocedures that are intended to control such mandates.It also requires CBO to estimate the costs to states andlocalities of any mandates imposed by new legislationthat the Congress is considering. Individual options inthis volume do not include estimates of any potentialmandates. The calculations of savings for individual options do not include savings in federal interest costs. Inter-est savings are typically estimated as part of a com-prehensive budget plan, such as the Congressionalbudget resolution, but such adjustments are usuallynot made for individual options of the type discussedin this volume. Subsequent CBO cost estimates, which generally accompany any bill reported by a Congressional com-mittee, may not match the savings estimates shown inthis report. The policy proposals on which the costestimates are based may differ slightly from the speci-fications used in developing the options. Further, thebudget baseline estimates or levels against which theproposals ultimately are measured may have been up-dated and thus would differ from those used here. 11. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) changed the treatment of asset sales under the Budget Enforcement Act. Previously, asset saleswere not counted for any purpose under the BEA. Guidelines for cal-culating the net cost of an asset sale are included in the BEAscorekeeping guidelines set forth most recently in the BBA conference report; see U.S. House of Representatives, Balanced Budget Act of 1997, conference report to accompany H.R. 2015, Report 105-217 (July 30, 1997), p. 1012.INTRODUCTION 7 Scorekeeping Guidelines The Budget Enforcement Act included scorekeeping guidelines to ensure that the budgetary effects of legis-lation are measured consistently and in accord withstandard conventions. Those guidelines are revisedand updated periodically and were printed most re-cently in the conference report accompanying the Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997. (The scorekeeping guide-lines are reprinted in the appendix of this volume.)Among other things, they specify how to score assetsales and lease purchases and how to treat legislation that crosses between the discretionary spending andPAYGO enforcement categories. The guidelines, however, are subject to interpre- tation, and CBO and the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) sometimes view them differently.Those differing interpretations may affect how certainoptions are counted under BEA procedures. OMBestimates are final for the purpose of BEA enforce-ment. CBO estimates are advisory under the BEA butgenerally are used in the Congressional budget pro-cess. Part One Chapter One Expanding the Scope of Federal Activities Every year, policymakers weigh the benefits and costs of undertaking new federal initiatives orexpanding the scope of current programs. They also review existing spending and revenue options.With the recent dramatic change in the fiscal outlook\u2014from projections of persistent deficits to ones oflarge and growing surpluses\u2014policymakers are nowconsidering more ambitious initiatives than they mayhave in the past. Some of the proposals that have beenwidely discussed would greatly expand federal activi-ties, affecting millions of people and costing billions ofdollars. Other proposals, though more modest, couldalso have a significant impact on the economy andsociety in general. This chapter analyzes some general themes for expanding the scope of federal activities that have re-ceived considerable public attention in recent months.Those themes include: o Expanding Medicare benefits while ensuring the long-term financial health of the program; o Increasing income for the elderly and preserving Social Security for future generations; o Raising the number of people who have health insurance coverage; o Improving the financing of long-term care ser- vices for the elderly; and o Expanding federal support for education at all levels, from preschool through college.The discussion in this chapter is intended to pro- vide a broad perspective on several issues, includingthe nature of the policy problem, the extent of currentfederal programs, and the approaches that have beenproposed to expand federal funding or involvement.Because the number of specific options that have beenproposed is large, the chapter does not reflect a com-prehensive set of proposals. Nor does this chapterprovide detailed cost estimates; instead, it discussesthe principles and major factors that would influencethe costs of any specific proposal. The inclusion or exclusion of a particular pro- posal does not imply an endorsement or rejection ofthat proposal by the Congressional Budget Office. Asa nonpartisan Congressional staff agency, CBO does not make policy recommendations. Medicare Medicare, which is the second largest entitlement pro-gram after Social Security, provides health insurancecoverage to people who are aged or disabled. In 2000,the federal government will spend about $220 billionto finance the health care of 39 million beneficiaries.Medicare spending has grown dramatically since theprogram began more than three decades ago, and thatgrowth has been of increasing concern to policy-makers. Between 1975 and 1995, Medicare spendinggrew faster than the economy, rising from 1.1 percentof gross domestic product to a 2.6 percent share.12 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Following years of rapid growth, spending for Medicare has slowed considerably in the past fewyears. Indeed, spending was actually lower in fiscalyear 1999 than in 1998. Likely reasons for the slow-down include the cost-reducing provisions of the Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997 and the reactions of provid-ers to enhanced federal efforts to combat billing errorsand fraud. Although the slowdown is a temporaryphenomenon, projected baseline spending (net of pre-mium receipts) for Medicare in fiscal year 2000 isnow $5.5 billion, or 2.7 percent, below the levels thatCBO projected as recently as last summer. The good fiscal news has not been limited to Medicare. According to current projections, the fed-eral budget will have a surplus in each year of the 10-year budget window. If discretionary spending in-creases at the rate of inflation, the on-budget sur-pluses, which exclude Social Security and the PostalService, are projected to total more than $800 billionover the 2001-2010 period. Those fiscal developments have led to a greater focus on proposals to expand Medicare benefits, par-ticularly to add coverage for outpatient prescriptiondrugs and limit out-of-pocket expenses for beneficia-ries. Medicare beneficiaries often incur substantialcosts for prescription drugs, and many of them havelittle or no insurance protecti on. Moreover, unlike typical private insurance plans, Medicare does not capbeneficiaries' cost-sharing liabilities, leaving themwithout financial protection against high costs for ser-vices that the program covers. Last year, the Bipartisan Commission on the Fu- ture of Medicare considered a number of ways to ad-dress those two deficiencies, although it reached noagreement on recommendations. The President hasproposed a new prescription drug benefit for Medi-care, as have several Members of Congress, andothers have developed alternative proposals to havethe program provide a more comprehensive set of ben-efits. Concerns have been raised, however, that pro- posals to expand Medicare benefits could exacerbatethe program's long-term financing problem. The lead-ing edge of the baby-boom population will becomeeligible for Medicare in 2011, and program costs arecertain to increase rapidly thereafter under currentlaw. Demand for Medicare services will grow dramat- ically over the next few decades, while the number ofpeople in the labor force will grow much more slowly.Between 2000 and 2030, for example, the number ofMedicare beneficiaries will almost double, comparedwith an expected increase of about 13 percent in thenumber of workers paying payroll taxes. For that rea-son, some fundamental reform of Medicare's financingmay be necessary whether benefits are expanded ornot. One such reform is the premium-support pro-posal that members of the Bipartisan Commission de-veloped last year. Expanding Benefits Compared with the typical health insurance plan of-fered by employers, Medicare's benefit package is lim-ited in important ways. The program covers basicservices\u2014hospital stays, postacute care, physicians'services, and other outpatient care\u2014but it does notcover other services that are important in the treatmentof disease. Perhaps the most notable omission is cov-erage for outpatient prescription drugs, which repre-sent a significant expense for many beneficiaries. In1996, over 10 percent of the cost of health services fornoninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries, or about$25 billion, was spending on prescription drugs. Al-most half of that cost was paid for out of pocket ratherthan through some type of insurance coverage. Beneficiaries are potentially liable for significant costs even for the services covered by Medicare. Forexample, beneficiaries must pay a deductible equal to$776 in 2000 for an inpatient hospital stay, and hospi-tal stays of more than 60 days require a substantialcopayment. Care in skilled nursing facilities is alsosubject to substantial copayments after the first 20days. Most outpatient services are subject to a $100annual deductible, after which the patient is responsi-ble for 20 percent of covered expenses (plus any addi-tional amount that the physician is allowed to charge). In part because Medicare leaves beneficiaries at risk for very large out-of-pocket costs, most benefici-aries seek some kind of supplementary coveragethrough employment-sponsored retiree health plans,private medigap plans, health maintenance organiza-tions (HMOs), or Medicaid (for those whose incomeCHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 13 and assets are low enough to qualify). But such a patchwork arrangement generates a number of prob-lems. First, it leaves unprotected a group of peoplewho do not qualify for Medicaid or coverage under aretiree health plan and who cannot afford a privatesupplement. Second, the coverage available from pri-vate supplements is eroding. The share of employersoffering health coverage to their retirees has been de-clining in recent years, and the supplementary benefitsoffered by HMOs are also being cut back in responseto lower payment rates from Medicare. Further, be-cause most medigap plans do not offer coverage fordrugs, those that do so experience adverse selection(attracting enrollees who are more costly than aver-age), resulting in such high premiums that few medi-gap enrollees purchase those plans. Third, the costs ofadministering insurance supplements are high becauseof the need to market to individuals and to coordinatebenefit payments with Medicare. Making Medicare's coverage more comprehen- sive would reduce or eliminate the need for privateinsurance supplements, but it would also mean thatsome of the costs now paid by beneficiaries, their em-ployers, or state Medicaid agencies would be paid byMedicare. Expanding Medicare's benefits would alsoprobably slow the shift of enrollment from Medicare'sfee-for-service sector to risk-based Medicare+Choiceplans because those plans are currently one low-costway in which enrollees can supplement Medicare'scoverage. It might also accelerate the decline inemployer-sponsored retiree health benefits. Covering Prescription Drugs . The President has proposed adding a drug benefit to Medicare. In theproposal first presented last summer (and included inthe President's fiscal year 2001 budget), the benefitwould be offered under a new Medicare program\u2014Part D. The new program would pay 50 percent ofenrollees' total drug costs, up to a maximum annualbenefit that would eventually reach $2,500. Peopleenrolling in Part D would pay a premium set to coverhalf of Medicare's cost for the new benefit. The value of the Part D benefit would depend on how much an enrollee spent on prescription drugs.For example, someone whose total drug spending was$5,000 when the program was fully phased in wouldpay $2,500, and the program would pay the remain-der. Enrollees whose total drug spending exceeded$5,000 would pay all of the costs above that amount. Last year, CBO estimated that the President's pre-scription drug proposal would add about $7 billion toMedicare's net costs in 2002, its initial year of opera-tion. Annual costs of the drug proposal would in-crease to $26 billion in fiscal year 2009. 1 Because benefits would be paid from the first dollar of an enrollee's spending on drugs, the Presi-dent's proposal would provide some benefit to nearly85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries if all of themchose to enroll. However, because benefits paid toany given enrollee would be capped, Part D wouldleave those with the largest drug expenditures\u2014about20 percent of enrollees\u2014unprotected once they spent$5,000. Although the cap on benefits would enableMedicare to better control costs for Part D, it wouldalso limit the protection enrollees would have fromlarge out-of-pocket costs. Part D enrollees could be offered better insurance protection, but that would impose greater financialrisks for Medicare. One option would provide fewerbenefits to enrollees whose drug costs were low andgreater protection to those whose costs were high. Forexample, a deductible could be required for enrollees'drug costs, but the benefit cap could also be eliminatedso that Part D would pay 50 percent of all drug costsabove the deductible. The deductible would have to bequite large, however, for that option to have federalcosts that were no greater than those of the President'sproposal. A 50 percent coinsurance rate would give en- rollees in Part D a strong incentive to be price-con-scious. Other, more generous options could weakenthat sensitivity to drug prices, which might loosenwhatever pricing restraints drug manufacturers nowface; if so, that could substantially increase federalcosts for the new benefit. An example of such an op-tion would be one that eliminated any further costsharing for enrollees who spent more than a specificamount during the year. 1. See the statement of Dan L. Crippen, Director, Congressional Budget Office, before the Senate Committee on Finance, July 22, 1999. ThePresident's 2001 budget includes a prescription drug benefit thatwould begin in 2003, a year later than previously proposed.14 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Although competition among manufacturers might hold down prices for drugs that have genericequivalents or therapeutic substitutes, many new andunique drugs are patented and are protected from suchcompetition. The price of those drugs could risesharply if Medicare offered an unrestricted drug bene-fit. In that case, new mechanisms might ultimately beneeded to control program costs. Such mechanismsmight include giving administrators the power to denycoverage of some new drugs if they were too expen-sive or limiting the prices that drug manufacturers ini-tially charge for new drugs. Capping Cost-Sharing Requirements . Medicare provides substantial protection for millions of benefi-ciaries against the cost of health care services. But theinsurance protection Medicare now provides againsthigh out-of-pocket costs could be significantly im-proved if its cost-sharing requirements for currentlycovered services were limited to a maximum annualamount for each enrollee. Such stop-loss protection istypical in private insurance plans. Adding stop-loss protection would increase Medicare's costs unless other aspects of the programwere modified. For example, if enrollees' cost-sharingexpenses were capped at $2,000 in 2001 with no otherchanges in current law, Medicare's net costs for theyear would be about 6 percent higher. One option tolimit costs would be to increase the cost-sharing re-quirements that Medicare beneficiaries would pay un-til they met an annual cap on those expenses. Com-bining the new stop-loss protection with the cost-shar-ing requirements described in Chapter 3 in option570-13-A, for instance, would lower Medicare spend-ing by about 1 percent in 2001. That alternative mightbe unpopular, though, because 70 percent of all bene-ficiaries would face somewhat higher cost-sharing ex-penses whereas only 10 percent would have their cost-sharing expenses fall because of the stop-loss protec-tion. Long-Term Reform A booming economy and the prospect of large federalbudget surpluses, in part because of the recent slow-down in Medicare spending, have given policymakersconfidence that the program will be adequately fi-nanced over the next decade. But over the long term, Medicare spending will grow much faster than the restof the economy. Medicare costs will increase dramatically after 2010, when the first of the baby boomers reach age65. The number of beneficiaries will double over thenext 30 years, and the growth rate of costs per benefi-ciary witnessed in the past may well accelerate withthe aging of the Medicare population and continuingimprovements in medical practice and technology. If a balance between spending pressures and rev- enues is to be maintained in the long term, policy ac-tions must be taken. Those actions might include op-tions to increase premium revenues, change eligibilityconditions to reduce the number of beneficiaries, orreduce costs per beneficiary. Near-term examples foreach of those approaches are discussed in Chapter 3.This section discusses more fundamental long-termreform of the Medicare program. The most direct way to maintain the balance be- tween Medicare spending and federal revenues wouldbe to move from the current defined benefit program,which mandates a broad set of benefits and providesunlimited federal contributions, to a defined contribu-tion approach. Such a plan would limit the federalcontribution to Medicare, allowing that contribution togrow at some rate that could be sustained in the longrun (such as the growth rate of the overall economy).If the total cost of Medicare-covered services grewfaster than the federal contribution, those additionalcosts would be borne by beneficiaries rather than bytaxpayers. Since beneficiaries typically are not working and have limited income, a defined contribution approachwould sharply limit the financing available for healthcare. Unless other program changes were institutedthat increased the efficiency of Medicare providers andthus slowed the growth in costs, some beneficiariescould ultimately have difficulty paying for basic Medi-care services under such an approach. An alternative to a defined contribution plan would be to shift some risk to beneficiaries while in-troducing mechanisms that would encourage moreprice competition among plans and providers. ACHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 15 premium-support mechanism, like the one developed by members of the Bipartisan Commission on the Fu-ture of Medicare, is one example. Important elementsof such a plan for Medicare would include: o Multiple plans in each geographic area, each of- fering at least the basic Medicare benefit pack-age. All plans would compete for enrollment onthe basis of price, quality, and (perhaps) benefitsbeyond the basic package. o A contribution by Medicare to each enrollee's plan premium. The contribution could be set ator somewhat below the premium for the lowest-cost plan in each geographic area, or at someaverage of the premiums of the low-cost plans. Under this approach, beneficiaries would be able to enroll in at least one plan for which they would payno more than a modest premium. Because beneficia-ries would pay the full additional premium of a moreexpensive plan, they would have a financial incentiveto seek out low-cost plans. Competition among plansfor enrollment would help induce plans to provide ade-quate service at the lowest cost possible. If Medi-care's current fee-for-service plan was to continue, itwould have to compete for enrollment on the samebasis as private plans; otherwise, enrollees' incentiveto seek out low-cost plans would be diluted. How effective the premium-support approach would be in reducing growth in Medicare costs overthe long term is uncertain. For one thing, the ap-proach could not be implemented in areas where theMedicare population was too small to support multipleplans. In such areas, the traditional fee-for-serviceplan might have to be retained, and reforms to makethat plan more efficient would also be important.Even in areas populous enough to support competingplans, extensive regulatory oversight would probablybe necessary to ensure that plans were competingfairly, that enrollees were well informed, and that ac-cess and quality of care were maintained. Finally, it isunclear whether managed competition causes only aone-time reduction in cost for each enrollee whomoves from fee-for-service care to a more efficientmanaged care plan or whether it can also slow costgrowth once all beneficiaries who will switch to man-aged care have done so.Social Security This year, the Social Security program will pay about$400 billion in benefits to about 45 million retired anddisabled workers, their families, and their survivors.Nearly all workers and their employers now pay So-cial Security payroll taxes, and most people over age65 (as well as many younger people) receive monthlybenefits from the program. This section presents basicinformation about the Social Security program and itsfinancial outlook. It also examines several approachesthe Congress could take in the near term to increasethe income of the elderly. Any approach taken in theshort term that increased the federal government's to-tal financial commitments, however, could make thelong-term budget problem more difficult to fix. Thissection concludes with a brief review of the proposalsbeing discussed for funding Social Security over thelong term. The Social Security Budget Story in Brief Social Security is, by far, the federal government's largest program, playing a critical role in supportingthe standard of living of its beneficiaries. In recentyears, people age 65 or older received about 40 per-cent of their cash income from Social Security. El-derly people whose cash income was relatively lowwere particularly reliant on Social Security. Familieswho had at least one member collecting Social Secu-rity benefits and who were in the lowest incomequintile of elderly families received almost 90 percentof their income from Social Security, compared withonly 25 percent for those in the highest incomequintile. Short-Term Budget Outlook . Spending for Social Security has been growing at roughly the same pace asthe overall economy in recent years and will continueto do so throughout the next decade. The share of theeconomy devoted to Social Security has been between4 percent and 5 percent of gross domestic product(GDP) for the past quarter of a century and is ex-pected to remain below 5 percent until 2013, accord-16 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 ing to the Social Security Administration.2 Mean- while, revenues from Social Security payroll taxeshave increased rapidly as the economy booms. TheCongressional Budget Office projects that Social Se-curity revenues will exceed program outlays by be-tween $150 billion and $300 billion in each of the next10 years. 3 Long-Term Budget Problem . Once large numbers of the baby-boom generation begin receiving benefits,spending on Social Security (as well as on other pro-grams for the elderly) will consume an increasingshare of national income. The Social Security pro-gram's trustees project that under the current benefitstructure, total spending will rise to almost 7 percentof GDP in 2030. The expected increase in Social Security spend- ing as a share of GDP results from the aging of thepopulation born during the 1946-1964 baby boom. Asthat cohort retires and becomes eligible for Social Se-curity benefits (starting in 2008), the ratio of benefi-ciaries to workers is expected to surge. By 2030,there will be 48 beneficiaries per 100 workers coveredby Social Security, compared with only 30 today, ac-cording to estimates from the Social Security Adminis-tration. The number of beneficiaries is expected toincrease somewhat faster than the number of workersthereafter, as life spans continue to lengthen. 4 Much attention has been focused on the outlook for the Social Security trust funds. Last year, SocialSecurity tax revenues, together with interest and other intragovernmental payments, exceeded expendituresby about $130 billion, bringing total Social Securitytrust fund balances to almost $900 billion at the end ofDecember 1999. Projections show those balances ris-ing steadily over the next two decades, peaking at $4.5trillion at the beginning of 2022 and then diminishinguntil the balances are exhausted in 2034. Once thefunds are exhausted, the payroll taxes collected for theSocial Security program will equal only about 70 per-cent of benefits owed. But the size of trust fund balances bears no rela- tionship to Social Security's obligations or to the coun-try's ability to fund benefits. Once Social Securitybenefits begin to outstrip payroll tax collections, thefederal government eventually will need to reduce So-cial Security benefits or spending on other federal pro-grams or raise taxes\u2014regardless of the size of thetrust funds. To fulfill the nation's promises to SocialSecurity beneficiaries, the government must acquireresources from existing production when benefits aredue. Actions taken now to increase capital accumula-tion, enhance productivity, and increase work effortcould help build a larger economy in the future, whichin turn would expand the capacity to fund future So-cial Security benefits, other federal commitments, andother claims of the elderly on the economy. Proposals for Increasing Retirement Income Despite the large amount spent on Social Security ben- efits, many elderly people still have low income. Inthe most recent year for which data are available, 1.0million elderly men (7.2 percent of men age 65 orolder) and 2.4 million elderly women ( 12.8 percent) had income below the poverty threshold. 5 Many oth- ers have income slightly over the poverty line. As thenumber of elderly people increases, the number withlow income is likely to rise as well.2.1999 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old- Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds (March 30, 1999), p. 187, and unpublished tables from www.ssa. gov, based on the trustees' intermediate assumptions. 3. Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2001-2010 (January 2000), p. 23. Over 85 percent of the revenues credited to the Social Security trust funds are from pay-roll taxes levied on workers and their employers. Most of the rest isfrom interest received on trust fund balances and from a portion of theincome taxes paid by Social Security beneficiaries whose adjustedgross income is above a specified amount. 4.1999 Annual Report , pp. 62 and 122. The intermediate assumptions in the report are that in 2030, the life expectancy of men who reachage 65 will be 17.1 years and that of women will be 20.2 years. In2000, the life expectancy of men age 65 is 15.8 years, and that ofwomen is 19.2 years. In 1940, soon after the program began, the lifeexpectancies of men and women were only 11.9 years and 13.4 years,respectively. (\"Life expectancy,\" as used here, is the average numberof years of life remaining for a person if that person experienced thedeath rates by age observed in, or assumed for, the selected year.) 5.

Pov-erty rates are particularly high for elderly women who are widowed,divorced, or never married. CHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 17 The Congress could take several approaches in the short run to improve the lives of the elderly by in-creasing their income, particularly for those with lowincome, although that need not be the only goal of fed-eral policies. To help raise the income of the elderly,the government could: o Provide them with more income from Social Se- curity or other public programs once they wereno longer working; o Encourage current workers to save more for their retirement by contributing to pensions, individualretirement accounts (IRAs), or other types ofretirement plans; and o Encourage people to work longer.Numerous proposals in each of those areas have been made in recent years. Increase Benefits . The first approach would be to target additional federal resources toward low-incomeelderly people. The Social Security program alreadydoes so by using a progressive benefit formula throughwhich retired workers with a history of low wages re-ceive benefits that replace a higher percentage of theirpreretirement earnings than the percentage replacedfor other retired workers. The program also basesbenefits for widows on the benefits for which theirhusbands had qualified, if that provides them withhigher benefits than they would receive on the basis oftheir own past earnings. Both of those features couldbe strengthened, or new provisions could be enacted tospecifically focus on beneficiaries with low family in-come. If those provisions were successful, some of theadditional Social Security expenditures would be off-set by reductions in outlays for Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) and other means-tested programs. For example, the \"special minimum benefit\" pro- visions in the current Social Security program couldbe revamped to increase benefits for people whoworked many years at low wages. Fewer than200,000 people receive Social Security benefits underthe current rules for special minimum benefits, and theaverage benefit they receive is below the poverty line. 6 Some Social Security reform plans call for a new pro- vision that would raise the minimum benefit above thepoverty line for retired workers who had worked mostof their adult life at low wages. One problem with trying to modify the Social Security system to strengthen its role in providing ade-quate income to retired workers who would otherwisehave low income is that it is difficult to make suchchanges \"target efficient.\" That is, it is hard to specif-ically focus additional Social Security benefits on peo-ple who are in low-income families. For example,some people who receive low Social Security benefitshave pensions and other sources of retirement incomeor have a spouse who has high benefits. Likewise,although a widow has a much higher likelihood of be-ing poor than does the average elderly person, a policythat focused on improving the benefits of widowscould also help those with higher income as well andcould miss the majority of the low-income elderly. A more direct method of helping low-income el- derly people would be to increase both the numberwho receive SSI and the amount of their monthly ben-efits. This year, that means-tested program will pro-vide over 6 million recipients with almost $30 billionin federal benefits. (In addition, most states supple-ment the federal benefits.) About one-third of thoserecipients are age 65 or older; the others will qualifyon the basis of their disabilities. Many people noweligible for SSI do not participate. Increasing maximum monthly SSI benefits would raise the income of current recipients and could bringother low-income elderly and disabled people into theprogram. (The maximum monthly benefit for an indi-vidual with no other income is currently $512; for acouple, it is $7 69.) Increasing benefits could, of course, substantially add to SSI program costs, espe-cially if more people participated in the program. 6. Social Security Administration, Annual Statistical Supplement, 1999 , p. 197. In December 1998, 154,000 beneficiaries received an averagemonthly benefit of $534. Most of those beneficiaries were retiredworkers, whose average benefit was $556. The annual poverty thresh-old for an elderly person living alone in 1998 was $7,818, or $651 amonth. 18 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Increase Savings . Another approach for increasing the income of the elderly would be to subsidize or oth-erwise encourage or require people to save more fortheir old age. That approach could increase the re-sources available to future retired workers and theirfamilies, but it would not help people who had alreadyretired. The federal government encourages workers to save for their retirement, largely through various taxincentives. For example, workers can receive favor-able tax treatment of earnings that they and their em-ployers put directly into qualified pension plans (suchas the commonly used 401(k) plans). They can alsoreceive favorable tax treatment for money they investin IRAs. 7 Additional incentives could be provided by broadening the eligibility for existing plans, increasingthe amounts that workers can contribute, or develop-ing new types of plans. For example, last year's pro-posal by the Administration to establish UniversalSavings Accounts (USA accounts) would have pro-vided eligible workers with matching contributionsplus a flat contribution for lower-income workers toencourage them to put money into a retirement plan.Several of the proposals for partial privatization of theSocial Security program (discussed below) would alsoencourage or require workers to put money into invest-ment accounts that they could not withdraw before age62. A key issue in assessing any proposal of this sort is whether federal spending (directly or through re-duced revenues) would actually increase overall savingor merely substitute for saving that would have oc-curred without the proposal. The majority of workersalready save something for their retirement throughpension plans, IRAs, and other investments. If thefederal government subsidized or required workers toput aside money in a specific type of plan, they mightput less into other accounts. If such substitution oc-curred, any federal subsidy would reduce federal sav-ing without an offsetting increase in private saving.Proposals that focus the subsidy on workers whoseincome is relatively low would suffer less from thatproblem because those workers are less likely to have pensions and other savings. Increase Employment . Encouraging workers to de- lay retirement would also increase the income of theelderly. At age 62, most workers become eligible forSocial Security benefits and must make two decisions: o Should they continue to work and, if so, how much? o Should they apply for Social Security benefits?Within a year of becoming eligible for benefits, a ma- jority of workers have stopped working (or substan-tially reduced their earnings) and a majority have filedfor benefits. One consequence of those actions is thatmost of those workers subsequently have a smallerincome than they would have had if they had post-poned retirement. For example, workers who stopworking and begin collecting benefits at age 62 receivemonthly Social Security benefits that are at least 20percent below the amount they would receive if theydelayed retirement and receipt of benefits until age 65.Moreover, if they instead continued to work, feweryears of retirement would need to be financed out ofwhatever private savings they had already accumu-lated, and they might be able to save more for theirretirement. Likewise, the size of any private pensionsthey had might increase somewhat. (The relevant So-cial Security rules are described in Box 1.) One way of encouraging people to work longer would be to eliminate Social Security's retirementearnings test so that people could begin to collect So-cial Security benefits at age 62 while they continued towork. Under current law, retirement benefits are re-duced by $1 for each $2 that beneficiaries under age65 earn above a specified threshold ($10,080 in 2000)and by $1 for each $3 that beneficiaries ages 65 to 69earn above a higher threshold ($17,000 in 2000). Al-though those workers can later receive substantiallyhigher monthly benefits as a consequence of that re-duction, many people apparently are not aware of thatand treat it as a simple benefit reduction. As a result,some people either stop working before they wouldhave in the absence of the retirement earnings test or,at least, keep their earnings below the threshold. 7. Provisions in the tax code that include incentives to save are discussed in Chapter 2.CHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 19 Box 1. Eligibility for Social Security and the Earnings Test Workers can begin receiving Social Security retire- ment benefits as early as age 62, but the monthly ben-efits they receive will be lower than if they postponefiling. From age 62 to the full retirement age (alsoknown as the \"normal\" r etirement age), each year postponed adds about 8 percent to monthly benefits.For example, a worker eligible for a monthly benefitof $800 at age 62 could wait until age 65 and receivea monthly benefit of $1,000. Likewise, workers whodelay collecting benefits beyond the full retirementage receive a credit for doing so. Each year delayedadds 6 percent to the monthly benefits of workersturning age 65 this year; the size of that credit isscheduled to gradually increase to 8 percent for subse-quent birth cohorts. Until this year, the full retirement age was 65. Starting with workers born in 1938 (that is, workerswho become eligible for retirement benefits this year),the full retirement age gradually increases from 65 to67. For workers born in 1938, the full retirement age is 65 years and 2 months. For most practical pur-poses, that increase in the full retirement age simplyreduces monthly benefits below what they would havebeen in the absence of the change; it does not changethe age of eligibility for benefits. For example, whenthe full retirement age was 65, the benefits of workerswho began collecting them at age 62 were perma-nently reduced by 20 percent. When the full retire-ment age becomes 67, workers will still be eligible tocollect benefits at age 62, but they will incur a 30 per-cent reduction. (Workers who begin collecting retire-ment benefits this year at age 62 will receive about 1 percent less than they would have received had thefull retirement age remained at 65.) The rules requiring the withholding of Social Security benefits if beneficiaries under age 70 haveearnings in excess of certain exempt amounts\u2014the\"retirement earnings test\"\u2014are complic ated and eas- ily misunderstood. In 2000, the benefits of workerswho are under the full retirement age are reduced by$1 for each $2 they earn above $10,080, and the bene-fits of workers above that age are reduced by $1 foreach $3 they earn above $17,000. (The earningsthreshold for workers below the full retirement ageautomatically increases each year according to theannual increase in a national average wage index.Legislation enacted in 1996 raised the threshold forolder workers to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 in2002; thereafter, the threshold will increase withchanges in the average wage index.) Workers whosebenefits are reduced because their earnings exceed thethreshold will subsequently receive higher monthlybenefits\u2014ultimately, about 8 percent higher for eachyear in which benefits are entirely withheld becauseof the retirement earnings test. The increase in bene-fits in many cases will be even more than 8 percentbecause the additional earnings can raise the earningsbase on which benefits are calculated. In s hort, even though the retirement earnings test is often portrayedas a tax on work, it is more accurately described as ameans of deferring benefits until the workers no lon-ger have substantial earnings. Eliminating the retirement earnings test would be quite costly initially, because doing so would encour-age workers who were already eligible for Social Se-curity benefits to claim them. But the effect on SocialSecurity spending would be small in the long run, ac-cording to the Social Security Administration's Officeof the Actuary, because the earlier receipt of benefitswould result in lower future monthly benefits. 8 Moreover, if eliminating the earnings test caused some peo- ple to increase their earnings, the federal governmentwould gain from added tax revenues. Proponents of eliminating the earnings test con- tend that it is unfair and counterproductive to penalizepeople who want to work. Workers ages 62 through64 who are otherwise eligible for Social Security bene- 8. The Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary estimates that eliminating the earnings test for workers age 62 or older wouldworsen the 75-year actuarial balance by a small amount (0.01 percentof taxable payroll) and that eliminating the earnings test for workers atthe full benefit age would have a negligible effect (that is, less than0.005 percent of payroll) on the long-range balance. See the memo-randum from Stephen C. Goss, Deputy Chief Actuary, to Harry C.Ballantyne, Chief Actuary, \"Long-Range OASDI Financial Effects ofEliminating the OASDI Retirement Earnings Test,\" September 13,1999.20 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 fits may think they are facing a 50 percent tax on their wages if they earn more than the threshold amount;workers ages 65 through 69 appear to be hit with a 33percent tax if they earn more than their thresholdamount. Those tax rates are in addition to the payrolltaxes and income taxes they already must pay. Al-though these workers may be mistaken, proponents ofabolishing the earnings test can point to strong evi-dence that some people are working less to avoid anyreduction in their Social Security benefits. 9 Opponents argue that the main effect of eliminat- ing the earnings test would be to provide Social Secu-rity benefits to workers who already have a higher in-come than do many Social Security beneficiaries. Theonly people who would receive higher Social Securitybenefits if the earnings test was eliminated would beworkers who earned above the threshold amounts. Forexample, 63-year-old workers who had earnings abovethe threshold this year and were otherwise eligible forthe average Social Security benefit for workers theirage would need to have a total income (earnings plusbenefits) of more than $18,000 before their benefitswould be reduced. Likewise, 65-year-old workers eli-gible for average benefits would need to have a totalincome of more than $26,000 before their benefitswould be reduced. 10 Moreover, the annual earnings threshold for older workers is already scheduled tonearly double over the next two years. Another draw-back of eliminating the earnings test is that the work-ers who decided to claim benefits while still workingwould receive lower benefits after they stopped work-ing than they would have received if they delayed fil-ing for them. Thus, encouraging people to claim bene-fits at an earlier age could subsequently increase thenumber of elderly retired workers and their survivors who have low income. An alternative approach for raising the income of the elderly is to raise the earliest eligibility age for So-cial Security retirement benefits. Several proposalsfor slowing the growth in Social Security spendinginclude provisions that would raise the earliest eligibil-ity age from 62 to 65 and then link subsequent in-creases to changes in life expectancy. Such proposalswould make people below the new eligibility ageworse off by delaying their eligibility but would helpensure that they had higher income later. Unlike pro-posals to eliminate the retirement earnings test, thisapproach would initially reduce Social Security spend-ing because workers would need to wait longer to be-come eligible for benefits. In the long run, however,raising the earliest eligibility age without making otherchanges in the program probably would have little im-pact on Social Security spending because the workerswould ultimately become eligible for higher benefits.Nonetheless, if that approach resulted in people work-ing longer, federal tax revenues would increase. Proponents argue that the federal government should no longer be helping people retire at age 62, forseveral reasons. First, with the coming shift in the agedistribution of the population, it makes little sense togive up the productive capacity and revenues thatwould result from more people working longer. Sec-ond, as life spans have increased and the average jobhas become less physically demanding, most peoplecan work longer. Third, by enabling workers to tradelower future Social Security benefits for early accessto benefits, the current rules for early retirement con-tribute to the higher poverty rates experienced by peo-ple who live to a very old age. Opponents of raising the earliest eligibility age contend that it would be especially harmful to peoplewho have little or no choice about when they stopworking and who have few resources other than SocialSecurity. 11 Those opponents argue that many low-9. See, for example, Leora Friedberg, The Labor Supply Effects of the Social Security Earnings Test , Working Paper No. 7200 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June 1999).Friedberg estimated that eliminating the earnings test for workers ages65 to 69 would increase the total number of hours worked by peoplein that age group by about 5 percent. 10. In December 1998, the average monthly benefits paid to retired work- ers ages 63 and 65 were $677 and $735, respectively (see Social Se- curity Administration, Annual Statistical Supplement, p. 181). In- cluding the subsequent cost-of-living adjustments they would havereceived, the annual amount of those benefits would now equal about$8,300 and $9,000. Thus, workers receiving average benefits andfacing the $10,080 threshold could have a total income of about$18,000, and workers facing the $17,000 threshold could have a totalincome of about $26,000, without any reduction in their benefits. 11. See Congressional Budget Office, Raising the Earliest Eligibility Age for Social Security Benefits , CBO Paper (January 1999), for an anal- ysis of the characteristics, circumstances, and financial resources ofmen and women who claimed Social Security retirement benefits atage 62 or 63 in the early 1990s. That paper found that the majority ofthose retired workers had pensions and other sources of income suffi-cient to keep them well above the poverty line even if they had notCHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 21 earning workers are in physically demanding or un- pleasant jobs and that by age 62, if not earlier, theyhave worked long enough. 12 Moreover, by that age, opportunities for those workers are not very plentifulif they lose their job, particularly if the labor market isweak. Another argument made by opponents is thatraising the earliest eligibility age would be unfair toworkers with a below-average life expectancy, espe-cially if they left no survivors eligible for benefits. Long-Term Reform Both the Congress and the Administration are inter-ested in addressing the problem of funding Social Se-curity over the long term in a timely fashi on, before the baby boomers begin drawing benefits. But policy-makers sharply disagree about how to do so. Benefit Reductions and Revenue Increases . Slow- ing the growth in spending for Social Security wouldbe one way of reducing future budgetary pressures.Previous CBO reports have reviewed a wide range ofoptions for doing that. For example, the formula usedto calculate benefits for newly eligible beneficiariescould be altered to reduce their initial benefits; the ageat which full benefits became available could be in-creased; or the cost-of-living adjustments beneficiariesreceive could be reduced. 13 Each option for slowing the growth in benefits, by itself, would leave some beneficiaries worse offthan they would be if they received the benefits sched-uled under current law and the benefits were paid forin some other way. If the changes were made in a waythat preserved the benefits of those with the lowestamounts, then larger reductions would need to bemade in the benefits received by other retired workers.That is, the benefit structure would need to be made more progressive. Benefit reductions could be avoided by increas- ing Social Security revenues. The Social Security pro-gram's trustees project that the gap between spendingand revenues in 2034 will be about 5 percent of tax-able payroll. Thus, an increase in the combined pay-roll tax on workers and their employers from 12.4 per-cent to 17.4 percent at that time would be an alterna-tive way of dealing with the shortfall. 14 Privatization . Numerous proposals have been made to pair a reduction in the Social Security program withthe establishment of mandatory individual investmentaccounts that are owned and directed by the workersthemselves. Such proposals, often referred to as pri-vatization, would give workers control over how theirmoney was invested. Most privatization plans containat least four elements: o Reducing Social Security benefits below the amounts specified under current law; o Requiring (or at least giving a strong financial incentive to) workers to put a certain percentageof their earnings into individual investment ac-counts; o Allowing workers generally to decide for them- selves how their accounts are invested; and o Prohibiting withdrawal of money from those ac- counts until the worker reaches a certain age. Privatization proposals raise a number of issues concerning their potential consequences for the econ-omy and for the income of workers and their familiesafter the workers retire, become disabled, or die. Pro-ponents of plans to replace all or part of future SocialSecurity benefits with income from mandatory definedcontributions contend that doing so would increasenational income and enable workers to receive muchhigher returns on their investments than they could get received Social Security. But a sizable minority of them had non- Social Security income below the poverty threshold and might wellhave had serious difficulty finding a job. 12. If the eligibility age was raised, more workers would probably apply for benefits under Social Security's Disability Insurance program in-stead. If they were successful, that program would incur additionalcosts. 13. See Congressional Budget Office, Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (May 1998), Chapter 3.14.1999 Annual Repor t, p. 169, and unpublished tables from www.ssa.gov, based on the trustees' intermediate assumptions. Thetrustees project that the gap will remain at around 5 percent of taxablepayroll until 2050 and will then gradually increase to 6.5 percent by2075.22 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 by putting their money into the Social Security system. Opponents argue that those claims are exaggeratedand that even partial privatization could subject work-ers, particularly low-wage workers, to unnecessaryrisks. Although mandatory accounts would not resolve the projected shortfall between revenues earmarked forSocial Security and program costs, they would providean alternate source of income for former workers andtheir families if Social Security benefits were scaledback. The proposed USA accounts, cited earlier,could serve a similar purpose. Replacing part of So-cial Security with individual accounts would shiftsome financial risk, now borne collectively, onto theworkers themselves, but at the same time it would of-fer workers the potential to increase their income inretirement. Health Insurance Coverage Despite significant economic growth over the past de-cade and the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years,the number of people who lack health insurance cover-age continues to increase. The number of uninsuredrose from about 35 million in 1991 to more than 44 million by 1998. The percentage of the populationthat was uninsured also increased over that period,from 14.1 percent to 16.3 percent. Lack of health in-surance coverage is primarily a problem of the non-elderly, since Medicare covers people over the age of65. In 1998, 18.4 percent of the nonelderly populationwas uninsured. 15 The majority of nonelderly Americans had health insurance in 1998. Two-thirds participated in healthplans through their employer, and nearly 7 percentpurchased insurance in the individual market. About14 percent of nonelderly people obtained coveragethrough a public program, primarily Medicaid. Somepeople were covered by more than one type of insur-ance during the year, and some were covered part of the year and were uninsured for the remainder. Although policymakers have focused consider- able attention in recent years on the lack of insurancecoverage among children, adults account for most ofthe uninsured population. About 15 percent of chil-dren lacked health insurance coverage in 1998, com-pared with almost 20 percent of nonelderly adults. The percentage of adults without insurance var- ies according to employment and income characteris-tics. In general, workers who are self-employed orwho work in small firms are less likely to have healthinsurance than workers in large firms. Small firmsmay have higher health insurance costs than largefirms because of smaller risk pools and higher admin-istrative and marketing costs. Health insurance statusis also correlated with income. More than a third ofnonelderly people with income below 150 percent ofthe poverty threshold lack health insurance, comparedwith 12 percent of those with income above 200 per-cent of the poverty line. The continuing growth in the percentage of peo- ple without health coverage stems partly from risingcosts for private health insurance and declining enroll-ment in Medicaid. Although private insurance premi-ums grew relatively slowly during the mid-1990s, pre-mium increases of 7 percent or more\u2014substantiallygreater than general price inflation\u2014are expected thisyear. Those rising costs, coupled with less generousbenefits, may have led an increasing number of em-ployees to decline coverage offered by their employers. Another factor in the continuing increase in unin- sured people is the drop in Medicaid enrollment duringthe mid-1990s as the economy improved and welfarereform was implemented. Between 1993 and 1998,the percentage of nonelderly people covered by Medic-aid fell from 12.7 percent to 10.4 percent. However,some people not currently enrolled in Medicaid con-tinue to be eligible, even though they may no longerreceive cash welfare benefits. Those people mightobtain Medicaid coverage if they became ill andsought medical care. The uninsured remain an important focus of con- cern among policymakers. People without health in-surance are less likely to receive basic health care ser- 15.

They may delay treatment until a condition becomes serious, which canresult in costlier treatment than would otherwise havebeen necessary. Hospitals and physicians are oftenuncompensated for the care they provide to uninsuredpeople. As health care markets become increasinglycompetitive, providers have more difficulty coveringthose costs. As a result, less health care may be avail-able to the uninsured. Overview of Policy Approaches Several policy approaches could increase the numberof people covered by health insurance. They include: o Expanding the scope and funding of government insurance programs. Policymakers have recentlyfocused on broadening eligibility for existingprograms rather than creating a new governmentinsurance program. o Providing tax incentives for health insurance purchased in the private market or from an ex-panded government insurance program. o Regulating the private market to expand options for the purchase of lower-cost health insurance. An alternative approach, not discussed here, would increase the direct provision of health services to peo-ple without insurance. That could be accomplished byexpanding government funding for public health clin-ics and other providers. 16 Expanding government programs or providing new tax incentives could involve substantial new fed-eral spending or forgone revenues, particularly if thosepolicies were intended to significantly reduce the num-ber of people without health insurance. Subsidies ap-proaching the full cost of insurance might be neces-sary to induce most low-income people who were un-insured to purchase coverage or participate in a gov-ernment program. In contrast, expanding insuranceoptions by changing the regulatory environment of theprivate market would not require significant new gov- ernment spending but by itself might have limited ef-fectiveness. The effectiveness of any of those strategies in reducing the number of people without insurance de-pends both on the specifics of the proposal and on thebroader policy environment. Recent debate over thecost-containing actions of managed care plans, forexample, has raised legislative interest in imposingnew mandates on health plans that would affect accessto specialist care, payment for specific services, cover-age of certain benefits, and portability of insurance. Ifsuch mandates were enacted, they would increase thecost of private insurance and ultimately increase thenumber of people who do not have private coverage. Health insurance coverage increases the likeli- hood that an individual will receive basic health careservices. But lack of insurance may be only one of thebarriers to appropriate treatment. Low-income peo-ple, in particular, may not have access to physicians'offices near their home, may lack transportation, andmay risk significant income losses (including loss ofemployment) if they take time off work to seek treat-ment for themselves or their children. Expanding Government Insurance Programs Three government programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and the recently enacted State Children's Health Insur-ance Program (SCHIP)\u2014offer health insurance toelderly, disabled, or low-income people. Some 60 mil-lion people are expected to participate in those pro-grams in 2000 at an annual federal cost totaling morethan $300 billion. Of the three programs, Medicare is the only one that is completely financed and run by the federal gov-ernment. Both Medicaid and SCHIP are partnershipsbetween the federal and state governments. The fed-eral government sets basic standards for insuring pop-ulations and guidelines by which states will be reim-bursed for a portion of the expenditures they incur forinsuring individuals, but the administration of bothMedicaid and SCHIP is left to the states. A federalinitiative to expand coverage in those programs is thus 16. Medicare and Medicaid also subsidize the provision of services to people without insurance through disproportionate share payments tohospitals that serve poor populations.24 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 not simply a matter of providing more federal funds. States may also require more flexibility in how theymay use those dollars to better accommodate the needsand circumstances of their populations. Even then,some states may not expand their programs enough tomake full use of the additional funds. Making Medicaid Eligibility Broader and More Uniform. Medicaid is an entitlement program that provides medical assistance to low-income people whoare aged, blind, disabled, or members of families withdependent children. It also covers certain other preg-nant women and children. The program is fundedjointly by the federal and state governments, with fed-eral payments ranging from 50 percent to 83 percentof total expenditures. Outlays for Medicaid in 2000are expected to be about $115 bi llion for the federal government and nearly $90 billion for the states.About a third of Medicaid spending is for long-termcare services. Medicaid is the principal source of health insur- ance for low-income people, but that coverage variesamong states. Federal eligibility requirements arecomplex, and states have wide latitude to set their owneligibility standards above federally mandated levels.States must cover pregnant women and children underage 6 with family income below 133 percent of thefederal poverty level. By 2002, states are required tophase in coverage of all children under age 19 withfamily income below the poverty line. Beyond those requirements, states vary widely in the populations they cover under Medicaid. At theiroption, states may cover pregnant women and infants(under the age of one) whose family income is at orbelow 185 percent of the poverty threshold; about 30states do so. Although some states have not coveredall people whose income is below the poverty level,other states have chosen to enroll particular groups ofpeople with income considerably above the povertyline, using options available under current law orthrough waivers granted by the Health Care FinancingAdministration. There is no guarantee that states willexpand their programs even if federal funding is in-creased and federal restrictions on the uses of thosefunds are loosened, although some states surely would. The number of low-income people who are cov- ered by insurance could be increased by broadeningfederal eligibility requirements for Medicaid, making them more uniform among states for people facingsimilar economic circumstances. Options might in-clude, for example, requiring all states to cover preg-nant women and children with family income up to185 percent of the poverty threshold or to cover allpeople up to some income level. Permitting or requir-ing states to cover groups who are not traditionallycovered under Medicaid is another way to expand cov-erage. Such policies would probably increase the num- ber of people with insurance, but not all people tar-geted by the policy would enroll. Some people mightwish to avoid the perceived stigma of enrolling in awelfare program. Others might delay enrolling inMedicaid until they needed services. Still others\u2014who, before the passage of welfare reform in 1996,might have been automatically eligible for Medicaid asrecipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children\u2014might not realize that they were eligible for the newbenefit. Special outreach efforts might be required forthe program expansion to be effective. Other people (particularly those with higher in- come) who enrolled in an expanded Medicaid programwould have had insurance even without that expan-sion. Some of them would have purchased individualcoverage but would choose Medicaid because of itslower out-of-pocket costs, broader benefits, or both.Others would have had employment-based coverage.Some employees would refuse that coverage if theybecame eligible for Medicaid when the program ex-panded. Some employers would also have an incen-tive to drop the benefit if most of their workers couldobtain coverage elsewhere, although that might leavesome workers uninsured. Broadening federal eligibility requirements for Medicaid would have a differential impact on states,depending on the generosity of their current programs.Less prosperous states tend to have relatively narroweligibility rules, at least partly because they are lessable to pay for large programs. Those states mightargue that broader national eligibility requirementswould impose an unreasonable fiscal burden on them. Expanding the Scope of SCHIP . The State Chil- dren's Health Insurance Program provides enhancedfederal matching funds to assist states in providingCHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 25 coverage for low-income children. Federal payments range from 65 percent to 85 percent of programspending, depending on the state's average per capitaincome. States may use SCHIP funds to expandMedicaid, to develop or expand other insurance pro-grams for children, or to provide services directly. Inaddition, states may subsidize the purchase of familycoverage through employment-based insurance if thatoption costs less than covering only the children. Unlike with the Medicaid program\u2014which, as an entitlement, serves all those who are eligible and en-roll, regardless of the federal cost\u2014federal funding forSCHIP is limited in the aggregate and at the statelevel. Federal outlays for SCHIP are expected to beabout $2 billion in 2000. States are developing pro-grams that may ultimately enroll 2.5 million childrenon an average annual basis. Given the size and focusof the current program, the extent to which proposalsto broaden SCHIP would reduce the total number ofpeople without health insurance depends on both theamount of new federal funding and the additional flex-ibility to design and implement programs that are ex-tended to the states. Only 19 states used SCHIP funds in 1998, the first year of operation, and many states have spent lessthan the amounts allotted to them in the federal bud-get. Recognizing that some states would need time todevelop their programs, the Balanced Budget Act of1997 gave states three years to spend their allocationsand required the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-vices to redistribute unspent funds in the fourth year tostates that had spent their allocation. But federal re-strictions on the states' use of funds, particularly thelimitation on outreach activities, have been criticizedas unduly hampering the early development of SCHIPprograms. Some analysts have also criticized SCHIP as too narrowly circumscribed to be effective in increasingthe number of children with health insurance. Oneoption would expand SCHIP to cover the parents ofeligible children. Such a policy could increase insur-ance coverage among parents of children already inSCHIP and encourage other parents to enroll them-selves and their children in the program. As withother proposals to expand eligibility for governmentinsurance programs, some of the people enrolling in anexpanded SCHIP would have had group or individual coverage without the expansion. Some employerswould discontinue their offer of insurance unlessSCHIP subsidized that coverage. Extending Medicare to Younger Ages . Unlike Medicaid and SCHIP, which do not offer insurance toall low-income people, Medicare provides nearly uni-versal coverage to people age 65 or older and to manydisabled individuals. In 2000, Medicare outlays willtotal about $220 billion and will finance health ser-vices for 39 million people. Options for expanding Medicare eligibility target older adults who are not yet 65. Those people havemore difficulty obtaining insurance than do youngerpeople, and their premiums are high because they usemore health services. The Administration has pro-posed allowing displaced workers ages 55 to 61 topurchase Medicare coverage. A separate proposalwould allow certain people ages 62 to 64 to enroll vol-untarily in Medicare. The cost and effectiveness of such buy-in pro- posals depend on specific design features. The pro-gram for displaced workers would be narrowly tar-geted. Workers (and their spouses) would be eligibleif they lost health insurance because of a job loss.Other eligibility requirements would include receivingemployment-based health insurance for 12 monthsbefore losing their job, being eligible for unemploy-ment insurance, and exhausting their coverage underthe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act(COBRA), which requires employers to offer continu-ing insurance benefits to workers (and family mem-bers) after workers leave their job. Premiums wouldbe set at relatively high levels. Consequently, CBOestimated last year that participation would be limitedto about 50,000 people by 2009. Those most likely toenroll would be people whose medical expenditureswere higher than average for their age. Premiumswould not fully cover program costs, and net Medicareoutlays would rise by about $300 million over the 10-year period beginning in 2000. The proposed Medicare buy-in for people ages 62 to 64 is designed to attract greater enrollment. En-rollment would be limited to people who did not haveemployment-based insurance or Medicaid. They26 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 would have to enroll as soon as they became eligible, which includes turning age 62 or losing employment-based coverage. People buying into Medicare under those circum- stances would pay premiums that would approxi-mately cover their expected cost to the program overtheir lifetime. The premiums would be paid in twoparts. Before the age of 65, enrollees would pay pre-miums that reflected the average expected cost of ben-efits if everyone ages 62 to 64 participated in the buy-in. However, as with the buy-in for displaced work-ers, the people most likely to enroll would have highercosts than average for their age. Thus, premiums be-fore age 65 would not fully cover the program's costsduring those years. To offset those costs, people whobought into Medicare early would pay a premium sur-charge (in addition to their regular SupplementaryMedical Insurance premium) once they reached age65. Using those specifications, CBO estimated last year that the buy-in for people ages 62 to 64 wouldincrease program outlays by $32 billion between 2001(when the program would have begun) and 2009.Nearly 500,000 people would participate in 2001, ris-ing to about 700,000 people by 2009. 17 Many of the people who would buy into Medi- care before they were 65 would have been insuredeven without the program. Most of them would havepurchased coverage in the individual market. But thebuy-in would give some people who were working andcovered by employment-based insurance an incentiveto retire early. CBO assumed that about 1 percent ofworkers ages 62 to 64 would retire early and buy intoMedicare if that option became available. A policy that encouraged early retirement even to that limited extent would certainly not help Medicare'slong-term financing crisis. A buy-in policy could,however, be a first step in advancing the age ofMedicare eligibility beyond 65. As discussed below,the early buy-in could be coupled with a gradual moveto a later age of normal eligibility comparable with theincrease in Social Security's normal retirement age. 18 The modest program savings that would be realized over the next 10 years from such an approach wouldgrow rapidly in later years as an increasing number ofpeople were affected by the change. Some employers would drop their health insur- ance for retirees because of the availability of theMedicare buy-in. The prevalence of employer-spon-sored retiree coverage has been declining, and the buy-in proposal would accelerate that trend. Other policyproposals, such as adding a Medicare prescriptiondrug benefit, could worsen that adverse consequenceof a buy-in. Providing Tax Incentives for the Purchase of Insurance The tax system currently provides substantial subsi- dies for health-related expenses, including the pur-chase of health insurance. The federal governmentannually forgoes over $100 billion in tax revenues,according to some estimates, by excluding from in-come and payroll taxes the contributions that employ-ers make for health benefits and by allowing deduc-tions for certain other health expenses. Those tax ex-penditures have significantly lowered the cost of healthcare for millions of people, primarily benefiting themore than 150 million people with employment-basedinsurance. Existing tax incentives might be restruc-tured, or new ones added, to encourage additional peo-ple to purchase health insurance. Subsidies Under the Current Tax Code . The largest health-related federal tax subsidy is the exclusion ofemployers' payments for health insurance and otherhealth expenses from a worker's taxable income.Other health expenses include benefits paid throughcafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts, as wellas employers' contributions for long-term care insur-ance. That income tax exclusion will account for al-most $60 billion in federal tax expenditures this yearand will also reduce state income tax revenues. Em-ployers' contributions for health benefits are also ex- 17. Congressional Budget Office, An Analysis of the President's Budget- ary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2000 (April 1999), p. 36.18. See option 570-19-B, Permit Early Buy-In to Medicare and Increase the Normal Age of Eligibility, in Chapter 3.CHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 27 cluded from payroll taxes, accounting for as much as $30 billion in forgone federal revenues.19 Self-employed taxpayers may deduct part of their health insurance payments from taxable income. Thatdeduction is \"above the line\" and is available to peoplewho use the standard deduction as well as to thosewho itemize. Under current law, a self-employed per-son may deduct 60 percent of health insurance coststhis year. That deduction rises to 100 percent by2003. Taxpayers who itemize their deductions may also use the medical expense deduction, which is gearedtoward families who incur high medical expenses (rel-ative to their income). That provision allows them todeduct unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5percent of adjusted gross income. Medical expensesinclude health insurance payments paid by the tax-payer, out-of-pocket payments for medical care, andcertain costs for transportation, lodging, and long-termcare. In addition, people who choose to purchase qual- ifying high-deductible health insurance and are nototherwise covered tax-preferred medicalsavings accounts (MSAs). MSAs are personal sav-ings accounts that can be used to pay deductibles, co-payments, and other health expenses not covered byinsurance. The tax system heavily favors health insurance purchased through employers over coverage purchasedin the individual market. People without access toemployment-based health insurance cannot take ad-vantage of a substantial tax benefit, yet they often facehigher premiums than people who are covered throughtheir job. Moreover, tax incentives in the current sys-tem are regressive. Since tax savings depend on thetaxpayer's marginal rate, people in the highest taxbrackets, who are most able to afford coverage, re-ceive the largest subsidies. People who have low in-come and little or no income tax liability receive littleor no subsidy if they buy health insurance.The tax exclusion is a particularly inefficient way to subsidize health benefits. Because all insur-ance costs are subsidized, the exclusion encouragespeople to purchase more insurance than they otherwisewould. For example, someone facing a marginal taxrate of 30 percent (counting federal and state incometaxes and payroll taxes) is encouraged to spend a dol-lar for health insurance that is worth only 70 cents tothat person\u2014the remaining 30 cents is paid by thegovernment as forgone tax revenue. Such excessiveinsurance encourages people to use more health ser-vices than they would have used without a subsidy. Options for Expanding Tax Subsidies . Expanding tax subsidies for the purchase of health insurancewould reduce the cost of that coverage, thus providingan incentive for more people to enroll in a health plan.The current structure of tax incentives could be ex-tended to more people through the broader use of de-ductions, exclusions, or tax credits. Alternatively, thetax system could be restructured to expand insurancecoverage more efficiently than at present. People who do not have access to employment- based health insurance must pay the full unsubsidizedcost of any coverage they buy in the individual market.As a result, they are less likely to have health insur-ance than are people who can obtain coverage throughan employer. One option would allow those people to deduct their health insurance expenses from taxable income.Those who purchased health insurance without a taxdeduction would continue to do so under such an op-tion, although many of them would pay less for insur-ance (after taxes) than previously. An expanded taxdeduction of this kind would be regressive\u2014benefitingthose with higher income more than those with lowerincome\u2014and might provide the greater benefit forpeople who would have purchased insurance coverageanyway. This option would probably induce few unin-sured people to purchase insurance because most ofthem have low or moderate income. Another option would offer a tax credit to people purchasing insurance in the individual or group mar-ket. Such an option might provide a credit of up to$1,000 to offset health insurance premiums, for exam-ple. That approach would be less regressive than ex-panding a tax deduction, but people with no income 19. Detailed estimates of those tax expenditures are reported by John Sheils and Paul Hogan, \"Cost of Tax-Exempt Health Benefits in 1998,\" Health Affairs , vol. 18, no. 2 (March/April 1999), pp. 176- 181. 28 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 tax liability would not benefit from a nonrefundable credit. A refundable tax credit would be more effec-tive in giving people at those lower income levels anincentive to purchase insurance. The amount of a tax credit would have to be fairly large\u2014approaching the full cost of the pre-mium\u2014to induce a large proportion of the uninsuredpopulation to buy insurance. Many uninsured peoplehave low income and may not be able to pay muchtoward their health insurance. Some may be countingon the services of public hospitals and other publiclysupported providers, which often write off the costs ofcare or require only modest payments from their pa-tients. Moreover, many people who might be inducedto buy insurance because of a tax subsidy would haveaccess only to the individual market, whose premiumsare generally higher than those in the group market.To make coverage more affordable, some tax creditproposals would permit uninsured people to buy intogovernment-sponsored insurance programs, includingMedicaid, Medicare, or the Federal Employees HealthBenefits (FEHB) program. Other, more sweeping proposals would alter the current tax treatment of health insurance benefits inthe context of a new tax credit. One approach wouldlimit the amount of the tax exclusion, which wouldincrease tax revenues and discourage the purchase ofexcessively generous insurance. Those additional rev-enues could be used to finance a refundable tax credit.Another approach would be to completely replace thecurrent tax preferences for employment-based cover-age with a tax credit for everyone purchasing insur-ance. The tax credit could be allowed whether the in-surance was purchased through the individual market,employers, or a government-sponsored plan. Any proposal to expand tax incentives for the purchase of health insurance would have to deal with ahost of technical issues that would determine the pro-posal's cost and effectiveness in increasing insurancecoverage. 20 Some of those issues include: o Defining the eligible group,o Relating the subsidy to family income or some measure of need, o Timing the receipt of the subsidy to coincide with the payment of premiums, and o Defining and enforcing new regulatory standards for qualified insurance plans. A tax subsidy could be targeted toward people who do not have access to employment-based cover-age, or it could be made available to a broader group.Making a subsidy available to all who purchase healthinsurance might be the easiest policy to administer, buta substantial amount of federal aid would go to peoplewho would have been insured anyway. Narrowing thefocus to those who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance might be more cost-effective, butit would be administratively more complex. Any cov-erage that might have been available to a person andpossibly a spouse would have to be verified, possiblylong after the fact. In addition, such an approachmight encourage employers to drop their health plans.Requiring employers to continue to offer that coveragecould be difficult to enforce. Tax subsidies could readily be tied to a family's income. But low family income, by itself, might dis-tribute those subsidies inefficiently. As the current taxdeduction for health expenses recognizes, a more ac-curate indicator would reflect both income and thelevel of health costs. The subsidy might also be ad-justed to reflect variations in the average cost of healthcare in different geographic locations or other factors.Such adjustments could help people in high-cost areasbuy as much care as people who receive the same dol-lar amount of subsidy but who live in low-cost areas. An often-voiced concern about tax subsidies is that they would provide cash to families only at thetime of tax filing, not when the cash was needed to paypremiums throughout the year. The health insurancetax credit that was available during the early 1990sdid not offer payment advances, for example, and par-ticipation was well below expectations. One way toimplement payment advances would be to lower in-come tax withholding. But making such adjustmentsprecisely could be difficult, and some people mightface unexpectedly high tax bills the following year. Inaddition, some other method of making advances 20. For a more complete discussion of those issues, see Jack A. Meyer and others, Tax Reform to Expand Health Coverage: Administrative Issues and Challenges (Menlo Park, Calif.: Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2000).CHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 29 would be needed for people who are eligible for a tax subsidy but do not have earnings. Standards would be needed to define how health insurance plans that qualify for a tax subsidy couldoperate. Such standards might define a minimum ben-efit package that all health plans would have to offer,limit cost-sharing requirements, and establish otherregulations for the private insurance market. Thoseregulations might include rules for medical underwrit-ing, requirements to make insurance coverage avail-able and renewable, limits on the premiums that maybe charged, and other issues. Such standards and reg-ulations are typically intended to protect consumers,but they also impose costs on the insurance industrythat are ultimately paid by consumers. Expanding Private Coverage Expanding government health insurance programs orincreasing the generosity of tax preferences for healthinsurance could require substantial new federal expen-ditures. Alternatively, regulation of the private insur-ance market could be modified with the intention ofincreasing health insurance coverage. Regulatory ap-proaches have the appeal of not requiring new govern-ment spending, but they generally would impose someadditional cost on the insurance industry that wouldultimately be paid by consumers. Both the Congress and the states have passed legislation affecting the benefits, cost, and accessibil-ity of private health insurance, but the states have pri-mary responsibility for regulating insurance. Allstates have passed legislation mandating the inclusionof specified benefits in health plans, which may haveincreased the cost of insurance. Most states also re-quire insurers to issue insurance to all groups whoapply and to guarantee the renewal of that coverage,and states frequently regulate the premium that may becharged for health insurance. In addition, some stateshave passed legislation creating health insurance pur-chasing cooperatives to facilitate insurance coveragefor employees in small firms. Federal regulatory initiatives have been intended to ensure more continuous coverage for people whoare usually insured and to increase the number oflower-cost options available in the small-group mar- ket. Additional proposals might be considered to im-prove the availability and portability of insurance cov-erage and to reduce the cost consumers pay for thatcoverage. Improving Insurance Availability and Portability . The Health Insurance Portability and AccountabilityAct of 1996 (HIPAA) addressed concerns that work-ers had become locked into their current employmentbecause they risked losing insurance coverage forsome period of time if they changed jobs. That actexpanded COBRA protections for workers who leavetheir job. It also required insurers to make insuranceavailable to people who had prior group or employer-sponsored coverage, and it guaranteed renewal of thatcoverage. The law limited the use of exclusions forpreexisting conditions, which exempt the plan frompaying for expenses related to a medical condition thatalready existed when the enrollee joined the plan. The insurance mandates in HIPAA were intended to make group health insurance more available toworkers and to make it easier for workers to changejobs by making that coverage more portable. But thelaw also imposed costs on insurers that would increasepremiums somewhat\u2014by about $500 million annuallyby 2001, according to CBO's estimates. The impacton insurance enrollment is uncertain: the increase incost would tend to reduce coverage, but the looseningof insurers' restrictions would increase enrollment bysome groups of people. Additional initiatives might be considered to im- prove the continuity of private insurance coverage.Some options would extend the period of time overwhich COBRA coverage is available or broaden theavailability of that protection. For example, firms thatdropped their retiree health benefits might be requiredto offer their early retirees who were enrolled in thehealth plan extended COBRA coverage\u2014perhaps untilthose retirees reached age 65 and became eligible forMedicare. Such a requirement could discourage em-ployers from dropping their retiree health plans, but itcould also discourage employers from offering cover-age in the first place. Expanding COBRA coverage inthat way would raise the cost of health insurance forworkers, and fewer employees would enroll.30 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Making Small-Group Insurance More Affordable . Employees in small firms typically face higher healthinsurance costs than those in larger firms and aretherefore less likely to have health coverage. Smallfirms lack purchasing power, limiting their ability tobargain for lower rates from providers and insurers.They have fewer employees to pay the fixed costs of ahealth plan, including marketing and enrollment costs,so their average administrative expenses are high.And small firms generally purchase coverage that issubject to state benefit mandates and premium taxes,both of which increase average premiums. Largerfirms that self-insure are exempted from those stateinsurance regulations by the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act. Concerns about the affordability of insurance coverage in the small-group market have promptedrecent proposals to establish association health plans(AHPs) and HealthMarts. Those new entities are in-tended to provide small firms and their employees withsome of the premium-lowering cost advantages en-joyed by larger firms, including lower administrativecosts and enhanced purchasing power. AHPs andHealthMarts would also enable small firms to avoidsome regulations that generally increase their insur-ance costs. AHPs could be sponsored by trade, i ndustry, or professional associations and could offer a full rangeof health plans, including a self-insured plan, to theirmember firms. Both self-insured and fully insuredplans (offered by a licensed insurer) would be exemptfrom state-mandated coverage of benefits. An AHPwould offer its plans only to members of its sponsor-ing association and could price its premiums to reflectthe expected health care costs of its association mem-bers rather than the costs of the small-group market asa whole. HealthMarts would be nonprofit organizations that offered health insurance products to all smallfirms within an approved geographic service area. AHealthMart would have to make all of the plans it of-fered available to any small employer within its ser-vice area. Health plans offered through HealthMartswould be exempt from most state benefit mandates.Like AHPs, HealthMarts could offer premiums re-flecting the expected health care costs of potential en-rollees in small firms in its designated geographic ser-vice area rather than the entire small-group market in the state. Unlike AHPs, HealthMarts could offer onlyfully insured plans from insurance issuers licensed inthe state. Insurance offered through AHPs and Health- Marts could significantly lower premiums for somesmall firms compared with coverage offered in the tra-ditional (fully regulated) small-group market. Some ofthose premium savings would result from reduced ad-ministrative costs or increased market power throughgroup purchasing. Those savings would most likelybe modest, however. Other savings would result fromexempting AHPs and HealthMarts from state-man-dated coverage of benefits that may not be stronglydemanded by employees of small firms. But AHPsand HealthMarts would also attract firms withhealthier-than-average employees, further loweringpremiums. The exemption from state-mandated benefits could foster that favorable selection of firms withhealthier employees. AHPs and HealthMarts mightdesign benefit packages that were relatively unattrac-tive to firms whose employees had costly health careneeds. Lower-priced plans with leaner benefits mightappeal both to firms that currently offer no coverageto their employees and to firms with healthy employeesthat already offer insurance. If firms with healthier-than-average employees switched from traditional coverage to AHPs andHealthMarts, premiums for some firms in the tradi-tional market would rise. However, proposals gener-ally include requirements that would limit the abilityof AHPs and HealthMarts to attract healthier groups.AHPs would have to offer their plans to any smallfirm that qualified for membership in the sponsoringassociation. Similarly, HealthMarts would have tomake their plans available to any small firm located ina HealthMart's designated geographic area. And bothtypes of plans would be subject to limits on the premi-ums they could charge. Moreover, aggressive effortsby AHPs and HealthMarts to obtain favorable healthrisks would add to administrative costs, which couldtemper such efforts to attract healthier groups. In a recent analysis, CBO estimated that intro- ducing the new entities would increase the number ofpeople insured through small firms by approximatelyCHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 31 330,000.21 Many more people\u2014about 4.6 million\u2014 would be attracted by lower premiums to the newplans, but most of them would otherwise have beeninsured through the small-group market. Some firmsand workers in the traditional market would drop cov-erage because their premiums would increase, butmost would continue their coverage and pay slightlyhigher premiums. Long-Term Care for the Elderly The demand for long-term care services is substantial and will probably accelerate with the aging of thebaby boomers. Over $120 billion, or more than 10percent of national health expenditures, was spent onnursing home and home health care in 1998. Federaland state governments account for the bulk of thatspending, perhaps as much as two-thirds of the total.The rest is paid for privately. Uncounted in that totalare services provided to people with chronic healthconditions by relatives and friends who are unpaid. The demand for both paid and unpaid services is likely to grow as more people live longer. Policiescould be adopted that might ease some of the financialpressures now facing families as they deal with thelong-term care needs of a friend or relative and thatmight provide incentives for younger people to betterprepare for such needs. Use of Long-Term Care Services by the Elderly Long-term care comprises a variety of medical and social services for elderly and disabled people whosedisabilities prevent them from living independently.Formal, or paid, long-term care services may be pro-vided in the home or community or in institutions forpeople who can no longer remain in their home. Notall people who could use such services receive them,however, because formal services are expensive if paid for out of pocket, and they may be less desirable thaninformal help from family and friends. Indeed, themost important sources of assistance for disabled el-derly people who remain in the community are live-incaregivers and networks of family helpers. Despiterecent rapid growth in long-term care spending, mostlong-term care services are still provided informallyand are not, therefore, represented in expenditure data. This year, 7.5 million people age 65 or older (or about 21 percent of the elderly population) are ex-pected to require assistance because of physical dis-abilities, cognitive impairments, or behavioral prob-lems. Of those people, 1.5 million will be in nursinghomes; 2.2 million will receive assistance while livingin the community, although they probably would havequalified for admission to a nursing home; and the restwill be less severely disabled but may still use long-term care services on occasion. Over the next 30 years or so, the elderly popula- tion will double. Similar increases are foreseen for the\"old old\" population\u2014those who are 85 or older andmore likely to have disabilities that make them depend-ent on others for assistance. If current rates of disabil-ity among the elderly continue, almost 8 million se-verely disabled elderly people are projected to be liv-ing in 2030, with a similar number having lesser dis-abilities. Those estimates are quite speculative, however, because of the uncertainty that surrounds future ratesof disability and longevity among the elderly. If, forexample, the Census Bureau's projections of the 85-or-older population are too low, as some demographersbelieve, the proportion of the elderly population inneed of intensive long-term care could be considerablylarger. By contrast, reductions in age-specific disabil-ity rates would lessen that effect. Recent data suggestthat the incidence of disability has been declining overthe past two decades, and those declines may continue. Current Financing of Long-Term Care for the Elderly Medicaid and Medicare, the two largest health financ- ing programs, were responsible for about half of nurs-21. See Congressional Budget Office, Increasing Small-Firm Health Insurance Coverage Through Association Health Plans and Health-Marts, CBO Paper (January 2000).32 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 ing home and home care expenditures for the elderly in 1995 (see Table 2). Medicaid is jointly funded by thefederal government and the states and serves certainpeople who have low income and few assets. A signif-icant fraction of Medicaid spending is for nursinghome residents who have \"spent down\" their assetsand income as a result of incurring large medical ex-penses. Because of the spend-down provisions,Medicaid is effectively the insurer of last resort formiddle-income people facing high expenses for long-term care. Medicare pays primarily for acute medical treat- ment, but a sizable component of Medicare spendingis for home health care and skilled nursing facility ser-vices. Although those services were originally in-tended to meet the short-term postacute needs ofMedicare patients, Medicare's home health benefit isincreasingly important for patients requiring chroniccare. (Table 2 does not distinguish between postacuteand chronic care services.) Recent spending declines in Medicare outlays for home health services are not likely to persist. Thoseoutlays declined in 1998 and 1999 partly because oflegislative changes in payment methods and partly be-cause of administrative actions curbing fraud andabuse in Medicare. Over the next decade, however,Medicare spending for both home health and skilled nursing care will grow substantially, CBO projects. Because the federal government finances more than half of Medicaid's spending and all of Medicare's(apart from premiums and cost sharing paid by benefi-ciaries), it is the primary payer for long-term care ser-vices for the elderly. By contrast, the role of privateinsurance in financing long-term care is modest, ac-counting for less than 1 percent of all spending onnursing home and home care for the elderly in 1995.That may not be surprising since Medicaid providessome protection against potentially catastrophic long-term care expenses. Many long-term care services are also provided informally by adult children or friends, who are notpaid for providing that help. Informal services mightbe valued at $50 billion to $100 billion annually ifthey were purchased in the market. Economic anddemographic changes may curtail family caregiving inthe future, however. The increased participation ofwomen in the labor force is already reducing the po-tential pool of informal caregivers. Average familysize has also been declining, which further reduces thechances that an adult child will be present to provideinformal services if the need arises. Reliance on paidcare would be likely to rise if those trends continued. Table 2.

Somewould address the needs of people who are now usinglong-term care services and the needs of their families.Those policies might expand eligibility for servicescovered by Medicaid and Medicare or provide taxsubsidies for paid or unpaid care. Other options would increase opportunities for people to prepare financially for the possibility thatthey might need such services once they were elderly.Such options would encourage people to purchaselong-term care insurance or to save more over theirlifetime. Expanding Medicaid and Medicare . Federal and state governments already finance long-term care ex-penses through Medicaid and Medicare. Those pro-grams could be expanded, and eligibility rules couldbe liberalized. All state Medicaid programs cover nursing home care, and many states also offer home and commu-nity-based care in an attempt to avoid or delay a per-son's entry into a nursing home. To be eligible forMedicaid coverage, nursing home patients may nothave assets with a value greater than a relatively lowlimit (that excludes the value of a home). In addition,all of their income except a small allowance must bespent on nursing home costs. If the patient is married,the spouse living in the community may retain higheramounts of income and assets. Most states permitpeople with relatively high income to qualify forMedicaid if they meet the asset test and if medical ex-penses exceed their income. One option would allow patients whose long- term care expenses are covered by Medicaid, and theirspouses, to retain more of their income and assets.That change would allow people with lower medicalcosts to obtain Medicaid coverage and would impose alarger share of total long-term care costs on the pro-gram. Such an option would increase the number ofchronic care patients enrolled in Medicaid, primarilyby allowing them into the program earlier. The optionmight also reduce some financial burdens for a spouseliving at home, although nursing homes would alsohave an incentive to raise their prices for personal ser- vices paid for by the family. Medicare provides postacute care services rather than comprehensive long-term care services. For ex-ample, Medicare covers up to 100 days of nursinghome care for each spell of illness but only after thepatient has been hospitalized for at least three days totreat an acute illness. Only the first 20 days are fullyreimbursed, however; the remaining days require sub-stantial coinsurance. That benefit could be made com-prehensive by dropping the hospitalization require-ment, eliminating the 100-day limit on coverage, andreducing coinsurance rates. Coupled with alreadygenerous home health benefits, those policy changeswould establish a true long-term care benefit inMedicare. But such a policy would substantially in-crease Medicare spending as nursing home residentsshifted from Medicaid and state-only programs (inwhich states bear some or all of the costs) or from pri-vate payment. Another option would create a new benefit for respite care in Medicare. Respite care would coverpaid services provided for a brief time, perhaps a weekor two, to care for a chronically ill Medicare patientliving at home. Those services would enable an un-paid caregiver to take time away from the patient.Such a policy could help caregivers cope with thephysically and emotionally draining experience of car-ing for a loved one and might encourage more familymembers and friends to help someone with chronicneeds, possibly delaying the patient's move to institu-tional care. Tax Subsidies for Long-Term Care Services . Tax- payers who itemize may deduct unreimbursed medicalexpenses that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross in-come. Taxpayers or their dependents who have sub-stantial expenses for long-term care can deduct a por-tion of those costs, but the tax benefit is modest formost people. The deduction could be converted into atax credit, which would provide a greater benefit tolow-income people than would the deduction. Another option would allow people to open a tax-preferred savings account, similar to a medicalsavings account, that could be used to purchase long-term care services. Such an account might be fundedwith pretax dollars, and interest accrued on account34 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 balances might also be excluded from taxable income. Medical savings accounts have not proved popular,however, perhaps in part because of restrictions ontheir use. Also, the amount of additional savings thatmight be gained through such vehicles might be mod-est, since some of the money going into the accountwould be diverted from other savings. Expanding Long-Term Care Insurance . Although private long-term care insurance does not currentlypay for a significant fraction of services, interest insuch insurance is growing. The number of policiesthat have been written increased from about 800,000in December 1987 to nearly 5 million by the end of1996. Most long-term care insurance is sold in theindividual and group association markets rather thanthrough employer-sponsored group plans. Private long-term care insurance protects policy- holders against potentially large financial losses asso-ciated with a debilitating condition. The market forthat insurance is concentrated among people withabove-average income, who may have significant as-sets that they wish to bequeath to their heirs. Low-income people may reasonably have little interest inlong-term care insurance. They may have limited as-sets to protect, they may not feel private premiums areaffordable, and they are likely to be eligible forMedicaid coverage if they need long-term care servicesas they age. People with higher income might face greater financial losses if they needed long-term care servicesand had to spend down their assets to become eligiblefor Medicaid. But even for those people, the availabil-ity of Medicaid is a significant deterrent to purchasingprivate insurance. Purchasers may find that long-termcare insurance would give them more treatment op-tions should the need arise. In addition, some statesallow nursing home patients who purchased privatelong-term care insurance to become eligible forMedicaid with substantially higher-than-usual levelsof assets. Even with those incentives, however, manypeople who buy private long-term care insurance al-low their policy to lapse; perhaps as many as half ofthe people with that insurance drop their policy withinfive years of purchasing it. The Congress could create new tax incentives for purchasing long-term care insurance. Options includea tax credit or \"above the line\" deduction for premi- ums paid by the taxpayer. Another approach wouldbe to exclude from taxable income money withdrawnfrom qualified retirement plans that is used to pur-chase long-term care insurance. Such options wouldfavor high-income taxpayers, particularly those whowere already buying private coverage. Lower-incometaxpayers, who are unlikely to buy long-term care in-surance now for the reasons discussed above, wouldbe unlikely to purchase that coverage unless the newtax benefit subsidized most of the premium. Some people who purchased private insurance because of a new tax subsidy would use fewerMedicaid-covered services as a result, yielding someprogram savings. Those savings would be unlikely tofully offset the revenue loss, however. The net impacton the budget would depend on the details of the pol-icy option. Without other changes, tax incentives might have little impact on the private insurance market. Long-term care insurance remains a little-known product toemployers, and the administrative cost of selling thatinsurance through the individual market is high. TheAdministration's recent proposal to offer long-termcare insurance to federal workers through the Office ofPersonnel Management might promote that type ofcoverage more generally. Since that coverage wouldbe sold to a group, premiums might be lower thanthose for comparable coverage sold through the indi-vidual market. Unlike the treatment of health insur-ance in the FEHB program, however, employeeswould pay the entire premium cost under that pro-posal\u2014there would be no employer contribution. Private insurance is one way for people to fi- nance the costs of long-term care services themselves.Other policies, discussed earlier in the section on So-cial Security, could be pursued to increase retirementincome, enabling the elderly to better afford healthcare and other services that they may need. Education The federal government historically has played a smallrole in funding the U.S. education system. FederalCHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 35 funds represent only about 8 percent of the cost of public elementary and secondary education, for exam-ple. State and local tax revenues provide most of thefunding for public schools; parents of students in pri-vate schools pay most of those costs. The same is true for other types of education. Most of the cost of preschool is paid by parents, withlimited support provided by government sources forchildren in poor families. And although the federalgovernment provided about $20 billion this year tohelp students pay for their postsecondary educationthrough grants, loan subsidies, and tax benefits, familycontributions and state subsidies have always been farmore significant sources of funding for colleges anduniversities. Nonetheless, the success of the education system is critical to the future of the nation, and additionalspending has been proposed at all levels. The broadgoals of those proposals are to promote equal opportu-nity; enhance the skills, productivity, and income offuture workers; and provide greater assurance thatchildren will become adults who can function effec-tively in society. Specific proposals might be more orless effective in achieving those goals. Prominent among education spending initiatives are the following strategies: o Helping children become better prepared to learn when they enter school by expanding the avail-ability of preschool programs, most notablyHead Start for low-income children. o Improving the effectiveness of elementary and secondary schools by hiring more teachers andimproving their training, as well as making im-provements in facilities and other infrastructure. o Increasing support for investment in education beyond high school by expanding federal studentaid programs, especially Pell grants. Expanding Preschool Education Adequate preparation is a critical factor for success inschool. Some analysts believe that the greatest returnfrom additional spending in education could be ob- tained by investing in early childhood education. Although universal public schooling is available starting at age 5, many younger children attend pre-school programs. Nearly 40 percent of 3-year-oldsattend some type of center-based program, as do al-most 60 percent of 4-year-olds. Even with existingfederal efforts focusing on low-income children, how-ever, preschool attendance rates remain much loweramong children from lower-income families thanamong those from higher-income families. For in-stance, preschool enrollment was about 38 percent in1996 among 3- and 4-year-olds in families with annualincome below $20,000, compared with over 65 per-cent in families with income above $50,000. Head Start is the primary federal preschool pro- gram serving poor children. It provides a comprehen-sive set of services, mostly to eligible 3- and 4-year-olds, that includes child development, education,health, nutrition, social, and other activities. The pro-gram strives not only to improve the education out-comes of children but to achieve other goals as well,including improving health status and reducing aggres-sive and other antisocial behavior. In 2000, the program will enroll an estimated 877,000 children, over 85 percent of whom are fromfamilies with annual income below $13,000. The av-erage federal service grant per child is about $5,800, with funds going directly to the approximately 1,500public and private nonprofit agencies that operate theHead Start centers. Local grant recipients provideroughly 15 percent of total program resources. Federal funding for Head Start has grown rapidly in recent years, rising from about $1.2 billion in 1989to about $5.3 billion in 2000 (including advance ap-propriations). Increases occurred with the rise in thenumber of 3- and 4-year-old participants, which nearlydoubled, and with the introduction of the Early HeadStart program. That program provides early interven-tion services to pregnant women and families with in-fants and toddlers. The Effectiveness of Preschool Programs . Two mechanisms could explain how children's experiencesat age 3 or 4 might improve their subsequent educa-36 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 tion outcome.22 Preschool might improve children's ability to think and reason as they enter school, en-abling them to learn more in the early grades andkeeping them \"on track\" toward high school gradua-tion. It might also help increase their motivation tolearn. The success children have in early grades couldlead to higher expectations and added support fromtheir parents and teachers, increasing their drive tosucceed. The effectiveness of preschool programs remains unclear, however. Most analysts agree that earlychildhood education programs in general can havepositive short-term effects on participants' cognitiveand social development, but there is less evidenceabout the longer-term effects of the programs. Al-though cognitive gains may fade, other effects\u2014suchas lower placement rates into special education andlower retention in grade\u2014seem to persist. Analyses ofsmall-scale \"model\" preschool programs also find inthose programs long-term reductions in crime, teenagechildbearing, and use of social services. The efficacy of Head Start programs over the long term is even less clear. The positive long-termeffects of model preschool programs may not pertainto Head Start programs because its teachers are oftenless well trained. Likewise, most Head Start programsdo not provide some of the services, such as in-hometutoring, that are usually part of the model programs.Although both types of programs generally show fa-vorable effects on reducing the placement of studentsin special education programs and on reducing the re-tention of students in grade, the question of HeadStart's effects on participants in the long term remainsopen. The General Accounting Office has concludedthat the body of specific research on Head Start todate is inadequate for use in drawing conclusionsabout the impact of the national program. 23Expanding Head Start . A range of proposals have been made to increase federal support for presc hool education. Some options would make services likethose provided in Head Start available to more 3- and4-year-olds. For instance, one proposal would makefederally supported preschool available to all 4-year-olds. Other options would increase the services pro-vided to children who are already enrolled, includingexpanding the length of the program from half-day tofull-day. Still other options would focus funding onprograms that provide services to parents and childrenat earlier ages. A specific proposal would be to increase Head Start funding sufficiently to enroll all poor 3- and 4-year-olds. In 1998, about one-quarter of eligible 3-year-olds and about one-half of eligible 4-year-oldswere enrolled in the program. Enrolling all childrenwho live in families with income below the federalpoverty threshold today could raise the program's an-nual price tag from about $ 5.3 billion to a bout $12 billion if the average federal service grant per HeadStart enrollee remained unchanged. The federal cost could be higher, however, for three reasons. First, although the existing programsoften make use of underutilized facilities and volunteerstaff to save costs, significant further expansions ofthe program would be likely to exhaust those opportu-nities. Providing more classrooms and training moreteachers to meet the program's expanded requirementswould require additional resources. Second, a largerprogram would need to attract new teachers awayfrom other jobs and career paths by offering themhigher salaries. Furthermore, to prevent dissatisfac-tion and turnover among current teachers, their sala-ries would probably have to be raised as well. Third,for the positive effects of the model preschool pro-grams to carry over to Head Start, many Head Startteachers probably would need increased training, andthe program would have to provide an expanded arrayof services to participants and their families. Achieving 100 percent enrollment of low-income 3- and 4-year-olds would be very unlikely, however\u2014thus reducing the cost of the option. First, many par-ents prefer home-based care, irrespective of the avail-ability and cost of center-based care. Second, thehalf-day schedule of most Head Start centers conflictswith the schedules of some working parents. It might 22. Deanna S.

Improving Elementary and Secondary Education The federal government will provide approximately $24 billion in aid to elementary and secondary schoolsin the 2000-2001 academic year to fund a range ofactivities. Some aid supports improved education forchildren who are poor or have disabilities; other aidfinances education reform and school improvementinitiatives. The government's first major effort to aid public elementary and secondary education (the Title I pro-gram) began in the mid-1960s as part of the war onpoverty. Experience since then has shown that in-creasing the quality of schools that poor children at-tend can go only a small way toward closing the gapbetween their academic achievement and that of theirhigher-income peers. Other factors, such as difficulthome situations and detrimental neighborhood influ-ences, can undermine the efforts of schools to increaseachievement but are much more difficult to addressthrough federal policies. Federal spending on disad-vantaged children through state grants for Title I totals$7.9 billion in 2000, or about one-third of all federalspending on elementary and secondary education. In 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Educa- tion Act (IDEA) became law, requiring states andschool districts to provide a free, appropriate publiceducation to children with disabilities. Doing so isvery expensive. By some estimates, the cost of edu-cating a disabled child is two to two-and-a-half timesthe cost of educating a nondisabled child, althoughthat figure probably varies widely among states andschool districts. 24 In passing IDEA, the Congress au- thorized a federal contribution for each disabled childserved of up to 40 percent of the national average per- pupil expenditure (APPE) for all students. At about$5 billion, however, current federal f unding gives states only about 13 percent of the APPE. Providingstates with the 40 percent amount would require anadditional $11 billion a year, assuming that the num-ber of children identified as disabled remained un-changed. Since the early 1990s, federal education policies have focused on a very different way of improvingeducation outcomes. Along with continuing to aidspecial populations of students, those policies haveencouraged broad-based education reform and schoolimprovement. Proposals to increase the effectiveness of U.S. schools range from state-level, top-down strategies tograss-roots strategies that address local problems. Anexample of a top-down strategy is one that would re-quire states receiving federal funds to develop stan-dards for what children should know in various gradesand help states develop assessments of students' per-formance in various subject areas. An example of agrass-roots strategy is one that would support localgroups who want to start new public schools (calledcharter schools) that implement specific educationstrategies appropriate to local needs. Another exam-ple is one that would create vouchers by tying Title Ifunding to disadvantaged students; those attendingunderperforming schools could be given the option ofattending another public or private school, with theTitle I funds following the student to the new school. Other recent proposals would strive to improve schools by expanding or improving the inputs into theeducation process. Some proposals would support theprofessional development of teachers in areas such asscience and math or would improve the quality ofteachers by funding mentoring programs that team upexperienced and inexperienced teachers. Other pro-posals would support state and local efforts to im-prove school facilities, including constructing and ren-ovating school buildings and bringing Internet accessto classrooms. The quantity and quality of teachers are critical determinants of a school's success. Public elementaryand secondary schools today employ over 2.7 millionteachers. About half of them have a master's degree, 24. M.T. Moore and others, Patterns in Special Education Service Deliv- ery and Cost (Washington, D.C.: Decision Resources Corporation, 1988).38 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 and the median teacher has more than 15 years of teaching experience. Their average salary is an esti-mated $42,000 a year, and the starting salary is about$27,000. Increasing the number of teachers in the early grades, thereby reducing class size, could be a tangibleway to improve education outcomes. The averageclass size in elementary schools is about 24 studentsper teacher. The Congress appropriated $1.2 billionfor academic year 1999-2000 and $1.3 billion for2000-2001 to help reduce class size to 18 students perteacher in grades 1 through 3, and proposals havebeen made to continue and increase that amount. Because average class size differs across states and school districts, the best method of allocating fed-eral funds is not obvious. Funds could be distributedto jurisdictions according to the amount they wouldneed to reduce their class size to a target level, but thatmethod would give the greatest reward to those juris-dictions that had made the least progress on their ownin reducing class size. Giving all jurisdictions thesame amount of funds per student would avoid thatoutcome, but it would not necessarily result in the av-erage class size falling to the target unless some juris-dictions reduced their class size below the target. The best research evidence on the effectiveness of smaller classes on student achievement is Tennes-see's STAR project. 25 Children entering kindergarten were randomly assigned to small classes of 13 to 17students and regular classes of 22 to 26 students.Through third grade, students in small classes outper-formed those in regular classes on both standardizedand curriculum-based tests. In fourth grade, all stu-dents went to regular classes. Nevertheless, at leastthrough eighth grade, a decreasing but still signifi-cantly higher level of achievement persisted for stu-dents who had been in the small classes. Reducing class size in grades 1 through 3 from the current estimate of about 22 students per teacherto 15 would require hiring approximately 250,000 ad-ditional teachers. Paying those additional teachers atcurrent beginning compensation levels would cost about $9 billion per year. The salaries of current and new teachers would probably have to be raised to meet the extra demand,however. Those higher salaries could add another $4billion to $8 billion annually to the price of this option,assuming that salaries of all elementary teachers roseby 5 percent to 10 percent. Additional costs would beincurred to recruit and train teachers, to give salaryincreases in future years, and to build the added class-rooms that would be needed to accommodate thelarger number of classes. The task of reducing class size would be made even harder by the impending retirement of a largeshare of current teachers. Nearly 50 percent of ele-mentary and secondary school teachers today are age45 or older. Finding replacements for those experi-enced teachers when they retire would add consider-ably to the difficulty of expanding the overall numberof teachers. Promoting Greater Investment in Higher Education Enrollment rates in postsecondary schools have in- creased in recent years, as have the returns on a col-lege education. However, the cost of postsecondaryeducation has also grown, having outpaced the growthin family income for more than two decades. The federal government has long promoted atten- dance at colleges and trade schools. Perhaps the mostimportant goals of federal policies for higher educationare to remove the financial barriers to attendancefaced by low-income students and to keep college af-fordable for middle-income families. To help achieve those goals, the Congress cre- ated several programs, including a federal student loanprogram in 1959, the Pell grant program in 1972, andtax credits for postsecondary education in 1997. Lastyear, the student loan program provided $31 billion inloans to about 5 million students at a federal cost ofapproximately $4 billion. The Pell grant program pro-vided more than $7 billion in aid to nearly 4 millionstudents with very low income. And for the 1998 tax 25. E. Ward and others, Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR): Tennessee's K-3 Class-Size Study (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee State Department of Education, 1990). CHAPTER ONE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES 39 year, about 8 million filers received an estimated $4 billion in education tax credits and deductions for in-terest on student loans. About 80 percent of students from upper-income families now enroll in college or trade school immedi-ately after high school graduation. Less than 50 per-cent of students from low-income families enroll, evenwith the availability of significant amounts of federaland other aid. Federal student aid has been increased several times in recent years: o The interest rate on nearly all federal student loans was reduced by 0.8 percentage points in1998 through 2003. o The maximum Pell grant was increased in- crementally from $2,900 for academic year1997-1998 to $3,300 for 2000-2001. o Tax credits of up to $1,500 for tuition expenses and tax deductions for interest expenses on stu-dent loans were created. The Effectiveness of Student Aid in Increasing Col- lege Attendance . The availability of student financial aid\u2014from the original GI bill to the more recent fed-eral grant and loan programs\u2014has allowed many stu-dents to attend college or trade school who otherwisewould not have and others to continue their postsec-ondary education further. On the basis of a recentstudy of students' experiences in the 1980s, a $1,000 increase in grant aid to all high school graduateswould increase the proportion attending college ortrade school by 4 percentage points. 26 Similarly, ac- cording to another study, a $1,000 difference in tuitionat public two-year colleges was associated with a 7percentage-point difference in enrollment rates among18- and 19-year-olds. 27 There was no disproportionalgrowth in enrollment by low-income youth, however, after the Pell grant program was established in themid-1970s. Overall, it appears that young people aresensitive to the cost of continuing their education be-yond high school but that problems in understandingand applying for financial aid may deter college atten-dance, particularly among youth whose parents did notattend college. Although the size of the effect is difficult to esti- mate, federal aid does induce some students, particu-larly those from low-income families, who would nothave attended college or trade school to enroll in post-secondary education. It also increases the length oftime some lower-income students remain in school. However, the aid also subsidizes many students whowould have attended school without it. Increasing Pell Grants . One option would target ad- ditional aid toward students with low income by ex-panding the maximum award in the Pell grant pro-gram. That award could be increased from its currentappropriated level of $3,300 to the full authorizedlimit of $5,100 in 2001. Doing so would raise the costof the Pell grant program from $7.9 billion to a bout $15 billion. Most of the added funding would go to the esti- mated 3.8 million current Pell grant recipients, whoseaverage award would rise from $2,070 to about$3,400. The higher limit would also raise the numberof current students who are eligible for Pell grants,adding about 600,000 new recipients to the program.Finally, raising the maximum Pell grant would inducesome young people to enroll who previously foundcollege or trade school too expensive. An estimated300,000 new students would be added in that way. In addition, the more generous aid would in- crease the number of affordable choices available tosome young people already attending school. Somestudents might transfer from a two-year college neartheir home to a state four-year college a greater dis-tance away. Others might give up jobs to focus en-tirely on school. Several other considerations would affect the desirability of increasing the federal grant. Pell grantsare available to any low-income student who has grad-uated from high school or passed the General Educa- 26. Susan M. Dynarski, Does Aid Matter?

Many students who enroll in college drop out before graduating, in part becausesome of them are probably not adequately prepared.Increasing the amount of financial aid that is availablemight not be productive without taking steps to betterprepare students. One way to motivate students to prepare for col- lege is to make them aware of available aid early intheir school career. Some analysts believe thatmiddle-school students are generally unaware of theamount of federal aid that is available to them andmight therefore underestimate their ability to go tocollege. Programs to make all seventh or eighth gradestudents more aware of college aid might improvetheir preparedness for, and enrollment in, college. A final consideration is that a large part of the return on higher education today is a private benefit.College graduates with a bachelor's degree earn sub- stantially more than people with only a high school di-ploma. Furthermore, attending college enriches stu-dents' lives in other ways that are long lasting and ex-tend to their children. Because students enjoy most ofthe benefits, one can argue that they should bear mostof the cost. Accordingly, the role of federal policymight be to ensure that students who want to attendschool are not prevented from doing so by temporaryfinancial constraints; that could be achieved by in-creasing the availability of education loans. Althoughfinancing their education with loans increases theamount of debt the students amass by the time theyleave school, federal policies already exist to provideborrowers with options for repaying loans that makethe burden more manageable. For example, borrowersmay extend the repayment period beyond the usual 10years or choose graduated payments that rise overtime with expected increases in income.1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010510152025Percentage of GDP Actual Proj.Chapter Two Cutting Taxes Federal tax revenues will claim a postwar record 20.3 percent of gross domestic product in fiscalyear 2000 (see Figure 1). The Congressional Budget Office projects that revenues measured as ashare of GDP will decline over the next few years to19.8 percent, a level that is still higher than in anyyear before 1998 other than the last two years ofWorld War II. In light of that situation, the Congressmay want to use some of the projected surplus to cuttaxes. If so, it will face two issues: how much to re-duce revenues and how to accomplish that reduction.Making choices among alternative approaches requiresan understanding of the current structure of the federaltax system as well as of the criteria that may proveuseful in evaluating any tax change. Figure 1. Total Revenues as a Share of GDP(By fiscal year) SOURCE: Con gressional Bud get Office.The Federal Tax System The federal tax system will raise nearly $2 trillion in fiscal year 2000 (see Table 3). Over 90 percent ofthat revenue will come from income and social insur-ance taxes. Individual income taxes are the largestsource, accounting for nearly half of the total. Socialinsurance taxes, levied primarily to support SocialSecurity and Medicare, make up another third. Theremainder splits roughly evenly between the corporateincome tax and a variety of smaller revenue sourcesincluding excise taxes, the estate and gift tax, customsduties, and miscellaneous levies. The Individual Income Tax Americans are most familiar with the individual in-come tax and its recurring April 15 deadline. Al-though it has many complexities, the basic structure ofthe tax is straightforward: add up income from vari-ous sources; subtract exclusions, standard or itemizeddeductions, and personal exemptions to determine tax-able income; apply graduated tax rates to assess basictax liability; and subtract various credits to calculatefinal liability. The tax falls most heavily on people atthe top of the income distribution: those in the highestquintile\u2014the fifth of families with the highest in-come\u2014pay over three-fourths of the total revenuefrom the individual income tax (see Table 4). By con-trast, families in the bottom three-fifths of the incomedistribution pay just 7 percent of the tax, and becauseof the earned income tax credit, the lowest quintile asa group actually receives a net payment. 42 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 That distribution reflects two developments in the 1990s. First, tax acts in 1990 and 1993 added three new tax brackets to the 15 percent and 28 percentbrackets set in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86). The new brackets\u2014with rates of 31 percent, 36percent, and 39.6 percent\u2014sharply increased the taxespaid by high-income families. At the same time, theincome of families facing the higher rates rose muchmore rapidly over the decade than did overall income,making a markedly larger share of total income sub-ject to the higher rates. Finally, the earned income taxcredit (EITC) was greatly expanded in the early1990s. Those changes combined to boost the share ofindividual income tax liability in the top quintile from72 percent in 1991 to 77 percent just four years later. The changes were also an important cause of revenuesfrom the tax growing from 7.7 percent of GDP in1992 to 9.9 percent in 2000 (see Figure 2). The rate structure of the individual income tax makes it the most progressive of the major sources ofrevenue; that is, the tax measured as a share of in-come\u2014the effective tax rate\u2014rises most sharply asincome increases. In 1995, families in the lowest in-come quintile faced a negative effective tax rate, -5.6percent, compared with 6.1 percent for the middlequintile and 16.2 percent for the highest quintile. Table 3.

The taxes, which are often referredto as payroll taxes, principally comprise several sepa-rate levies. The tax that finances Social Securityequals 6.2 percent of wage, salary, and self-employ-ment income up to a taxable maximum ($76,200 in2000) paid by both employer and employee. Thus, thetotal Social Security tax is 12.4 percent of earnings up to the maximum. The Medicare tax has no cap andequals 1.45 percent of earnings, again paid by bothemployer and employee to yield a total tax of 2.9 per-cent. Economists generally agree that the entire pay-roll tax is actually paid by workers because theirwages are lower by the employer's share of the tax.Smaller taxes finance unemployment benefits and re-tirement benefits for railroad and government workers.

NOTES: Families are groups of individuals living together. Individuals not living with relatives are included as one-person fam ilies. Individual income taxes are distributed directly to families paying those taxes. Corporate income taxes are distributed to fam ilies according to their share of capital income. Social insurance (payroll) taxes are distributed to families paying those taxes directly, or indirectly through their employers. Federal excise taxes are distributed to families according to their consumption of the taxed good or service. Pretax family income is the sum of wages, salaries, self-employment income, rents, taxable and nontaxable interest, dividends, realized capital gains, and all cash transfer payments. Income also includes the corporate income tax and the employer's share of Socia l Security and federal unemployment insurance payroll taxes. For purposes of ranking by adjusted family income, income for each family is divided by the poverty threshold for a family of that size. Quintiles contain equal numbers of people. Families with zero or negative income are excluded from the lowest income category but are included in the total.44 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010024681012Percentage of GDP Actual Projected Individual Income Taxes Social Insurance Taxes Corporate Income Taxes Excise TaxesFrom 1960 to 1988, payroll taxes climbed sharply as a share of GDP, rising from 3 percent tonearly 7 percent. The share of payroll taxes is about 7percent today and will remain at about that level undercurrent law. For most families, the payroll tax nowexceeds their income tax. Nearly three-fourths of fam-ilies who pay either tax face a combined employer/employee payroll tax that is greater than their incometax liability. The cap on earnings subject to the Social Secu- rity tax and the fact that income other than earnings isnot taxed combine to impose somewhat higher payrolltaxes, measured as a percentage of income, on middle-income families than on those at the top or bottom ofthe income distribution. In 1995, families in the low-est income quintile incurred payroll taxes equal, onaverage, to 7.8 percent of their income, compared with10.7 percent for families in the middle quintile and 7.9percent for those in the top quintile. Other Federal Taxes One-sixth of federal tax revenues come from varioussources, none of which yields as much as one-tenth ofthe total.The Corporate Income Tax . After falling from 3.6 percent of GDP in 1962 to just over 1 percent in theearly 1980s, the corporate income tax has reboundedsomewhat to claim roughly 2 percent of GDP thisyear. The recent rise resulted primarily from TRA-86and from generally higher corporate profits in the1990s. CBO projects that that percentage will declineslightly over the next decade. The tax currently pro-vides just under one-tenth of total federal revenues,but that share is expected to fall over time. Althoughthe tax has four rates, the first two (15 percent and 25percent) apply only to corporate income below$75,000; the higher two (34 percent and 35 percent)differ only slightly. At least 80 percent of corporateincome is taxed at the highest rate. Regardless of how they are levied, taxes are paid by individuals, not by corporations. Various theorieshave been advanced to explain how the burden of thecorporate income tax might be borne by workers, own-ers of corporate capital, or owners of capital gener-ally. Most economists now agree that all or nearly allof the tax falls on the owners of capital, both corpo-rate and noncorporate. Since the nation's capitalstock is owned primarily by people at the upper end ofthe income distribution, the tax falls most heavily on Figure 2. Revenues, by Source, as a Share of GDP (By fiscal year) SOURCE: Con gressional Bud get Office.CHAPTER TWO CUTTING TAXES 45 the wealthy and is therefore progressive. In 1995, families in the top income quintile effectively paid cor-porate income taxes equal to about 4.9 percent of theirincome, compared with 1.3 percent for families in themiddle quintile and 0.5 percent for those in the lowestquintile. Excise Taxes . Excise taxes, which are levied on such goods and services as gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, andtelephone use, represent a small and declining share oftotal federal revenues. Most of those taxes are leviedon the quantity rather than the value of goods, andrates have generally not kept pace with inflation. Inthe early 1960s, excise taxes were just over 2 percentof GDP; this year, they will be only about one-third aslarge, or 0.7 percent. Because consumption claims a smaller share of income as income rises, effective excise tax rates arehigher for families at the lower end of the income dis-tribution than for those at the top. Families in the low-est income quintile faced an average effective rate of3.3 percent in 1995, compared with 0.7 percent forfamilies in the top quintile. Estate and Gift Taxes . The estate and gift tax com- bines the taxation of assets given away during a per-son's life and bequests made at death. The tax appliesonly to large estates and gifts. Under current law, es-tates valued at less than $675,000 are exempt fromtaxation, but those valued at more than $675,000 aretaxed at rates ranging from 37 percent to 55 percent. 1 Annual gifts in excess of $10,000 per recipient aresubject to similar levies. The $675,000 exclusion,which applies to the lifetime sum of taxable gifts andbequests, is scheduled to increase incrementally to $1million by 2006 and remain at that level. By contrast,the $10,000 a nnual limit on gifts increases to keep pace with inflation since 1997, but only in $1,000 in-crements. Revenues from the estate and gift tax have grown rapidly in recent years, nearly tripling from $11 billionin 1991 to a projected $32 billion in 2001. Even so, the tax is relatively small. CBO projects that revenuesfrom that tax will claim only 0.3 percent of GDP overthe next decade. Furthermore, the tax affects few tax-payers: less than 2 percent of estates incur any taxliability\u2014just over 100,000 estates in 1998. Gift taxreturns, which may be filed annually and may or maynot involve tax liability, are more numerous\u2014about260,000 in 1998\u2014but they represent less than 0.5 per-cent of all taxpayers. 2 Assessing the distributional impact of the estate and gift tax is difficult. Measured with respect to thewell-being of decedents and gift-givers, the tax isclearly highly progressive; only the largest estates andgifts pay any tax. Some economists argue, however,that it is more appropriate to assign the burden of thetax to beneficiaries. Unfortunately, research yieldsincomplete and conflicting findings about the distribu-tional impact of the tax from that perspective. Customs Duties and Miscellaneous Receipts . The final pieces of federal collections are customs dutiesand miscellaneous receipts. Customs duties grow overtime in tandem with imports and claim about 0.2 per-cent of GDP. Tariff reductions enacted in 1994 willcontinue to phase in over the next few years and con-strain any growth in revenues from that source. The largest component of miscellaneous receipts is the profits of the Federal Reserve System, which areturned over to the Treasury and counted as revenues.The other major source of receipts is the UniversalService Fund, collected from the telecommunicationsindustry to finance Internet service for libraries andschools and to subsidize basic telephone service forhigh-cost areas and low-income households. Thosetwo and other, smaller components of receipts equalabout 0.4 percent of GDP, a level that is projected toremain fairly constant. 1. Rates actually range from 18 percent to 60 percent. However, rates below 37 percent apply only to that part of an estate below the$675,000 exemption and are therefore irrelevant. The 60 percent rateapplies to that part of an estate valued between $10 million and about$17 million in order to phase out the benefits of the graduated estatetax brackets.2. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gave taxpayers an incentive to file gift tax returns, even if gifts were below the $10,000 limit. Under theact, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may not question the informa-tion on those returns after three years. If no return is filed, the IRSmay audit gifts when an estate tax return is filed upon the taxpayer'sdeath.46 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Criteria for Assessing Tax Changes Any examination of potential tax changes requires a set of criteria by which to evaluate the effects on indi-viduals and the economy as a whole. Economists fo-cus their evaluation of taxes on three characteristics: o Efficiency\u2014the impact of the tax on economic activity and growth, o The fairness of the tax with respect to who bears its burden, and o The costs of complying with and collecting the tax. Those three criteria are often in conflict, however, and the Congress faces inevitable trade-offs in its decisionson tax policy. Efficiency Taxes change behavior. Consumers buy less of taxedgoods and more of untaxed goods. People decidewhether and how much to work on the basis of theirafter-tax wages and thus may choose to work lesswhen income taxes are higher. Firms pick productionmethods on the basis of input costs after taxes\u2014usingless machinery, for example\u2014in the face of highertaxes on capital. And individuals make decisionsabout saving on the basis of after-tax returns. All ofthose responses distort the economy from the way itwould be in the absence of taxes and may lead toslower economic growth and thus a lower level of na-tional well-being. Typical estimates of the economiccost of a dollar of tax revenue range from 20 cents to60 cents over and above the revenue raised. 3 Those negative effects do not mean, however, that taxes have only negative effects. Some taxes mayinduce behavior consistent with other policy goals;cigarette taxes lead to a reduction in smoking and its associated costs, and emission taxes cause firms toshift to production methods that pollute less. Further-more, the government needs revenues to carry out itsvarious functions. Nevertheless, economists agree thattaxes should distort behavior as little as possible, con-sistent with other objectives. In general, that meansnot levying taxes that affect some activities more thanothers. Economists generally refer to minimizing dis-tortions as maximizing efficiency. Fairness Unfortunately, maximizing efficiency can mean im-posing taxes that many people feel are unfair. Themost efficient tax from an economist's viewpoint is ahead tax\u2014a specific levy on every individual, regard-less of his or her well-being. Because liability undersuch a tax does not depend at all on behavior, the onlydistortion comes from the revenue collection itself.However, few people would argue that the U.S. gov-ernment should pay its bills by charging every citizen$7,000 (the total of gross government expendituresdivided by the total number of citizens). Most wouldview such a head tax as inherently unfair. Rather thanfocusing only on maximizing efficiency, the countryfaces trade-offs between doing what is best for theeconomy and what is fair. Economists have developed various ways of as- sessing fairness. Horizontal equity occurs when peo- ple in equivalent economic positions have the same taxliability; that is, equals are treated equally. The majordifficulty in interpreting that metric comes in defining\"equals.\" Much of the complexity of the individualincome tax derives from the various adjustments toincome, such as personal exemptions and itemized de-ductions, that are intended to yield a measure of tax-able income defining \"equals.\" Any such measure,however, is open to interpretation and debate. Vertical equity occurs when tax liabilities rise with ability to pay, often interpreted as having moreincome. Progressivity measures that characteristic.

A tax that claims the same per-centage of income from all taxpayers is termed pro- portional. Vertical equity can be assessed in terms of either effective tax rates (tax liability as a percentage ofpretax income) or the effect of the tax on the distribu-tion of after-tax income. The two approaches arequite different but yield comparable assessments of agiven tax. A progressive tax, for example, has effec-tive tax rates that rise with income and generates amore equal after-tax distribution of income. But thatconsistency fails to hold when evaluating a change intaxes. For example, a tax reduction that cuts all ratesof a progressive tax by the same percentage has noeffect on relative effective rates; relative shares of thetotal tax bill are unchanged. However, the changeraises after-tax income much more for families at thetop of the income distribution than for those at the bot-tom, thus increasing inequality. The choice of metricmatters. Complexity and Collection Costs The costs of collecting taxes are net losses to the econ-omy. Taxes that cost less to collect raise more netrevenue relative to resources taken from the economythan do more expensive alternatives. The collectioncosts include both the costs the government incurs inadministering and enforcing the code and the costs thepublic incurs in complying with it. Administrativecosts are frequently associated with the ease of eva-sion. Compliance costs are usually associated withcomplexity. Complexity in the tax system largely results from features of the tax code that are designed to affect be-havior by taxing some endeavors more or less thanothers. Those features include activities that are ex-empt from tax, from various deductions for preferreditems, and from credits for undertaking certain actions.As a consequence, many of the same aspects of thesystem that reduce economic efficiency also increasecomplexity.In a number of instances, complexity also arises from efforts to achieve vertical equity. For example,the phaseouts of various tax credits and deductionsthroughout the code are designed to give benefits onlyto people with the greatest need, but they make taxesmore difficult to calculate. Similarly, the earned in-come tax credit provides wage subsidies to low-in-come families but requires them to fill out an addi-tional form. And the alternative minimum tax is in-tended to limit the use of incentives by higher-incometaxpayers but requires taxpayers to recalculate theirtax liability in an entirely different way and then paythe larger of the regular and alternative taxes. In some cases, complexity results from trying to make the code efficient. That occurs most frequentlyin the case of business taxation, in which considerablecomplexity stems from the need to define income con-sistently so that it may be taxed with a minimum ofdistortion. Minimizing complexity, therefore, in some in- stances involves a trade-off with vertical equity andefficiency. In other instances, probably most, it isconsistent with horizontal equity and greater effi-ciency. All else being equal, taxes that are simplerand easy to enforce are preferred in order to minimizethe costs of collection. Ways to Reduce Revenues Given the near-record levels of federal revenues as a share of GDP, the Congress may want to use some ofthe projected surplus to cut taxes. In doing so, itfaces two issues: how much to reduce revenues andwhich approach to use in making that reduction. Cutsneed not be restricted to a single approach; differentapproaches can be combined into a package that ac-complishes the desired reduction in revenues. TheCongress can choose from a range of approaches, in-cluding: o Broad-based tax cuts that affect most taxpayers;48 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 o Tax cuts aimed at reducing particular disincen- tives in the current tax system; o Tax cuts designed to simplify the tax system or improve compliance; and o Tax cuts that provide new incentives for particu- lar types of behavior. Options based on each approach may have different effects on the complexity of the tax code, incentives ordisincentives for particular behavior, and the distribu-tion of after-tax income among families and individu-als. Estimates of the amount of revenue that would be lost under each of the options discussed in this chaptershould be viewed as approximate. Unlike the revenueestimates provided by the Joint Committee on Taxa-tion (JCT) for the options in Chapter 4, the estimatesfor options in this chapter come from CBO. Making Broad-Based Tax Cuts Two federal taxes\u2014individual income taxes and thepayroll taxes funding Social Security and Medicare\u2014affect most families. Consequently, cutting either orboth of those taxes is the easiest way to provide sub-stantial across-the-board tax relief. Individual Income Taxes . Rapidly rising incomes over the past decade have caused individual incometax revenues to climb more sharply than GDP, reach-ing 9.6 percent of GDP in 1999, the highest level ever.Although much of the increase in revenues has comefrom the concentration of income gains in the top in-come brackets that face the highest tax rates, manyobservers argue that the increase calls for some formof across-the-board cut in individual income taxes.Such a cut would lower top tax rates toward levelsexperienced in the early 1990s and could have positiveeffects on both incentives to work and the nationalsaving rate. Most evidence suggests that income taxes mod- estly reduce incentives to work because they reduceafter-tax wages. The negative effects are particularlystrong for workers who are not their family's principalearner. Lowering income tax rates would decrease those disincentives and result in an expansion of thenational labor supply. Evidence with respect to theeffect of income taxes on saving is weaker, but manyanalysts have concluded that they also reduce the in-centive to save. Hence, reducing tax rates would alsoreduce the disincentives to save that may exist andcould lead to an increase in the national saving rate. More important, because it taxes some income- producing activities and not others, the income taxcode distorts choices about production, consumption,and portfolio allocation. Those distortions result ineconomic inefficiency\u2014too much activity in areassubject to lower or no tax and too little activity inareas subject to higher taxes. Lowering tax rates re-duces those differentials and consequently improvesefficiency. Since some of those distortions were delib-erately enacted to encourage particular activities suchas home ownership and charitable giving, however,lowering tax rates can lead to less of what has beenlegislatively deemed to be desirable behavior. Across-the-board rate cuts may be implemented in various ways that have differing consequences forthe distribution of income. The two most commonlysuggested methods are cutting all rates by a given per-centage or by a given number of percentage points.Either form of rate cut could accomplish any level ofdesired revenue reduction, determined by how muchrates are lowered. CBO expects nearly $1 trillion inindividual income tax revenue in 2001, so a 10 percenttax cut would reduce tax liabilities in that year byabout $100 billion. Cutting all individual rates by 2.2percentage points would yield about the same revenueloss. Regardless of how rates were reduced, however,taxpayers would not realize the full benefits unless thealternative minimum tax (AMT) was also adjusted topreclude the lower tax rates from making more returnssubject to the AMT. A proportional cut\u2014say, 10 percent in all tax rates, including capital gains and the AMT\u2014wouldnot affect the progressivity of income tax rates. How-ever, because the individual income tax is the mostprogressive part of the federal tax system, reducingincome taxes while leaving other taxes unchangedmakes overall federal taxes less progressive. Further-more, because the effective tax rate facing high-income taxpayers would be reduced more in terms ofCHAPTER TWO CUTTING TAXES 49 percentage points, such a cut would make the distribu- tion of after-tax income more unequal and would thusreduce progressivity under that measure. A rate cut that reduced all tax brackets by the same number of percentage points would actually in-crease the progressivity of tax rates by making propor-tionately larger cuts in the lower rates. However,since low- and middle-income families face relativelylow effective tax rates, their total taxes would be cutby a smaller percentage than would the taxes of otherfamilies. Payroll Taxes . Most families pay more in payroll taxes\u2014deductions from paychecks to fund Social Se-curity and Medicare\u2014than in income taxes. Cuttingtaxes that finance Social Security (the Old-Age, Survi-vors, and Disability Insurance program, or OASDI)and Medicare's Hospital Insurance program couldthus have a greater impact on most families thanwould cutting income taxes by the same total amount.Cuts in payroll taxes would have the same kind of ef-fects on work incentives as cuts in the individual in-come tax. However, the incentives of workers withearnings above the taxable maximum would not beaffected by a reduction in OASDI tax rates. Further-more, because payroll taxes do not apply to invest-ment income, cutting them would have less of an effecton incentives to save than cutting income taxes would.Finally, because payroll taxes are a larger share oftotal taxes for low- and middle-income families thanfor those with higher income, cutting payroll tax rateswould increase the overall progressivity of the tax sys-tem. An immediate 10 percent reduction in the Social Security and Medicare tax rates would reduce revenueby about $60 b illion in fi scal year 2001. The reduc- tion could be scaled to produce a greater or smallerlevel of tax reduction. For a fixed amount of revenuereduction, cutting the Social Security tax rate wouldfocus more tax relief on low- and middle-income fami-lies than would a change in the Medicare tax rate be-cause of the limit on earnings subject to the Social Se-curity levy. One concern about cutting payroll taxes is the effect on the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.Although the trust f unds currently have positive bal- ances, the retirement of the baby-boom generation willdeplete them rapidly. Trust fund balances, however, can be misleading. Transfers to the trust funds, forexample, will not by themselves provide the resourcesfor future benefits. Ultimately, it is not the size of thebalances in the trust funds that will limit the ability tomeet long-term obligations but the amount of the bene-fits and the size of the economy. Reducing Particular Disincentives of the Tax System Rather than provide broad-based tax relief, the Con- gress might choose to focus tax cuts on particulargroups of taxpayers. Marriage pena lties and estate taxes are two aspects of the current tax system thatobservers have frequently identified as in need ofchange. The double taxation of corporate income hasalso drawn the criticism of many tax experts. Marriage Penalty . Many married couples who file a joint return have higher tax liabilities than they wouldif they were allowed to file as individuals or heads ofhousehold (single taxpayers with dependents). At thesame time, many other married couples pay lowertaxes than they would if they filed as individuals.Whether a couple incurs a marriage \"penalty\" or re-ceives a marriage \"bonus\" depends on the spouses'relative incomes: penalties generally occur whenspouses have similar incomes, and bonuses occurwhen only one spouse works or when spouses havesubstantially different earnings. Penalties tend to belarger for couples who have dependents that wouldqualify them to file as heads of household if they werenot married. Just over 40 percent of married couples incurred marriage penalties averaging $1,480 in 1999, andabout 50 percent received bonuses averaging $1,600.Overall, however, bonuses totaled $43 billion, about$10 billion more than total penalties. High-incomecouples were more likely to incur penalties and lesslikely to receive bonuses than those with lower in-come. About 70 percent of both penalties and bonusesaffected couples with income above $50,000. Any tax system that treats married couples as single taxpaying units subject to progressive tax rateswill have marriage penalties, bonuses, or both. One50 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 way to reduce the penalties would be to allow couples to choose to file either jointly or individually. Thatoption would erase all penalties other than those asso-ciated with the head-of-household filing status andwould not affect couples with bonuses. However,couples with the same amounts of income would nolonger face the same tax liabilities. Beyond allowing married taxpayers to choose their filing status, penalties can be reduced by lower-ing the taxes of penalized couples, increasing the taxesof other taxpayers, or both. Some options would in-crease tax revenues. For example, requiring all mar-ried couples to file individual tax returns would elimi-nate all marriage penalties but only at the cost of in-creasing the tax liabilities of couples now receivingbonuses. Alternatively, tax brackets and standard de-ductions could be made less generous for individualsand heads of household, thus raising their taxes. Thatchange would reduce penalties for some married cou-ples and increase bonuses for others. Other options would reduce both tax revenues and marriage penalties. The options differ in howmuch of the tax relief goes to couples incurring penal-ties and where in the income distribution the tax reliefoccurs. For example, setting the standard deductionfor married couples equal to twice that for single filerswould reduce penalties by about 6 percent at an an-nual cost of roughly $5 billion. That approach wouldfavor low- and middle-income couples: penalized cou-ples with annual income below $50,000, who incurjust over one-third of total penalties, would get two-thirds of the tax savings. But half of the tax reductionwould go to couples not now incurring penalties. Al-ternatively, setting both the standard deduction and taxbracket widths for joint filers to twice those for indi-vidual filers would offset roughly 40 percent of totalpenalties at an annual cost of about $40 billion. But itwould focus that reduction on higher-income couples:more than 90 percent of the cut in penalties would goto those with income above $50,000. Another option would restore the two-earner de- duction that existed between 1982 and 1986. Thatprovision allowed two-earner couples to deduct fromtaxable income 10 percent of the earnings of thelower-earning spouse, up to a maximum of $3,000.That approach would reduce current marriage penal-ties by more than one-fourth at an annual cost ofabout $12 billion. Roughly 80 percent of the revenue loss would go to reducing current penalties. Most ofthe benefits would go to higher-income families: cou-ples with income over $50,000\u2014those most likely tohave two earners\u2014would get more than four-fifths ofthe tax reduction. Like other ways of reducing mar-riage penalties, that option would also widen the dis-parity of treatment between married and unmarriedcouples. A related issue involves marriage penalties asso- ciated with the earned income tax credit. Since manylow-income families pay no income tax, most of theirmarriage penalty results from the loss of the EITCbecause the percentages and income levels determiningthe credit do not differ by marital status. As a result,two single parents could lose as much as $5,310 of theEITC if they married. Setting the credit parametersfor couples to twice those for individuals would elimi-nate that penalty, but it would also give the EITC tocouples who would not qualify at all if they had to fileas individuals. The penalty could be reduced some-what at significantly lower cost by phasing the creditout more slowly for couples than for individuals, butthat approach would leave many couples facing sub-stantial penalties. Regardless of the approach taken,any option to reduce marriage penalties that does notaddress the EITC would leave in place much of thepenalty for low-income families. The Estate and Gift Tax . The only federal tax on wealth is the estate and gift tax, which imposes levieson large estates and gifts. Proponents of the tax assertthat it provides limited redistribution of wealth andgives people an incentive to donate to charities. It alsoserves as a backstop to other taxes, taxing income thatwould otherwise go untaxed. Critics complain that thetax leads to the breakup of family farms and busi-nesses, discourages saving, and induces costly effortsto avoid paying the tax. The tax may create problems for family-owned farms and businesses, primarily because estates domi-nated by family enterprises may lack the liquid assetsneeded to pay the tax. However, many small busi-nesses are able to undertake tax planning, such as pur-chasing life insurance to cover any estate tax liability,to mitigate the effects of the tax. Even so, the levycould force the sale of part or all of the enterprise andthus might jeopardize its viability. Provisions in theCHAPTER TWO CUTTING TAXES 51 tax reduce that effect by allowing estates to spread payments over time. Despite anecdotal evidence aboutthe adverse effects of the estate tax on family busi-nesses, however, no research has revealed whether thetax actually contributes to the breakup of such enter-prises. In 1995, about 2,000 small businesses andfarms, roughly defined, incurred any estate tax liabil-ity; those enterprises paid less than 4 percent of allestate tax revenues. Some critics have argued that because the estate tax reduces the size of bequests that can be passed onto heirs, it reduces the incentive to save. The likeli-hood of such an effect depends on the reasons peoplehave for leaving bequests. On the one hand, if peoplebase decisions on the trade-off between their own con-sumption and their heirs' consumption, the tax shiftsthe balance toward their own consumption and theywould tend to save less. On the other hand, if peoplewant to leave particular levels of inheritance, the taxforces them to save more to reach their goal. Empiri-cal studies have reached no consensus on the neteffect. Although the estate and gift tax accounts for less than 2 percent of federal revenues, its effect on thedistribution of federal taxes among income groups issubstantial. Measured in terms of the giver, the estatetax falls primarily on high-income families because iteffectively exempts all but the largest estates. As aconsequence, eliminating the tax would substantiallyreduce the progressivity of the federal tax system. Thedistributional consequences of the tax are less clear ifthe burden of the tax is assumed to fall on beneficia-ries. The estate and gift tax may influence more than personal saving. Because the tax does not apply tocharitable contributions, it may encourage donationsto charitable activities. Significantly lowering the taxcould reduce such gifts. The estate tax also interactswith the taxation of capital gains. Under current law,gains incur tax liability only when realized; accruedgains held until death escape the income tax becauseheirs receive assets with their basis set to the currentvalue (that is, \"stepped up\" from the decedent's basisto the value at his or her death). Because of that step-up in basis, accrued gains would avoid taxation en-tirely if the estate tax was removed. Many proposalsfor modifying the estate tax would therefore either taxany accrued gains at death or require that beneficiaries assume the decedent's basis. A major criticism of the estate tax is that it leads the owners of significant assets to pursue complicatedstrategies in their attempt to mitigate or avoid the taxliability. Such activity not only involves potentiallygreat expense but may also result in inefficient use ofassets and inequitable treatment of taxpayers, onlysome of whom undertake actions to lower their taxes.Furthermore, the tax's complexity imposes large com-pliance costs; conservative estimates place the cost atbetween 5 percent and 10 percent of revenue collected.Eliminating the tax, or even substantially increasing itsexemption level, would mitigate both effects. Although estate and gift tax receipts are pro- jected to total about $32 billion in 2001, eliminatingthe tax could have a larger or smaller effect on federalrevenues, depending on changes made to other parts ofthe tax code. For example, if the step-up in basis forcapital assets was also removed, the lost revenue fromthe estate tax could be offset by increased incometaxes on capital gains if taxpayers deferred fewer oftheir gains until death. Similarly, because the estatetax can significantly lower the after-tax cost of spend-ing during one's lifetime, removing the tax could leadto lower levels of deductible expenditures like charita-ble contributions and consequent increases in incometax revenues. Other options would reduce the impact of the tax. Under current law, the exempt value of an estatewill rise incrementally to $1 million in 2006 and re-main at that level in future years. Indexing that ex-emption would keep inflation from raising the percent-age of families subject to the tax, and increasing theexempt amount further could lower that percentage.Alternatively, lowering estate tax rates would reduceincentives for taxpayers to avoid the tax through com-plicated actions. Any of those changes would affectonly the 2 percent of decedents who owe estate taxes,and a rate change would give more of the benefit ofthe cut to the wealthiest families within that group. Double Taxation of Corporate Income . Many econ- omists are concerned that the corporate tax createsdistortions that cause economic inefficiency. Firmspay taxes on their profits, and investors pay additionaltaxes when they receive dividends or realize capital52 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 gains. The tax thus raises the cost of capital and dis- courages investment. More significantly, it createsvarious distortions: between noncorporate and corpo-rate business; between payment of dividends and inter-nal reinvestment of earnings; and between financingwith debt (interest on which is deductible) and withstock issuance (dividends from which are not deduct-ible). All such distortions change how corporationsoperate\u2014in terms of production methods and invest-ment decisions, for example\u2014and thus create eco-nomic inefficiency. The corporate tax will raise nearly $190 billion in 2001, but eliminating it would reduce revenues byless than that amount because both dividends and cap-ital gains realizations would be greater in its absence.Furthermore, removing distortions caused by differen-tial taxation of business activities would improve eco-nomic efficiency, leading to a larger economy and con-sequent higher revenues. Eliminating the corporatetax, however, might not be optimal in terms of effi-cient tax collection. The tax applies to the retainedearnings of firms; those earnings would either escapetaxation under the individual income tax or face lowertaxes because any tax on them is deferred until corpo-rate shareholders receive them as future dividends orrealized capital gains. Two approaches that would lose less revenue than would eliminating the tax involve integrating thecorporate and individual income taxes to reduce oreliminate the efficiency costs that come from doubletaxation. The more complicated approach would re-place the current tax with a comprehensive tax onbusiness income and eliminate taxes on capital incomeat the individual level. The second, more straightfor-ward approach would eliminate either the individual orcorporate taxation of business income within the cur-rent structure. That approach could be implementedin stages by reducing the share of income subject toboth taxes incrementally over a number of years. A final issue involves the distributional effects of reducing corporate taxes. Most economists agree thatthe burden of the current corporate tax falls almostentirely on the owners of all capital, both corporateand noncorporate. Because capital ownership is con-centrated toward the upper end of the income distribu-tion, the corporate tax is progressive. Any reductionin the tax would give the bulk of gains to higher-income taxpayers and would almost certainly reduce the progressivity of the federal tax system. Simplifying the Tax System Particular features of the tax system might also betargeted because they complicate tax filing. Two fea-tures increasingly encountered by taxpayers are thealternative minimum tax and the phaseout of personalexemptions and deductions. Alternative Minimum Tax . The Congress imple- mented the alternative minimum tax in 1969 to preventtaxpayers from using tax preferences so intensivelythat they pay little or no tax. The AMT requires thattaxpayers add some preference items to income andthen recompute their taxes under rules that disallowmost exemptions, deductions, and credits. That re-computation allows a single exemption\u2014$45,000 forjoint filers and $33,750 for single filers\u2014that isphased out completely for high-income taxpayers.The remaining income is then subject to two tax rates:26 percent on the first $175,000 and 28 percent onany excess. Those taxpayers then pay the higher ofthe normal tax or the AMT. The adjustments to the AMT include not just preferences used by high-income taxpayers to avoidtaxes but also commonly used deductions, credits, andpersonal exemptions. As a consequence, manymiddle-income families would fall under the AMT butfor the Congress's repeated exemption of personalcredits from the AMT. That exemption is not perma-nent, however; in 1999, the Congress exempted allpersonal tax credits from the AMT only through 2001.More important, unlike many other dollar values usedto calculate tax liabilities (such as tax brackets, per-sonal exemptions, and the standard deduction), thevalues for the AMT exemption and tax brackets arenot indexed for inflation. As a result, more taxpayersbecome subject to the AMT each year. In any case,even if the AMT does not result in greater tax liability,an increasing number of taxpayers still have to com-pute it to determine their liability. CBO estimates that the number of taxpayers sub- ject to the AMT will grow from 1 million in 2000 to15 million in 2010 if the tax code is not changed.CHAPTER TWO CUTTING TAXES 53 That growth will raise the revenue attributed to the AMT from $5 billion to $35 billion over the decade.Much of the increased impact of the AMT derivesfrom the fact that personal exemptions, the standarddeduction, and tax brackets in the regular tax are in-dexed for inflation but the AMT exemptions and taxbrackets are not. Increasing those two parts of theAMT over time to keep pace with inflation wouldeliminate most of the growth in the AMT's reach. Ifsuch indexation began in 2000, the number of taxpay-ers subject to the AMT in 2010 would fall to about1 million, and the revenue attributable to the AMT inthat year would drop by about three-fourths, to about$9 billion. Eliminating the AMT would further cutrevenues by that amount. Phaseout of Exemptions and Limitation on Deduc- tions. Because of the progressive rate structure of the individual income tax, reductions in taxable income,such as personal exemptions and itemized deductions,are more valuable to taxpayers in high tax bracketsthan to those in low brackets. The tax code reducesthat disparity by phasing out personal exemptions andlimiting itemized deductions for taxpayers with incomeabove specified levels. In 1999, personal exemptionswere phased out for joint filers with adjusted grossincome (AGI) above $189 ,950 and for individual filers with AGI above $126,600; itemized deductions werereduced by 3 percent of AGI above $126,600. Thetwo limitations differ, however, in that personal ex-emptions are phased out completely for taxpayers withthe highest income but most taxpayers keep a substan-tial portion of their deductions. The tax code thus effectively imposes higher tax rates on income in the range over which the exemp-tions and deductions are reduced. The phaseouts alsoadd complexity to the tax code. Eliminating themwould simplify the computation of taxes for affectedtaxpayers at an annual revenue cost of about $12 bil-lion. In addition, it would slightly improve work in-centives for taxpayers who face the higher effectivetax rates on any additional income. The gains, how-ever, would accrue entirely to taxpayers with incomein or above the phaseout range\u2014about 5 million tax-payers with the highest income. Taxpayers with in-come above the exemption's phaseout range wouldreceive tax cuts with smaller changes in their marginalincentives.Expanding or Adding to Current Incentives The Congress might choose to focus tax reductions on people engaging in particular activities it wishes toencourage. Any of the current incentives built into thetax code could be expanded, and the cost would de-pend on how much the current credits or deductionswere raised. For example, the current child creditcould be raised, or the deduction for charitable contri-butions could be extended to families that do not item-ize their deductions. A long list of new incentivescould be added. In recent years, the President has pro-posed expanding the EITC to assist low-income work-ing families and creating new retirement savings ac-counts to encourage private saving. Either changewould probably involve refundable tax credits thatexceed basic tax liabilities in order to reach familieswith little or no tax liability. The excess of those cred-its over basic tax liabilities represents not a change inrevenues but rather an increase in federal outlays. Earned Income Tax Credit . In 2000, the earned in- come tax credit will provide low-income working fam-ilies with up to $3,888 in income tax reduction or, fortaxpayers with low or no tax liability, payments in theform of tax refunds. Of the $30 billion cost of thecredit in 1999, about 85 percent represented paymentsto taxpayers in excess of their tax liability. That por-tion of the credit shows up on the spending side of thefederal budget rather than the revenue side. The EITC has a complicated structure. The credit equals a fixed percentage of earnings up to amaximum that depends on the number of children inthe family. The credit stays at that maximum as in-come rises further, up to a level beyond which thecredit is reduced by as much as 21 cents for each addi-tional dollar of income. That reduction continues untilthe credit falls to zero at a point termed the break-evenincome. The phase-in and phaseout rates and the lev-els of income to which they apply differ depending onwhether the tax unit has no children, one child, or twoor more children, with maximum credits rising acrossthe three groups. The credit is refundable; that is, ifthe credit exceeds a family's tax liability, the familyreceives the balance as a payment.54 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Roughly 13 percent of mandatory federal spend- ing on low-income families is provided through theEITC. Its structure, however, creates both incentivesand disincentives to work. Furthermore, because thecredit is the same for families with two children as forthose with more children, it provides less assistancerelative to need for larger families. Increasing the cred-its would concentrate the benefits of the tax cutsamong lower-income families. Depending on how thecredit was structured, it could improve the incentivesto work. The EITC provides a work incentive for families with earnings in the range over which the credit is ris-ing. Taxpayers with earnings in that range and twochildren, for example, can claim a tax credit equal to40 percent of their wages. Such families receive aneffective wage that is 40 percent greater than that paidby their employers, thus encouraging them to workmore than they would if the wage was unsubsidized.That subsidy is reversed, however, for families withincome in the phaseout range. Those families face aneffective wage that is less than that paid by their em-ployers; the difference between effective and actualwages is the percentage rate of phaseout, roughly 21percent for families with two children. Because theirnet wage (reflecting the loss of the EITC) is lowerthan their gross wage, families in the phaseout rangeface a work disincentive and may choose to workfewer hours (although the credit still provides an in-centive for such families to continue to hold jobs). Phasing out the credit more slowly would reduce the work disincentive for families with income in thephaseout range but would give the credit to familiesearning more than the current break-even income andwould reduce their incentive to work. For example,halving the phaseout rate for taxpayers with two chil-dren from 21.06 percent to 10.53 percent would raisethe break-even income from the current $30,580 to$48,700\u2014roughly the 60th percentile of all familieswith children. That change would extend the credit toabout 4 million families that are not now eligible at anannual cost of roughly $8 billion. The change wouldhave no effect on families with earnings below thephaseout range. Changes to the credit could take many alternative forms. The phase-in percentage could be increased togive larger subsidies to working families with the low- est income. That change would also raise the break-even income unless the phaseout rate was also in-creased. The phase-in range could be extended to in-crease the income range over which wages are subsi-dized, thus encouraging more families to work. Thatmodification would also lift the break-even income andmake more families subject to the work disincentivesof the phaseout. Or the amount of the credit could beraised for families with more than two children, as thePresident has proposed. That approach would affectrelatively few families and would focus added creditson families with arguably the greatest need. For anyof the options, the bulk of the budgetary effect wouldbe to increase outlays for the refundable portion of thecredit rather than to reduce revenue collections. Any expansion of the EITC could increase the complexity of the tax code. Claiming the EITC re-quires completing an additional form, and any changethat raised the break-even income would impose thatrequirement on more taxpayers. Another issue in-volves compliance: taxpayers not in traditional (mar-ried couple with children) families appear to be un-clear about the living arrangements of children thatqualify them for the credit. As a result, many taxpay-ers erroneously claim the credit, either inadvertently orintentionally. In many cases, the Internal RevenueService lacks the information needed to identify suchreturns and may consequently allow the credit for inel-igible taxpayers. Expanding the EITC would worsenthose problems. New Retirement Savings Accounts . The tax code encourages saving in many ways, most commonly bydeferring the taxation of income from savings or ex-empting such income from taxation entirely. Capitalgains are taxed only when realized, traditional individ-ual retirement accounts (IRAs) are taxed when fundsare withdrawn, and the earnings of Roth IRAs arenever taxed. (Unlike the case of traditional IRAs,however, contributions to Roth IRAs come from after-tax income.) Because those incentives to save aregreater for people in higher tax brackets, they dispro-portionately favor high-income taxpayers, who arealready the most likely to save. Taxpayers with AGIabove specified levels may not contribute to eitherkind of IRA, however, and thus cannot benefit fromthose incentives to save.CHAPTER TWO CUTTING TAXES 55 Saving incentives that would give greater encour- agement to lower-income taxpayers could involve re-fundable tax credits, which have equal value to allfamilies regardless of their tax liability. One proposalto create new retirement savings accounts would makeannual deposits to private retirement savings accountsfor all low-income families and individuals and matchaccount holders' contributions up to a fixed annuallimit. The fixed annual contribution would in itself cre- ate no incentives. It might, in fact, reduce private sav-ing to the extent that it would substitute for existingsaving, although that effect could not be large, giventhe near-zero saving rate of low-income taxpayers.Even if some substitution did occur, however, the pro-gram would still increase national saving relative to anapproach that would give equal sums to families butnot require that the money be saved.Unlike the fixed contribution, the matching cred- its would encourage people to save more by increasingthe return to private saving, although the positive ef-fect would be offset somewhat by the increased wealththat the new savings accounts would represent. Thenet effect of the program on national saving is uncer-tain. Economic analyses have reached differing con-clusions about the impact of subsidizing saving. The new savings accounts would concentrate benefits on low- and middle-income families and indi-viduals, particularly when compared with existing sav-ing incentives. They might also introduce a largenumber of families without bank accounts to financialinstitutions and to the benefits of saving. The pro-posal would, however, add significant complexity tothe tax code. Part Two Chapter Three Spending Options Savings for most of the nondefense discretionary spending options in this chapter are estimated in two ways: relative to the freeze variation of the Congressional Budget Office's baseline, referred toas WODI (without discretionary inflation), and r elative to the inflation-adjusted version, or WIDI (with discretionary inflation). Savings for most of the defense options are estimated relative toprogram levels that are assumed to be roughly the same under WODI or WIDI. 050 National Defense Budget function 050 comprises spending for national defense. Although 95 percent of that spending falls within the Department of Defense, function 050 also includes the atomic energy activities of the Depart-ment of Energy and smaller amounts in the budgets of other federal departments and agencies. CBOestimates that discretionary outlays for function 050 will be about $283 billion in 2000. Mandatory spend-ing in that function usually shows negative balances because of payments made to federal agencies. (In1991, those receipts were unusually large because of reimbursements by foreign governments for some ofthe costs of the Persian Gulf War.) CBO's estimate of increased outlays for 2000 would mark the secondconsecutive year of nominal growth in defense spending.

Daschle regarding the estimatedbudgetary impacts of alternativelevels of strategic forces , March 18, 1998.The second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) will require the United States to cut its long-range nuclear forces to 3,500 warheads by 2003\u2014roughlyone-third of the 1990 level. START II was ratified by the Sen ate in 1996, but it faces an uncertain future in Russia's parliament, the Duma. Presidents Clintonand Yeltsin agreed to delay full implementation of the treaty until December 31,2007, in an effort to encourage ratification by the Duma. However, the forces tobe dismantled by that date must be made inoperable by the end of 2003. Today's forces remain largely consistent with the START I treaty\u2014500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with three warheadseach; 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs with 10 warheads each; 18 Trident submarines(each carrying 192 warheads on 24 missiles); and 94 B-52H, 94 B-1B, and 21B-2 bombers. The Administration would achieve the 3,500-warhead limit inSTART II by eliminating all 50 Peacekeepers, four Trident submarines, and 23B-52H bombers by the end of 2007. It would also reduce the number of war-heads on Minuteman III missiles from three to one and on Trident D5 missilesfrom eight to five and redesignate its B-1B bombers as conventional bombers.Although the Administration has decided to eliminate the f our Trident subma- rines over the next five years to save money, it plans to keep all 50 Peacekeepermissiles and 94 B-52Hs in the force until the Duma ratifies START II. This option would reduce U.S. forces to START II levels even if the Duma does not ratify the treaty. Those cuts would be made by the end of 2007, thetreaty's modified implementation date. The primary motivation would be finan-cial; those changes would save $920 million through 2010 relative to the Admin-istration's plans. All of the savings would come from not having to operatePeacekeeper missiles after 2007. (There would be no savings from retiring the23 B-52Hs because the Administration does not operate them today.) Savingscould be $750 million higher through 2010 if the forces were retired by 2003, theoriginal implementation date for START II. If the Duma never r atifies START II and the Air Force is required to keep Peacekeeper in the force bey ond 2010 \u2014when it will run out of miss iles for test flights\u2014there would be significant costs associated with either reestablishing the Peacekeeper production line ordeveloping a replacement missile. Compared with that possibility, this optionmight save several hundred million dollars through 2010. Supporters of this approach argue that keeping long-range forces at today's levels is unnecessary. According to several reports, Russia will have troublemaintaining its forces at START I levels. Many of its missiles and submarinesare nearing the end of their service life, and production of replacements hasslowed to a trickle or stopped altogether. For that reason, several prominentformer opponents of START II in the Duma have recently urged r atification. Some advocates of this option also argue that a dopting it will encourage the Duma to ratify the treaty. Critics argue that U.S. forces should remain at START I levels. They op- pose any unilateral disarmament. They also worry that Russia might build up itsnuclear forces if a hard-line government came to power. In their view, the Dumawill only ratify the treaty if it is faced with a robust U.S. START I force.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 63 050-01-B Reduce Nuclear Delivery Systems Within Overall Limits of START II Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 670 240 2002 420 3402003 620 CBO PUBLICATION: Letter to the Honorable Thomas A. Daschle regarding the estimatedbudgetary impacts of alternativelevels of strategic forces , March 18, 1998.This option would go one step farther than the previous alternative (050-01-A). It would reduce the number of missiles and submarines below the levelsplanned by the Administration for START II but keep the number of warheadsat START II levels. Specifically, it would retire four additional Trident subma-rines and 200 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2003, retain- ing 10 Tridents and 300 Minuteman IIIs. To keep the same number of war- heads, the smaller Trident force would carry seven warheads on each missileinstead of five (see option 050-02). Minuteman III missiles would carry one warhead. This option would keep the same number of nuclear bombers asoption 050-01-A, each carrying an average of 16 warheads. In all, those forceswould carry nearly 3,500 warheads\u2014the limit set in START II. Compared with keeping U.S. forces at START I levels, this option would save $670 million in 2001 and $8.3 billion thr ough 2010. One-fifth of those savings\u2014which were outlined in option 050-01-A\u2014would come from reducing forces to the START II levels planned by the Administration and thus do notrepresent savings from the Administration's budget plan. However, this optionwould save an additional $670 million in 2001 and $7.4 billion through 2010compared with the Administration's plan: $3.1 billion from reduced operationand support costs (from retiring 200 Minuteman ICBMs and four additionalTrident submarines) and $4.3 billion from lower levels of investment spending(from canceling production of the D5 missile after buying 12 in 2000, extend-ing the service life of fewer Minuteman missiles, and forgoing the Administra-tion's plans to reconfigure four Trident submarines under START II so they cancarry new D5 missiles). During the Cold War, this option might have raised concerns about stabil- ity. By putting more nuclear \"eggs\" in fewer baskets, the United States wouldhave increased its vulnerability to a surprise attack. But today those concernsare less acute. The United States may now decide that it can save money safelyby deploying its warheads on fewer weapon systems. Moreover, this optionwould retain three types of nuclear systems\u2014the so-called nuclear triad\u2014andthus provide a margin of security against an adversary's developing a newtechnology that would render other legs of the triad more vulnerable to attack. The disadvantages of this option include those raised in option 050-01-A about cutting forces below START I levels before Russia ratifies START II. Inaddition, carrying more warheads on D5 missiles would reduce the targetingflexibility of U.S. planners, and deploying fewer submarines might increasetheir vulnerability to Russian antisubmarine forces. Unilaterally cutting forceswould also limit the United States' ability to increase the number of warheadsit deployed if Russia decided not to abide by START II. Indeed, some criticsargue that unilateral cuts would reduce U.S. leverage to get Russia to ratifySTART II. Supporters of this option, however, counter that U.S. cuts wouldencourage ratification because they would reduce the United States' potential tobreak out of START II\u2014one of Russia's major concerns about the treaty.64 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-02 Terminate Production of D5 Missiles After 2000 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 670 240 2002 420 3402003 620 4402004 and 050-01-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Rethinking the Trident Force (Study), July 1993.Under both Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START I and II), the Navy plans to deploy a force of 14 Trident submarines. Each one will carry 24 D5 mis-siles\u2014the most accurate and powerful submarine-launched ballistic missile(SLBM) in the U.S. inventory. Today, the Navy has 10 Trident submarinesarmed with D5s and eight armed with older C4 missiles. To keep 14 subma-rines, it must convert four older subs to carry D5s as well. To arm that force,CBO estimates, the Navy will have to purchase a total of 425 D5 missiles, 372 ofwhich it has already bought. If Russia ratifies START II, the Administrationwill probably cut the number of warheads on each missile from eight to five (fora total of 1,680) to keep the number of U.S. warheads near the ceiling allowed bythat treaty. This option would terminate production of D5 missiles after 2000 and retire all eight C4 submarines by 2005. The Navy would then have 372 D5s\u201425more than it says it needs to support a 10-submarine force. Like the Administra-tion's plan for START II, this option would wait to retire the C4 submarines toencourage Russian compliance with START II and to give the United Statesflexibility to stay at higher START I levels if Russia does not comply. To retain1,680 warheads, the option would increase the number of warheads on each D5missile from five to seven. Compared with the Administration's plan for START I and II, this option would save $670 million in 2001 and $4.9 billion through 2010. The savings would come from canceling miss ile production ($2.6 billion), retiring all eight C4 submarines rather than upgrading four of them ($1.1 billion), and operatingfewer subs ($1.2 billion). Terminating production of the D5 would have several drawbacks. Loading more warheads on existing missiles would reduce their range by roughly 20percent, limiting the areas in which submarines could oper ate. It would also reduce the flexibility of the force, since missiles with fewer warheads can covermore widely dispersed targets. Deploying D5 missiles with seven warheadswould also constrain the United States' ability to expand its SLBM force by add-ing back the extra warheads if Russia violated or never ratified START II. In addition, reducing the fleet to 10 submarines could increase its vulnerability toattack by Russian antisubmarine forces. Nevertheless, some people may consider the capability retained under this option sufficient to deter nuclear war. Although the missiles' range and thesubmarines' patrol areas would be smaller, they would still exceed the levelsplanned during the Cold War\u2014when Russia had more antisubmarine forces andthe United States intended to deploy the D5 with eight large warheads (W-88s).Moreover, less targeting flexibility might not reduce the nuclear deterrent: 1,680warheads deployed on 336 miss iles might not deter an adversary any more than if they were on the 240 missiles called for in this option. Also, the smaller likeli-hood of nuclear war and Russia's atrophying nuclear forces may have weakenedthe rationale for the United States to be able to increase its forces rapidly byadding warheads to the D5. In fact, since the U.S. ability to do that is one ofRussia's biggest concerns about START II, adopting this option could makepassage of the treaty more likely.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 65 050-03 Reduce the Scope of DOE's Stockpile Stewardship Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 50 40 2002 120 1002003 200 1702004 280 2502005 340 310 2001-2005 SPENDING CATEGORY: Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Preserving the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Under a Comprehensive Test Ban (Paper), May 1997 .The Department of Energy (DOE) has developed the Stockpile Stewardship Program to preserve the long-term reliability and safety of U.S. nuclear weap-ons without testing them by exploding them underground. To carry out theprogram, DOE plans to continue operating both of its weapons-design laborato-ries (Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore) and its engineering lab (Sandia). Itwill also construct several new facilities to provide data on the reliability andsafety of nuclear weapons as they age. In addition, DOE will conduct \"zero-yield\" subcritical tests at the Nevada Test Site so it can keep enough skilledtechnicians there to be able to resume testing nuclear weapons by explodingthem underground if the United States decides that doing so is in the nationalinterest\u2014a capability that the President has ordered DOE to retain. DOE plans to spend an average of $2.5 billion a year over the next 10 years on what has historically been known as weapons research, development,and testing. To some observers, a budget of that size today is excessive andunnecessary. This option would reduce the scope of the stewardship program by consol- idating the two design laboratories and halting all testing activities at the Ne-vada Test Site. However, it would preserve the other elements of the steward-ship program, including the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrotest (DARHT)facility at Los Alamos and the National Ign ition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore. Taken together, the changes in this option would reduce employ-ment by about 2,000 people. They would also save $50 million in 2001 and$2.8 billion through 2010 compared with the Administration's 2000 budget. Those savings assume that weapons-design activities would be consoli- dated over five years at Los Alamos, which developed most of the weapons thatare likely to remain in the stockpile. Lawrence Livermore's primary focuswould become other scientific research. To ensure that the warheads it devel-oped could be reliably maintained, some designers from Lawrence Livermorewould be relocated to Los Alamos. However, a cadre of weapons scientistswould remain at Livermore to act as an independent review team for Los Al-amos's efforts. To provide them with challenging work, Livermore would keeplarge computational facilities for modeling the complex pr ocesses inside nu- clear weapons and would build NIF as currently planned. (Alternatively, stew-ardship activities could be consolidated at Lawrence Livermore, but the savingswould be lower.) To some people, this option would cut the planned stewardship program too deeply. They believe that the program is the minimum effort necessary tomaintain the nuclear stockpile without underground testing. In their view,scientists will need new facilities to obtain data on reliability that were for-merly provided directly by such testing. They also contend that consolidationwould reduce competition and peer review, result in the loss of some facilitiesthat could not easily be transferred, and eliminate Lawrence Livermore's centralunifying mission (and thus its motivation for excellence). For those reasons,the President has directed DOE to retain both labs. Closing the Nevada TestSite would increase the time needed to resume underground testing if Russia66 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 started a new arms race or the United States discovered a serious problem with its stockpile that could only be cor-rected by testing. Closing the test site would also stopscientists from conducting subcritical experiments tolearn more about how aging affects the plutonium com-ponents in nuclear weapons. To other people, this option would not cut deeply enough. In their view, keeping part of a second lab andbuilding DARHT and the $1.2 billion NIF are unneces-sary to support the nuclear stockpile. Furthermore, theyclaim, those facilities might allow DOE scientists to con-tinue designing and testing weapons and circumvent therestrictions imposed by the Comprehensive Test BanTreaty. Even if DOE has no such intentions, the percep-tion of such a capability could make it difficult to con-vince countries such as India, which are critical ofthe United States' plans to preserve its nuclear weaponsunder a test ban, that the United States has really given up designing new weapons. Critics also argue that NIFshould be funded outside the nuclear weapons program ifit can help scientists understand how to harness fusion forcivilian energy, as supporters claim. Finally, some analysts are fundamentally opposed to a U.S. moratorium on testing (which will become per-manent if the United States ratifies the test ban treaty).They contend that the only way to ensure the reliabilityof U.S. nuclear weapons is to explode those weaponsunderground. They also worry that by halting the devel-opment and testing of new types of weapons, the UnitedStates will lose the skilled people necessary to preservethe stockpile. This option does not address the test bandirectly, but the cuts it would make to the laboratorieswould probably be resisted by test-ban opponents.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 67 050-04 Eliminate Two Army National Guard Combat Divisions Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 247 218 2002 510 4732003 527 Making Peace While Staying Ready for War: The Challenges of U.S.Military Participation in PeaceOperations (Paper), December 1999. Structuring the Active and Reserve Army for the 21st Century (Study), December 1997.The Army National Guard has eight combat divisions. In 1995, the official Commission on Roles and Missions reported that several of those divisionswere not needed to carry out the nation's military strategy of being able to fighttwo nearly simultaneous major theater wars. Overall, the commission said, theArmy has more than 100,000 excess combat troops that are not required forthat security strategy. The commission also argued that the Guard has too manycombat divisions even given its other missions, such as providing forces forrotation during wartime and supporting civil authorities at the state level. This option would eliminate two National Guard combat divisions: one armored division and one mechanized infantry division. Doing so would re-duce the Army's excess combat forces by about 35,000. The Army is planningto convert about 48,000 Guard combat troops into combat-support and combat-service-support troops (through the Army National Guard Division Redesignprogram), but that conversion would still leave the Army with more than50,000 extra combat troops. This option would eliminate most of that excess.(Since the Army has identified a shortage of support forces, this option wouldretain all of the support personnel associated with the eliminated divisions.) The primary advantage of this option is the savings it would generate. Cutting the two divisions would save the Army an average of about $550 mil-lion a year in operating costs over 10 years\u2014funds that could be used to mod-ernize the rest of the Army's active-duty and reserve forces more quickly.Eliminating those divisions could also help the Army avoid some future costs,since the equipment in the two disbanded divisions would not need to be mod-ernized. This option would have several disadvantages, however. First, it would reduce the number of reserve forces available as reinforcements during war-time. But how risky such a reduction would be is unclear, because analystsdisagree about whether Guard combat forces could be ready to fight in time tohelp in a major theater war. Second, these cuts might reduce the Army's flexi-bility by leaving fewer reserve forces to use in peacetime missions. The Armyhas sent reserve combat troops to peace operations such as the l ong-running one in the Sinai Peninsula, and it plans to send more reservists to similar opera-tions in the future. Third, this option would reduce the number of forces avail-able for governors to call on to support missions in the states. 68 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-05 Cancel the Army's Comanche Helicopter Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 42 71 2002 165 1832003 178 2322004 277 2962005 247 278 2001-2005 909 6,270 4,531 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : An Analysis of U.S. Army Helicop- ter Programs (Study), December 1995.Many of the Army's helicopters are beyond the end of their useful service life. Initially, the Army had planned to replace some of those older scout, attack, andutility helicopters with more than 5,000 new Comanche (RAH-66) helicopters.Comanche has had a troubled development program, however. The utilityversion of the helicopter was dropped in 1988 because the program had becometoo costly. In 1990, the size of the planned purchase was reduced from morethan 2,000 aircraft to just under 1,300. Later, the Army delayed the projectedstart of Comanche production from 1996 to 2005. Those changes have caused the procurement cost per helicopter to nearly double since the program began\u2014from $11.7 million (in 2000 dollars) in 1985to $21.5 million, based on current Army estimates. With that cost growth, Co-manche is now more expensive than the Army's Apache (AH-64) attack heli-copter, even though it was developed to be less costly to buy, operate, andmaintain than other attack helicopters. Moreover, the General Acc ounting Office (GAO) and the Department of Defense's Inspector General (DoD IG)have stated that costs could grow by as much as another 30 percent. In addi-tion, GAO recently reported that there are significant risks that Comanche willenter service later than expected and will not work as well as planned. The primary advantage of Comanche over existing aircraft is its sophisti- cated stealth, avionics, and aeronautics technologies. However, some analystswould argue that the helicopter, which was conceived at the height of the ColdWar, will no longer face threats of the same scale or sophistication as those forwhich it was designed. According to the DoD IG, the Army has not reexam-ined the mission requirements for Comanche in any depth since the end of theCold War (although it w ill need to do so in the context of the Army Chief of Staff's new restructuring plan). Comanche is intended both to serve as a scoutfor Apache and to fill the scout and light attack role independently. Butwhether Comanche really does have a unique role to play in Army aviation isunclear. The Army is planning to use Apaches in both scout and attack rolesfor the next 15 to 20 years, as it did successfully during the Persian Gulf War.The Army also used armed scout helicopters, known as Kiowa Warriors, in thePersian Gulf both as scouts for Apache and as light attack aircraft. Moreover,the Army could use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for some scout functions.Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified that U.S. forces used UAVs asscouts in Kosovo effectively and without the risk of losing aircrews. This option would cancel the Comanche program. The Army has already purchased enough Apaches to fill the attack role assigned to 13 of its 18 divi-sions, but it does need to replace the aging Cobras assigned to the attack avia-tion units of the remaining divisions. This alternative would buy 519 KiowaWarriors by the end of 2010 to replace the Cobras still in service. Net savingswould total about $6.3 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Some of the savingscould be used to fund a program to continue development of advanced helicop-ter technologies. Abandoning the Comanche program, however, would meanthat the Army would have to rely on helicopters designed in the 1960s and1970s for years to come.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 69 050-06 Cancel the Army's Crusader Artillery Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 201 117 2002 365 2452003 280 2252004 : DiscretionaryThe Army plans to invest $13.7 billion (in 2000 dollars) to develop and procure more than 1,100 Crusader artillery systems. It considers the Crusader\u2014whichincludes a self-propelled howitzer and a resupply vehicle\u2014to be technologi-cally advanced and significantly more effective than the service's current artil-lery systems. Supporters cite several reasons why Crusader is needed. The Paladin, the Army's most modern artillery system, is too slow to keep up with other combatvehicles when armored forces advance. Its range is shorter than that of severalforeign systems available to potential adversaries. And Paladin's peak firingrate of four rounds per minute is significantly slower than the 10 to 12 roundsper minute that the Army says it needs. Crusader's current design includes anautomated resupply system, which m akes a higher firing rate possible and reduces the crew size to six from Paladin's nine. Crusader is also designedwith more sophisticated automation and better crew protection. Opponents, however, question whether a heavy system such as Crusader has a role in the lighter, more mobile force envisioned for the future Army.Some also question how much improvement Crusader will actually deliver. Itmay be only 9 kilometers per hour faster than Paladin, and it has encounteredtechnical difficulties. The original concept called for a gun using liquid propel-lant. The Army had to abandon that technology in 1996 because of technicaland schedule problems. In addition, some Crusader subsystems embody tech-nological innovations that have not yet been proved, and some have no backupsin case of failure. For example, if the automatic munition reloader fails, Cru-sader will not be able to fire since it cannot be loaded manually. Those techni-cal risks could prevent Crusader from meeting some of the Army's key require-ments, in which case it might be no more effective than current systems. Aspart of a restructuring plan proposed by the Army Chief of Staff, General EricShinseki, the Army is now scaling back its requirements for Crusader to reducethe system's weight and is cutting the number of systems it will buy by morethan 50 percent. This option would cancel the Crusader program and provide funds to procure 550 German PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers (with resupply vehi-cles), which the General Accounting Office has identified as a viable alterna-tive to Crusader. The PzH 2000 fires eight to 10 rounds per minute, and its cross-country speed of 45 kilometers per hour is within the range required forCrusader. Purchasing that system could hedge against potential threats whilefreeing $6.7 billion over 10 years for the Army to pursue other promising tech-nologies. For fire support in fast-moving advances, the Army could rely on thePzH 2000 systems or on the multiple-launch rocket system, which it used suc-cessfully in that role during the Persian Gulf War.70 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-07 Cancel the Army's Tank Upgrade Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 525 85 2002 366 2952003 377 3792004 323 3572005 Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Alternatives for the U.S. Tank Industrial Base (Paper), February 1993.The downsizing of the U.S. military and the unprecedented peacetime invest- ment in modern weapons that occurred in the 1980s have sharply reduced theneed for new weapons. In particular, the Army now has enough of the latesttype of tank, the Abrams, to equip the forces it plans to field for the foreseeablefuture. As a result, the Army does not intend to buy new tanks for at least thenext 15 years. Instead, the Army has proposed upgrading about 1,000 M1s (the first model of the Abrams) to a later configuration, designated the M1A2. Theupgrade program, which began in 1991 and ends in 2003, has two major goals:to increase the capability of Army tanks and to keep the facilities that producetanks in business pending the need for a new tank to repl ace the Abrams. (Most of those facilities are owned by the government and operated by privatecontractors.) In late 1999, the Army Chief of Staff presented a new vision for a much lighter and more rapidly deployable Army. One of its goals is a force that candeploy a brigade in four days, a division in five days, and five divisions in 30days. Another goal is a force that can deploy abroad C-130 transport aircraft.What role heavy, current-generation tanks have in such a force is unclear.Upgrading those tanks might not be the best use of scarce funds. Also, al-though the M1A2 is 20 percent more capable than the M1 (as measured by onescoring system developed for the Department of Defense), converting 1,000M1s to M1A2s would increase the total capability of the Army's 7,880 Abramstanks by only 3 percent. That slight increase in capability would come at ahigh price\u2014a total of about $3 billion over the next 10 years. This option would cancel the Army's upgrade program but would keep some of the major components of the tank industrial base in a mothballed sta-tus. By preserving production facilities, the United States would retain thecapability to make new or existing types of tanks in the future. Mothballing thegovernment-owned facilities would require an in itial investment. But after taking those costs into account, this option would save $525 million in 2001and a total of $2.1 billion through 2010. Those funds could be used to developnew, lighter vehicles for the future Army. Closing the tank production line would have some disadvantages, how- ever. Without an upgrade program, the U.S. inventory would include fewer ofthe most capable M1A2 tanks. As regional powers acquired better tanks, theabsence of M1A2s might erode the United States' advantage in a war, eventhough the M1A1 remains a highly capable tank. Perhaps the most importantdrawback of this option is that some companies that manufacture tank compo-nents might close and thus be unavailable to produce tanks in the event of acrisis. A related concern is the potential loss of workers whose skills areunique to tank manufacturing.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 71 050-08 Reduce Procurement of the Virginia Class New Attack Submarine Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 0 02004 400 302005 440 12,970 5,270 SPENDING CATEGORY: DiscretionaryAs a result of the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Navy is reducing its force of attack submarines from 80 in 1996 to 50 by 2003. To meet that amb itious schedule, the Navy is decommissioning some of its Los Angeles class (SSN-688) submarines before they reach the end of their 30-year service life. (A re-cently released study prepared for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,however, calls for a force of 55 to 68 submarines. An option that examinesincreasing the attack submarine force to 68 appears in Congressional BudgetOffice, Budget Options for National Defense , March 2000.) Even as it is dis- carding older subs, though, the Navy is building newer ones. It ordered threeSeawolf class submarines in the late 1980s and 1990s and is procuring the Vir-ginia class New Attack Submarine (NSSN) to be their lower-cost successor. Thereason for the additions is that the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the Navywill need 10 to 12 very quiet submarines by 2012 to compete with Russia'snewest subs, which have become quieter, making them harder to locate andtrack. The Virginia class submarine is designed to be as quiet as the Seawolf but will be smaller and slower, carry fewer weapons, and not be able to dive as deep.Although the Seawolf was designed primarily to counter the more severe threatposed by Russian submarines in the open ocean, the Virginia is being developedto operate in coastal waters close to potential regional foes. The Navy ordered the first Virginia class submarine in 1998. It plans to buy one Virginia per year from 2001 to 2005 and two or three subs per yearthereafter. Under that plan, 15 Virginia class submarines would be authorizedbetween 2001 and 2010. This option would save money by keeping the Los Angeles class subma- rines in service until the end of their normal 30-year life and slowing procure-ment of the Virginia class. To help maintain the industrial base for buildingsubs and to modernize the fleet, the option would produce one Virginia per yearfrom 2001 to 2010. At that pace, 10 Virginia class subs would be authorizedbetween 2001 and 2010. Producing the Virginia at low annual rates would save a total of almost $13 billion over the next 10 years. Most of those savings would occur after 2005, when the submarines would be produced at a lower rate. (Had CBOreflected a higher force goal in this option, savings would be lower.) During the Congressional debate on producing the third Seawolf, the Navy emphasized that although Russia's economic troubles mean it cannot operate itsnuclear submarine fleet up to potential, it is still buying new, very quiet attacksubmarines at low rates. The Seawolf and the Virginia would both be quietenough to meet the Joint Chiefs' goal of competing with those new Russian subs.Procuring a total of 10 Virginias in addition to the three Seawolfs would enablethe Navy to field a force of 13 very quiet submarines by 2012, meeting the JointChiefs' requirement.72 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-09 Reduce the Number of Aircraft Carriers to Ten and Air Wings to Nine Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 4,460 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Improving the Efficiency of Forward Presence by Aircraft Carriers (Paper), August 1996.The aircraft carrier is the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy. The Administration's de- fense plans call for a fleet of 12 carriers\u201411 active ships plus one, manned partly byreserves, that can also be used for training. Those ships require a total of 10 activeand one reserve air wings. (The number of active air wings is one less than thenumber of active carriers because one of the Navy's carriers is usually undergoing amajor overhaul.) They will also be accompanied by a mix of surface combat ships(usually cruisers and destroyers) and submarines to defend against aircraft, ships,and subs that threaten the carriers. The surface combatants and submarines can alsoattack targets on land. Since the Cold War ended, some policymakers have argued that the United States does not need a force of 12 carriers. The total capability of U.S. tactical air-craft in the Navy and Air Force will substantially exceed that of any regional powerthat seems potentially hostile. Moreover, the capab ilities of U.S. ships are unsur- passed worldwide. This option would immediately retire one conventionally powered aircraft carrier and one nuclear-powered carrier. By the end of 2001, the Navy would have10 carriers (nine active ships and one partial reserve carrier for training purposes).In addition, this option would eliminate two active air wings, leaving eight active andone reserve wings. Compared with the Administration's planned forces, those cuts could save $4.5 billion in 2001 and $24 billion over the next 10 years. Of that amount, $9 billionwould result from not buying new carriers in 2001 and 2006, as now planned. Theremaining savings would come from reduced operating costs associated with retiringtwo carriers and air wings. Those estimates include the cost of decommissioning theretiring ships\u2014roughly $100 million apiece. (Cutting carriers could also reduce thenumber of surface combatants, submarines, and aircraft the Navy would need toaccompany them. Thus, the Navy might save more money on procurement andoperations by not having to buy and operate as many other new ships and aircraft.Conversely, the Navy might need those ships to perform other missions, such asforward presence, once it had fewer carriers.) Although reducing the force to 10 carriers might not impair the United States' ability to fight and win two regional wars (according to one analysis by the Depart-ment of Defense), having fewer ships would limit the Navy's ability to keep threecarriers deployed overseas most of the time. That could substantially increase thestrain put on the carrier force as long as policymakers continued to use aircraft carri-ers to respond to crises or to provide U.S. presence overseas as extensively as theyhave in recent years. With fewer ships available, the time that those ships spent atsea could increase. The high-quality sailors the Navy needs would therefore spendmore time away from their homes and families, perhaps making them less inclined tostay in the service. (An option that would increase the carrier fleet to 14 appears in Congressional Budget Office, Budget Options for National Defense , March 2000.) The Navy might be able to maintain more overseas presence with carriers by bringing new crews to the ships while they were at their foreign posts rather thanwaiting for them to return home. (The Navy does that with some minesweepers.) Inaddition, the Navy could use ships other than carriers (such as large flat-deck am-phibious vessels or Aegis cruisers) to help maintain U.S. presence overseas.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 73 050-10 Use Marine Corps Squadrons to Fill Out Navy Air Wings Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 129 103 2002 265 2292003 273 2592004 at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.The F/A-18 is the workhorse of both Navy and Marine Corps fighter fleets. It has operated from the decks of aircraft carriers and in Marine air wings sincethe early 1980s. The Navy has a requirement for 34 squadrons of F/A-18s forits carrier air wings. (Each squadron consists of 12 planes.) The MarineCorps has 18 squadrons of F/A-18s to provide air support to Marine gr ound forces. To decrease what some critics see as unnecessary redundancy between the Marine Corps and Navy forces, this option would cut six of the Navy's F/A-18squadrons\u2014the planes in two operational carrier air wings\u2014and use six Ma-rine Corps F/A-18 squadrons in their place. That change would result in oper-ating savings of about $300 million per year and a total of $2.8 billion through2010. Investment savings would also result because the Navy could decrease its purchases of the F/A-18E/F by about 185 planes (taking into account the air-craft in the six eliminated squadrons, as well as the additional planes that themilitary would have needed to buy for maintenance and training purposes andto make up for expected attrition.) Assuming those planes were eliminatedfrom the end of the F/A-18E/F procurement program, savings in procurementwould amount to $228 million in 2005 and $12.7 billion over 10 years. Sav-ings from fighter-procurement funds could be especially helpful to the Depart-ment of Defense (DoD) since its planned spending on fighters may exceed theamount it will actually be able to devote to such purchases. DoD may not need all of the F/A-18 squadrons in the Navy and Marine Corps for the type of conflict that is probable today. In the Cold War era,Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fighters would have been likely to operatein different areas during a major European war. Each of the Navy's opera-tional carriers would have needed its full complement of aircraft to provide airsupport for itself and its accompanying ships. Those carriers might well havebeen assigned to other missions that would take them away from the flanks ofNATO, where Marine Corps ground operations were likely to have takenplace. Air Force fighters would have been engaged in combat with fighters ofthe former Soviet Union over central Europe. Thus, the Marine Corps wouldhave had to rely on its own squadrons for air s upport. But today, critics say, even major theater wars will probably be sufficiently confined that aircraft carriers and their air wings will be able to remain in the theater to provide airsupport. Air Force fighters might also be on hand to give air support to Marineforces. When operating in the same area, however, those various fighters face a problem of space. Because Marine Corps F/A-18 squadrons cannot operate from the shorter decks of the amphibious ships that transport marines and theirequipment, those squadrons must use aircraft carriers while at sea. But theycannot operate from carriers that have a full complement of Navy aircraft,because the number of planes associated with today's notional carrier wingsapproaches the number that can actually operate from a carrier deck. Thus, inwartime, either the Marine Corps's or the Navy's fighter squadrons\u2014but not74 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 both\u2014could operate from the carriers' decks. In the face of equipment shortages, the Navy is already using fiveMarine Corps squadrons to fill out its carrier wings. This option assumes that Marine Corps squadrons are kept rather than Navy squadrons. Marine Corps offi-cers argue that the emphasis on both air and ground oper-ations in their training makes them better suited to pro-vide support to Marine ground units than pilots in Navysquadrons are. Moreover, Marine Corps pilots alreadytrain for such operations.This option would have some significant draw- backs, however. It would cut a part of DoD's tactical airforce structure that may be among the most useful in thefuture. Tactical aircraft have made significant contribu-tions in recent conflicts. Fighter and attack aircraft havealso been heavily used in recent peacetime operations, socutting their number could further strain personnel andequipment in the units that remained. But an option suchas this one may represent a force cut that will take placeanyway, if future Administrations and Congresses areunable to devote more funds to fighter purchases. CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 75 050-11 Defer Purchases of the Marine Corps's V-22 Aircraft Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 0 02004 22 32005 637 110 2001-2005 658 113 3,270 : Discretionary RELATED OPTION: 050-14 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Moving the Marine Corps by Sea in the 1990s (Study), October 1989.The V-22 aircraft, which entered production in 1997, is designed to help the Marine Corps perform its amphibious assault mission (seizing a beachhead inhostile territory) and its subsequent operations ashore. The plane's tilt-rotortechnology enables it to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and, bytilting its rotor assemblies into a horizontal position, to become a propeller- driven airplane when in forward flight. As a result, the V-22 will be able to flyfaster than conventional helicopters. The Marine Corps argues that the plane'sincreased speed and other design features will make it less vulnerable whenflying over enemy terrain and will provide over-the-horizon amphibious assaultcapability. Despite all of those advantages, the Bush Administration tried to cancel the V-22, largely because of its price tag. Each aircraft bought for the Marine Corpsis expected to have a unit procurement cost of $61 million, on average\u2014consid-erably more than most conventional helicopters. Nevertheless, the Congress hascontinued to fund the V-22, and the Marine Corps plans to buy a total of 360planes. (The Air Force may eventually buy 50 V-22s for its special-operationsforces, and the Navy plans to buy 48 for combat search-and-rescue missions andfor logistics support of its fleet.) The Marine Corps expects to acquire several other planes at the same time. During many of the years that it is purchasing V-22s, it also plans to buy largenumbers of Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) to replace its short-range bomber, theAV-8B, and its F/A-18 fighter attack aircraft. JSFs are expected to be relativelyinexpensive as tactical fighters go\u2014perhaps 60 percent of the price of the AirForce's sophisticated F-22. But when bought in quantity and combined with thecost of the V-22, their purchase would bring peak annual spending on the V-22 and JSF to about $5.5 billion\u2014roughly five times the amount requested for Ma-rine Corps combat aircraft in this year's budget. (Technically, the V-22 and JSF are bought with Navy procurement funds.) If the Marine Corps cannot increasefunding for those aircraft, it may have to modernize either its fighter f leet, its airborne amphibious assault fleet, or both more slowly. This option would halve the Marine Corps's annual procurement of V-22s during the 2005-2010 period, when both V-22s and JSFs would be bought. As aresult, the service's average funding requirements during those years woulddecrease to about $5 billion. That sum may be more manageable than the Ma-rine Corps's current plan and would save almost $3.3 billion over 10 years. Deferring purchases of V-22s would have drawbacks, however. The cur- rent amphibious assault fleet is made up of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters thatare more than 30 years old, on average. The CH-46s would remain in the fleetuntil their average age approached 50 if the V-22s deferred under this optionwere bought beginning in 2013, when planned V-22 purchases decrease sharply.(If the Marines had to engage in an extensive modification effort to r etain those helicopters longer, the savings shown at left would be lower.) Also, the amphibi-ous assault fleet provides more unique services than the Corps's fighter attackfleet. The Marines can probably count on the Navy's carrier-based F/A-18 air-craft to provide them with additional firepower, but they cannot get aerial am-phibious assault assets anywhere else. Also, cutting V-22 purchases might de-crease the Corps's ability to perform humanitarian missions and other peacekeep-ing activities, which have grown more common in recent years.76 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-12 Reduce Air Force Tactical Forces Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 307 245 2002 632 5502003 050-13-A, 050-13-B, and 050-14 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.Today's Air Force includes about 20 tactical air wings\u201413 on active duty and seven in the reserves. (An Air Force tactical air wing traditionally consists of72 combat planes, plus another 28 for training and maintenance purposes.)Substantial disagreement exists about whether all of those air wings are neces-sary, since U.S. tactical aircraft enjoy overwhelming superiority compared withthe forces of any regional power that appears potentially hostile to the UnitedStates. This option would reduce the Air Force's tactical fighter forces to 18 air wings by the end of 2001. That pace of reductions might be feasible inasmuchas the Air Force has cut the size of its fleet quickly in the past: it eliminated sixair wings between 1990 and 1992 and another six by the end of 1996. Reduc-ing the number of Air Force wings from 20 to 18 would lower the service'soperating costs by $307 million in 2001 and $6.7 billion through 2010. Further savings might be possible if the Air Force accompanied the force reduction with a reorganization that increased the number of planes per squad-ron and eliminated more squadrons. That practice (known as \"robusting\")allocates resources more efficiently, since each squadron or wing has high fixedcosts. Increasing all Air Force squadrons to 24 planes could add significantlyto the savings shown at left, though only if the Department of Defense (DoD)restructured units and bases to reduce overhead costs. A reduction to 18 Air Force wings might leave the United States with an acceptable number of capable fighters. Even in terms of simple numbers, U.S.fighter inventories exceed those of any potential regional aggressor. Also, U.S.aircraft are more sophisticated than those of potential enemies. However, retaining only 18 wings in the Air Force would not meet the military's current estimate of its requirements. Today's force planning assumesthat the United States needs to be able to fight virtually simultaneous wars intwo regions of the world\u2014one in the Middle East and another, perhaps, in Asia. Winning two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts would require aminimum of 20 air wings, DoD has suggested. Some analysts would also argue that additional cuts in Air Force wings ignore a major lesson from the Persian Gulf War: that aerial bombardment bytactical aircraft can be very effective and may greatly accelerate the end of awar, thus reducing loss of life among U.S. ground troops. The recent war inKosovo was waged chiefly by U.S. and allied air forces, further emphasizingtheir key role in future conflicts. A sizable inventory of tactical aircraft\u2014perhaps more than would be maintained under this option\u2014might therefore bea wise investment.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 77 050-13-A Reduce Purchases of the Air Force's F-22 Fighter Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 320 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.The F-22 is being developed as the Air Force's next premier fighter aircraft and is scheduled to begin replacing the F-15 soon. But the plane has experiencedrepeated delays, reductions in quantity, and increases in price during its almost20-year development. This option would decrease the planned purchase ofF-22s by 219 planes. Assuming that the reduction was evenly distributed overthe F-22's purchase period, it would save a total of $22.2 billion through 2010,although the savings would not begin until 2002. (A related option, 050-13-B,would cancel production of the F-22 altogether.) The Air Force originally planned to buy more than 800 F-22s. After a series of cuts, the latest plan will buy only 339 aircraft\u2014enough for about threeair wings. Even if the Air Force makes no further cuts to planned purchases, itwill have to pay $120 million apiece for the F-22. That price will purchase anumber of improvements in capability over other fighters. Even so, the F-22'scost makes it the most expensive fighter ever built. The F-22 is the only tactical fighter program to survive from the Cold War period. (The other two fighters that the Department of Defense is plan-ning\u2014the Joint Strike Fighter and the Navy's F/A-18E/F\u2014entered develop-ment after 1990. They are likely to be both less capable and less expensivethan the F-22, although they may face many of the same threats.) The F-22'ssophistication and cost, plus concerns about whether the plane will actuallyrealize promised improvements in capability, have led some people to suggestthat the F-22 is a legacy of the Cold War\u2014a plane designed to fight manysophisticated Soviet fighters rather than the modest regional fighter forces it ismore likely to encounter today. Such critics recommend canceling the program,or at least cutting planned procurement further. In its report on its fiscal year2000 defense appropriation bill, the defense subcommittee of the House Com-mittee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the plane's cost and capa-bility. The Senate concurred and the Congress directed DoD to complete test-ing of the F-22 before spending procurement funds on production. The Air Force could reduce production quantities to a total of 120 F-22s, enough to let the service field one air wing of the sophisticated fighters. Such a\"silver-bullet\" purchase would allow the Air Force to learn lessons about pro-ducing aircraft of the F-22's technological complexity but might still leave morethan enough planes to perform the missions for which the service needs the F-22's degree of stealth and other performance advantages. One possible disadvantage of this option is that it would make the Air Force's fighter fleets, which are already aging under current plans, even older.However, buying 219 F-15s to replace the cut in F-22s would remedy thatproblem. Although the F-15 is much less capable than the F-22, it is far morecapable than the fighters of almost any of the United States' regional adversar-ies. A one-for-one offset of F-15s for F-22s lower the 10-year savingsfrom this option to $10 billion.78 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-13-B Cancel Production of the Air Force's F-22 Fighter Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.As option 050-13-A discussed, although the Air Force has great hopes for its new F-22 fighter, the aircraft's development program has experienced numer-ous delays, reductions in quantity, and increases in price over almost 20 years.If the program does not deliver as promised\u2014or if leaders in the Congress andthe Department of Defense (DoD) decide that the plane's capab ilities are too expensive to afford in today's budget environment\u2014the F-22 could be can-celed. Doing that without making any provisions for replacing the plane wouldsave $3.1 billion in 2001 and a total of $43 billion over 10 years. If F-22 pur-chases were offset with F-15s, savings would drop to $2.4 billion in 2001 and$25 billion over 10 years. Outright cancellation would save more money than a \"silver-bullet\" pur- chase of F-22s (as described in option 050-13-A). But it would have severaldisadvantages. Cancellation of the F-22 could affect development of the JointStrike Fighter, since DoD expects the two planes to have common design ele-ments. In addition, the U.S. military might need the F-22's stealthy design andother characteristics if other countries improved their fighter capabilities. Fi-nally, if beginning another top-of-the-line fighter program to replace the F-22proves necessary, some of the costs already incurred in developing the F-22could be paid again in a new development program, adding to the government'soverall costs.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 79 050-14 Slow the Schedule of the Joint Strike Fighter Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 687 407 2002 -73 at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.One of the military's most ambitious aircraft development programs is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. Variants of the JSF are intended to replaceplanes in the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps; they account for two-thirdsof the fighter aircraft the military expects to buy through 2020. The Depart-ment of Defense (DoD) intends to develop and begin purchasing the JSF by2005\u2014only nine years after the plane's first acquisition milestone. That inter-val is about 40 percent less than the time DoD has spent developing the F-22,the other new jet fighter it is developing from scratch. Many experts questionwhether DoD will actually be able to keep to such a tight schedule in a programthat is supposed to produce three versions of the aircraft for three services. This option would postpone fielding the JSF by two years to make the program's schedule more closely reflect recent experience with fighter develop-ment. That slowdown in development and production would decrease require-ments for funding by $3 billion over the next five years and $22.3 billionthrough 2010. The program office expects to need a total of about $23.4 b illion to de- velop the three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter: an inexpensive multirolefighter for the Air Force; a longer-range, stealthy, ground-attack plane for theNavy; and a short-takeoff/vertical-landing fighter for the Marine Corps. (Thatsum includes about $1.3 billion invested by several foreign governments, in-cluding the United Kingdom's, that expect to purchase one or more of the vari-ants.) The JSF program amalgamated three fighter programs that had beenunder way: the Air Force's multirole fighter, the Navy's the MarineCorps's ASTOVL program. Although the JSF variants will perform signifi-cantly different missions, they are expected to have much in common. DoDwants them to be more capable than current-generation aircraft but onlyslightly more expensive, if at all. Satisfying the diverse needs of prospective users of the JSF could be challenging. Nevertheless, DoD plans to begin buying the planes just six yearsfrom now. The Joint Strike Fighter became a major defense acquisition pro-gram in May 1996; under the current schedule, the first formal review will takeplace in 2001, when the program is s cheduled to enter the engineering and manufacturing stage of development (EMD). The JSF would then be producedin 2005, just four years after EMD began and nine years after it became amajor acquisition program. The F-22 program, by contrast, has already beenrunning for 14 years and may take a year or more to enter low-rate production(see options 050-13-A and 050-13-B). Some analysts might argue that the F-22's experience is not a good indicator for the JSF, since the F-22 was expectedto represent a greater technological leap over its predecessor. But with theJSF's multiple missions and sponsors and the services' ambitious cost goals forthe fighter, others might argue that the JSF program will be even more com-plex. If the original JSF schedule is actually attainable, delaying it by two years would have several major drawbacks. Despite saving money in the near term,the delay could add to development costs. In addition, delay would exacerbate80 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 the aging problem of DoD's fighter fleets. Even under current plans for the JSF, when large-scale deliveriesbegin toward the end of the next d ecade, fighters in the Navy and Marine Corps fleets will be an aver age of al- most 15 years old. The Air Force fighter fleet will aver-age almost 20 years of age when that service receivesbulk deliveries of JSFs. Both averages exceed the agesat which each of those services has retired fighter planesin the past.If, however, delays in developing the JSF are inevi- table, a less ambitious, more realistic schedule would addto neither costs nor fleet ages. Revising the JSF schedulewould permit DoD to plan its future courses of actionbetter. For example, actions to deal with fleet agingmight include buying more current-generation aircraft ormodifying the planes in existing fleets.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 81 050-15 Create Common NATO Airlift and Cut U.S. C-17 Costs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 1,893 2742003 943 SPENDING : Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Moving U.S. Forces: Options for Strategic Mobility (Study), February 1997. Assessing Future Trends in the Defense Burdens of Western Nations (Paper), April 1993.The C-17 Globemaster III is a four-engine transport aircraft that can carry at least 110,000 pounds of cargo for 3,200 nautical miles without aerial refueling. Because it is designed to land at sm all airfields with short runways, the C-17 could help meet transport needs within a th eater of combat as well as over long distances. The current plan for transporting U.S. forces to regional conflictscalls for a fleet of 120 C-17s. At the same time, seven of the United States' Euro-pean allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are planning tobuy a total of 289 transport aircraft to carry reaction forces to crisis spots outsidethe territory of NATO members, in accordance with NATO's Strategic Concept. This option would create a common NATO airlift fleet of 20 C-17s (similar to the common NATO AWACS fleet based in Germany, for which the UnitedStates pays 41.5 percent of oper ating and modernization costs). Twenty C-17s that the Air Force plans to buy in 2002 and 2003 would be transferred to NATO,which would reimburse the Air Force for them by the beginning of each year inorder to comply with full-funding requirements. The average cost of thoseplanes is about $200 million apiece. A common NATO airlift fleet would enable the allies to deploy forces to a crisis zone, while allowing the Un ited States to draw on those assets for non- NATO missions under the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept approvedin 1996. That concept allows NATO members\u2014with consensus from the alli-ance\u2014to use NATO assets for missions other than defense of a member state. Assuming that the United States paid 41.5 percent of the cost of the NATO airlift fleet, this option would achieve net savings for the United States of $3.1billion over five years and $4.0 b illion over 10 years, including net savings of about $200 million per year in operation and support costs once all 20 aircraftwere delivered. It also would give the European allies faster access to strategicairlift than would otherwise be the case. This option would face two main obstacles, however. The first is the Euro- pean countries' desire to protect their defense industries by building their ownstrategic transport plane. The seven countries involved have committed to a jointprogram to develop the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), to be produced by theAirbus consortium. That plane would carry less cargo than the C-17 and becheaper (at $75 m illion apiece). Alternatively, the Europeans could consider buying Airbus commercial aircraft, although such planes are more difficult to load and unload, cannot carry very large cargo, and cannot land on some shorteror unpaved runways. Enthusiasm for developing the FLA is waning, however.In an indication that they will consider alternatives, Britain, France, Spain, andBelgium have all so licited bids from U.S. firms for a total of 143 aircraft, and Britain intends to lease four C-17s or their equivalent. The second obstacle involves the political ramifications of relying on NATO to provide part of the U.S. Air Force's lift capability. The CJTF concept,designed to let European coal itions act without U.S. involvement, is new and evolving. Conceivably, if a NATO member opposed a mission (such as Franceopposing military action against Iraq), it might be able to veto U.S. use of NATOassets. Some Members of Congress might find that saving money would notoutweigh the risk of diminishing the U.S. ability to act unilaterally if necessary.82 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-16 Cut Requirements for Pilots in Nonflying Positions Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 145 115 2002 204 1842003 238 Christopher Jehn, Assistant Director, NationalSecurity Division, on PilotRetention: Issues and PossibleSolutions, before the Subcommitteeon Military Personnel of theHouse Committee on ArmedServices (Testimony), March 4,1999.The Air Force and the Navy have fewer pilots than their stated requirements call for. In 1999, both services reported shortfalls of more t han 1,000 pilots. The two services have undertaken several initiatives to address that problem,including paying special bonuses under the Aviation Continuation Pay pro- gram. But despite those efforts, pilot shortfalls are expected to persist for theforeseeable future. This option would use an additional approach to address that problem: reducing the stated requirements for pilots in nonflying positions. Cutting thoserequirements by two-thirds would save $115 million in outlays in 2001 and$2.7 billion over 10 years by reducing the number of pilots who would need tobe trained. Both the Air Force and the Navy have many more pilots than they need for critical cockpit or flying positions. The shortfalls reflect the fact that theservices have included many nonflying positions in their requirements for pi-lots. At the end of 1998, for example, nearly one-fourth of the Air Force'sroughly 13,400 pilots were in nonflying positions, as were about half of the Navy's 6,600 pilots. Supporters of this option would argue that some of the nonflying billets identified as requiring pilots are already being adequately filled by personnelwith other backgrounds. In addition, the services could employ aviation navi-gators in some nonflying positions that require the expertise of a pilot. The principal disadvantage of this option is that reducing the number of nonflying positions reserved for pilots could limit pilots' opportunity to gain thebroader experience they need to progress in their careers. That problem mightbe alleviated, however, if the Air Force and Navy established a fly-only careerpath specifically for pilots who wanted to spend all 20 years of their militaryservice in flying assignments. (Some pilots have indicated that they joined themilitary to fly and might be willing to stay in such a career path even if it lim-ited their ability to be promoted.) A fly-only career path would lessen thenumber of nonflying positions needed to provide pilots with career-broadeningopportunities. Another disadvantage of this option is that it might not leaveenough shore billets for Navy pilots to rotate into between their tours at sea.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 83 050-17 Restructure the Officer Corps Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 -242 35 2002 123 Drawdown of the Military Officer Corps (Paper), November 1999.As part of the post-Cold War drawdown in the military, each of the services cut its officer corps significantly. Those cuts, however, were accompanied by achange in the composition of the armed forces. The ratio of enlisted personnelto officers declined from 6.0 to 1 in 1989 to 5.2 to 1 in 1999 because the officercorps was cut by a smaller percentage than enlisted personnel. The percentageof senior officers\u2014those in the general or flag grades as well as the so-calledfield grades (major through colonel)\u2014increased. The percent age of officers who entered the military through the service academies also rose. This option would offset those apparent consequences of the drawdown. It would return the enlisted-to-officer ratio and the percentage of general andflag-level officers to the levels that existed in 1989, when the drawdown began.In addition, the percentage of newly commissioned officers trained in the ser-vice academies would be reduced. The option would also reduce the number offield-grade officers, restoring the limits on those positions to levels consistentwith the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act before the drawdown.Compared with the Administration's budget request for 2000, those changeswould save $35 million in outlays in 2001 and a total of $12 billion through2010. In carrying out the drawdown, the services tried to protect officers who were already in the force, many of whom had based their career expectationsand financial plans on continued military service. The decline in the enlisted-to-officer ratio suggests that those efforts may have created an unbalancedforce. The services might argue that the decline was driven by changing re-quirements as a result of new technologies and military doctrines that havedecreased the need for enlisted personnel relative to the need for officers. Butsome critics see the timing of the shift as suspicious. Moreover, when thedrawdown began, none of the services expected that their future requirementsfor enlisted personnel would fall as much as they did relative to requirementsfor officers. This option would restore the enlisted-to-officer ratio to the 1989level of 6.0 to 1 by reducing the size of the officer corps by about 15,900 andincreasing the size of the enlisted force by an equal amount. That reduction would be targeted primarily toward officers in the field, general, and flag grades. The percentage of general and flag officers would bereduced gradually to the 1989 level by restricting promotions into those grades.Reductions in the field grades could be achieved by encouraging officers toleave the service voluntarily, through such programs as the temporary earlyretirement authority (TERA), voluntary separation incentive (VSI), and specialseparation benefit (SSB). Over a period of four to five years, the number of general or flag officers would be reduced by about 200 thr ough attrition, while about 12,600 field- grade officers and 3,100 junior officers (second lieutenant through captain)would be separated. Assuming that field-grade officers with less than 20 yearsof service would receive TERA and those with 6 to 15 years of service wouldreceive VSI or SSB, the savings in pay would initially be offset entirely by the84 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 cost of separation payments. Net savings in pay would amount to a total of $9.6 billion through 2010. Supporters of this option would argue that the ser- vices' actions have resulted in a force that is too seniorand contains more officers than needed to lead the re-maining enlisted personnel. In their view, much of theexpertise and combat readiness that senior officers pro-vide could be obtained at lower cost from highly capablesenior enlisted personnel and junior officers. Opponents,by contrast, might argue that separating additional seniorofficers would constitute a breach of faith because itwould cut short the careers of some service members.Moreover, the services' efforts to implement theGoldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986and the Defense Acquisition Workforce Act of 1990 mayhave increased requirements for those relatively seniorofficers. This option would also return the mix of academy and nonacademy graduates entering active duty to thelevel that prevailed before the drawdown. Although thenumber of students in the service academies declined dur-ing the drawdown, academy graduates account for 14percent of new officers now compared with 9 percent inthe early 1980s. U nder this opti on, the total number of officer accessions would remain at the level planned bythe Department of Defense, but the services would drawmore officers from lower-cost commissioning programs \u2014the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and Offi-cers Candidate School/Officer Training School (OCS/OTS)\u2014and fewer from the more costly service acade-mies. The estimated savings from that action reflect onlythe costs that would change in the near term, such as op-erating expenses and pay for faculty and cadets. Thosesavings would be partially offset by additional costs ofabout $350 million over 10 years to procure officers fromOCS and ROTC to replace those from the academies. Asa result, this change would save $75 million in outlays in2001 and a total of nearly $2.4 billion through 2010. Inthe longer term, savings might also accrue from changesin the academies' physical plant. Supporters of changing the mix of new officers might argue that the academies are larger than many suc-cessful private colleges and that additional cuts to themare feasible. Moreover, a balanced mix of academygraduates and accessions from other commissioning pro-grams may be needed to maintain good civil/military re-lations and ensure that the officer corps reflects the fulldiversity of U.S. society. Opponents of that changewould contend that the service academies are the bestsource of future military leaders and that academy gradu-ates are well worth the dollars spent on them. Some op-ponents might also argue that the academies have alreadyreduced their class size to the minimum efficient level.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 85 050-18 Deny Unemployment Compensation to Service Members Who Leave Voluntarily Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 134 134 2002 145 1452003 162 1622004 181 1812005 188 188 2001-2005 1,852 1,852 SPENDING CATEGORY: Discretionary and MandatoryMany military personnel who voluntarily leave active-duty service are eligible for unemployment benefits. That situation contrasts with the situation of civil-ian workers\u2014who must have left their job involuntarily to qualify for unem-ployment compensation\u2014even though payment amounts for the two gr oups are calculated the same way. This option would subject former military personnel to the same rules as members of the civilian labor force; in other words, only personnel who left theservice involuntarily would be eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Thatchange would reduce the number of departing personnel eligible for benefits byat least two-thirds and save an average of $185 million annually through 2010.Because the Department of Defense ultimately reimburses the Department ofLabor for the cost of unemployment payments to former service members, mostof those savings ($1.8 billion through 2010) would occur in the defense budget.A small portion of the savings ($57 million through 2010) would occur in theDepartment of Labor's budget. (The latter savings would be in mandatoryspending.) Most personnel who leave military service do so voluntarily. Many choose not to reenlist after completing a term of service; others, who haveserved for a minimum of 20 years, opt for voluntary retirement. A muchsmaller group is separated involuntarily for reasons related to job or promotionperformance or, in recent years, to the drawdown of military forces. Althoughthe pressures associated with the drawdown may have blurred the line betweenvoluntary and involuntary separation in the past, the end of the drawdown hasrestored that distinction. Proponents of this option would argue that in addition to saving money, it would subject military personnel to the same rules as the rest of the workforce.Thus, in their view, it would make more equitable use of an entitlement pro-gram that was established with the intent of aiding people who lost their jobinvoluntarily. Critics, by contrast, might argue that the frequent moves associated with military service mean that members who separate voluntarily are unlikely totake up residence in the area of their final posting, making it difficult for themto find a new job before they leave the service. In those critics' view, voluntaryseparation from military service is not comparable with voluntary terminationof civilian employment and therefore should not be subject to the same restric-tions on eligibility for unemployment compensation.86 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-19 Downsize the Military Medical System Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 -241 050-20 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Restructuring Military Medical Care (Paper), July 1995.The extensive medical system run by the Department of Defense (DoD) is the chief source of health care for some 5.3 million people in the United States.DoD's primary justification for the system is that it is necessary to ensure carefor service members in wartime. During peacetime, the system trains medicalpersonnel for war and provides care for active-duty service members, retirees,and dependents of both groups. This option would substantially reduce the size of DoD's direct care system, cutting the number of beds in military facilities to the amount that DoDwould need to care for two-thirds of the casualties it anticipates from twonearly simultaneous major wars. As part of that downsizing, DoD would con-vert many military hospitals into outpatient clinics, close other facilities, andreduce the number of active-duty physicians. This option would also discon-tinue the Tricare program for retirees and all types of dependents, requiringthem to seek care in the civilian sector. Those younger than 65 would be of-fered coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) pro-gram, and those 65 or older (who now receive care at military hospitals andclinics only when space is available) would use their Medicare coverage andany private insurance they obtained. Such restructuring of the military medical system would require additional spending in the near term but would offer substantial savings later on. Totalnet savings in outlays would be nearly $28 billion through 2010. That estimatereflects savings from operating a smaller military system, assuming that DoDfaces the same upward pressures on the cost of care that private-sector provid-ers and insurers do. It also takes into account higher Medicare spending (asolder military beneficiaries rely more heavily on their Medicare benefits), thecosts of closing facilities, and the costs of providing FEHB coverage to benefi-ciaries younger than 65. Under this option, DoD would pay the same share ofthe premiums for FEHB health plans that other federal agencies do for theircivilian employees. In addition, families of active-duty service members whoenrolled in FEHB would receive a voucher that covered much or all of theremaining share of the premium. Supporters of downsizing note that although DoD's wartime medical requirements during the Cold War were based on the scenario of a large con-ventional conflict in Europe, more recent planning scenarios have led to sizablecuts in those requirements. Today, between military medical facilities, hospi-tals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and civilian facilities that haveagreed to provide beds during a national emergency, the United States has morethan twice the hospital capacity needed to meet the current wartime demand for13,400 beds. Moreover, even after making the reductions in this option, DoDwould still have about 9,000 beds in its expanded system\u2014a much higher per-centage of its wartime requirement than it met during the Cold War. DoD would probably see several disadvantages, however, to making such deep cuts to its health care system. Military medical officials argue that DoDfacilities and the care they provide in peacetime are essential for recruiting andtraining physicians and ensuring medical readiness. Downsizing that system toCHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 87 such an extent would require DoD to modify the way it trains and prepares for wartime. For example, it wouldneed to strengthen ties with the civilian sector to providecasualty training for military medical personnel and tocontinue ensuring an adequate supply of beds for war-time. Another potential drawback of this option is that those older beneficiaries who are able to rely on militaryfacilities would have to seek care elsewhere. In addition,some beneficiaries who enrolled in FEHB plans wouldpay substantially more out of pocket than they do for carein the military system. Military retirees and their de-pendents would pay about 30 percent of their FEHB pre-mium. (Dependents of active-duty members would paylittle or no premium after receiving their voucher.) Andenrollees in most FEHB plans would face copayments ordeductibles for outpatient visits, prescription drugs, and other medical services. Proponents of this option would counter that higher out-of-pocket costs could prompt more prudent use ofmedical care than in DoD's direct care system, wheremany services are provided at no or low cost. In addi-tion, they might say, many FEHB plans would offer im-proved coverage and so might be worth the greater out-of-pocket expense. Moreover, the value of DoD's healthbenefits has grown dramatically with advances in tech-nology and medical practices. Thus, proponents wouldargue, it is reasonable for military beneficiaries to sharemore of the costs associated with those advances\u2014asmany people covered by employer-sponsored plans in theprivate sector already do.88 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-20 Revise Cost Sharing for Military Health Benefits Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 327 276 2002 437 4112003 444 PUBLICATION: Restructuring Military Medical Care (Paper), July 1995.Some 8.1 million active-duty service members, military retirees, and their dependents are eligible to use the military health care system worldwide, yet only 5.8 millionactually do on a full-time basis. Because the Department of Defense (DoD) does notrequire users to enroll, many of them choose to seek military care on a case-by-casebasis to augment other insurance coverage. Thus, military planners face major uncer-tainties about their patient load and health care costs each year. The military health system offers three types of coverage: Tricare Prime, a plan similar to health maintenance organizations; Tricare Standard, a traditional fee-for-service insurance program; and Tricare Extra, a preferred provider option. Beneficia-ries must enroll in Tricare Prime if they wish to use it, or they may use Tricare Stan-dard or Extra without enrolling. This option would make three changes to that system. First, all beneficiaries (except those on Medicare) would have to enroll in one of the three programs beforeusing the military health care system. The annual enrollment fee for Tricare Primewould remain the same (no charge for active-duty personnel and their families and$230 for single coverage or $460 for family coverage for retirees). Under Tricare Extraor Standard, active-duty personnel would still pay no fee, but retirees would pay $115a year for single or $230 for family coverage. Second, DoD would adjust enrollmentfees for inflation by the annual change in the consumer price index for medical ex-penses. Third, users of Tricare Prime would pay the same copayments for outpatientcare at military facilities (where they now pay nothing) as they do at civilian providers.In addition, all retirees would begin to pay small copayments if they chose to receivecare at military facilities. Together, those three changes would lower discretionary appropriations by $327 million in 2001 and $4.1 billion through 2010. The savings would stem from enroll-ment fees, increased copayment charges, and more prudent use of care by beneficia-ries. Under current law, DoD is allowed to spend some of the revenues it collectsthrough copayments. This estimate assumes that the Congress would reduce DoD'sappropriations by the amount of revenue collected under the option. However, if theCongress revoked DoD's automatic reimbursement authority, the estimate would takethe form of an offset to mandatory spending. By requiring beneficiaries to enroll, DoD could identify who uses its system. Military providers need to plan for the health care needs of a defined population todevelop per capita budgets and build cost-effective delivery networks. Proponents of this option could argue that the value of DoD's health benefits has risen with advances in medical technology, so users should expect to bear some of theassociated cost, just as employees of private firms have. In addition, chargingcopayments would help curb excessive use of services by creating the same incentivesfor beneficiaries who receive care on-base as for those who use civilian providers. Itwould also eliminate the inequity of providing more generous benefits to people wholive near a military hospital or clinic. On the negative side, many military families and retirees would view even mod- est copayments at military facilities as an erosion of their benefits. Retention andmorale might suffer, even though this option would still offer service members andtheir families more generous health benefits than most government or private-sectoremployers do.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 89 050-21 Have DoD and VA Purchase Drugs Jointly Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 26 21 2002 74 632003 78 742004 82 802005 86 84 2001-2005 346 323 2001-2010 843 810 SPENDING CATEGORY: Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS: 700-05In 1997, the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) spent about $1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, on pharmaceutical products forpatients in their health care systems. Nationwide, spending on prescriptiondrugs has grown roughly twice as fast in recent years as total national healthspending. Constraining such cost growth is an important goal for DoD andVA: each operates its large health care system on a fixed annual appropriation,so spending more on prescription drugs means it has fewer resources to devoteto other types of care for its beneficiaries. This option would consolidate DoD's and VA's purchases of pharmaceu- tical products, as the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Vet-erans Transition Assistance has recommended. Specifically, it would requirethe two agencies to organize a joint procurement office and develop a commonclinically based formulary (a list of prescription drugs that both agencies'health plans would agree to provide). Formularies can save money by encour-aging providers to substitute generic versions for brand-name drugs or by se-lecting one or more preferred brand-name drugs within a therapeutic class. Thejoint formulary would apply throughout the VA health system, to mail-orderpharmacy services, and at military hospitals and clinics. Once in place, itwould allow the agencies to enter into more \"committed-volume\" contractswith pharmaceutical manufacturers, which generally lead to lower drug prices.In addition, this option would merge the two agencies' mail-order pharmacyservices. Those changes would save DoD and VA a total of $21 million inoutlays in 2001 and $810 million through 2010. In recent years, DoD and VA have made efforts to combine some pur- chases, but that collaboration is limited, and they continue to maintain separateformularies and procurement offices. The VA's National Acquisition Center(NAC) is responsible for purchasing prescription drugs for most federal agen-cies except DoD, and it negotiates and maintains the federal supply schedulesof prices for those items. The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), anoffice of the Defense Logistics Agency, negotiates prices for pharmaceuticalsand draws up contracts with vendors to buy and deliver those products to mili-tary treatment facilities. DSCP also makes plans to deliver those items over-seas quickly in the event of a conflict. Proponents of joint purchasing would argue that DoD and VA need to rein in the rapid growth of prescription drug costs. Without such measures, bothagencies may be forced to ration more tightly the care they provide. In addi-tion, those proponents would say, the need for separate procurement offices isnot apparent. According to a 1998 report by DoD's Inspector General, only0.05 percent of the items that the DSCP procures on behalf of military facilitiesare \"militarily unique\"; most are common items. VA officials maintain that theNational Acquisition Center has already achieved significant savings on manyof its pharmaceutical purchases through committed-volume contracts. In developing a common formulary, the two agencies would need to adopt procedures by which physicians could prescribe nonformulary drugs to patientswho needed them. (For example, a patient would require an alternative drug if90 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 he or she was allergic to the formulary drug in a thera- peutic class.) The design and execution of such an ex-ception process would affect the savings from this option.The stricter the process, the higher would be the cost ofdocumenting and judging the patient's need for anonformulary drug. A less restrictive process, however,would reduce the government's bargaining power andcould reduce the savings from this option. Critics of consolidation argue that such savings are unachievable anyway. The veterans who obtain healthcare from the VA make up a very different mix of medi-cal cases than military beneficiaries do\u2014for example,more of them suffer from mental illness, substance abuse,or severe disabilities (such as spinal cord injuries). Thus,the degree of overlap in prescription drugs dispensed bythe two agencies may be limited. Opponents of this option also argue that DoD and VA have already taken important steps to expand theirjoint procurement. They have entered into 19 joint na-tional contracts to buy pharmaceutical products.Some officials believe that the agencies will achieve thebulk of any possible savings simply by sharing pricing data with one another so they can negotiate the lowestprices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers.Moreover, DoD officials contend that they must maintaintheir own procurement office to ensure that drug supplieswill be available quickly in the event of war. Other critics, however, might argue that this option would not go far enough. Savings could be even larger ifDoD implemented a uniform formulary for all three typesof pharmacies that its beneficiaries use: pharmacies atmilitary hospitals and clinics, the mail-order service, andretail pharmacies (where beneficiaries receive partialreimbursement through insurance). DoD officials saythat as they have tightened the formularies of drugs avail-able at military facilities, beneficiaries have increasinglyturned to retail outlets\u2014which often costs DoD morethan if the department had purchased the drugs at federalprices and dispensed them itself. (Consequently, the esti-mate for this option assumes that DoD's insurance claimsfor pharmacy services would increase.) If DoD couldenforce a single formulary at all pharmacy outlets, itwould enjoy more substantial savings.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 91 050-22 Eliminate DoD's Elementary and Secondary Schools Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 -10 -9 2002 4 32003 20 182004 33 312005 44 90 85 2001-2010 466 456 SPENDING CATEGORY: DiscretionaryThe Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) system operates schools on several military bases in the United States to educate depend-ents of military personnel living on those bases. The Department of Defense(DoD) also operates a separate school system for military dependents livingoverseas. This option would phase out most of the schools that DDESS runs in favor of increased use of local public schools and would consolidate management ofany remaining DDESS schools into the much larger overseas school system.Those changes would save DoD a total of $1.5 billion between 2001 and 2010.Savings for the federal government as a whole would be less\u2014about $400 mil-lion through 2010\u2014because the Department of Education would have to spendmore on Impact Aid, which it provides to local school districts that enroll de-pendents of federal employees. (These cost estimates assume that funding forImpact Aid would increase enough that the average amount paid per studentliving on federal land would remain at its current level.) Critics would argue that DDESS takes an uneven and largely arbitrary approach to educating the dependents of active-duty service members. The dis-tribution of DDESS schools is mainly a historical accident, d ating to the time when segregated public schools in the South did not adequately serve an inte-grated military. The great majority of military bases in the United States have noDDESS school. And where such sc hools do exist, they generally enroll only dependents of active-duty members who live on-base; those living off-base, anddependents of civilian employees, are the responsibility of local school districts.In addition, most bases with DDESS facilities offer only elementary and middleschools; high school students living on-base use the public schools. In most ofthe places where DDESS operates schools, accredited public schools are readilyavailable\u2014with the possible exceptions of Guam, Puerto Rico, and West Point,where DoD would continue to run domestic schools under this option. Closing DDESS schools need not create major disruptions. The roughly 30,000 students who might be affected already change schools frequently, inlarge part because they move often as their military parent is reassigned. Inmany locations, the public school district could continue to use the DDESS facil-ity. (DoD already offers support to some local districts by allowing publicschools to operate on-base or providing additional limited funding on a per-stu-dent basis.) Finally, to ease the transition, DDESS schools would be phased outat a rate of one per distr ict per year rather than all at once. And the local school districts would receive additional one-time funding and transfer of facilities andequipment to help them absorb their new teaching load. This option might have several disadvantages, however. First, many par- ents of DDESS students might be reluctant to see the schools phased out becausethey believe DoD schools offer higher-quality educations. Second, if local schooldistricts did not maintain the on-base schools, former DDESS students mightface longer commutes. Third, some of the savings to the federal governmentfrom this option would be offset by increased costs to local school districts. Inthe past, those districts have effectively been subsidized by not having to pay anyof the costs of educating DDESS students while receiving at least some directand indirect tax revenues from their parents. This option would eliminate thatsubsidy.92 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-23 Consolidate and Encourage Efficiencies in Military Exchange Activities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 62 47 2002 85 762003 108 992004 111 1072005 Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: The Costs and Benefits of Retail Activities at Military Bases (Study), October 1997.The Department of Defense's (DoD's) three military exchange systems\u2014the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Navy Exchange Command, and theMarine Corps system\u2014provide a wide array of retail stores and consumerservices at military bases. With combined annual sales of approximately $10billion, operating costs of about $2 billion, and 80,000 employees, the ex-changes constitute one of the largest retail businesses in the United States. The Congress does not directly appropriate funds to the exchanges, but DoD provides them with about $400 million worth of free services each year.Those services include maintaining the exterior of exchange buildings (such asroofs, windows, and heating and cooling systems), transporting goods overseas,and providing utilities at overseas stores. The federal status of DoD exchangesoffers other advantages as well: exemption from state and local excise taxes, amonopoly over on-base sales of goods and services, and access to free land andinterest-free capital. Those exemptions and other subsidies are worth morethan $1 billion a year, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Part of that annual subsidy is translated either into lower prices for mili- tary personnel and their families or into exchange earnings that support theservices' morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs. Another portion isabsorbed by inefficiencies. Private retailers in the United States must be effi-cient to survive in the face of competition. The subsidies that exchanges re-ceive, by contrast, alleviate the pressure of competition and allow the ex-changes to operate in ways that private retailers could not afford to. For exam-ple, although economies of scale in the private sector often force private retail-ers to merge, DoD's three exchange systems remain separate\u2014despite numer-ous studies showing that consolidation would significantly reduce operatingcosts. Subsidies also distort the incentives that exchange managers face. Be-cause DoD provides free utilities overseas, the Army and Air Force ExchangeService can operate an ice cream production line in Germany without regard toutility costs. And because DoD pays to transport goods overseas, the ex-changes can ship beer and carbonated beverages abroad rather than buyingthem locally. This option would consolidate the three exchange systems into a single entity and introduce incentives for more efficient operations. Rather than re-ceive DoD support services free of charge, the exchanges would receive alump-sum appropriation equal to the historical cost of those services and would(like DoD's industrially funded activities) reimburse the providers of thoseservices. Over the long r un, consolidating the three exchange systems could save about $65 million a year in overhead costs. R equiring the exchanges to reimburse DoD for support services would save another $40 million a year if itinduced the exchanges to reduce the costs of those activities by 10 percent. Inall, savings would total $1.1 billion between 2001 and 2010. Initially, thesavings might provide additional funding for MWR activities. Over the longrun, the increase in exchange earnings would allow DoD to provide its plannedlevel of MWR activities with less support from appropriated funds.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 93 050-24 Increase Competition Between DoD and Private-Sector Housing Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 627 32 2002 637 : 050-25 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Military Family Housing in the United States (Study), September 1993.Most military families receive cash allowances for housing and buy or rent dwell- ings in the private sector. About one-third, however, live rent-free in on-basehousing provided by the Department of Defense (DoD). It costs the federal gov-ernment about 35 percent more to provide a housing unit than it costs to rent acomparable unit in the private sector. Despite the cost, DoD intends to keep itsinventory of housing. The department is experimenting with public/privatepartnerships that could provide private capital to replace or revitalize on-basehousing units, many of which are nearing the end of their service life. But thosepartnerships are proceeding more slowly than planned, leaving many families insubstandard units. Moreover, it is uncertain whether such partnerships willreduce the long-run costs to DoD of providing on-base housing. This option would reduce the demand for on-base housing by requiring it to compete with priv ate-sector housing. All military families would receive the cash allowance and be free to choose between DoD and private-sector units.DoD\u2014and any companies it takes on as partners\u2014would act like a private land-lord, setting rents for on-base units at market-clearing levels (levels at whichthere would be neither excess vacancies nor waiting lists). On-base housingunits would be replaced or revitalized if they met one of two criteria: their valueto service members (the market-clearing rent they could command) was sufficientto cover both operating costs and amortized capital costs, or DoD deemed theunits indispensable because of their historical nature or importance for militaryreadiness. Those criteria would limit DoD to rev italizing or replacing about 25 percent of its existing housing stock. The principal advantage of this option would be savings to DoD, which could amount to more than $5 b illion in outlays through 2010. The main source of those savings would be lower revitalization and replacement costs as DoDretired aging units rather than investing in ones that could not cover their costsin competition with private-sector housing. Among other advantages, this optionwould let DoD focus on its warfighting mission rather than on real estate man-agement, eliminate waiting lists for on-base units, and equalize the value of thehousing benefits that it provides to families living on- and off-base. Moreover,the housing costs that serv ice members as a whole pay out of pocket would not change: if rents paid to DoD exceeded the housing allowances paid to personnelliving in DoD units, the excess would be returned to all service members throughan increase in allowance rates. The main disadvantage of this option is that reducing DoD's role as a pro- vider of housing would limit the benefits associated with the current policy.Advocates argue that housing soldiers and their families on-base promotes espritde corps, morale, and a sense that the military \"takes care of its own.\" Thisoption would represent a significant break with military tradition. As a result, itcould have a negative impact on morale unless it r eceived strong pub lic support from senior military leaders. On-base units are in high demand among military families primarily be- cause of their low cost to service members. The allowance that families living inDoD housing forfeit equals only about 60 percent of the costs that the federalgovernment incurs in providing a unit. Under this option, families that chose tolive on-base would face higher costs than they do today because their rent to DoDwould most likely exceed their housing allowance.94 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-25 Create Incentives for Military Families to Save Energy Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 5 5 2002 26 262003 54 542004 67 672005 68 68 2001-2005 220 220 2001-2010 580 580 SPENDING Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS: 050-24 and 050-31 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Military Family Housing in the United States (Study), September 1993.The Department of Defense (DoD) spent almost $310 million last year on gas, electricity, and water for the approximately 216,000 family housing units that itowns in the United States. DoD's efforts to reduce those costs by promotingresource conservation have met with limited success. One reason is that ser-vice members living in DoD-owned housing do not pay for their utilities andmay not even know how much gas, electricity, and water they use. Landlordsin the private sector have found that utility use typically declines by about 20percent when tenants are responsible for their own utility bills. This option would install utility meters in DoD housing units, provide cash utility allowances to the families living there, and then charge for utilitiesbased on actual use. Residents who spent less than their allowance could keepthe savings; those who spent more would pay the extra cost out of pocket. Thebudget for allowances would be set equal to the expected cost of utilities underthe new system, or about 80 percent of what DoD now spends. The departmentwould allocate that amount among the different housing units on the basis oftheir size, energy efficiency, and location. Once the program was established,the allowance budget for each year could be set equal to the previous year'sactual utility charges plus an adjustment for inflation. As such, if service mem-bers were able to cut their utility us age by more than 20 percent, allowances would fall and the savings from this option would increase. If, however, 20percent overestimates members' true ability to conserve, allowances would behigher and the savings would be less. Because families who conserved aggressively would receive more in allowances than they would be charged for utilities, this option would rewardpeople who tried to conserve energy. Families who did not economize wouldface utility bills in excess of their allowance. However, there is a risk that theallowances for some units might not accurately reflect their characteristics.People living in such a unit might find that the allowance did not cover all oftheir utility costs even after they had made reasonable conservation efforts. The principal advantage of this option is that it would reduce DoD's costs by giving military families who live on-base the same incentives for conserva-tion as most homeowners and renters\u2014including military families living off-base. Although DoD would incur the up-front costs of determining allowanceamounts, setting up a billing system, and installing meters, this option couldprovide total savings of about $580 million from 2001 through 2010. Many DoD housing units already have a connection where a meter could be installed. Nonetheless, a temporary exemption from the metering require-ment (and the utility allowances and charges) could be given for some olderunits if the Secretary of Defense certified that metering them was not feasible.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 95 050-26 Apply Technology to Reduce the Cost of Operating Equipment Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 -600 -241 2002 for Military Readiness and Upkeep: Trends in Operationand Maintenance Spending (Study), September 1997.In some circumstances, agencies need to spend money to save money. This option would provide an additional $600 million a year to invest in technolo-gies to reduce the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of weapon systems.The funds would go into \"technology insertion accounts\" that would be held atthe headquarters level of each service and be applied to equipment already usedby military units in the field\u2014for example, to support the research, develop-ment, procurement, and installation of reliable digital compasses in place ofantiquated analog versions, or to replace universal joints on truck axles withconstant-velocity joints, which reduce a fleet's tire wear by one-third. Suchinvestments can lessen the need to repair or replace failed components, freeingup maintenance workers and ultimately reducing the costs of operating equip-ment. Similar opportunities to save on O&M costs without sacrificing perfor-mance exist for all of the services' aging weapon systems. Over 10 years, the$6 billion investment in this option could produce $10.6 billion in savings\u2014fornet savings of $4.6 billion through 2010. The services currently spend relatively little on technology insertion. Of the $38 billion spent each year on maintaining w eapon systems, only a bout $600 million is devoted to technology insertion to reduce costs. As an extremeexample, the program manager for the M1A1 Abrams tank\u2014the Army's sec-ond largest weapon system\u2014received only $1.2 million for research and devel-opment (R&D) on ways to reduce the system's $2.9 billion annual operatingcosts. Studies conducted for the Department of Defense (DoD) by the Logis-tics Management Institute and others have concluded that funding for technol-ogy insertion is inadequate. The military's current funding for technology insertion programs is lim- ited for three main reasons: o The services focus their O&M spending on short-term rather than long- term investment. A March 1998 report by the Air Force Materiel Com-mand stated, \"The key barrier in today's increasingly tight budgetaryenvironment is finding funding for an activity that will yield net benefitsonly in the future.\" o Technology insertion initiatives typically need small quantities of funds from different appropriations\u2014R&D, procurement, and O&M. But theservices are prohibited (partly by Congressional statutes and partly byinternal regulations) from using R&D or procurement dollars for compo-nents that reduce O&M costs. The dilemma is that officials who want toreduce O&M costs ca nnot tap into the correct pots of money\u2014R&D or procurement\u2014to do so. o No incentives exist to encourage technology insertion. Maintenance de- pots do not have a vested interest in improving the reliability of equip-ment, because that would reduce their already dwindling workload. Offi-cials who control R&D or procurement funds often focus on the costs notof systems already in the field but of the next emerging weapon system. 96 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 This option would promote technology insertion through a combination of new f unds and new f unding mechanisms. The newly created accounts would be\"fenced,\" or earmarked only for technology insertion, andwould contain a blend of R&D, procurement, and O&Mfunds. Within each service, program managers ofweapon systems would compete for access to the fundson the basis of their ability to demonstrate potential gainsfrom technology insertion. Thus, program managerscould have the resources to change the O&M costs oftheir systems. Establishing a separate pool of money fortechnology insertion would also create incentives withinindustry to vie for those dollars. If equipment manufac-turers, subcontractors, and even depots knew that fundingwas available for R&D and procurement, they wouldhave an incentive to devise and promote options for re-ducing O&M costs. Burden-sharing of R&D costs withprivate industry could increase because more dollarswould be available for procuring the new technologies.(Industry officials have stated a willingness to assume therisks associated with research and development, but onlyif they can be assured of future procurement funding ifthe R&D is successful.) The 10-year savings of $4.6 billion estimated for this option assume that each $1 invested in technologyinsertion yields a return of $3 over five years. The ser-vices report a range of returns on such investments, from3-to-1 to as much as 20-to-1. But the dozens of separateO&M cost-reducing programs now in place suffer frominaccurate accounting of realized savings, so countingon high rates of return might be unrealistic. Many of those programs do not attempt to track the results of tech-nology insertion. To help ensure a high rate of returnunder this option, project managers would provide ac-count managers with detailed proposals that would in-clude information about the past O&M costs of their sys-tems, estimates of projected savings, and procedures totrack and verify those savings. Although potentially large, the savings under this option are uncertain. And as with any investment, thereis a risk that DoD would not receive a good return on theinvestment. Service leaders claim they cannot absorbmany more proposals for R&D or engineering changeswithout adding personnel to analyze and implement the proposals\u2014thus adding to the cost of technology inser-tion and reducing the return. In addition, estimated sav-ings might not materialize because reducing the laborforce simply because of a labor-saving initiative is oftendifficult, both politically and practically. Finally, accu-rate data on costs and savings are not readily available,further clouding claims of gains made. Each of the services is currently reforming its pro- grams to account for the life-cycle costs of weapon sys-tems, which could help better identify savings, but thoseefforts are not closely tied to technology insertion pro-grams. Therefore, some observers argue that DoDshould wait until the services can track costs better be-fore offering additional funds to reduce costs.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 97 050-27 Close and Realign Additional Military Bases Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS: Review of The Report of the Department of Defense on BaseRealignment and Closure (Letter), July 1998. Closing Military Bases: An Interim Assessment (Paper), December 1996.Beginning in the late 1980s, the Department of Defense (DoD) sought to re- duce its operating costs by closing unneeded military bases. Significant reduc-tions in force structure at the end of the Cold War made many bases unneces-sary. Because political and procedural difficulties had long made closing basesnearly impossible, the Congress set up four successive independent commis-sions on base realignment and closure (or BRAC). Those commissions recom-mended shutting or realigning (moving departments and facilities at) hundredsof military installations in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam. When allof the actions from the four BRAC rounds are completed, DoD will save about$5.6 billion a year in operating costs, it estimates. This option would authorize two additional rounds of base closures and realignments in 2003 and 2005. In the long run, such actions can producesubstantial savings. However, they require some up-front investment, so costswould increase in the short run. Between 2001 and 2010, this option wouldreduce DoD's costs by a net total of $4.7 billion. Beginning in 2012, the de-partment could realize recurring savings of around $4 billion per year. Thoseestimates are based on DoD's experience and current projections for the fourearlier rounds of base closings. (The estimates do not include the costs of envi-ronmental cleanup, since DoD is obligated to incur such costs regardless ofwhether it operates or closes bases.) Closing and realigning additional military bases is consistent with DoD's overall drawdown of forces. By several measures, planned force reductionssignificantly exceed the projected decrease in base capacity. For example, thedepartment intends to cut the number of military and civilian personnel by 34percent from the 1990 level. But according to DoD, only 21 percent of the baseinfrastructure in the United States has been eliminated. The Secretary of Defense asked the Congress in early 1998 and again in early 2000 to authorize two more rounds of base closures. In The Report of the Department of Defense on Base Realignment and Closure of April 1998, DoD stated that opportunities exist for further cutbacks and consolidations at severaltypes of bases\u2014such as defense laboratories, test and evaluation installations,training facilities, naval bases, aircraft installations, and supply facilities. Some analysts, however, argue that the BRAC cuts have gone far enough in matching the planned reductions in forces. The base structure, they say,should retain enough excess capacity to accommodate new risks to nationalsecurity that could require a surge in the number of military forces. Opponentsof more closures also cite the possible adverse economic effects on local com-munities. Some opponents suggest that savings could be made by demolishingcertain buildings or by achieving other operating efficiencies short of closingbases.98 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-28 Demolish Excess and Obsolete Structures Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 -30 -21 2002 -23 -232003 -15 -172004 22 112005 23 21 2001-2005 -23 98 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION: 050-27The defense drawdown has left many military bases with structures that the services no longer need and that have no remaining asset value. Those struc-tures include buildings, such as schools and family housing units, as well asother facilities, such as piers and runways. In some cases, the structures are dangerous eyesores. In other cases, their availability attracts marginal userswho benefit from occupying them because the users are not required to pay thefull costs of the utilities and other support that the bases provide. Althoughdemolishing those structures would entail up-front spending, it would allow theDepartment of Defense (DoD) to avoid future maintenance costs. Estimates byDoD suggest that demolition projects may pay for themselves in as little as fiveyears. This option would increase funding to tear down excess, obsolete struc- tures by $35 million a year over the 2001-2003 period. A majority of thoseannual funds, $30 million, would be allocated to the services' operation andmaintenance (O&M) accounts to fund the demolition of excess facilities thatare maintained with O&M dollars. The remaining $5 million would be allo-cated to the family housing accounts to pay for demolishing obsolete family housing units that are too costly to repair. Those funds would allow DoD toincrease demolitions by 6 percent from planned levels and would generate $22million in annual savings after 2003. The services expect to tear down 80 million square feet of buildings by 2003 in accordance with a management reform that the Office of the Secretaryof Defense (OSD) began in 1997. Recent defense plans have extended the AirForce's and Navy's demolition programs to 2005 to accommodate their largeinventories of structures other than buildings. DoD plans to spend a total of$773 million on demolition programs during the 2000- 2003 peri od, with an estimated savings in O&M costs of $160 million a year after that. However, DoD officials maintain that the department's inventory of real property will still contain excess structures, such as buildings and other facili-ties that are maintained with O&M dollars, after the current demolition pro-grams are completed in 2005. Funding above planned levels would be neces-sary to demolish the rest of those excess structures and generate additionalO&M savings. In addition, current OSD plans do not fund the destruction ofexcess, obsolete family housing units. Although the services' family housingcommands have adopted demolition as a key tool in their strategies for realproperty management, critics argue that the resources devoted to those activi-ties are inadequate. The primary disadvantage of this option is that the quantity of structures that are both excess and obsolete is unclear. If DoD has underestimated itsrequirements for facilities, demolition programs may destroy a structure thathas a potential use in the future. One alternative to demolition is to board up afacility and cease maintaining it. Nonetheless, as long as structures remain inDoD's inventory, the department is likely to feel pressure to maintain them andmake them available to potential users.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 99 050-29 Consolidate Depot Functions and Close Some Facilities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 -386 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Public and Private Roles in Maintaining Military Equipmentat the Depot Level (Study), July 1995.Despite four rounds of base r ealignment and closure (BRAC), the serv ices still have a large number of underutilized buildings and equipment within their net-work of maintenance depots (government-owned and -operated industrial facili-ties that repair military equipment). The individual services, the Office of theSecretary of Defense, and the General Accounting Office (GAO) have all recom-mended closing additional depot facilities to reduce that excess capacity, whichGAO has estimated at about 50 percent and rising. This option would authorize a BRAC commission that would focus exclu- sively on maintenance depots. Assuming the commission identified up to fivefacilities for closure, this option could save a total of $1.2 billion between 2001and 2010. Closing additional depots would require some up-front investment,but the Department of Defense (DoD) would probably break even within five tosix years. When the actions recommended by the four previous BRAC rounds are completed next year, 19 of the 38 major government-owned and -operated depotsthat existed in 1988 will no longer be functioning as government entities. Nev-ertheless, the depot network will still have excess capacity because its workloadis declining for four reasons: the overall military force structure and stocks ofweapons and equipment continue to be reduced, most new or modified weaponsystems are more reliable than previous systems, manufacturers of weapon sys-tems are seeking greater control over maintenance support for their systems, andsome unit commanders are conducting more repairs in their own local mainte-nance facilities (see option 050-30). Proponents of a BRAC commission specifically for maintenance depots would argue that the unique characteristics of depots\u2014including nondeployablepersonnel, huge fixed capital assets, and a mostly civilian workforce\u2014set themapart from conventional military bases. In that view, the sp ecial expertise re- quired to understand depot-industry issues\u2014to determine to what extent repairscould be made more efficiently in the private sector and to define and identifyexcess capacity from an overall DoD perspective \u2014underscores the need for a specialized BRAC panel whose members have knowledge of the unique attrib-utes of the depot system. (That argument could also apply to the defense labora-tories, research facilities, and test and evaluation facilities.) Opponents of this option, by contrast, might argue that depot realignments and closures have gone far enough. Many cr itics feel that DoD should retain enough capacity within its depot system to accommod ate new risks to n ational security that could require a surge in depot-level maintenance. In addition, depotclosures could have adverse economic effects on local communities\u2014at least inthe short run. Instead of closing more depots, opponents would argue, DoD could reduce excess capacity by entering into public/private partnerships that u tilized that capacity during peacetime and thus made depots more cost-effective. For exam-ple, the commercial aviation i ndustry re portedly faces a shortfall in its depot capacity and could potentially become a partner in sharing the costs of maintain-ing military depots.100 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-30 Change the Management and Pricing of Repairs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 46 35 2002 154 1252003 735 5862004 050-29When subcomponents of weapon systems (such as transmissions and radars) break down, unit commanders often have them repaired in the unit's own main-tenance and repair shops\u2014called intermediate maintenance facilities, or gen-eral support fac ilities in the Army. That is the case even if it would be less costly for the Department of Defense (DoD) as a whole if the subcomponentswere sent to large, centralized maintenance facilities\u2014called depots\u2014for re-pair. This option would reduce costs by changing the way in which DoD man- ages and charges for repair of those subcom ponents\u2014known as depot-level repairables (DLRs). Under this option, repair work for DLRs would be allo-cated to either depots or intermediate facilities by managers who were aware ofthe full costs of both sources of repair and had an incentive to minimize DoD'stotal repair bill. Such a system could save the department $3.4 billion over 10years through improving inventory efficiency alone. In the early 1990s, DoD tried to reduce the demand for repairs and make unit commanders more careful in their use of DLRs by shifting repair funds outof central accounts and into the budgets of individual units. To a large degree,the plan succeeded: demand for repair and replacements of DLRs declined.But because of problems in the price structure for repairs, shifting financialresponsibility to unit commanders had unintended consequences. The pricesthat depots charge for DLRs overstate the actual cost of doing repairs becausedepots must cover their overhead and management costs. By contrast, some ofthe costs that intermediate facilities face (including the costs of capital andmilitary labor) are not included in the prices that units pay. Thus, commandershave a financial incentive to repair DLRs in their own facilities regardless ofthe actual cost, and repair jobs that before would have gone to a depot arebeing handled by intermediate facilities. According to one joint Navy/Office ofthe Secretary of Defense study, intermediate maintenance is up to twice asexpensive as depot repairs. B ecause intermediate facilities are not as well equipped for some tasks as depots, repairs could take longer or have higherfailure rates. Besides raising costs, the shift in workload has increased excesscapacity in the depots and may have decreased the quality of repairs overall. This option would try to improve the distribution of the DLR workload between depots and intermediate maintenance facilities by centralizing man- agement of DLRs. More important, it would provide a pricing system thatmore accurately reflects the actual cost of repairs. Within each service, equip-ment (or item) managers would assume control of all DLR inventories andallocate repairs between depots and intermediate facilities. They, not unitcommanders, would decide which source of repair was less costly. Command-ers would have a single point of contact\u2014the item manager\u2014for each type ofDLR, regardless of whether the work had been allocated to an intermediatefacility or a depot. Under this option, both depots and intermediate facilities would charge item managers for repairs. Each repair facility would set its prices to coveronly those costs that varied with the DLR workload, taking into account theCHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 101 time to complete the work, quality, and return of broken DLRs. In other words, it would cover the additionalcosts that would be incurred for each specific repair, suchas materials, labor, and transportation. That pricingstructure has been proposed by economists at RAND, theCenter for Naval Analyses, and elsewhere. By encourag-ing item managers to send DLRs to the facility that coulddo the work at the lowest cost, it would let DoD mini-mize its total repair bill. Intermediate facilities would continue to rely on direct appropriations to cover their fixed capital andoverhead costs. In addition, military personnel whowould deploy as part of maintenance units in wartimecould continue to be assigned to intermediate facilities inpeacetime and be paid from their service's central mili-tary personnel account. However, costs that varied withthe amount of repair work at the intermediate fac ility would be covered not through direct appropriations butthrough the prices charged for DLR repairs. Those costswould include the salaries of civilian workers and mili- tary personnel whose positions were required not becauseof wartime deployments but because of the DLR repairworkload in peacetime. In turn, the intermediate mainte-nance facilities would be required to reimburse the ser-vices' military personnel accounts for those salaries. In the case of depots, repair costs that did not vary with workload would be paid by customers through a flatcharge that did not depend on how much work they sentto the depot that year. Such a two-part pricing system\u2014aflat charge plus a variable fee based on workload\u2014issimilar to the system that some telephone companies use.Costs that were not related to ongoing repair tasks butwere previously included in DLR prices would be cov-ered by direct appropriations. For example, the costs ofmaintaining excess facilities for wartime, such as theArmy's Watervliet facility (a unique plant that manufac-tures large gun barrels), would not be charged to depotcustomers. That approach to pricing would allow thedepot to cover its total costs but not charge more for anadditional task than the task would cost to perform. Astudy by RAND concluded that such an approach would reduce the prices that depots charge for repairs. A pricereduction could shift a significant amount of the DLRworkload back to depots. One disadvantage of this option is that commanders would have less control over their intermediate mainte-nance facilities. Thus, it would be harder for them toensure that those facilities provided an adequate mini- mum number of personnel to cover wartime tasks or tosupport deployments and contingency operations. In ad-dition, centralization and worldwide management of theDLR inventory would require new software and com-puter systems. Another disadvantage is that developing appropriate prices for the depots and intermediate facilities couldprove difficult. Depot managers, anxious to attract workby keeping their prices as low as possible, might try tomove costs into the flat charge or direct appropriationsthat were in fact part of the costs of repair that variedwith workload. Alternatively, depot managers might bereluctant to separate repair costs that varied with work-load from those that were fixed because doing so wouldhighlight their degree of excess capacity. In addition, anaccurate historical database of repair costs at intermedi-ate facilities does not exist, which makes pricing DLRrepairs there difficult. A more fundamental concern is that it might be dif- ficult to predict exactly how managers would respond tothe new prices. (DoD, for example, failed to predict howmanagers would respond to the current DLR pricingscheme.) The unintended consequences of changingprices could outweigh the benefits if this option was notimplemented carefully and systematically. Opponents ofthis option might argue that it would be simpler for DoDto just order work to go to the facility that could performit at the least cost. Supporters might counter that DoDalready has rules about where DLRs are to be repairedbut that current DLR prices are driving units to ignorethose rules. 102 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-31 Allow Federal Agencies to Bargain for Electricity Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 36 36 2002 128 1282003 90 902004 28 282005 23 23 2001-2005 CBO PUBLICATIONS: Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998. Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997. The federal government spends more than $2 billion per year in the United States on electricity, of which about 50 percent is purchased through the De-partment of Defense. Although the government is a large consumer of electric-ity, it pays full retail prices. A provision in a continuing appropriation act forfiscal year 1988 (Public Law 100-202, section 8093) requires federal agenciesto conform to state laws regarding electricity purchases. Some states havealready allowed retail customers to choose their electricity supplier and negoti-ate lower prices. This option would let the federal government realize such savings in all states, regardless of state regulations on retail customers. The resulting savingscould total around $422 million over 10 years if agencies' appropriations werereduced by the expected decrease in electricity bills. (The lower savings in2001 reflect phase-in and transition costs.) The federal government would face lower electricity prices if it purchased power on a competitive basis. In that situation, suppliers would have an incen-tive to provide electricity at the lowest possible cost and offer new services.Under traditional regulation, utilities generally gave customers the same prod-uct: reliable electricity at a fairly high, but uniform, price. If the federal gov-ernment was allowed to negotiate for electricity, suppliers would be encouragedto furnish a greater variety of electricity services\u2014with different prices anddifferent degrees of reliability, depending on what the federal governmentwanted or needed. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts, Pennsylva-nia, and Rhode Island, have already introduced retail competition, allowing allretail customers\u2014including federal agencies\u2014to choose their electricity pro-vider. Any reduction in federal spending because of Congressional actionwould have to take into account that those states already allow price competi-tion and others will allow it before 2010. Several bills to restructure the electricity industry were introduced in the 105th Congress. They would have allowed all customers, not just the federalgovernment, to buy electricity in a competitive market. A comprehensiveelectricity-restructuring bill like one of those may be needed for the federalgovernment to realize all of the savings from negotiating lower prices for elec-tricity. Otherwise, an electricity provider that once served the federal govern-ment might be reluctant to lose so large a customer and could try to impede thegovernment's choice of suppliers. (In some parts of the country, no alternativesuppliers may be available.) Also, the federal government could be subject tosurcharges if it broke a contract with its old supplier. Such surcharges woulddiminish the savings from this option. The federal government might also beperceived as unfair if it was allowed to choose suppliers but no other retailcustomer was. Prices to other consumers could rise if the federal governmentchose a new supplier and the utility that once served it could not search foralternative buyers for the electricity.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 050 103 050-32 Sell Surplus Real Property of the Department of Energy Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 3 32003 3 32004 3 32005 3 3 2001-2005 12 12 2001-2010 17 17 SPENDING CATEGORY: MandatoryThe Department of Energy (DOE) controls about 2.4 million acres of land,much of it surrounding sites in the West and Southeast that have contributed tothe nation's efforts to develop nuclear weapons. DOE's Office of InspectorGeneral (IG) recently identified 309,000 acres that it considers no l onger es- sential to carrying out the department's core missions of weapons dismantling,environmental cleanup, technology development, and scientific research. Thatacreage is part of the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, the Hanford Site inWashington, and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Additional realproperty that may be excess but was not evaluated in the IG report exists atsuch DOE facilities as the Nevada Test Site, the Los Alamos National Labora-tory in New Mexico, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, andthe Savannah River Site in South Carolina. To demonstrate the potential savings from disposing of those properties, this option would require DOE to sell at market value 16,000 acres at the OakRidge Reservation that the IG has identified as excess. (The IG proposedtransferring other excess property to the Department of the Interior for manage-ment as a natural resource.) That sale\u2014conducted over four years to minimizethe effect on local land values\u2014could yield savings of $17 million during the2001-2010 period, including reduced outlays for property management. Thatsum excludes any savings associated with reducing DOE's liabilities for pay-ments to local governments in lieu of taxes or the costs of cleaning up futureaccidents. The estimate also assumes that the sale would be exempted fromrequirements of the Federal Property Administrative Services Act to first offersurplus property to state and local governments. Opponents of selling excess land argue that DOE's mission is changing to include the stewardship of land as a valuable national resource. Most of theacreage in question was used as buffer lands and has been little touched in thepast 50 years. In line with the land's unique qualities, DOE has establishedenvironmental research parks at seven of its properties to protect species andcultural sites and to provide a natural laboratory for research and environmen-tal monitoring. It has also made agreements with the Fish and Wildlife Serviceand the Bureau of Reclamation to manage certain areas. Moreover, some ofthe land (excluding the acres at Oak Ridge to be sold in this option) may becontaminated by hazardous materials or unexploded ordnan ce, which would have to be disposed of before transfer could occur. (Such disposal would di-minish the savings from this option.) In addition, DOE still needs buffer landsto control the future spread of contaminants from its nuclear sites. Proponents argue that selling unneeded DOE property would not only save money but also make the land available for more uses, including agricul-ture, recreation, and residential or commercial development. They note thataccording to the IG, cleanup will be necessary at only a small part of the excessacreage. Moreover, the government would still have to pay cleanup costs if itkept or transferred the property rather than selling it.104 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 050-33 Eliminate Cargo Preference Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 177 148 2002 272 2522003 Act of 1904 and other laws require that U.S.-flag vessels be used to carry certain government-owned or government-financed cargo thatis shipped internationally. Eliminating cargo preference would lower federaltransportation costs by allowing the government to ship its cargo at the lowestavailable rates. That would reduce the government's costs by $177 million in2001 and a total of almost $3.7 billion over the next decade. Two federal agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014account for about 90 percent (by weight) of thegovernment shipments subject to cargo preference laws. The preference appliesto nearly all DoD freight and three-quarters of the USDA's shipments of foodaid, as well as shipments associated with programs of the Agency for Interna-tional Development and the Export-Import Bank. Roughly 70 percent of thesavings from eliminating cargo preference would come from defense discretion-ary spending, with the other 30 percent from nondefense discretionary spend-ing. Supporters of cargo preference argue that it promotes the economic viabil- ity of the nation's maritime industry. That industry has suffered at the hands offoreign competition in recent decades. Under federal law, U.S. mariners mustcrew U.S. vessels, and in general, U.S. shipyards must build them. BecauseU.S.-flag ships face higher labor costs and greater regulatory responsibilitiesthan foreign-flag ships, they generally charge higher rates. Without guaranteedbusiness from cargo preference, many U.S.-flag vessels still engaged in interna-tional trade would leave the fleet. They would do so either by reflagging in aforeign country to save money or by decommissioning if they could not operatecompetitively. Supporters also argue that cargo preference helps bolster na-tional security by ensuring that U.S.-flag vessels and U.S. crews are availableduring wartime. Finally, eliminating cargo preference could cause U.S. shipoperators and shipbuilders to default on loans guaranteed by the government.(The possibility of such defaults is not reflected in the estimated savings for thisoption.) Critics of cargo preference say it represents a subsidy of private industry by taxpayers, which simply helps a handful of carriers preserve their marketshare and market power. In 1999, the program cost was nearly $1 million pervessel for the 475 ships, barges, and tugboats benefiting from the program.Opponents also point out that even DoD officials question the national securityimportance of the Merchant Marine fleet. DoD has invested in a fleet of itsown specifically for transporting military equipment. It also contracts withforeign-flag ships when needed. In addition, critics of cargo preference arguethat the U.S. government is at a competitive disadvantage in selling surplusagricultural commodities abroad because it must pay higher costs to transportthem.150 International Affairs Budget function 150 covers all spending on international programs by various departments and agencies whose missions concern international affairs. The category includes spending by the Department of Stateto conduct foreign policy and exchange programs, funds controlled directly by the President to give othernations economic and military aid, and U.S. contributions to international organizations such as the UnitedNations, multilateral development banks, and the International Monetary Fund. Function 150 also includesfinancing for exports through the Export-Import Bank. CBO estimates that discretionary outlays for thefunction will total $20.1 billion in 2000. Repayments of loans and interest income in the Exchange Stabili-zation Fund account for the negative balances in mandatory spending for this function.

Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) broadcast country-specific news to Eastern Europe andthe former Soviet Union, respectively. The Voice of America (VOA) overseesradio broadcasts that provide news and U.S.-related information to audiencesworldwide. The State Department oversees television broadcasting servicessimilar to VOA's radio broadcasts and also manages a broadcasting service toCuba. In 1996, the Congress consolidated the appropriations for VOA, RFE/RL, and television and film service into the international broadcasting opera-tions account. Funding for radio and television broadcasting to Cuba and forconstruction of broadcast facilities was provided in separate appropriations. This option would eliminate VOA and RFE/RL and end broadcasting services to Cuba, all overseas construction of broadcast facilities, and U.S.overseas television broadcasting. Compared with the funding level in 2000,those cuts would save almost $3.7 billion over 10 years. (The savings are netof the near-term costs of termination, such as severance pay for employees.) Proponents of ending overseas broadcasting by the U.S. government say that RFE/RL and VOA are Cold War relics that are no longer necessary. RFEand RL continue to broadcast to former Communist countries in Europe eventhough those countries now have ready access to world news. With the adventof satellite television broadcasting, most nations can receive news about theUnited States and the world from private broadcasters, such as the Cable NewsNetwork (CNN). Some proponents of termination also argue that the primarytechnology used by VOA and RFE/RL\u2014shortwave radio\u2014limits the audiencesand thus the effectiveness of U.S. overseas broadcasting. In addition, propo-nents maintain that foreigners may distrust the accuracy of broadcasts spon-sored by the U.S. government. Critics of this option would argue that the current level of broadcasting should continue or even increase. The process of change in Eastern Europe andthe former Soviet Union needs nurturing, they say, and U.S. broadcasting canhelp in that process. In addition, many c ountries in other parts of the world remain closed to outside information. Supporters of VOA and RFE/RL arguethat shortwave radio is the best way to reach audiences in closed countriesbecause very few people there own satellite dishes, which are needed to receivetelevision broadcasts such as those of CNN. Moreover, they note, VOA andRFE/RL are broadcasting more programs over AM and FM frequencies. Sup-porters of U.S. government broadcasting also argue that it should be sharply in-creased to some countries, such as China and North Korea. Further, they main-tain that television is a powerful communications tool, and private televisionnetworks cannot adequately communicate U.S. policy and viewpoints.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 150 107 150-02 Reduce Assistance to Israel and Egypt Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 PUBLICATIONS: The Role of Foreign Aid in Development (Study), May 1997. Enhancing U.S. Security Through Foreign Aid (Study), April 1994. Limiting Conventional Arms Exports to the Middle East (Study), September 1992.As part of the 1979 Camp David peace accords, the United States agreed to pro- vide substantial amounts of aid to Israel and Egypt to promote economic, political,and military security. That aid, which for years totaled $5.1 billion for the twocountries, is paid through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and the Foreign Mili-tary Financing (FMF) program. Of that total, Israel received $3 billion ($1.2 bil-lion in ESF payments and $1.8 billion from the FMF program), and Egypt received$2.1 billion ($815 million from the ESF and $1.3 billion from the FMF program). In January 1998, Israel proposed phasing out its $1.2 billion a year in ESF payments while increasing its FMF assistance by $600 million a year. The confer-ence report for the 1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act endorsed thatproposal with a 10-year phase-in. As a result, it cut ESF aid to Israel by $120million and increased FMF aid by $60 million. The conference report also reducedeconomic assistance to Egypt from $815 million in 1998 to $775 million in1999\u2014and proposed cutting it to $415 million by 2008\u2014while keeping militaryaid constant. This year, U.S. aid to the two nations will total $6.1 billion (including $1.2 billion in FMF aid to Israel promised for implementing the Wye peace accords).That amount represents more than three-fourths of discretionary spending for U.S.security assistance and more than 40 percent of the foreign operations budget for2000. This option would drop the one-time funding for implementing the Wye peace accords and forgo the proposed increase in military funding for Israel (main-taining that aid at its 1998 level). The option would also continue to cut economicassistance to both Israel and Egypt each year through 2008. The reductions inIsraeli aid would save $481 million in 2001, compared with this year's fundinglevel, and a total of $6.7 billion over five years and almost $17.8 billion over 10years. Adding in the cuts to Egyptian aid would bring total savings in outlays to$483 million in 2001, $7.0 billion over five years, and $19.3 billion over 10 years. The conference report asserted that increased military assistance to Israel was necessary because \"the [country's] security situation, particularly with respect toweapons of mass destruction, has worsened.\" But despite reports of weapons tech-nology being transferred to Iran, critics could argue that Israel's security situationhas improved. Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction has been reduced,though not eliminated, by U.N. inspections; Israel has concluded a peace treaty withJordan; and peace talks with the Palestinians and Syrians are continuing. In addi-tion to those developments, Israel's per capita income (in excess of $18,000) ap-proaches that of the United States' European allies, who have long been prodded bythe Congress to assume greater responsibility for their own defense. As for Egypt, some analysts say U.S. assistance to that country is not being spent wisely or efficiently. Critics note that high levels of appropriations haveexceeded Egypt's ability to spend the funds, leading to the accumulation of largeundisbursed balances, inefficient use of assistance, and delays in making the re-forms needed to foster self-sustaining growth. Furthermore, many other countriesand organizations contribute substantial amounts of money to Egypt, which couldmake reducing U.S. assistance more feasible.108 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 150-03 Eliminate the Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Trade and Development Agency Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 814 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS: The Domestic Costs of Sanctions on Foreign Commerce (Study), March 1999. The Role of Foreign Aid in Development (Study), May 1997.The Export-Import Bank (Eximbank), the Overseas Private Investment Corpo- ration (OPIC), and the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) promote U.S.exports and overseas investment by providing a range of services to U.S. com-panies wishing to do business abroad. Eximbank offers subsidized direct loans,guarantees of private lending, and export credit insurance; OPIC provides in-vestment financing and insurance against political risks; and TDA funds feasi-bility studies, orientation visits, training grants, and other forms of technicalassistance. Appropriations in 2000 for Eximbank, OPIC, and TDA are $814million, $59 million, and $44 million, respectively. Those organizations are only three of the various U.S. government agen- cies (some of which are part of the Department of Agriculture) that promotetrade and exports. Moreover, their impact on exports may be limited. Accord-ing to the annual reports of OPIC, Eximbank, and TDA, those three agenciessupported about 2 percent of total U.S. exports in 1995. This option would eliminate TDA and the subsidy appropriations for Eximbank and OPIC. The latter two agencies could not make any new financeor insurance commitments but would continue to service their existing portfo-lios. Those changes would save $155 million in outlays in 2001, $2.5 billionthrough 2005, and almost $6.2 billion over 10 years compared with the fundinglevel for 2000. Supporters of promoting exports argue that those agencies play an impor- tant role in helping U.S. businesses, especially small businesses, understandand penetrate overseas markets. They level the playing field for U.S. exportersby offsetting the subsidies that foreign governments provide to their exporters,thereby creating jobs and promoting sales of U.S. goods. By encouraging U.S.investment in areas such as Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union,those agencies may also serve a foreign policy objective. Critics dispute the claim that promoting exports creates U.S. jobs. They assert that by subsidizing exports, the government distorts business decisionsthat are best left to free markets. OPIC and Eximbank finance programs thathave trouble raising funds on their own merit. Similarly, those agencies' insur-ance programs may encourage moral hazard\u2014the practice of companies invest-ing in riskier projects than they would if more of their own funds were at stake.Finally, critics argue, those agencies encourage highly risky projects in vulnera-ble areas. Although emerging economies like Russia and Indonesia may beimportant markets for U.S. exports, they can also be dangerous: firms operat-ing there may face considerable political, currency, and business risks.250 General Science, Space, and Technology Budget function 250 includes funding for the National Science Foundation, more than 90 percent of the spending of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and funding for general science researchby the Department of Energy. In 2000, CBO estimates, outlays for function 250 will total about $18.5billion. For the past 10 years, the trend in spending for the function has generally been upward.

The l aunch of a third element using a Russian Proton rocket has been delayed pending the investigation of an October 1999 failure ofthat launcher. The space shuttle has also encountered delays recently, suggest-ing that the completion date currently planned for the facility\u20142005\u2014 couldbe at risk. By that time, an estimated $25 billion will have been spent to de-velop, build, and assemble the space station. The General Accounting Office(GAO) estimates that the life-cycle cost of the entire project, including opera-tion, maintenance, and transportation to and from orbit, will be over $95 bil-lion. The Congress's yearly decision about whether to continue funding for theprogram hinges not on the money already spent but on whether the program'sbenefits are sufficient to justify spending an add itional $70 billion through 2013. People who would cancel the international space station program assert that its benefits are unlikely to justify additional spending and that costs arelikely to increase above those estimated by GAO. To support their position,critics cite the general lack of enthusiasm for the space station among individ-ual scientists and scientific societies. The program's opponents also note thatthe costs of the program have continually increased, although its capabilitiesand scope have decreased. Critics point as well to the uncertainty surroundingthe costs of operating and supporting the facility once it has been developed andlaunched. Regarding that issue, opponents are skeptical of the National Aero-nautics and Space Administration's assurance that the station's operating costswill be low, noting that the agency made similar claims about the space shuttlethat proved overly optimistic. Advocates of continued spending for the space station reject critics' claim that the program's benefits do not sufficiently justify its costs. Supporters placea high value on the role of the station as a stepping-stone to future human ex-ploration of the solar system. They also contend that the program will deliverboth scientific advances and perhaps even commercial benefits. Supportersfurther argue that Russia's participation has strengthened the foreign policyreason for continuing the program. They assert that drawing Russia, and par-ticularly its aerospace industry, into a cooperative venture will help to stabilizethe Russian economy and provide incentives for Russia to adhere to interna-tional agreements on the spread of missile technology. Advocates also pointout that the project's cancellation would force the United States to renege onagreements signed with European nations, Japan, and Canada. That could hurtthe prospects for future international cooperative agreements on space, science,and other areas of mutual interest.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 250 111 250-02 Eliminate the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 122 37 2002 152 1012003 152 1332004 152 1432005 152 148 2001-2005 730 562 2001-2010 1,490 1,322 Relative to WIDI 2001 124 37 2002 157 1032003 160 1372004 163 1512005 166 159 2001-2005 770 587 2001-2010 1,640 1,442 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a partnership between states and several research-oriented federal agencies, wasdesigned to encourage more investment by states in science and technology.EPSCoR was created in response to a concentrated distribution among thestates of federal research and development (R&D) funding: a large number ofstates receive little funding. Currently, federal agencies spend about $113 mil-lion on EPSCoR. Eighteen states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico currently take part in EPSCoR. Between 1980 and 1998, the National Science Foundation pro-vided roughly $270 million to more than 60 colleges, universities, and laborato-ries that had not received significant federal R&D funding in the past. Stategovernments, local industry, and other nonfederal sources provided an addi-tional $300 million to those institutions. The entire effort has supported 2,000scientists and engineers. Opponents of EPSCoR contend that the nation must make optimal use of its limited research dollars. That principle would argue for supporting research-ers whose proposals are judged superior through a process of peer review,without regard to geographical distribution. Furthermore, critics doubt whethernewcomers to the research enterprise can sustain a top-level effort, which re-quires substantial ongoing investments by the states and regional institutions.Even with matching funds from the states and other nonfederal organizations,novice research institutions might find it difficult to succeed. Critics also argue that EPSCoR was supposed to be an experimental pro- gram, not a permanent source of R&D support for selected states. They notethat after nearly 15 years of EPSCoR support, the program's recipients continueto attract only about 8 percent of the federal funding for academic R&D. Op-ponents point to the corresponding lack of improvement in state shares of suchfunding: participating states that began the 1980s in the bottom half of thenational rankings were still in the bottom half in 1998. Advocates maintain that EPSCoR promotes a more equitable geographic distribution of the nation's science and technology base. They assert that statepolicymakers invest more in R&D than they would without EPSCoR's incen-tives and those investments promote equity in higher education by givingstudents in those states the research experience and training necessary for ca-reers in scientific fields. Proponents also cont end that the program fosters technology-related industries in the states by involving local firms in selectingresearch topics. Supporters note that 15 of the EPSCoR states experiencedabove-average growth in federal funding for academic R&D over the 1990-1998 period. They claim that the EPSCoR states have improved their rankingsin their chosen \"niche\" fields, even if such changes are not apparent in the over-all statistics. They argue as well that the quality of EPSCoR-funded research isequivalent to other federally funded R&D because awards are based on meritreviews. 270 Energy Budget function 270 includes funding for the nondefense programs of the Department of Energy as well as for the Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electrification loans, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.The programs supported by this function are intended to increase the supply of energy, encourage energyconservation, provide an emergency supply of energy, and regulate energy production. CBO estimates thatdiscretionary outlays for function 270 will be $3 billion in 2000, continuing recent declines in energyspending. Negative balances in mandatory spending for the function result from repayment of loans,receipts from the sale of electricity produced by federal entities, and charges for the disposal of nuclearwaste.

Those programs were put into place when theprices of fossil fuels were controlled and, as a result, incentives for technologydevelopment were muted. In a world of deregulation and increasingly freeenergy markets, the value of federal research and development (R&D) pro-grams in energy is questionable. One reason for deregulating prices in energy markets is to provide suppli- ers with incentives to develop newer and better technology and bring it to mar-ket. The recent deregulation of electrical generation markets, for example, hasalready brought a great deal of low-cost generating capacity on line, displacinghigher-cost power plants. In addition, private entities are more attuned to which new technology has commercial promise than are federal officials. Federal programs in the fossilfuel area have a long history of funding technologies that, while interestingtechnically, had little chance of commercial feasibility, even after years offederal investment. As a result, much of the federal spending has been irrele-vant to solving the nation's energy problems. Critics of the programs argue that DOE should concentrate on basic en- ergy research and reduce the department's involvement in applied technologydevelopment. They contend that the federal government has a comparativeadvantage in developing the basic science for a new energy source but a com-parative disadvantage in developing and demonstrating the costly technology.DOE's basic energy science program, critics note, allows university researchersand scientists at the national laboratories to better understand the materials andother sciences underlying energy use. Finally, because energy prices have been low, potential users of applied technology for new energy sources have had little incentive to invest in imple-menting it. Consequently, the technology developed by the basic energy sci-ence program sometimes sat on the shelf until it became obsolete. Defenders of the applied research programs argue that federal R&D in those areas helps offset several existing failures in energy markets and that theprograms therefore represent a sound investment for the nation. Current energyprices, they argue, do not reflect the environmental damage done by excessivereliance on fossil fuels, including the potential for global warming. In addition,current energy prices do not reflect the military and economic risks posed byreliance on Middle East oil. Although the DOE R&D programs cannot correctmarket failures in the short term, they may moderate the consequences of suchfailures over the long term.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 270 115 270-02 Eliminate the Department of Energy's Applied Research for Energy Conservation Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 461 115 2002 577 3982003 270-01, 270-03, 270-04, 270-08, and 350-01In 2000, the Department of Energy (DOE) will spend $577 million on pro- grams to develop energy conservation technology. Those efforts include thePartnership for the Next Generation Vehicles (discussed in option 270-08) forautomobile research as well as industrial and residential energy-efficiencyresearch. Involvement of federal agencies in the selection and development ofnear-commercial technologies raises questions about the appropriateness of thecurrent division of labor between the public and private sectors in this area. Opponents of federal spending for energy conservation research and de- velopment (R&D) make several arguments. Generally, they argue that thefederal government should stay out of applied energy technology developmentand concentrate on basic research in the science underlying those areas. Spe-cifically, they note that many projects funded through this research effort aresmall and discrete enough\u2014and, in many cases, have a clear enough market\u2014to warrant private investment. In such instances, DOE may be crowding out orpreempting private-sector firms. In other instances, such programs conductR&D that the intended recipients are likely to ignore\u2014often because it is tooexpensive or esoteric to implement. Critics of the programs also note that other federal policies encourage the introduction of some of the technologies. Utilities, for instance, are encouragedto subsidize consumers' purchases of conservation technologies by underwritingthe purchase of efficient home appliances. In addition, the tax code favorsinvestments in conservation technology. Thus, federal government R&D pro-grams may be duplicative given such other avenues of support. Defenders of the programs argue that federal R&D in the energy conser- vation area helps offset several existing failures in energy markets. Currentenergy prices, they argue, do not reflect the damage to the environment fromexcessively relying on fossil fuels, including the potential for global warming.In addition, current energy prices do not reflect the military and economic risksposed by relying on Middle East oil. Although DOE's R&D programs forenergy conservation cannot correct market failures in the short term, they canmoderate the consequences of those market failures over the long run. One advantage such programs have had over other DOE R&D efforts in the energy technology area is that many of the individual programs are small.Over the years, many of the best outcomes of the research efforts, such as thinfilms to make windows more energy efficient, have come from small researchinvestments. (Because energy conservation R&D and the Partnership for the New Generation Vehicles overlap, the savings from eliminating both programswould be less than the sum of the two options. In addition to its own energyconservation program, DOE separately provides grants to state and local agen-cies for energy conservation. Those grants are discussed in option 270-04.)116 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 270-03 Eliminate the Department of Energy's Applied Research for Solar and Renewable Energy Sources Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 248 186 2002 310 2952003 310 : 270-01, 270-02, 350-01, and REV-35In 2000, the Department of Energy (DOE) will spend $310 million on research and development (R&D) for solar and other renewable energy sources. Thelargest technology development efforts by far are those for developing alterna-tive liquid fuels from biomass and electricity from photovoltaic cells. Smallerefforts involve electric energy storage and wind energy systems. Phasing outthe research would save $1.4 billion over the 2001-2005 time frame. Opponents of federal support for such research argue that the federal government should stay out of applied energy technology development andconcentrate on basic research in the science underlying those areas. Federallysponsored researchers lack the complex market feedback that helps researchersin private companies realize when their technologies become too esoteric orexpensive for the market. Another criticism shared by DOE's conservation R&D programs (dis- cussed in option 270-02) is that many of the research projects funded by therenewable energy program are sufficiently small and discrete and have a clearenough market to attract private funding. (Of course, many of those alternativeenergies were simply not economical during the long period when oil priceswere low.) The biggest single solar energy program\u2014photovoltaics\u2014has largely suc- ceeded, and program o pponents might argue that it may now be time for an orderly withdrawal of federal support. Several large factories are producingphotovoltaic cells, mainly for the export market, or are under construction.After nearly three decades of federal support, the market may well be becominga purely private concern, and the government may wish to withdraw its funding.Foreign firms, critics note, are likely to dominate the market because of theircountries' higher domestic energy prices and consequent higher likely demandfor alternative energy sources. U.S. consumers may let foreign companies andgovernments bear the cost of developing the energy sources and then buy thetechnology when it is cheap and perfected. For liquid fuels derived from renewable resources, especially biomass, the federal tax code already provides incentives for developing the technology.Ethanol fuels receive special treatment under the federal highway tax (seeoption REV-35). Furthermore, federal regulations authorized by many differ-ent statutes favor alcohol fuels, which now usually mean those that are cornbased. Such fuels could be derived from other biomass sources, however, withthe right technology. Defenders of the programs argue that energy markets are still far from perfect. The energy prices consumers pay fail to incorporate both the environ-mental and national security risks posed by the nation's dependence on fossilfuels. Furthermore, the United States also plays the role of international R&Dlaboratory for less developed countries, which often have much higher energycosts.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 270 117 270-04 Eliminate Energy Conservation Grant Programs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 134 34 2002 168 1162003 168 1552004 168 1,644 Relative WIDI 37 2002 270-02, 270-03, 300-15, and 600-12 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity?

Institutional conservation grants sup-ported by the office help reduce the use of energy in educational and health carefacilities by adding federal funds to private and local public spending to encour-age local investment in building improvements. The Office of State and Com-munity Programs also supports the energy conservation programs of states andmunicipal governments that, for example, establish energy-efficiency standardsfor buildings and promote public transportation and carpooling. Critics of thoseprograms question whether they actually produce any savings and whether theconservation actions they provide are not already promoted by other programsor laws, such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The DOE programsare independent of a similar block-grant activity, the Low Income Home En-ergy Assistance Program, administered by the Department of Health and Hu-man Services. This option would halt new appropriations for the block-grant programs that support energy conservation activities by the states. It would save $1.5billion in outlays from 2001 through 2010. Arguments supporting this option include diminished concern about en- ergy security, questions about the efficacy of the program, and duplication withother programs or laws. Federal grants to promote less energy consumptionreflect the widespread concerns about energy-supply security\u2014for all sources,including oil, natural gas, and coal\u2014prevalent in the mid-1970s. Today, thoseconcerns are more correctly focused on imported oil supplies. State grant pro-grams that help reduce residential and institutional demand for natural gas andcoal-generated electricity have little benefit for the cause of oil-supply security.And although the government has urged the reduction of energy use for environ-mental reasons, federal support for reducing the use of gas and coal throughconservation grants for security or environmental needs conflicts with otherfederal policies that promote the production and use of those fuels. Proponents of continuing the grant programs claim that eliminating them could impose hardships on states that wish to continue their energy conserva-tion efforts but are financially stressed. Many states still rely heavily on suchgrants to help low-income households and public institutions. In addition, thevoluntary energy savings those programs effect are an important part of thePresident's Climate Change Action Plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Such considerations may result in continued federal support for the energyconservation grants.118 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 270-05 Eliminate Electrification and Telephone Credit Subsidies Provided by the Rural Utilities Service Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 15 1 2002 15 22003 15 62004 15 112005 15 13 2001-2005 75 33 2001-2010 150 103 Relative to WIDI 2001 15 1 2002 15 22003 16 62004 16 112005 16 14 2001-2005 78 34 2001-2010 161 111 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 270-06, 270-07, 450-01, REV-42, and REV-43 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity?

Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998.The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) is an agency within the Department of Agri- culture that, among other activities, offers financial assistance through subsidizedloans and grants to electric and telephone companies serving primarily ruralareas. Because that purpose has been largely accomplished, questions havearisen as to whether those subsidies should continue to be offered. This optionaddresses only the credit subsidies provided through loans for electrification andtelephone service that were previously administered by the Rural ElectrificationAdministration (REA). The former REA programs were combined with otherloan and grant programs in 1994 to form the RUS. (Additional potential savingsfrom cutting other RUS programs are described in option 450-01.) For 2000, RUS subsidies to electric and telephone companies total about $15 million. In addition, the agency spends nearly $31 million per year adminis-tering those programs. Eliminating the credit subsidies for loans made or guar-anteed by the RUS would reduce outlays by an estimated $103 million between2001 and 2010. The savings shown in the table could result from either of two scenarios: discontinue lending and require RUS borrowers to use private sources of capitalfor all of their loan needs, or continue a federal loan program but eliminate subsi-dies. A loan program with no subsidy costs would require raising the interestrates on loans to rural electric and telephone companies to the level of the Trea-sury's cost of borrowing; it would also mean charging small loan origination feesto cover the cost of defaults for certain classes of loans. In addition to savings insubsidy costs, some savings in administrative costs could result if all such lend-ing was discontinued. Some of the nearly $31 million per year in current salariesand expenses would be required to administer existing loans, but those costscould be gradually reduced under a no-new-lending option. Additional adminis-trative savings over the 2001-2010 period could be achieved by eliminating theprogram, but those additional savings are not counted in this option. The loan program for rural electrification and telephone service has largely fulfilled its original goal of making those services available in rural communi-ties. Most of the communities that the RUS subsidizes are now much larger thanthe original service area requirement of no more than 1,500 inhabitants. RUSborrowers serve about 10 percent of U.S. electricity customers and 4 percent oftelephone customers. In addition, more than 95 percent of rural America haselectric service. Moreover, most RUS borrowers already use some private fi-nancing. Because the cost of interest accounts for only a small percentage of thetypical customer's bill, eliminating the remaining federal subsidy would havelittle effect on the utility rates that most borrowers charge their customers. Proponents of the RUS claim that many borrowers still depend on federal loans to maintain and expand those utilities. Increasing the interest rates orcharging origination fees on some loans would raise the rates that such borrow-ers charge their customers, especially in the rural regions that are most affected.Borrowers argue that they need some level of subsidization to keep their serviceand utility rates comparable with those in urban areas.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 270 119 270-06 Restructure the Power Marketing Administrations to Charge Higher Rates Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 130 1302003 130 1302004 130 1302005 130 130 2001-2005 520 520 2001-2010 1,170 1,170 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory OPTIONS : 270-05, 270-07, REV-42, and REV-43 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997.The three smallest power marketing administrations (PMAs) of the Department of Energy sell about 1 percent of the nation's electricity: the Western AreaPower Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, and the South-eastern Power Administration. Those PMAs sell power at below-market rates,a practice that some observers find inconsistent with improving the efficiencyof energy markets, which is a generally accepted goal of energy policy. The power generated by the PMAs comes largely from hydropower facili- ties that the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation havebuilt and continue to operate. Current law requires that those sales be made atcost\u2014a situation intended to ultimately reimburse taxpayers for a share of thecosts of construction, costs of current operations, and interest on the portion oftotal costs that has not been repaid. Interest charges are generally below thegovernment's cost of borrowing, which, along with the low cost of generatingelectricity from hydropower, results in power rates for federal customers thatare significantly below the rates that other utilities charge. Current law alsorequires that PMAs first offer that power to rural electric cooperatives, munici-pal utilities, and other publicly owned utilities. Restructuring would require that those three PMAs sell electricity at mar- ket rates to any wholesale buyer. Implementing higher rate charges wouldbring in about $130 million in 2002 and increase total receipts by about $500million through 2005 relative to the 2000 level. The rationale for federal power subsidies is not as strong as it once was. The market power of private utilities is checked by federal and state regulationof the power supply, by federal antitrust laws, and, increasingly, by competitionfrom independent power sources. In addition, the disparity between incomes indifferent regions of the country has diminished. In many cases, neighboringcommunities\u2014some receiving federal power and some not\u2014have no discern-ible differences. For households in the regions that the three PMAs serve,federal sales of power meet only a small share of their total power needs; there-fore, the impact of increased federal rates on average costs is small. In addi-tion, the prospect of significant future costs of producing electricity fromhydropower further supports the case for increasing power rates now. Suchcosts are for long-deferred maintenance and upgrades and for addressing the environmental needs of threatened species. The opportunity to earn additionalrevenues from federal power sales may be short-lived: new power sources arebecoming increasingly competitive with federal power. The current beneficiaries of the federal power program believe that re- structuring could greatly increase electric utility rates for the many small andrural communities served by PMAs. They also argue that continuing low-costfederal power is necessary to counter the uncompetitive practices of investor-owned utilities and to support the economies of certain regions of the country.120 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 270-07 Sell the Southeastern Power Administration and Related Power Generation Equipment Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory (excludes discretionary savings for operations) RELATED OPTIONS : 270-05, 270-06, REV-42, and REV-43 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997. Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998.The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) of the Department of Energy sells electricity that comes from hydropower facilities that the Army Corps ofEngineers has constructed and operates. SEPA pays private transmission com-panies to deliver that power to over 300 wholesale customers: rural coopera-tives, municipal utilities, and other publicly owned utilities. Selling f ederal power assets would be consistent with the policy goal of increasing efficiencyin energy markets. SEPA power rates are designed to recover for taxpayers a share of the costs of construction, costs of current operations, and a nominal interest chargeon the portion of total costs that have not yet been recovered. The averagerevenues from SEPA power (for sales other than to the Tennessee Valley Au-thority) are about 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), compared with averagerevenues in the region of 4.7 cents per kWh. Selling assets that directly support the production of SEPA electricity would save about $1.4 billion over the 2001-2005 period. That estimate re-flects sale proceeds of about $1.7 billion minus a loss of budgetary receipts forthat period of about $160 million annually. Those figures do not include dis-cretionary budgetary savings of about $75 million annually from ending appro-priations to SEPA and the Corps for operations. The estimate of sale proceedsis based on recent sales of hydroelectric assets in the United States. Corpsassets to be transferred would include equipment, such as turbines and genera-tors, but not the dams, reservoirs, or waterside property. The sale would alsoinclude rights of access to that equipment and to the water flows necessary forpower generation, subject to the constraints of competing uses of water. The original reasons for establishing SEPA\u2014marketing low-cost power to promote competition and fostering economic development\u2014are no longercompelling to many people because of the small amount of power SEPA sellsand because of competitive and regulatory constraints on power rates. Also,selling federal facilities does not mean transferring all water resource functions.The Corps could retain direct responsibility for managing water flows for alluses, including the upkeep of basic physical structures and surrounding proper-ties. Or, as with other nonfederal dams, the terms of the federal license tooperate the facility (issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)could dictate the management of water flows for competing purposes. Proponents of maintaining federal ownership believe that nonfederal enti- ties lack the proper incentives to perform all of SEPA's functions. Many Corpsfacilities serve multiple purposes, for example, managing water resources fornavigation, flood control, or recreation as well as for power generation. Propo-nents also argue that increased power rates could accompany selling SEPA.SEPA sales meet only about 1 percent of the total power needs in the 11 stateswhere it operates; however, for a few communities, dependence on SEPA is great.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 270 121 270-08 Eliminate Federal Funding for the Partnership for New Generation Vehicles Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 187 51 2002 227 1532003 227 2052004 227 2212005 227 223 2001-2005 1,095 853 2001-2010 2,230 1,973 Relative to WIDI 2001 190 53 2002 234 1582003 239 2122004 247 240 2001-2005 1,153 896 2001-2010 2,450 2,159 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 270-02The Partnership for New Generation Vehicles (PNGV) is a joint federal/private research effort that performs cooperative, precompetitive automotive research,mainly focusing on energy-efficient vehicles. The program raises the issue ofthe appropriateness of federal support for commercial technology. The partner-ship draws on the resources of five federal agencies, most notably the Depart-ment of Energy (DOE). Within DOE, the partnership primarily falls underenergy conservation, where it received $135 million for 2000. (B ecause the PNGV and the energy conservation programs\u2014option 270-02\u2014are related, thesavings from eliminating both of them would be less than the sum of the twooptions.) Critics of the PNGV argue that instead of using general tax revenues to support applied research, the federal government could more fairly increase theefficiency of the nation's automotive fleet by raising gasoline taxes, user fees,or both for vehicles that get low mileage per gallon of fuel. Critics further pointout that the program may not reach its goal of creating a production-readyvehicle by 2004. Although the latest National Academy of Sciences evaluationof the program \"believes the near-term and long-term technologies the PNGVhas focused on have the potential to meet the program's objectives,\" representa-tives of the automakers involved in the PNGV have downplayed the prospectsfor near-term commercialization of the technological advances achieved so far.Competitive pressures also raise doubts about the PNGV's usefulness. BothHonda and Toyota have either begun marketing high-mileage cars in the UnitedStates or plan to do so in 2000. If those efforts succeed, then domestic auto-makers should have sufficient commercial incentive to continue their researchand hence should no longer need federal support. Finally, critics contend thatbecause the federal contribution to PNGV has, to date, accounted for only asmall fraction of total spending on research and development by participatingautomakers, those firms could probably finance such efforts privately. Proponents of the PNGV argue that continuing imperfections in energy markets and environmental considerations make the development of these tech-nologies a public policy matter. Although sports utility vehicles, minivans, andpickups have more than doubled their 1983 market share, claiming 46 percentof the U.S. market in 1999, the PNGV program conducts research that couldcontribute to the production of high-mileage vehicles. Given the uncertaintysurrounding energy prices and environmental issues, levying taxes or user feesto reduce current fuel consumption could impose a burden on consumers thatoutweighs eventual benefits. From that perspective, federal funding for PNGVis a low-cost option today that will facilitate domestic production of efficientvehicles at a later date. If low-income consumers were more likely to purchaseolder, inefficient vehicles, research subsidies would then avoid regressive gaso-line taxes, user fees, or both.122 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 270-09 Sell Oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 217 217 2002 266 2662003 273 2732004 : Mandatory RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Rethinking Emergency Energy Policy (Study), December 1994.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stock of crude oil that was first authorized in 1975 to help safeguard the nation against thethreat of a severe disruption of oil supplies. The SPR consists of four under-ground sites along the Gulf of Mexico that together have the capacity to store680 million barrels of oil. The SPR currently holds about 575 million barrelsof oil. The Department of Energy (DOE) can sustain a maximum drawdown ofabout 4 million barrels per day (20 percent of the nation's current petroleumuse) for 90 days. The department has released oil from the SPR in emergencycircumstances only once\u201417 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War. Thegovernment's net investment in the SPR is about $16 billion for oil and about$4 billion for storage and transportation facilities. At a price of $20 per barrel,the value of that oil would be about $12 billion. This option would require DOE to reduce the size and excess capacity of the SPR by closing the smallest storage site, Bayou Choctaw, and selling thesite's 68 million barrels of oil over a five-year period. It would place at least 10million but no more than 20 million barrels on the market each year to mini-mize the impact of reducing the SPR on world oil prices. The CongressionalBudget Office estimates that receipts from the oil sales would total $1.3 billionover the 2001-2005 period, and appropriations for operating the reserve couldbe reduced after the site is decommissioned toward the end of the decade. Theoption conforms with past Congressional actions: in 1996 and 1997, the Con-gress directed DOE to sell SPR oil to offset spending on the SPR and otherprograms and has authorized DOE to reduce its excess capacity by leasing it toforeign governments or private entities. Thus far, however, efforts to leaseexcess capacity have not succeeded. The argument for reducing the SPR is supported by changes in program benefits and costs since 1975. Structural changes in energy markets and the economy at large have reduced the potential cost of disrupting oil supplies andconsequently the benefits from releasing oil in a crisis. The increasing diversityof world oil supplies and the growing integration of the economies of oil-producing and oil-consuming nations lessen the risk of such disruptions. More-over, the experience of DOE in its Persian Gulf War sale and in recent salesindicates that the process of deciding to release oil and the sales mechanism cancontribute to market uncertainty, further diminishing the benefits of release.The rising costs of maintaining the SPR also strengthen the case for reducing it:many of the SPR's facilities are aging and have required unanticipated spendingfor repairs to maintain drawdown capabilities. Arguments against closing the site and selling the oil stress logistical and pricing concerns. Closing Bayou Choctaw could reduce DOE's flexibility indistributing oil if a drawdown occurred, especially in the Mississippi Valleyregion. Another argument against this option concerns the effect of selling SPRoil on domestic oil producers, which prompted the Congress to repeal legisla-tion in 1998 requiring oil to be sold.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 270 123 270-10 Eliminate the Analysis Function of the Energy Information Administration Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 8 5 2002 10 92003 10 102004 10 102005 10 10 2001-2005 48 44 2001-2010 98 94 Relative to WIDI 2001 8 5 2002 11 102003 11 112004 11 112005 11 11 2001-2005 52 48 2001-2010 114 110 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 350-01The Energy Information Administration (EIA), created by the Congress in 1977, is an independent statistical agency of the Department of Energy. EIA'smission is to develop data and analyses on energy resources and reserves, pro-duction, demand, and technologies as well as related fi nancial and statistical information on the adequacy of energy resources necessary to meet U.S. energydemand. Questions about the appropriateness and current need for those activi-ties underlie this option. Eliminating the analysis function, which includesenergy forecasting, would save $5 million in 2001 and reduce outlays by $94million through 2010 relative to the 2000 funding level. The Congress created EIA when many people thought that the United States would deplete its reserve of fossil fuels. Because that concern has beenalleviated, some argue that eliminating EIA's analysis function is appropriate.Furthermore, some critics of EIA assert that analysis that supports policy deci-sions is already done by academicians, the Department of Energy's Policy Of-fice, the Congressional Research Service, and the General Accounting Office.In addition, some critics note that industry's w illingness to fund specific re- search activities through trade associations, such as the American PetroleumInstitute and the Edison Electric Institute, suggests that EIA is providing aservice that the private sector would perform on its own. EIA supporters claim that an independent party should collect, analyze, and disseminate information. They claim that access to information is impor-tant to a competitive market. Although concerns about energy supplies havebeen alleviated, the Congress is now addressing such issues as global warming.Without independent analysis, the Congress would have to choose among con-flicting analyses done by the Administration, environmental groups, and indus-try sources. Additional savings could be obtained by eliminating some of EIA's data collection or moving EIA's data collection responsibilities to other agenciessuch as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Much of the informationcollected and distributed by the EIA is available through newspapers and tradesources. Natural gas and electricity futures prices are traded on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, among others, and are published daily in the Wall Street Journal. Although EIA conducts its own statistical surveys, it also develops reports based on information collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-mission.124 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 270-11 Require the Tennessee Valley Authority to Accelerate the Repayment of Deferred Nuclear Assets and Limit Its Future Borrowing Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 2752003 2752004 2752005 275 2001-2005 1,100 2001-2010 2,475 270-05, 270-06, 270-07, REV-42, and REV-43 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997.The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal agency, is one of the largest electric utilities in the nation. Under current law, TVA sets rates for the electric-ity that it sells so that over time, receipts from its sales will be sufficient to payfor the program's routine operations, cap ital projects, and certain nonpower activities. TVA finances some of those costs by borrowing from the public, sub-ject to a limit of $30 b illion on the amount of its outstanding debt at any given time. Currently, TVA's outstanding debt totals about $26 billion, an amount thatthe agency and others suggest may be too high in today's increasingly competi-tive electricity market. Of particular concern is the agency's ability to repay $6.3billion that it has invested in building nuclear power plants whose completionhas been deferred. This option would amend laws governing TVA's financial operations in two ways. First, it would require the agency to pay off its $6.3 billion investmentin deferred nuclear assets within the next 10 years. (Those payments would be inaddition to the agency's regular depreciation of its other assets.) Second, theoption would lower the limit on TVA's outstanding debt to $26 billion for fiscalyear 2001 and periodically reduce that limit further so that the borrowing capequals $18 billion by the end of 2 010. The Congressional Budget Office esti- mates that those changes would reduce TVA's net outlays by an average of about$275 million a year beginning in 2002. Savings over the 2001-2005 periodwould total about $1.1 billion. In addition to those savings, CBO expects TVA to retire substantial amounts of its debt under current law. In 1997, the agency a nnounced a series of actions aimed at cu tting its debt in half by 2007. Despite those initiatives, however, TVA has paid off less debt over the past two years than it planned,largely because of add itional spending on new power plants and emission con- trols. CBO projects that under current law, TVA's outstanding debt will declineto about $20.5 billion by the end of 2010. The savings from this option could result from reductions in spending, increases in power revenues, or some combi-nation of the two. This option would address several concerns about TVA operations. Adopt- ing a statutory timetable for repaying TVA's investment in deferred assets wouldallay concerns about taxpayers\u2014rather than the TVA system\u2014being saddledwith those costs if TVA has to reduce its prices in the future to stay competitive.Indeed, a key rationale for reducing TVA's debt-related costs is to increase theagency's flexibility in setting rates so that it can remain a viable competitor inthe future. Lowering the debt limit would bring the statutory ceiling in line withTVA's long-term plans, giving customers greater assurance that debt-relatedcosts could not climb in the future unless authorized by the Congress. Advocates for the status quo argue that such restrictions are unnecessary and could impair TVA's ability to manage its $6-billion-a-year electricity busi-ness efficiently. They point to the init iatives that the agency announced in 1997 as evidence that market forces, rather than new government controls, will leadTVA to lower its debt and restrain its spending. They also argue that this optioncould force TVA to keep prices higher than anticipated, at least in the near term.300 Natural Resources and Environment Budget function 300 supports programs administered by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department ofCommerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

RELATED OPTIONS : 300-01, 300-06, 300-07, and 300-08The Forest Service (FS) manages federal timber sales from 119 national for- ests. The spending necessary to make those sales in some cases is larger thanthe receipts paid to the government. As a result, questions have arisen aboutwhether those sales should be made. In fiscal year 1997, the FS sold roughly 3.7 billion board feet of public timber. Purchasers may harvest the timber over several years and pay the FSupon harvest. The total fiscal year 1997 harvest, approximately 3.3 billionboard feet, represented a continuing decline in volume from previous years.According to Timber Sales Program Annual Reports published by the FS, in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the FS s pent more on the timber program than it collected from companies harvesting the timber. In 1997, the timber expensesreported by the FS exceeded timber receipts by about $90 million. The annualreports exclude receipt-sharing payments to states from the calculation of tim-ber expenses. When such payments are included, timber expenses ex ceeded receipts by more than $160 million (or almost 30 percent) in fiscal year 1997. The FS does not maintain the data needed to estimate annual timber re- ceipts and the expenditures associated with each individual timber sale. There-fore, it is hard to determine precisely the possible budgetary savings from phas-ing out all timber sales in the National Forest System for which expendituresare likely to exceed receipts. To illustrate the potential savings, however, thisoption estimates the reduction in net outlays in the federal budget from elimi-nating all future timber sales in five National Forest System regions for whichimbalances between cash receipts and expenditures were prominent in fiscalyears 1996 and 1997. In those five regions (the Northern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, Inter- mountain, and Alaska regions), cash expenditures exceeded cash receipts by atleast 30 percent in 1996 and 1997. Eliminating all future timber sales from those regions would reduce the FS's outlays for the 2001-2010 period by about$1,570 million; timber r eceipts (which are categorized as mandatory) would fall by about $560 million after subtracting payments to states, producing netsavings of $1,010 million. (Hence, the savings estimates are the net effect ofchanges in both discretionary and mandatory budgets.) Timber sales for which spending exceeds receipts have several potential drawbacks. They may lead to reductions in the federal surplus, excessive de-pletion of federal timber resources, and destruction of roadless forests that haverecreational value. Potential advantages of the sales include community stability in areas dependent on federal timber for logging and other related jobs. Timber salesalso improve access to the land\u2014as a result of road construction\u2014for fire pro-tection and recreation.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 127 300-02 Impose a Ten-Year Moratorium on Land Purchases by the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 457 185 2002 457 3322003 457 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryFor 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior have received appro- priations of about $467 million to buy l and that is generally used to create or expand designated recreation and conservation areas, including national parks,national forests, wilderness areas, and national wildlife refuges. This optionproposes placing a 10-year moratorium on future appropriations for land acqui-sition by those departments. It would provide for a small annual appropriation($10 million) to cover emergency acquis ition of important tracts that became available on short notice, compensation to \"inholders\" (landholders whoseproperty lies wholly within the boundaries of an area set aside for public pur-poses, such as a national park), and ongoing administrative expenses. Savingsfrom this option would total $4.2 billion through 2010. Proponents of this option argue that land management agencies should improve their stewardship of the lands they already own before taking on addi-tional management responsibilities. In many instances, the National Park Ser-vice, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management find it difficult tomaintain and finance operations on their existing landholdings. Furthermore,given the limited operating funds of those agencies, environmental objectivessuch as habitat protection and access to recreation might be best met by im-proving management in currently held areas rather than providing minimalmanagement over a larger domain. Supporters of this option also argue that thefederal government already owns enough land. Currently, about 650 million acres\u2014approximately 30 percent of the United States' land mass\u2014belong tothe government, according to the General Services Administration. The senti-ment that that amount is sufficient is particularly strong in the West, where thegovernment owns about 62 percent of the land area in 11 states. Opponents of this option argue that future land purchases are necessary to achieve ecosystem management objectives and fulfill existing obligations fornational parks. Much of the land targeted by the Congress for new and ex-panded federal reserves is privately held, and acquiring it will require pur-chases. Furthermore, encroaching urban development and related activitiesoutside the boundaries of national parks and other federal landholdings may bedamaging the federal resources. Land acquisition is an important tool for miti-gating that problem. Acquisitions that consolidate landholdings may also helpimprove the efficiency of public land management.128 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-03 Eliminate Federal Grants for Water Infrastructure Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 RELATED OPTION : 450-01 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Economic Effects of Federal Spending on Infrastructure andOther Investments (Paper), June 1998.The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) require municipal wastewater and drinking water systems to meet certain performance stan-dards to protect the quality of the nation's waters and the safety of its drinking watersupply. The CWA provides financial assistance so communities can construct waste-water treatment plants that comply with the act's provisions. The 1996 amendmentsto the SDWA authorized a state revolving loan program for drinking water infra-structure. For 2000, the Congress appropriated a bout $2.6 billion for water infra- structure programs, including funds for wastewater programs and the relatively newprogram for drinking water facilities. Ending all funding of new water infrastructureprojects after 2000 would save $18.7 billion through 2010 measured against the2000 funding level. Title II of the CWA provides for grants to states and municipalities for con- structing wastewater treatment facilities. As amended in 1987, the CWA phased outtitle II grants and authorized a new grant program under title VI to s upport state revolving funds (SRFs) for water pollution control. Under the new system, statescontinue to receive federal grants, but now they are responsible for developing andoperating their own programs. For each dollar of title VI grant money a state re-ceives, it must contribute 20 cents to its SRF. States use the combined funds to makelow-interest loans to communities for building or upgrading municipal wastewatertreatment facilities. Although authorization for the SRF program under the CWA hasexpired, the Congress continues to provide annual grant appropriations. As amended in 1996, the SDWA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to states for capitalizing revolving loan funds for treatingdrinking water. As with the CWA's wastewater SRF program, states may use thosefunds to make low-cost financing available to public water systems for constructingfacilities to treat drinking water. In 2000, the Congress appropriated $820 millionfor capitalization grants for drinking water SRFs. Proponents of eliminating federal grants to water-related SRFs say such grants may encourage inefficient decisions about water treatment by allowing states to loanmoney at below-market interest rates. Below-market loan rates could reduce incen-tives for local governments to find less costly alternatives for controlling water pollu-tion and treating drinking water. In addition, federal contributions to wastewaterSRFs were intended to help move toward full state and local financing of the fundsby 1995. Thus, proponents of ending federal grants to those SRFs argue that theprogram was intended to be temporary and may have replaced, rather than supple-mented, state and local spending. Opponents of such cuts argue that states and localities could have trouble meeting the federal treatment deadlines without continued federal support\u2014bothbecause repayments to the SRFs would be too small to fund new projects and be-cause states would be unable to handle the additional cost of offsetting decreasedfederal contributions. Opponents of the cuts also have concerns about helping small and economi- cally disadvantaged communities that have had the most difficulty complying withCWA and SDWA requirements. Some people who oppose eliminating the federalgrants maintain that doing so would increase the burden of unfunded federal man-dates on state and local governments.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 129 300-04 Spend the Remaining Balance of the Superfund Trust Fund and Terminate the Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 0 0 2002 1,400 3502003 1,400 : DiscretionarySince 1981, the Superfund program of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been charged with cleaning up the nation's worst hazardous wastesites, particularly those on the National Priorities List (NPL). The programmade progress in the 1990s, especially in increasing the number of sites in thefinal phase of the cleanup process, but more work remains. As of the end offiscal year 1999, EPA had identified 670 of 1,403 NPL sites addressed throughthe Superfund program as \"construction complete,\" meaning that all physicalconstruction work required for the cleanup effort (capping a landfill, installinga groundwater treatment system, and the like) was done. Conversely, remedyconstruction had begun but had not been completed at 438 current NPL sites and had not yet started at 304 sites. In addition, EPA has proposed that another58 sites be added to the list, and hundreds more sites with NPL-caliber prob-lems probably remain to be identified. Although the Congress could choose to end the program at any time, one notable occasion to do so might be the forthcoming depletion of the HazardousSubstance Superfund, the trust fund that has been the main source of the pro-gram's appropriations. The trust fund balance has declined since Superfund's\"environmental income tax\" on corporations and excise taxes on oil, petroleumproducts, and certain chemicals expired in 1995. The trust fund is projected toend fiscal year 2000 with an unappropriated balance of roughly $1.1 billion,more than enough for fiscal year 2001 given current levels of spending andappropriations from the general fund. If the end of 2001 is too close at hand toallow a safe and orderly program shutdown, the Congress could reduce annualspending to stretch the same total funding for additional months or years. The argument for spending the trust fund balance and terminating the program asserts that Superfund efforts are not worthwhile, at least not at thefederal level. Superfund's critics argue that the program's cost is disproportion-ate to the threat represented by hazardous waste sites and that its system ofretroactive, joint-and-several liability is irremediably inefficient and unfair.They also argue that waste sites are local problems that are more appropriatelyhandled by the states, almost all of which have their own hazardous wastecleanup programs for sites not addressed under federal law. In addition, al-though depleting the trust f und has no budgetary significance, it provides a near-term opportunity to shut the program down\u2014unlike, for example, merelyclosing the NPL to new sites, which would require maintaining some federalprogram for most or all of the decade. Superfund's defenders point to evidence linking Superfund sites to human health problems, including birth defects, leukemia, cardiovascular abnormali-ties, respiratory illnesses, and immune disorders, and note that the public placesa high priority on waste cleanup. They argue further that Superfund has re-duced costs and completed more cleanups in recent years and that modest legis-lative reforms can improve the program. Finally, they note that states varywidely in their capacity to handle NPL-caliber problems.130 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-05 Charge Market Rates for Information Provided by the National Weather Service Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 2 2002 22003 22004 22005 2 2001-2005 10 2001-2010 20 SPENDING CATEGORY: This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED OPTIONS : 370-02 and 400-05The National Weather Service (NWS) provides public forecasts, weather and flood warnings, and severe-weather advisories to protect lives and reduce prop-erty damage from those hazards. The annual budget for such services, includ-ing operating weather satellites, is about $1 billion. Currently, the NWS al-lows open access to all of its weather data and information services. Commer-cial users\u2014such as the Weather Channel and Accu-Weather\u2014pay fees onlyfor the costs of computer hookups and transmission of NWS data. Moreover,the NWS charges nothing for information received from its satellite broadcastsor Internet site. Charging fees that are based on the fair market value of accessto that information, except for severe-weather warnings, could raise $2 millionin 2001, $10 million over five years, and $20 million over 10 years. Charging market value for general weather information might lessen its dissemination but encourage the production and presentation of more usefulinformation. Supporters of this option contend that charging market-based feeswould not substantially reduce the public's access to weather reports. For ex-ample, as long as the news media will pay for private forecasts, the market willdemand NWS products. In addition, because the fees would not apply tosevere-weather warnings, the safety of the general public would not be compro-mised. Many European nations routinely charge users for weather informationprovided by their satellites. For example, the Br itish Meteorological Office raises over $30 million a year from commercial customers. In the past, the NWS viewed charging fair market fees as a significant barrier to the public's access to its information. The Omnibus Budget Reconcil-iation Act of 1990 attempted to set fees based on the fair market value of NWSdata and information, except for information related to warnings and watches,information provided under international agreements, and data for nonprofitinstitutions. However, the NWS received approval from the Office of Manage-ment and Budget to reset the user fee to recover only the cost of disseminatingthe information.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 131 300-06 Change the Revenue-Sharing Formula from a Gross-Receipt to a Net-Receipt Basis for Commercial Activities on Federal Lands Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 185 185 2002 185 1852003 190 1902004 190 1902005 190 190 2001-2005 940 940 2001-2010 1,935 1,935 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 300-01, 300-07, and 300-08The federal government owns about 650 million acres of public lands\u2014nearly one-third of the United States' land mass. Those lands contain a rich supply ofnatural resources: timber, coal, forage for livestock, oil and natural gas, andmany nonfuel minerals. Private interests have access to much of the federal landto develop its resources and generally pay fees to the federal government depend-ing on the commercial returns realized. In many cases, the federal governmentallots a percentage of those receipts to the states and counties containing theresources, as compensation for tax revenues they did not receive from the federallands within their boundaries. The federal government typically calculates thoseallotments on a gross-receipt basis before accounting for its program costs. Thepractice sometimes causes the federal government's costs to exceed its share ofreceipts. Shifting payments to a net basis would reduce federal outlays. In most cases, the Forest Service is required to allot 25 percent of its gross receipts from commercial activities in the national forests to the respective statesand counties. The Department of the Interior allots 4 percent of its timber re-ceipts, an average of 18 percent of its grazing fees, and 4 percent of its miningfees from \"common variety\" materials to the states; the department's MineralsManagement Service (MMS) allots 50 percent of its adjusted onshore oil, gas,and other mineral receipts to the states. The MMS deducts 50 percent of itsadministrative costs from the gross-receipt calculation before distributing thosepayments. In effect, the states share 25 percent of the burden of those adminis-trative costs. On certain federal lands\u2014specifically, national forests affected byprotection of the spotted owl and the Oregon and California grant lands\u2014pay-ments to states and counties are guaranteed on the basis of an average of pastpayments. (Such guaranteed payments expire after 2003. This option assumesthat administrative costs would be deducted from the guaranteed payments on thebasis of past receipts and from other state payments on the basis of current re-ceipts.) Federal savings would be substantial if the Congress required those agen- cies to deduct their full program costs from gross receipts before paying thestates. The regional jurisdictions would continue to receive the same allottedpercentage of net federal receipts and accrue receipt shares totaling about $710million in 2001. The projected savings do not include potential federal cost increases under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, which was estab-lished to offset the effects of nontaxable federal lands on local governments'budgets. Payments in lieu of taxes are partially reduced by the amount ofrevenue-sharing payments from federal agencies. Payments under the PILTprogram would increase by about $30 million a year beginning in fiscal year2001 if net program receipts were shared and the Congress appropriated such anincrease. Changing the revenue-sharing formula to a net-receipt basis would proba- bly cause economic hardship to the respective states and counties, greatly reduc-ing their revenue. That might lead to severe cuts in state and county spending.To help alleviate that hardship, the formula could switch gradually to the net-receipt basis over several years.132 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-07 Reauthorize Holding Fees and Charge Royalties for Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 36 2002 442003 412004 412005 41 2001-2005 203 2001-2010 408 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

Alternative Proposals for Royalties on Hardrock Minerals (Testimony), May 1993.The General Mining Law of 1872, which originally supported an overall policy of encouraging settlement of the American West, governs access to hardrockminerals\u2014including gold, silver, copper, and uranium\u2014on public lands. Unlikeproducers of fossil fuels and other minerals from public lands, miners do not payroyalties to the government on the value of hardrock minerals. Instead, under theabove law, any holder of more than 10 mining claims on public lands must payan annual holding fee of $100 per claim, and all claimholders must pay a $25location fee when recording a claim. However, authorization to collect the hold-ing and location fees expires in 2000. Estimates place the current gross value of hardrock minerals production at about $650 million annually (excluding claims with so-called first-half patents).That sum has diminished greatly in recent years because of patenting activity.(In patenting, miners gain title to public lands by paying a one-time fee of $2.50or $5.00 an acre.) This option would reauthorize the current holding fee andlocation fee and assumes that such fees would be recorded as offsetting receiptsto the Treasury. (They are currently counted as offsetting collections to appropri-ations.) The option also considers an 8 percent royalty that the Congress couldimpose on the production of hardrock minerals from public lands. The royaltywould be on net proceeds (defined here as sales revenues minus costs that in-clude mining, separation, transportation, and other items). Total budgetary savings from those action would be $408 million over the 2001-2010 period. Of that total, reauthorization of holding and location feesaccount for about $330 million and royalty collections for about $78 million. Those estimates assume that states in which the mining takes place receive 25percent of the gross royalty receipts. They also assume that no further patentingof public lands occurs. (In comparison, royalties based on gross proceeds wouldraise more. In general, the costs of administering any royalty based on net pro-ceeds would exceed those for a royalty based on gross proceeds.) People in favor of reforming mining law\u2014including many in the environ- mental community\u2014argue that low holding fees and zero royalties make it lesscostly to produce on federal lands than on private lands (where payment of royal-ties is the rule). That policy encourages overdevelopment of public lands, whichmay cause severe environmental damage. Reforming the law could promoteother uses of those lands, such as recreation and wilderness conservation. Opponents of reform argue that without free access to public resources, exploration for hardrock minerals in this country\u2014especially by small miners\u2014would decline. They also argue that royalties would diminish the profitabilityof many mines, leading to scaled-back operations or closure and adverse eco-nomic consequences for mining communities in the West. Because many min-eral prices are set in world markets, miners would be unable to pass along newroyalty costs to consumers.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 133 300-08 Raise Grazing Fees on Public Lands Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 2 2002 42003 52004 72005 8 2001-2005 26 2001-2010 84 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection ora mandatory offsetting receipt de-pending on the specific language ofthe legislation establishing the fee. RELATED OPTIONS : 300-01, 300-06, and 300-07The federal government owns and manages about 650 million acres of U.S. land. The land has many purposes, including grazing of privately owned livestock.Cattle owners compensate the government for using the land by paying grazingfees; the fees, however, may not give the public a fair return. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administer livestock grazing on public rangelands in the West. In 1998, ranchers wereauthorized to use about 15 million animal unit months (AUMs)\u2014a standardmeasure of forage\u2014for grazing on those lands. In 1990, the appraised value ofpublic rangeland in six Western states varied between $5 and $10 per AUM. A1993 study indicated that the Forest Service and BLM spent $4.60 per AUM inthat year to manage their rangelands for grazing. The 1993 permit fee, however,was $1.86 per AUM. Thus, the current fee structure may subsidize ranchers.(The current fee is $1.35 per AUM.) The Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 established the current formula for grazing fees. It uses a 1966 base value of $1.23 per AUM andmakes adjustments to account for changes in beef cattle markets and productioninput markets. The Congress has considered various proposals to increase graz-ing fees. The increase in federal receipts resulting from any such proposal de-pends on the degree to which ranchers reduce their use of AUMs in response tohigher fees. One proposal is to allocate grazing rights through a bidding processas long as competition is not too limited. Another option is to follow the states'lead. The federal government would determine grazing fees for federal lands ineach state the same way the particular state determines grazing fees on state-owned lands. The government would implement this proposal over 10 years asexisting permits expired. The 10-year savings estimate of $84 million is net ofadditional payments to states of about $22 million. It does not include any addi-tional appropriations for range improvements that could result from added re-ceipts. Proponents of this option believe that low fees that subsidize ranching contribute to overgrazing and deteriorated range conditions. They support theapproach of following decisions made at the state level and reject the one-size-fits-all nature of the current federal fee. State grazing fees and the means ofcalculating them vary widely by state and sometimes even within a state. Sup-porters of this approach also point out that states' interest in the revenue receivedfrom both state and federal fees lessens any incentive to manipulate state fees tolower federal fees. Opponents of this approach note that state rangelands may be more valu- able than federal lands for grazing purposes. Some systems used by states toestablish fees may not reflect those differences in land quality and conditions ofuse when applied to federal lands. For example, that concern does not exist instates using auction or appraisal systems for setting fees. People in states usingfee formulas, however, have that concern. Opponents also point out that theadministrative costs of using different procedures to establish federal grazingfees in each state will be higher than those incurred under the current uniformfederal fee structure. (This option does not consider possible differences in ad-ministrative costs.)134 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-09 Recover Costs Associated with Administering the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Permitting Programs Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 9 2002 192003 192004 192005 19 2001-2005 85 2001-2010 180 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection ora mandatory offsetting receipt de-pending on the specific language ofthe legislation establishing the fee.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that any private,commercial, or government actor desiring to dredge or place fill material in U.S.waters or wetlands must obtain a permit from the Corps. By increasing permitfees, the Corps could recover a portion of its annual regulatory costs. Imposingone type of fee structure for section 404 permitting\u2014a cost-of-service fee oncommercial applicants\u2014would generate $9 million in 2001 and a total of $180million through 2010. From rather inauspicious beginnings, section 404 of CWA has grown to become the core of the nation's effort to protect wetlands. As legally interpreted,the terms \"dredge\" and \"fill\" encompass virtually any activity on a wetland inwhich dirt is moved, effectively granting the Corps permitting jurisdiction overall wetlands, including those not associated with traditionally navigable water-ways. In fiscal year 2000, the Corps's regulatory program budget is $117 mil-lion, which mainly funds permitting activ ities. In fiscal year 1996 (the most recent year for which data are available), the Corps received about 65,000 appli-cations for section 404 permits for discharging dredged or fill materials. Undersection 404, the Corps is required to evaluate each permit application and grantapproval or denial on the basis of expert opinion and statutory guidelines. Thebulk of the permits are quickly approved through outstanding general or regionalpermits, which grant authority for many low-impact activities. Evaluation ofpermits not covered by outstanding per mits may require the Corps to c onduct detailed, lengthy, and costly reviews. Currently, fees levied for commercial and private permits are $100 and $10, respectively. Government applicants do not pay a fee. The fee structurehas not changed since 1977. Total fee collections fall far short of covering thecosts of administering the permitting program, particularly for applications re-quiring detailed review. The Administration has proposed changing the permitfee structure: its Wetland Plan would increase permit fees for commercial proj-ects and eliminate the fees for private, noncommercial projects. Proponents of higher fees argue that parties pursuing a permit should bear the cost of the permit\u2014not the general taxpaying public. Since permit seekersare advancing a private interest whose benefits accrue to a private party, thecosts should be borne by that party. Taxpayers should not have to pay for some-thing that advances the interests of a comparative few. Permit seekers oppose such fees because they do not want to fund some- thing that may ultimately deny them the right to use their land in the way theychoose. The goal of the section 404 permitting program is to advance a publicinterest by protecting wetlands. Since society benefits from wetlands protection,often at the perceived expense of property owners, society should pay. Further-more, the regulatory process that property owners must navigate is already oner-ous, and raising the permit fees would add yet another cost, further infringing onproperty owners' rights.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 135 300-10 Impose User Fees on the Inland Waterway System Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 2332003 4672004 4672005 467 2001-2005 1,634 2001-2010 3,969 CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection, a mandatory offsetting receipt, or atax receipt, depending on the spe-cific language of the legislationestablishing the fee.

(Study), May 1992.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Army Corps of Engineers annually spends about $640 million for the nation's inland waterway system.Of that total, about $470 million is for operation and maintenance (O&M), andabout $170 million is for new construction. Current law allows up to 50 per-cent of new inland waterway construction to be funded by revenues from theinland waterway fuel tax, a levy on the fuel consumed by tow boats using mostsegments of the inland waterway system. All O&M expenditures are paid bygeneral tax revenues. Imposing user fees high enough to recover fully both O&M and construc- tion outlays for inland waterways would save about $1.6 billion during the2001-2005 period and a bout $4 billion over 10 years. The receipts could be considered tax revenues, offsetting receipts, or offse tting collections, depending on the form of the implementing legislation. Receipts could be increased byraising fuel taxes, imposing charges for the use of locks, or imposing fees basedon the weight of shipments and distance traveled. The estimates do not takeinto account any resulting reductions in income tax revenues. Imposing higher fees on users of the inland waterway system could im- prove the efficiency of its use by forcing shippers to choose the most efficienttransportation route rather than the most heavily subsidized one. Moreover,user fees would encourage more efficient use of existing waterways, reducingthe need for new construction to alleviate congestion. Finally, user fees sendmarket signals that identify the additional projects likely to provide the greatestnet benefits to society. The effects of user fees on efficiency would depend largely on whether the fees were set at the same rate for all segments of a waterway or on the basis ofthe cost of each segment. Since costs vary dramatically by segment, system-wide fees would offer weaker incentives for cost-effective spending becausethey would cause users of segments with low costs per ton-mile to subsidizeusers of high-cost segments. Fees based on the cost of each segment, by con-trast, could cause users to abandon high-cost segments of the waterways. One argument against user fees is that they may repress regional eco- nomic development. Imposing higher user fees would also lower the income ofbarge operators and grain producers in some regions, but those losses would besmall in the context of overall regional economies.136 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-11 Open the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to Leasing Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 02003 02004 02005 1,150 2001-2005 1,150 2001-2010 1,155 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 300-07 and 300-08The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) consists of 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska, of which 1.5 million acres are coastal plain. The coastalplain is the yet-to-be-explored onshore area with perhaps the country's mostpromising oil production potential. It is also the least disturbed Arctic coastalregion\u2014valued for species conservation and subsistence use. ANWR was established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conserva- tion Act of 1980. The refuge serves to conserve fish and wildlife habitats, fulfillrelated international treaty obligations, provide opportunities to continue indige-nous lifestyles, and protect water quality. The act prohibits industry activity inANWR unless specifically authorized by the Congress. This option would open ANWR's coastal plain to leasing and development. Leasing would be likely to result in bonus bid payments, ongoing rental pay-ments, and (once production begins, up to 10 or more years after leasing) royal-ties. As in recent proposals, the Congressional Budget Office assumes the fed-eral government would receive one-half of the offsetting r eceipts from those sources; the state of Alaska would receive the other half. The Department of the Interior's most recent assessment of the area's eco- nomically recoverable undiscovered petroleum resources is expressed in proba-bilities and assumptions about the price of oil at the time of pr oduction. For this estimate, CBO assumed an average price of $18 per barrel (in 1996 dollars)during the 2010-2030 period, partly on the basis of the Energy InformationAdministration's price forecast for 2020. At $18 per barrel (delivered to theWest Coast), the Department of the Interior estimates a 50 percent probabilitythat at least 2.4 billion barrels of oil will be produced. Using that mean resourceassessment and assuming that ANWR lease sales are held within the next 10years, CBO estimates that leasing ANWR would generate about $2.3 billionfrom bonus bids over the 2001-2010 period (with half of that amount going toAlaska). Conversely, if oil prices were to grow only at the rate of inflation after2010, the Department of the Interior's mean resource assessment indicates thatno oil would be economically recoverable from ANWR. At an expected price of$15 per barrel, leasing might not generate any significant proceeds for the gov-ernment. Arguments in favor of this option include the national security advantages of reducing dependence on imported oil. Most of ANWR would remain closedto development, and the part of the coastal plain that would be directly affectedby oil drilling and production represents less than 1 percent of ANWR. More-over, technological changes in the industry have improved its ability to safeguardthe environment. Arguments against this option include the short-term nature of the still uncertain gain from extracting a nonrenewable resource: it will not providelasting energy security. The coastal plain is ANWR's most biologically produc-tive area and sustains the biological productivity of the entire refuge. Industrialactivity poses a threat to wildlife and the environment despite efforts to mitigateits impact.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 137 300-12 Impose a New Harbor Maintenance Fee Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 164 2002 2812003 2332004 1802005 124 2001-2005 982 2001-2010 612 NOTE: net of revenues lost from repealing the exist-ing harbor tax. SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific lan-guage of the legislation establish-ing the fee. RELATED OPTIONS : 300-09, 300-10, 400-04, and 400-05On March 31, 1998, the Supreme Court found that the harbor maintenance tax (as it applied to exports) violated the constitutional restriction that \"No tax orduty shall be laid on articles exported from any State.\" Collection of the tax asapplied to exports ceased on April 25, 1998. One way to replace the revenueformerly generated by the harbor maintenance tax is to develop a new system ofharbor fees that is constitutional. Under such a system, the commercial users ofU.S. ports would pay a fee based on port use rather than a payment based oncargo value. Such fees would apply to imports, exports, and domestic ship-ments. Taxes currently levied on imports and domestic shipments would berescinded. Moneys generated by the fee would help support harbor operation,construction, and maintenance. The Administration has proposed such a pro-gram. The Army Corps of Engineers now spends about $960 million annually for costs associated with operating, constructing, and maintaining commercialports nationwide. A major part of those activities is maintaining adequatechannel depths. Replacing what remains of the harbor maintenance tax with amore comprehensive fee on commercial port users would generate $164 millionin 2001, $281 million in 2002, and $982 million over the 2001-2005 period. Two arguments can be made for imposing a harbor maintenance fee pro- gram. First, harbor maintenance activities, such as dredging by the Corps ofEngineers, provide a commercial service to identifiable beneficiaries. Modernand well-maintained ports save shippers money through lower unit costs ofshipping on larger vessels and by minimizing inland transport costs. Exporterscurrently make no payments directly associated with their use of port facilities.Second, imposing a harbor fee program would be unlikely to decrease port usebecause the fees would result in charges on users similar to the ones users re-cently paid under the rescinded tax. Whether imposing a harbor fee system will pass constitutional muster is uncertain. Establishing such a system might be viewed by the Supreme Courtas an unconstitutional export tax disguised by another name. A sec ond legal concern with a fee program is whether it would violate international tradeagreements, as several international trading partners allege of the harbor main-tenance tax. Another drawback of the proposed fee system is that after severalyears, the cash it would generate would not keep pace with the revenue that therescinded taxes would have generated. That is because tax collections based onthe value of the goods shipped are projected to increase more quickly than theproposed fees, which would be tied to the costs of operating, constructing, andmaintaining harbors.138 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-13 Terminate Economic Support Fund Payments Under the South Pacific Fisheries Treaty Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 14 142004 14 142005 14 14 2001-2005 42 42 2001-2010 112 112 Relative to WIDI 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 15 152004 15 152005 15 15 2001-2005 45 45 2001-2010 125 125 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe South Pacific Fisheries Treaty is formally known as the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Governmentof the United States of America. Signed in April 1987, it lays out terms andconditions under which up to 55 U.S.-flag commercial fishing vessels may usepurse seine methods to catch tuna in territorial waters of 16 Pacific Islandstates, including Kiribati, Micronesia, and Papua New Guinea. Japan, Korea,and Taiwan have similar treaties providing access to the waters for their tunafleets. Associated with the treaty is an agreement on annual economic assistance paid by the United States to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. Theagreement provides for amending, extending, or terminating that arrangementby written agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement bygiving the other party one year's written advance notice. An amended agree-ment went into effect in 1993 providing for $14 million annually from June1993 to June 2002. This option would terminate the U.S. government's pay-ments to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency at the end of the currentagreement in 2003. Savings would total $112 million over the 2 001-2010 period. Currently, the treaty also provides for an annual industry payment that covers license fees for up to 55 vessels as well as technical assistance to thePacific Island parties. In addition, the treaty calls for the U.S. tuna industry tocover the cost of the observer program. From June 1993 to June 1998, indus-try payments for licenses and technical assistance under the treaty were $4million annually. For that same period, on average, 40 U.S.-flag vessels hadaccess to tuna in the territorial waters of the South Pacific Island states eachyear. Thus, industry payments per vessel, excluding the cost of the observerprogram, averaged nearly $100,000 annually. People in favor of terminating U.S. economic assistance under the treaty believe that taxpayers are supporting the access of private vessels to the territo-rial waters of the party states at an annual rate of over $340,000 per vessel. Ifthose payments accurately reflect part of the value of that access to the fisher-ies, such a subsidy may encourage the overexploitation of fisheries. People who oppose this option believe that the treaty is merely an expedi- tious vehicle, and the only vehicle, through which the United States providesfinancial assistance, in keeping with its foreign policy interests, to the nations inthe South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. They argue that it is not a sub-sidy\u2014the fishing industry's own payments under the treaty are comparable withthose made by non-U.S. fleets. Those fleets obtain yearly licenses on a bilat-eral basis with any Pacific Island state of interest at a cost of 5 percent of thevalue of the previous year's catch.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 300 139 300-14 Eliminate Federal Funding of Beach Replenishment Projects Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 90 45 2002 90 772003 90 902004 90 902005 90 90 2001-2005 450 392 2001-2010 900 842 Relative to WIDI 2001 92 46 2002 94 792003 96 952004 98 962005 100 98 2001-2005 480 414 2001-2010 1,012 936 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 400-02Each year, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers partially f unds and conducts several sand replenishment projects to counter beach erosion. That activityraises questions about the federal role in addressing what may be primarilylocal problems and the ultimate effectiveness of the replenishment efforts, with-out regard to who pays for them. These operations typically involve dredgingsand from offshore locations and pumping it ashore to rebuild eroded areas.Typically, state and local governments share part of the operations' cost. Ceas-ing federal funding for beach replenishment activities would reduce discretion-ary outlays by $45 million in 2001 and $392 million for the 2001-2005 period. Beach replenishment projects have two primary motivations: mitigating damage and enhancing recreation. Beaches act as a barrier to absorb waveenergy and protect coastal property from severe weather. Replenishing erodedbeaches helps them maintain that protective function. And because beaches arean important recreational resource in many areas, sand replenishment projectshelp to ensure that such areas continue to generate economic activity throughtourism. Opponents of federal spending for beach replenishment argue that its benefits accrue largely to the states and localities in which the projects occur.Therefore, such opponents reason, state and local governments should bear theprojects' entire cost, not the federal government. Another argument against anyfunding, federal or otherwise, of replenishment projects is their ultimate futility.Beach erosion is an irreversible natural process, and replenishment projectsserve only to temporarily delay the inevitable natural shifting of beaches. Abetter long-term solution would be to accept the fact that beaches will shift overtime and to remove the various retention structures that inhibit the natural flowof sand along beaches and sometimes exacerbate erosion. Supporters of replenishment projects argue that beach replenishment ben- efits the nation at large as well as specific states and localities. Advocatesfurther contend that it would be unfair to stop federal funding, given the munici-palities and property owners who have made investments with the expectationof continuing federal support. Supporters also argue that in some cases, federalprojects\u2014for example, those intended to keep coastal inlets open\u2014contributeto beach erosion and that the federal government should bear part of the cost ofreplenishment in those cases.140 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 300-15 Eliminate Energy-Efficiency Programs of the EPA Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 0 0 2002 64 542003 64 642004 64 642005 64 64 2001-2005 256 246 2001-2010 576 566 Relative to WIDI 2001 0 0 2002 64 542003 66 652004 67 672005 69 69 2001-2005 266 255 2001-2010 637 625 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 270-04 and 270-08The President's Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI) is a government- wide strategy to stabilize emissions of greenhouse gases. It includes severalprograms of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that are intended tostimulate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and the use of renewableenergy by households and businesses. This option would halt new appropria-tions for two EPA activities that are a part of the CCTI but may contribute fewenvironmental benefits: the Energy Star and Green Lights programs for label-ing energy-efficient products and the Climate Wise program of public/privatepartnerships to encourage businesses to save energy. Energy Star and Green Lights are product-labeling programs meant to encourage businesses to sell products that meet or exceed federal guidelines forenergy efficiency and to raise consumers' awareness of energy-efficient prod-ucts. The types of products that the EPA has designated to receive the labelsinclude lighting fixtures, home appliances, office equipment, home constructionmaterial, and houses. The EPA also disseminates information on sellers of thelabeled products and offers participants some technical assistance in imple-menting efficiency changes. The Climate Wise program assists businesses inidentifying actions that may help them to save energy and reduce pr oduction costs, including free pollution-prevention and energy-efficiency assessments.For both programs, the main benefits to participants are in the public recogni-tion and free advertising that they receive for their efforts. Supporters of these EPA activities stress the relationship between energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) and othertoxic or smog-producing elements\u2014efforts to save energy may red uce such emissions. They also believe that the EPA is addressing market failures be-cause consumers do not see the full public benefits of using energy-savingproducts. Insufficient consumer interest in energy efficiency may com pound industry's normal disincentive to invest in uncertain new technologies. Critics, however, question the actual energy savings and whether any savings that do occur would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example,putting a government label on products that already meet government standardsmay produce little gain. Also, encouraging consumers to purchase, for exam-ple, an electric appliance rather than a less-efficient gas appliance could actu-ally increase carbon dioxide emissions, since the carbon content of the coalused to produce electricity is so high.350 Agriculture Budget function 350 covers programs administered by the Department of Agriculture, including such activities as agricultural research and stabilization of farm incomes through loans, subsidies, and otherpayments to farmers. CBO estimates that discretionary outlays for function 350 will total $4.5 billion in2000. Mandatory outlays for the function will increase to an estimated $24.1 billion in 2000\u2014from $7.9billion in 1998\u2014because of depressed commodity prices and provisions of the Agriculture, Rural Develop-ment, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 2000.

In particular, the Agricultural Research Service, the de-partment's internal research arm, focuses on maintaining and increasing theproductivity of the nation's land and water resources, improving the quality ofagricultural products and finding new uses for them, and improving humanhealth and nutrition. Those activities raise questions about the appropriatenessand effectiveness of federal involvement. The Cooperative State Research,Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) participates in a nationwide sys-tem of agricultural research and educational program planning and coordinationbetween state institutions and USDA. CSREES also takes part in the Coopera-tive Extension System, a national educational network that combines the exper-tise and resources of federal, state, and local partners. The Economic ResearchService carries out economic and other social science research and analysis forpublic and private decisions about agriculture, food, natural resources, andrural America. The 1999 appropriations for those three USDA units total $1.9 billion. Reducing the funding by 10 percent would save $836 million in outlays from2001 to 2005 and about $1.8 billion from 2001 to 2010. Federal funding for agricultural research may, in some cases, replace private funding. If federal funding was eliminated in those instances, the pri-vate sector would finance more of its own research. Moreover, federal fundingfor some extension activities under CSREES could be reduced without under-cutting its basic services to farmers. For example, funding for the Nutrition andFamily Education and Youth at Risk Programs totaled $68 million under theAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and RelatedAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000. Opponents of reducing funding for research and extension activities argue that the programs play important roles in developing an efficient farm sector.Reducing federal funding could compromise the sector's future development andits competitiveness in world markets. If the private sector assumed the burdenof funding, agricultural research, which contributes to an abundant, diverse, andrelatively inexpensive food supply for U.S. consumers, could decline. More-over, some federal grants are used to improve the health of humans, animals,and plants by funding research that promotes better nutrition or more environ-mentally sound farming practices. If federal funding was cut back, the publicmight have to bear some of that cost in higher prices, forgone innovations, andenvironmental degradation.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 350 143 350-02 Reduce Department of Agriculture Spending for Export Marketing and International Activities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 31 21 2002 31 282003 31 312004 31 312005 31 31 2001-2005 155 142 2001-2010 310 297 Relative to WIDI 2001 32 22 2002 33 302003 34 332004 34 342005 35 35 2001-2005 168 154 2001-2010 358 344 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 150-03, 350-06, and 350-09The Department of Agriculture (USDA) promotes exports and international activities through the programs of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). Forexample, in the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, FAS acts asa partner in joint ventures with \"cooperators,\" such as agricultural trade associ-ations and commodity groups, to develop markets for U.S. exports. FAS alsocollaborates on other ventures, one of which, the Cochran Fellowship Program,provides training to foreign nationals with the objective of improving commer-cial relationships that will benefit U.S. agriculture. Eliminating funding forthose two programs would reduce outlays by $142 million over the 2001-2005period and $297 million over the 2001-2010 period. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, also known as the Cooperator Program, typically promotes generic products and basic commodi-ties, such as grains and oilseeds, but the program also covers some high-valueproducts, such as meat and poultry. Some critics of the program argue thatcooperators should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because the cooper-ators benefit from them directly. (How much return, in terms of market devel-opment, the Cooperator Program actually generates or the extent to which itreplaces private expenditures with public funds is uncertain.) Some observersalso cite the possibility of duplicative services because the USDA provides funding for marketing through its Market Access Program and other activities. Eliminating the Cooperator Program, however, could pl ace U.S. e xporters at a disadvantage in international markets, depending in part on the amount ofsupport other countries provide to their exporters. Regarding the issue of dupli-cative services, some advocates note that the Cooperator Program is distinctfrom other programs in part because it focuses on services to trade organiza-tions and technical assistance. People concerned about U.S. exports of genericproducts and basic commodities consider the program useful for developingmarkets that could benefit the overall economy. The Cochran Fellowship Program brings foreign midlevel managers to the United States for training in agriculture and agribusiness. Although the pro-gram is popular among recipients and their sponsors, its direct benefits to U.S.agriculture are unknown; thus, it may be marginally val uable to taxpayers. However, eliminating the Cochran Fellowship Program could hurt U.S. agricul-ture to the extent that the program builds commercial relationships, introducesforeign professionals to U.S. products, and creates new opportunities for U.S.exports.144 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 350-03 Reinstate Assessments on Growers, Buyers, and Importers of Tobacco Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 8 8 2002 29 292003 30 302004 30 302005 30 30 2001-2005 127 127 2001-2010 277 277 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe federal government aids tobacco producers by supporting domestic tob acco prices above world-market levels. That support involves a combination ofmarketing quotas, price-supporting loans, and restrictions on imports. Thesupport program benefits about 125,000 growers and 300,000 holders of mar-keting quotas and allotments. Some quota holders actually raise tobacco, andsome rent their quota to others. For producers, tobacco is an important sourceof income, particularly in some states. The value of the 1998 tobacco crop wasestimated at $2.8 billion. The crop is produced in 16 states, and about two-thirds of its acreage lies in North Carolina and Kentucky. Tobacco is a controversial crop because of the health hazards of smoking, and federal support for producers has also been controversial. The price sup-port program has been modified over time to reduce its costs to the taxpayer,even though it does nothing to encourage tobacco use. In fact, it raises the priceof tobacco products to U.S. consumers but by a small amount. The Departmentof Agriculture has estimated that the program may increase the price of a packof cigarettes by less than 2 cents. The cost of the tobacco price s upport program varies from year to year. The program may have substantial outlays in a given year, but if it functions asintended, it should have no net cost to the government over time. The reason isthat growers and purchasers of tobacco contribute to \"no-net-cost accounts\"that are used to reimburse the government for costs (excluding administrativecosts) of the price support program. Starting with the 1991 crop, growers andpurchasers each paid an additional assessment of 0.5 percent of the value ofsales (for a total collection of 1 percent of sales). Those assessments, whichwere introduced to reduce the costs of federal farm programs and cut net federaloutlays, expired with the 1998 tobacco crop. A related assessment on importedtobacco expired at the end of calendar year 1998. This option would reinstatethose assessments beginning with the 2001 crop. Doing so would bring inreceipts of $127 million over the 2001-2005 period. The main benefit of reinstating the assessments is reducing net federal outlays. Proponents argue that the price support program gives tobacco produc-ers substantial benefits and that the assessment recoups a portion of those bene-fits for the taxpayer. Opponents would argue that since the tobacco programcosts the government little, assessments are unfair.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 350 145 350-04 Eliminate Mandatory Spending for the Agricultural Research Activities of the Fund for Rural America and the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 300 30 2002 150 1052003 150 1502004 0 1502005 0 105 2001-2005 600 540 2001-2010 600 600 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 350-01The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR) estab- lished the Fund for Rural America as a mandatory program to support ruralcommunities nationwide. FAIR provided funds through fiscal year 2000. TheAgricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (PublicLaw 105-185) provided additional funds through 2003. Currently, $120 mil-lion is available for research activities of the F und for Rural America for the 2001-2003 period. In addition, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 created and provided mandatory funding for the Initiative for Fu-ture Agriculture and Food Systems as a competitive grants program supportingresearch, extension, and education activities in critical emerging areas. Admin-istered by the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Cooperative State Re-search, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), the initiative was man-dated to receive $480 million through fiscal year 2003 to target food genomeresearch, food safety, human nutrition, alternative uses for agricultural com-modities, biotechnology, and precision agriculture. Eliminating those activitieswould reduce direct spending by $600 million from 2001 to 2010. Mandatory funding is usually reserved for entitlement programs, for which funding needs may be too immediate or undisputed to warrant annualreview by the Congress in the appropriation process. Supporters of this optionargue that the programs should hardly be grouped with other entitlements andshould be left where they have always been: as part of USDA's discretionaryfunding budget. Because providing the programs with mandatory funds mayavoid the spending jurisdiction and annual review of the appropriations com-mittees, supporters of the option argue that the programs do not necessarilyprovide funding for intended activities. In addition, they argue, existing discre-tionary programs can meet the goals of the agricultural research programs.Furthermore, they contend that federal funding for agricultural research may, insome cases, replace private funding. If federal funding was eliminated in thoseinstances, the private sector would finance more of its own research. Opponents of this option argue that reducing federal funding could com- promise U.S. agriculture's future development and its competitiveness in worldmarkets at a time when changes in commodity programs make producers' eco-nomic viability more dependent than before on world markets. They also arguethat the programs are necessary to address future food productivity, environ-mental quality, and farm income.146 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 350-05 Limit Future Enrollment of Land in the Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 8 8 2002 132 1322003 232 2322004 321 3212005 337 337 2001-2005 1,030 1,030 2001-2010 5,432 5,432 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Conservation Reserve Program promotes soil conservation, improves water quality, and provides wildlife habitat by removing land from active agriculturalproduction. Landowners contract with the program to keep land out of produc-tion, usually for a 10-year period, in exchange for annual rental payments.Such land is referred to as \"enrolled\" in the program. The federal governmentalso pays part of what farmers spend to establish approved cover crops on theland. The Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Credit Corpora-tion funds the program and spends about $1.5 billion per year on it. The pro-gram now has roughly 30 million acres enrolled; the law limits enrollment to atotal of 36.4 million acres. The Congressional Budget Office baseline assumesthat future net enrollments of land will reach the limit by 2009. Stopping newenrollments beginning October 1, 2000, would reduce outlays by $1 billion over the 2001-2005 period and by $5 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Some critics of the Conservation Reserve Program see it as corporate welfare\u2014unnecessarily and inefficiently supporting farm income. Others see itas an expensive and poorly focused conservation program and believe that otheruses of the money would yield greater environmental benefits. Still other criticsworry about the loss of economic activity in areas where much crop land isretired. Demand for seed, fertilizer, and other farm supplies drops in suchareas, hurting rural communities. The Conservation Reserve Program enjoys widespread support, however. Landowners appreciate the payments, which often exceed profits from contin-ued agricultural production and are more certain. Conservationists and envi-ronmentalists recognize the program's benefits and note USDA's plans to acceptthe most environmentally sensitive land in future enrollments. Those plansinvolve special provisions for enrolling land devoted to the most effective con-serving practices such as the use of filter strips, grass waterways, and riparianbuffers. Those and several other practices yield high returns per dollar spent inenhanced wildlife habitat, improved water quality, and reduced soil erosion. Infact, even most critics of the program recognize the need to take at least someenvironmentally sensitive land out of production for some time.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 350 147 350-06 Eliminate Attach\u00e9 Positions in the Foreign Agricultural Service Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 29 20 2002 39 332003 39 382004 39 392005 39 39 2001-2005 185 169 2001-2010 380 364 Relative to WIDI 2001 30 20 2002 41 352003 42 412004 43 432005 44 44 2001-2005 200 183 2001-2010 440 420 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 350-02 and 370-02U.S. agricultural attach\u00e9s, located at 97 offices worldwide, provide U.S. agri- cultural producers and traders with information on foreign government policies,supply and demand conditions, commercial trade relationships, and marketopportunities.

Instead, they argue, private firms could collect such information. In addition, Depart-ment of State or Commerce personnel could assume the attach\u00e9s' other func-tions. Although trade is vitally important to U.S. agriculture, according to thatargument the industry no longer warrants the special treatment it receives. Opponents of eliminating the agricultural attach\u00e9 positions contend, how- ever, that because attach\u00e9s represent the U.S. government, they have moreaccess to information than representatives of private firms would have.

Insurance policies that farm-ers buy through the program are sold and serviced by private insurance firms,which receive an administrative cost reimbursement according to the totalamount of insurance premiums they handle. Firms also share underwriting riskwith the federal government and can gain or lose depending on the value ofcrop losses relative to claims made. Overall, the companies typically gain. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has widely studied the crop insur- ance program and, in particular, the amount paid to the firms that service andsell the insurance policies. In a 1997 study, GAO concluded that the amountthe program has paid the firms has historically exceeded the reasonable ex-penses of selling and servicing the crop insurance. Partly on the basis of thatinformation, the 105th Congress cut the reimbursement rate for the benchmarkcrop insurance plan from 27 percent of premiums to 24.5 percent (with compa-rable reductions for other plans). This option would further reduce the bench-mark rate to 22.5 percent, resulting in savings of $334 million over the 2001-2010 period. Arguments for cutting the reimbursement rate hinge on the belief that the 105th Congress could have cut the reimbursement rate more deeply withoutsubstantially affecting the quantity or quality of services provided to farmers.In addition to relying on GAO's analysis, proponents of further cuts point to thedramatic expansion in business that followed enactment of the Federal CropInsurance Reform Act of 1994. Total insurance in force for 1999 totals about$30 billion, which is over twice that of the early 1990s. Total premiums grewcorrespondingly, but because of economies of scale, the costs of selling andservicing the policies probably grew by less. Thus, proponents argue, the pro-gram could tolerate further cuts. Finally, even if cuts caused firms to curtailsome services to farmers, proponents claim that the results would not be cata-strophic or irreversible. The industry argues, however, that the cuts enacted last year will impair its ability to sell and service insurance and will threaten farmers' access toinsurance. If farmers lack insurance, the industry argues, the Congress wouldmore likely resort to expensive, special-purpose disaster relief programs whendisaster strikes, negating any apparent savings from cutting the reimbursementrate. That argument\u2014perhaps made more forcefully\u2014applies to any furtherprogram cuts. Moreover, falling crop prices reduce total premiums (and reim-bursements) but hardly affect companies' costs. Cutting reimbursement rateswould further reduce company profits, making it harder for them to maintain theservices now provided to farmers.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 350 149 350-08 Eliminate Public Law 480 Title I Sales and Limit the Secretary of Agriculture's Authority Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 150 79 2002 150 1382003 150 1462004 150 1462005 150 146 2001-2005 750 655 2001-2010 1,500 1,385 Relative to WIDI 2001 152 80 2002 155 1422003 158 1532004 160 1552005 163 157 2001-2005 788 687 2001-2010 1,646 1,517 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 150-03The U.S. Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) was enacted to promote commercial exports of surplus agriculturalcommodities, foster foreign markets, and aid developing countries. The lawincluded commodity sales for foreign currencies, concessional credit, andgrants. In the 45 years since the law was passed, the program may have become obsolete and inefficient. This option would eliminate sales under title I of theact beginning in 2001. It would also constrain authority provided by the Com-modity Credit Corporation Charter Act of 1948 and other acts that allow theSecretary of Agriculture to use Commodity Credit Corporation or other funds topurchase and ship U.S. commodities abroad. Such constraints are necessary,some analysts believe, because without them, the Secretary of Agriculturecould offset the effects of a cut in the program (a discretionary one) by usingCommodity Credit Corporation or other funds (mandatory spending) to pur-chase and ship agricultural commodities. In fact, the Secretary used such au-thority in 1999 to provide more than $1 billion of food aid to Russia and othercountries. This option would reduce outlays by $655 million over the 2001-2005 period and by $1.4 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Title II of the act andsection 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, which fund humanitarian andemergency feeding programs, would not be affected by this option. The program's effectiveness in promoting agricultural exports is question- able for two reasons: exports under title I are a small portion of total U.S. agri-cultural exports, and the countries currently receiving those commodities areunlikely to become commercial customers. In fact, countries that receive com-modities under title I are typically those in which the United States has a secu-rity or foreign policy interest rather than those likely to become commercialcustomers in the near term. Providing assistance to developing countries is also a goal of the programs but may not always be an efficient use of U.S. resources. Many commoditiesthat foreign countries buy with P.L. 480 assistance are resold to generate localcurrency. Those funds are used in turn to support local budgets and local devel-opment. But the inexpensive food may discourage local investment in agricul-ture, lower rural employment and income, and discourage the development oflocal stockpiles. Supporters of title I argue that the programs are a flexible, fast means of providing assistance to friendly countries. They also note that the programsreduce the likelihood that agricultural surpluses w ill depress prices in the United States, and they stress the programs' humanitarian benefits: U.S. agri-cultural products are exported, and hungry people are fed.150 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 350-09 Eliminate the Market Access Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 5 5 2002 73 732003 90 902004 90 902005 90 90 2001-2005 348 348 2001-2010 798 798 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 150-03 and 350-02The Market Access Program (MAP), formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, was authorized under the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, andTrade Act to assist U.S. exporters of agricultural products. The program hasbeen used to counter the effects of unfair trading practices abroad, but the Uru-guay Round Agreements Act of 1994 eliminated the requirement that it be usedfor such purposes. Payments are made to partially offset the costs of marketbuilding and product promotion conducted by trade associations, commoditygroups, and some profit-making firms. On the basis of current law, the Con-gressional Budget Office assumes that $90 million will be allocated annuallyfor the program. Eliminating MAP would reduce outlays by $348 million overthe next five years. The program has been used to promote a wide range of mostly high-value products, including fruit, tree nuts, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, andwine. About 40 percent of MAP funding goes to promote brand-name prod-ucts. The 1996 farm bill prohibits direct MAP assistance for brand promotionsto foreign companies for foreign-produced products or to companies not recog-nized as small businesses under the Small Business Act, except for coopera-tives and nonprofit trade associations. Some critics of the program argue that participants should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because they benefit directly from them. (The extentto which the program has developed markets or replaced private expenditureswith public funds is uncertain.) In addition, some critics note the possibility ofduplication because the Department of Agriculture provides marketing fundsthrough the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program of the ForeignAgricultural Service and other activities. Many people also object to spendingthe taxpayers' money on advertising brand-name products. Eliminating MAP, however, could place U.S. exporters at a disadvantage in international markets, depending in part on the amount of support providedby other countries. Responding to concerns about duplication, some MAPadvocates note that the program differs from other programs partly because itfocuses on foreign retailers and consumer promotions. People concerned aboutU.S. exports of high-value products consider the program useful for developingmarkets and benefiting the overall economy.370 Commerce and Housing Credit Budget function 370 covers programs administered by the Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Administration, and the Small Business Administration, among others.

Under the Fed-eral Credit Reform Act of 1990, the credit subsidy for those programs is theestimated net present-value cost of projected defaults (excluding administrativecosts) to the SBA of guaranteeing loans over their lives. SBA's largest businesscredit programs are the general business loan guarantee, or 7(a) program; thecertified development company, or 504 program; and the small business invest-ment company (SBIC) equity capital programs. One of the programs, the certi-fied development company loan program, now operates with a zero subsidy rate.Equalizing the subsidy rate of all major SBA business loan guarantee programsat zero would reduce outlays by $1.2 billion for the 2001-2010 period measuredagainst the 2000 funding level. Under the 7(a) loan guarantee program, the federal government guarantees 80 percent of the principal for business loans up to $100,000 and 75 percent ofthe principal for larger ones. Small business investment companies in the SBICprogram are private investment firms licensed by the SBA. They make equityinvestments and long-term loans to small firms, using their own capital supple-mented with SBA-guaranteed debentures. In 1996, the Congress amended both the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act to reduce subsidy rates and improve the performance ofthe SBA's business loan programs. One of the most significant changes theCongress made was to increase the fees paid by loan recipients for most businessloans. Those increases help to reduce program costs because the revenues fromthe fees cover some of the expenses if a borrower defaults. The Congress alsocut the percentage of each loan amount that the government guarantees under theSBA's largest loan program\u2014the 7(a) program\u2014from about 90 percent to about80 percent. Reducing the guarantee rate should induce banks to more carefullyevaluate loan applications because the banks will share more responsibility forany losses from defaults. If banks use more care in approving SBA loans, thedefault rate should decline, and the program's cost to the government shoulddecrease. Adjusting fees (and changing loan guarantee levels) to cover potentialdefault losses could make the major SBA business loan programs financiallysound. As the subsidy rate declined to zero, the Congress would no longer haveto appropriate funds to cover the government's expected losses. Critics of this option believe SBA assistance aids small businesses by filling a gap in financing when banks and other traditional sources do not pro-vide loans for the purposes, in the amounts, and with the terms required by smallbusiness borrowers. Some critics argue against increasing program fees or re-ducing guarantee rates because such changes would reduce access to credit forsmall businesses. Others argue that subsidies are not necessary because the loanprograms provide the mechanism to pool risk so that the private sector will makefinancing available. Some supporters of this option argue, however, that SBAassistance serves only a tiny fraction of the nation's small businesses and thatmost of the program's borrowers could obtain financing without the SBA's help.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 370 153 370-02 Reduce Costs of the ITA by Eliminating Trade Promotion Activities or Charging the Beneficiaries Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 61 43 2002 244 1832003 244 2252004 244 2,257 Relative WIDI 44 2002 300-05, 400-05, and 400-06 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Antidumping Action in the United States and Around the World: AnAnalysis of International Data (Paper), June 1998. How the GATT Affects U.S. Anti- dumping and Countervailing-DutyPolicy (Study), September 1994.The International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce has four major program activities: the Import Administration, which investi-gates antidumping and countervailing-duty cases; the trade development pro-gram, which assesses the competitiveness of U.S. industries and runs exportpromotion programs; the market access and compliance (MAC) unit, whichworks to unlock foreign markets for U.S. goods and services; and the U.S. andforeign commercial services, which counsel U.S. businesses on exporting. TheMAC unit, and perhaps the countervailing-duty program against foreign subsi-dies, may be necessary to maintain public support for free-trade policies, and insome cases, they can be defended on economic grounds. The ITA's exportpromotion, marketing, and counseling activities could be eliminated, however,or the beneficiaries could be charged fees to cover more of the programs' costs.The ITA already charges some fees for some services, but those fees do notcover the cost of all such activities. Some people argue that such activities are better left to the firms and industries involved rather than to the ITA. Others argue that those activitiesmight have some economies of scale, especially for small firms. If so, havingone entity (the federal government) counsel exporters on foreign legal and otherrequirements, disseminate knowledge of foreign markets, and promote U.S.products abroad might make sense. In that case, net federal spending could bereduced by charging the beneficiaries of those programs their full cost. Fully funding the ITA's trade promotion activities through charges that are voluntary for all beneficiaries may not be possible, however. For example, inmany cases, promoting the products of selected firms in a given industry thatwant and pay for such promotion may be impossible without also encouragingdemand for the products of all other firms in that industry. In those circum-stances, all the firms have an incentive not to purchase the services b ecause they know that they are likely to receive the benefits whether they pay for themor not. Consequently, if the federal government wanted to charge beneficiariesfor the ITA's services, it might have to require that all firms in an industry (orthe industry's national tr ade group) decide together whether to purchase the ITA's services. If the firms decided to purchase them, all firms in the industrywould be required to pay according to some equitable formula. When beneficiaries do not pay the full cost of services, the ITA's activities effectively subsidize the industries involved. Those implicit subsidies are aninefficient means of helping the industries because they are partially passed onto foreigners in the form of lower prices for U.S. exports. Because the current-account balance is determined by total saving and investment in the U.S. econ-omy, over which the ITA has no influence, the agency's activities do not im-prove the current-account balance. As a result of the changes they cause inexchange rates and other variables, some combination of reduced exports inother industries and increased imports completely offsets all increases in ex-ports resulting from ITA activities. Thus, the ITA's export promotion activitieshurt other U.S. firms.154 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 370-03 Eliminate the Advanced Technology Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 114 11 2002 143 432003 143 962004 143 1,401 Relative WIDI 12 2002 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-04The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 established the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) within the Commerce Department's National Insti-tute of Standards and Technology. This option would eliminate the ATP, whoseobjective is to further the competitiveness of U.S. industry by helping convertdiscoveries in basic research more quickly into technological advances withcommercial potential. The program awards research and development (R&D)grants on the basis of merit to individual companies, independent research insti-tutes, and joint ventures. The grants support research in generic technologiesthat have applications for a broad range of products as well as precompetitiveresearch (preceding product development). This option would eliminate theATP, saving $1.1 billion through 2010. The ATP's grants are limited to $2 million over a three-year period when awarded to a single firm, but they have no dollar limit when awarded to a jointventure over a period of up to five years. Joint ventures must pay at least half ofthe R&D costs of each project, however, which helps ensure a project's commer-cial viability. The ATP has awarded 468 grants from its inception through 1999, includ- ing awards to 157 joint ventures. Roughly two-thirds of the firms participatingin awards are small or medium-sized firms or joint ventures led by small ormedium-sized firms; large firms account for only 20 percent of grant recipients.Universities and other nonprofit organizations participated in 256 projects asjoint-venture partners. Total funding committed to the research projects was$3.0 billion, of which the ATP paid roughly half. Starting in 1998, the ATP explicitly required applicants to disclose their prior efforts to secure private financing. ATP officials also made considerationof spillover benefits part of the selection criteria. The ATP was responding toearlier research done by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which found thatalmost two-thirds of applicants had not even sought private capital before apply-ing to the ATP and that half of the proposals the ATP rejected were subsequentlyfunded privately. GAO found that the changes in the selection process, althoughpositive, are insufficient, rely on the self-interested applicants for crucial infor-mation, or are difficult to operationalize. Opponents of the program argue that private investors, not the federal government, are better able to decide which research efforts should be funded.Furthermore, citing the GAO survey, critics argue that even when the federalgovernment chooses \"a winner,\" it is just as likely as not to be displacing privatecapital. The U.S. venture capital markets are the best developed in the world anddo an effective job of funding new ideas. Program supporters argue that surveys of the ATP's award recipients indi- cate that the awards have accelerated the development and commercialization ofadvanced technology by two years or more in the majority of planned commercialapplications. In addition, those surveys reveal that recipients are more willing totackle high-risk technology development projects as a result of their grants, pre-sumably increasing both the amount and the breadth of the R&D funded.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 370 155 370-04 Eliminate the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the National Quality Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 87 11 2002 109 362003 109 752004 109 1042005 109 109 2001-2005 523 335 2001-2010 1,068 880 Relative to WIDI 2001 89 11 2002 113 372003 116 772004 118 1092005 120 116 2001-2005 556 350 2001-2010 1,194 968 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-03The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the National Quality Pro- gram reside in the National Institute of Standards and Technology. MEP con-sists primarily of a network of manufacturing extension centers that assist smalland midsize firms with expertise in the latest management practices, manufactur-ing techniques, and other knowledge. The nonprofit centers are not owned by thefederal government but are partly funded by it. The National Quality Programconsists mainly of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, which is givento firms for achievements in quality. This option would eliminate the MEP andthe National Quality Program, saving $880 million through 2010. Proponents of MEP point to the economic importance of small and midsize firms, which produce more than half of U.S. output and employ two-thirds ofU.S. manufacturing workers. Small firms, they argue, often face limited budgets,lack of expertise, and other barriers to obtaining the information that MEP pro-vides. Those circumstances and the substantial reliance of larger firms on smalland midsize companies for supplies and intermediate goods lead proponents tocontend that MEP is needed for U.S. productivity and international competitive-ness. Opponents may question the need for government to provide such technical assistance. Small firms thrived long before MEP began in 1989, in part becauseother sources of expertise were available. Many professors of business, science,and engineering are also consultants to private industry, and other ties betweenuniversities and private firms facilitate the transfer of knowledge. In fact, someof the centers MEP subsidizes predate MEP. Furthermore, MEP cannot improve the competitiveness of the economy as a whole. The competitiveness of particular firms helped by MEP may improve,resulting in more exports or fewer competing imports. However, those changesin trade cause the dollar to rise in foreign exchange markets, decreasing the com-petitiveness of other U.S. firms. Overall, the balance of trade is not affected. Finally, one may question MEP's positive effect on the economy's produc- tivity. Federal spending for MEP is a subsidy for the firms MEP helps. In mostcases, subsidies promote inefficiency by allowing inefficient firms to remain inbusiness, tying up capital, labor, and other resources that would otherwise beused more productively elsewhere. In the case of businesses that increase theirexports, part of the subsidy is likely to be passed on to foreign customers in theform of lower prices. Like MEP advocates, defenders of the National Quality Program argue that it promotes U.S. competitiveness. The same counterargument used for MEP alsoapplies to the National Quality Program. Opponents may argue that businessesneed no government incentive to maintain quality\u2014the threat of lost sales issufficient. Furthermore, winners of the Baldrige Award often mention it in theiradvertising, which means they value it. If so, they should be willing to pay con-test entry fees large enough to eliminate the need for federal funding.156 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 370-05 Eliminate the Minority Business Development Agency Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 22 6 2002 27 252003 27 272004 27 272005 27 27 2001-2005 130 112 2001-2010 265 247 Relative to WIDI 2001 23 7 2002 28 262003 29 282004 30 292005 30 30 2001-2005 140 120 2001-2010 302 280 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-01The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) of the Department of Commerce plays the lead coordinating role in all federal programs for minoritybusiness development.

The agency alsoprovides support for advocacy, research, and technology to reduce informationbarriers. This option would eliminate the MBDA, saving $247 million over the2001-2010 period. The arguments for and against the MBDA mirror in part those of the larger debate over affirmative action. Proponents contend that minority groups,especially African Americans, have historically been, and continue to be, hin-dered by pervasive discrimination. They argue that such discrimination leads tofinancial and educational disadvantage and lack of experience, which meansthat members of minority groups are less competitive relative to (non-Hispanic)whites in the business world. Discrimination also hinders minority businessesin their task of developing business relationships with suppliers and customers.Minorities, according to the program's advocates, need a helping hand to com-pensate for those unfair handicaps. Opponents maintain that discrimination has substantially declined and that which remains is best fought by enforcing civil rights laws in the courts. Al-though, on average, African Americans and certain other minority groups areeconomically and ed ucationally disadvantaged in comparison with whites, in many individual instances the reverse is true: individual African Americans ormembers of other minorities may be quite wealthy and educated and are com-peting with individual whites who are not. In such cases, opponents point out,a desire to help the disadvantaged would argue for helping the white person\u2014not the minority group member. It is unfair, according to that argument, to helpcurrent-generation minority individuals at the expense of current-generationwhites simply because previous generations of whites benefited from discrimi-nation against previous generations of minorities. Opponents contend that suchhelp should be limited to remedies for specific acts of illegal discrimination thathave been proved in court or to general help for anyone who is disadvantaged,regardless of race. If the MBDA was eliminated, the Small Business Adminis-tration would continue to provide assistance to small businesses in general.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 370 157 370-06 Eliminate the 85 Percent Market Adoption Test for Digital Television Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 3002003 3002004 02005 0 2001-2005 600 2001-2010 600 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Federal Communications Com- mission (FCC) to auction licenses to use certain parts of the radio spectrum madeavailable by the transition from analog television broadcasting to digital televisionbroadcasting that is now in progress. Those parts of the spectrum will not be availablefor use by auction winners until 2007 at the earliest; they will not be available untileven later in markets in which less than 85 percent of the households are able to re-ceive a digital television signal. The BBA further stipulates that the receipts from theauction must be deposited in the Treasury no later than September 30, 2002. Thisoption would eliminate the 85 percent market adoption test, which the CongressionalBudget Office estimates will increase auction receipts by $600 million. As mandated by law, the nation's television broadcasters are currently shifting their operations from a technology based on analog signals to a newer, higher capacity-signal system based on digital technology. Current law anticipates that the transitionfrom analog to digital broadcasting will be completed by the end of 2006, but it alsoprovides for extending the transition if less than 85 percent of the households in atelevision market are able to receive the new digital signal at that time. Once the 85percent adoption test is met and the transition is deemed complete, broadcasters in thatmarket will stop broadcasting the old analog signals. The move to a digital systemmay require households to invest in new equipment before they can receive the newsignals. Current law also stipulates that the rights to use certain parts of the radio spec- trum freed by the adoption of the digital television standard must be auctioned beforethe transition is complete. Thus, even with a timely transition, bidders will be makingtheir offers with the understanding that the licenses they bid on will not permit full useof the associated spectrum until the trans ition's end. Since the BBA was enacted, however, it has become increasingly clear that the 85 percent goal probably will not bemet in many markets by 2006 and that the transition will be extended in those areas.As the time between paying for and making profitable use of the spectrum freed by thetransition appears to be lengthening, estimates of the receipts that will be raised byselling the rights to use it have been revised downward. Eliminating the 85 percentexemption and guaranteeing that the transition will not continue beyond the end of2006 would decrease the time between the auction and the spectrum's availability and,consequently, increase receipts. The argument in favor of this option rests on the economic value created by the earlier availability for other purposes of a portion of the frequencies currently allocatedto television broadcasting. That argument is based on the conjecture that the new usesof the spectrum in question will be more valuable than the losses in television viewingcreated by a more rapid transition. Viewers who do not adopt digital television by2006, the option's proponents might say, do not highly value television, and thus thesocial loss of disenfranchising them is correspondingly small. In the current case,higher auction receipts are a by-product of the radio spectrum's being used more effi-ciently. The main argument against this option emphasizes the economic and social costs of ending the transition before the 85 percent market penetration level is reached.Those households that are last to adopt digital television and most likely to be disen-franchised by an earlier end to the transition may be the households that are least ableto afford the equipment required for the upgrade to digital televison.

A feeon transactions overseen by the CFTC could cover the agency's operating costs.Such a fee would be similar to one now imposed on securities exchanges tocover the operating costs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A per-contract transaction fee could be imposed and remitted quarterly and adjusted periodically so that the money collected equals the CFTC's cost ofoperation. Meeting the CFTC's operating expenses of $620 million over the2001-2010 period would require a nominal fee of around 10 cents per contract,assuming that the number of contracts traded annually over the period remainsnear the number traded in 1999. The CFTC would collect the fee. The Con-gressional Budget Office envisions that authorizing legislation would establishthe fee, but only appropriation language would trigger the collection of the fee.The fee would then be classified as an offsetting collection. The main arguments for the fee are based on the principle that users of government services should pay for those services. Participants in transactionsthat the CFTC regulates, rather than general taxpayers, are seen as the mainbeneficiaries of the agency's operations and therefore should pay a fee, accord-ing to proponents of the fee. Furthermore, the precedent for charging user feeshas already been established by the SEC and other federal financial regulators,such as the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency. Considerations of equity and fairness suggest that not charging acomparable fee to support CFTC operations could give futures traders an unfairadvantage over securities traders. People who argue against the fee maintain that such charges tend to en- courage evasion by those who have to pay them. Users might try to avoid feesby limiting or shifting transactions to activities that are exempt from charges,which could conceivably cause some market participants to desert U.S. ex-changes for foreign exchanges. Major competing foreign exchanges, however,already charge transaction fees. Even with a nominal fee, U.S. futures ex-changes may still have a cost advantage over their major foreign competitors. CBO expects a fee of around 10 cents to cause a negligible decrease in transactions because that fee is small compared with fees already imposed bythe exchanges and the industry's self-regulatory organizati on, the National Futures Association.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 370 159 370-08 Eliminate FHA Mortgage Insurance Rebates Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 240 240 2002 240 2402003 240 2402004 240 2402005 240 240 2001-2005 1,200 1,200 2001-2010 2,400 2,400 SPENDING CATEGORY: MandatoryThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures home mortgages made by private lenders. It assumes the default risk on loans to eligible home buyers,who usually make down payments of 5 percent or less and often have debtpayment burdens that are high relative to their income. The agency chargesboth up-front and annual insurance premiums to cover its default losses. Theup-front premium equals 2.25 percentage points of the mortgage amount; theannual premium equals 0.5 percentage points of the outstanding loan balance.The FHA partially refunds the up-front premium if the borrower pays off themortgage in full during the first seven years. If the borrower takes out a newloan that the FHA insures, the refund is credited toward the up-front premiumon the new loan. If the rebate and the equivalent credit were eliminated fornewly insured loans, the government would save $240 million in 2001 and $1.2billion over five years. Over 10 years, the savings would total $2.4 billion. Eliminating the rebate would raise the cost of FHA insurance, which could lead some borrowers to take their business to the private mortgage insur-ance industry rather than to the FHA. Borrowers who pose less default risk than the average ones served by the FHA would be most likely to do that be-cause they are most likely to exercise their prepayment option. Given theFHA's forecast of prepayment rates on newly insured loans, eliminating therebate would be equivalent to increasing the up-front premium by about $2.50for every $1,000 borrowed (25 basis points). Many borrowers probably do notplace a high value on the rebate when deciding whether to use FHA or privateinsurance. Eliminating the rebate of the FHA's up-front premium would make it easier for prospective FHA borrowers to evaluate the cost of the agency's insur-ance. It would also have the advantage of better directing FHA insurance toborrowers in need of government assistance. But the resulting increase in therelative cost of FHA insurance could hamper the agency's ability to attract low-risk borrowers, whose presence helps to maintain an actuarially sound insur-ance program. Because eliminating the rebate would probably not cause manylow-risk borrowers to take their business elsewhere, however, it would proba-bly have little effect on the soundness of the program. (The most effective wayto ensure the program's soundness would be to intr oduce greater variation in FHA premiums based on a borrower's default risk.) In addition, raising thecost of FHA insurance by eliminating the rebate could cause some higher-riskborrowers to delay their home purchases or buy smaller homes. Because theFHA has a strong market presence am ong younger borrowers and low- and moderate-income and minority borrowers and neighborhoods, those home buy-ers and areas would most likely be affected. Whether higher-risk FHA borrow-ers account for the value of the rebate in deciding on the size and timing of theirhome purchases is unclear, however.160 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 370-09 Increase the Ginnie Mae Guarantee Fee Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 40 40 2002 40 402003 40 402004 40 402005 0 0 2001-2005 160 160 2001-2010 160 160 Relative to WIDI 2001 40 40 2002 40 402003 40 402004 40 402005 0 0 2001-2005 160 160 2001-2010 160 160 NOTE: Although Ginnie Mae is charac- terized as a discretionary pro-gram, this option would save thesame amounts under a WODIand WIDI baseline. SPENDING CATEGORY: DiscretionaryThe Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, is a govern- ment corporation that facilitates the financing of federally insured and guaran-teed home mortgages. Ginnie Mae guarantees mortgage-backed securities(MBSs) collateralized by home mortgages that are insured by the FederalHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of VeteransAffairs or the Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service. Ginnie Maenow charges issuers an annual fee of 6 cents for every $100 (6 basis points) ofguaranteed MBSs backed by single-family loans. Under current law, a feeincrease to 9 basis points is scheduled to take effect in 2005. Moving the feehike up to 2001 would save $40 million in 2001 and $160 million over five years. The cost of the fee increase would be shared by two groups: the firms that issue and service the mortgages backing MBSs guaranteed by Ginnie Mae,and borrowers who take out such loans. Ginnie Mae issuers would lose incomefrom a reduction in their servicing fee from the current maximum of 44 basispoints to 41 basis points (federal law limits the sum of the Ginnie Mae guaran-tee and servicing fees to 50 basis points). A Ginnie Mae servicing fee of 41basis points would probably still surpass competitive levels, which has thebenefit of inducing issuers to diligently service loans. Some issuers with lowprofit margins would leave the market as a result, but other firms in this highlycompetitive industry would increase their business. Issuers leaving the busi-ness would prefer to sell their portfolios rather than default, so Ginnie Mae'sdefault costs would probably be unaffected. Alternatively, some issuers of Ginnie Mae MBSs might try to maintain their profit margins by raising the interest rates on the new federally insured orguaranteed mortgages they made. Fully passing on to borrowers the cost of anincrease of 3 basis points in the guarantee fee would raise the monthly pay-ments on a $100,000 loan by $2.50. An increase of that size would probablyhave little effect on the demand for federally insured and guaranteed mortgagesor the volume of Ginnie Mae MBSs issued. Borrowers take out such loansmainly because the government accepts lower down payments and has lessstringent underwriting guidelines than do private mortgage insurers. Proponents of raising the Ginnie Mae guarantee fee by 3 basis points argue that the hike would result, at most, in a modest increase in the cost ofusing FHA mortgage insurance that would lead few, if any, borrowers to switchto private mortgage insurance. In addition, proponents argue that a modestreduction in the profitability of issuers of Ginnie Mae MBSs would not ad-versely affect the policy objective of ensuring a steady supply of credit to hous-ing. Opponents of moving up the fee hike argue that any increase in the cost ofusing FHA mortgage insurance or the Department of Veterans Affairs' loanguarantees is unwarranted. They are also concerned a bout the precedent of raising the fee, which could open the door to later increases that could jeopar-dize the viability of many Ginnie Mae issuers or hasten the consolidation of themortgage banking industry.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 370 161 370-10 Require All GSEs to Register with the SEC Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 313 2002 3042003 2942004 2742005 274 2001-2005 1,459 2001-2010 additional receipts would be revenues; a portionof the fees would be offsettingcollections credited againstdiscretionary spending. RELATED OPTION: 920-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS: Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac (Report), May 1996. Controlling the Risks of Government-Sponsored Enter-prises (Report), April 1991.Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private financial institutions chartered by the federal government to support the flow of funds to agriculture,housing, and higher education. GSEs achieve their public purposes by borrow-ing on the strength of an implicit federal guarantee of their debt obligations.The implicit guarantee lowers GSEs' cost of borrowing, conveying subsidiesthat give them a competitive advantage in financial markets. The federal gov-ernment also explicitly subsidizes five GSEs\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, theFederal Home Loan Bank System, the Farm Credit System, and Sallie Mae\u2014by exempting them from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of1933. That statute requires all corporations issuing stock or debt securitieswith maturities of more than nine months to register such offerings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), disclose uniform informationabout the securities, and pay registration fees. A sixth enterprise, Farmer Mac,is not exempt from SEC registration. In 1992, the Department of the Treasury,the Federal Reserve, and the SEC advocated requiring the five GSEs that arenow exempt to register their securities with the SEC, which would save $313million in 2001, $1.5 billion over five years, and $2.1 billion through 2010. Requiring issuers to register their securities with the SEC protects inves- tors by ensuring that all offerings are accompanied by disclosures of uniforminformation. GSEs were originally exempted from the requirement in part torelieve them of the costs of registering until they became accepted names in themarketplace. That rationale no longer applies: the five exempt GSEs are wellknown in financial markets. Repealing the exemption would not impose signif-icant additional regulatory burdens on those GSEs because they now disclosemost of the required information voluntarily. Moreover, it would reduce thecompetitive advantage that the enterprises have over other firms that financeloans by issuing debt or mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). (Although banksecurities are exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 act, thesecurities of bank holding companies and all MBSs issued by non-GSEs arenot.) A more level playing field would probably lead to a more efficient alloca-tion of credit. To register with the SEC, each of the five GSEs would pay about 25 cents for every $1,000 (about 2.5 basis points) in securities it issued in 2001. SECregistration fees are scheduled to decline gradually under current law and willbe less than 1 basis point in 2007 and later years. Competition from wholly private firms and between the enterprises would limit the GSEs' ab ility to re- coup the cost of paying registration fees by raising the interest rates on theloans they finance. Fully absorbing the costs of registration would have littleeffect on either the enterprises' profits or the interest rates paid by the borrow-ers they serve. If Fannie Mae absorbed the full cost of registering its securities,for example, that GSE's after-tax return on equity would probably decline byless than 1 percentage point. But if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lowered theprices they pay for the home mortgages they buy to cover the full cost of regis-tering securities issued to finance such loans, the origination fees paid by home-owners with loans with an initial balance of $150,000 would rise by less than$38.162 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 370-11 Eliminate New Funding for the Rural Rental Housing Assistance Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 45 3 2002 45 232003 45 342004 45 432005 45 44 2001-2005 225 147 2001-2010 450 368 Relative to WIDI 2001 46 3 2002 46 232003 47 352004 48 452005 49 46 2001-2005 236 152 2001-2010 493 398 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 600-02, 600-05, and REV-30The Section 515 housing program, administered by the Rural Housing Service (RHS), provides low-interest mortgage loans to developers of multifamilyrental projects in rural areas. Those mortgages typically have credits that re-duce the effective interest rate to 1 percent and, in turn, lower rental costs forSection 515 tenants. Under current rules, assisted tenants pay rent equal to the greater of 30 percent of their adjusted income or the basic rent. (The basic rent for each unitconsists of a proportionate share of the amortization costs of the 1 percentmortgage and the project's operating expenses.) The owner of the housingproject keeps the basic rent, and the RHS collects any payments above it.Many of the poorest t enants receive additional federal subsidies through the Rural Rental Assistance Payments program that reduce their rent payments to30 percent of their income. Eliminating all new commitments for assistance under the Section 515 program would reduce federal outlays by about $368 million over the 2001-2010 period. Support for this option is based on the view that expanding rural rental assistance is inappropriate when other federal programs are being cut. In addi-tion, turnover among current project residents would ensure that the programwould help some new income-eligible families each year. Critics of this option point out that it would reduce the proportion of rural families the program can help as the number of eligible families continues togrow. Moreover, eliminating new funding for the program would slow thegrowth in the supply of standard-quality, low-income rental units in rural areas.400 Transportation Budget function 400 covers most programs of the Department of Transportation as well as aeronautical research by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

By 1999,however, Amtrak had consumed more than $20 billion in federal subsidies. Inaddition to subsidies made through annual appropriations, the Congress gaveAmtrak $2.2 billion (in the form of credits for tax refunds) under the TaxpayerRelief Act of 1997. That money was to be used for investments that would helpturn Amtrak around. Further, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of1997 (ARAA) requires that Amtrak be self-supporting on an operational basisby the end of 2002. This option would eliminate all federal subsidies for Amtrak by the end of 2002. Amtrak would have to finance its capital investments without federalassistance. To help make up for that loss of federal funding, the Congress couldauthorize states to use federal-aid highway funds for Amtrak. This optionwould save $4.2 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Proponents of eliminating federal subsidies contend that Amtrak should be self-supporting, as initially envisioned. Without federal subsidies, Amtrakwould have to focus on service that has the greatest potential for financial suc-cess, such as the Metroliner's high-speed service along the congested corridorbetween Washington and New York City, where passengers are w illing and able to pay the full cost of the service. Amtrak would be forced to continue toimprove efficiency in its operations and its investments. Those who favor elim-inating subsidies claim that it is unfair for the federal government to subsidizebusiness travelers, who make up a substantial share of Amtrak passengers incongested corridors, and vacationers with high incomes. Opponents of cutting subsidies say that reducing federal support would lead Amtrak to cancel service on lightly traveled routes and that passengers inthose areas might not have alternative transportation available. They also notethat subsidizing rail service in congested areas may be justified as a way ofoffsetting the congestion costs imposed on and by users of highways, airports,and airways. Retaining federal subsidies for Amtrak, especially for congestedcorridors, may help to redress that imbalance. Moreover, improving service onsome corridors could strengthen the national passenger rail system by providinglinkages to better-performing routes.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 400 165 400-02 Eliminate the Essential Air Service Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 50 30 2002 50 502003 50 502004 50 502005 50 50 2001-2005 250 230 2001-2010 500 480 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 300-14The Essential Air Service (EAS) program was created by the Airline Deregula- tion Act of 1978 to continue air service to communities that had received feder-ally mandated air service before deregulation. The program provides subsidiesto air carriers serving small communities that meet certain criteria. Subsidiescurrently support air service to about 105 U.S. communities, including 29 inAlaska (for which separate rules apply). The number of passengers servedannually has fluctuated in recent years, as has the subsidy per passenger, whichhas ranged from $4 to $400. The Congress has directed that such subsidies notexceed $200 per passenger unless the community is more than 210 miles fromthe nearest large or medium-sized hub airport. This option would eliminate the EAS program, thus providing savings in mandatory outlays of $480 million from 2001 to 2010. To adopt this option,the Congress would have to modify the provision of the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration Reauthorization Act of 1996 that authorized $50 million a year indirect spending for the EAS program. That law also authorized the FederalAviation Administration (FAA) to collect up to $100 million in fees for speci-fied air traffic control services (for certain aircraft flying over the United Statesbut not taking off or landing at a U.S. airport), of which $50 million was to bemade available for the EAS subsidies. The law further provided that even if theFAA did not collect $50 million in fees, it still had to provide that amount forthe EAS program. The FAA's initial fee structure was overturned in court,however. While the agency is developing a new fee structure, it is collecting nofees. This option would not affect fee collection, but it would sever the linkbetween fees and EAS subsidies. Phasing out the program over several yearswould mitigate disruptions. Critics of the EAS program contend that the subsidies are excessive, providing air transportation at a high cost per passenger. They also maintainthat the program was intended to be transitional and that the time has come tophase it out. If states or communities derive b enefits from service to small communities, the states or communities could provide the subsidies themselves. Supporters of the subsidy program claim that it prevents the isolation of rural communities that would not otherwise receive air service. Subsidies arenot available for service to communities located less than 70 miles from a largeor medium-sized hub airport (except in Alaska and Hawaii). The availabilityof airline transportation is an important ingredient in the economic developmentof small communities. Without continued air service, according to some propo-nents, some towns might lose a sizable portion of their economic base.166 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 400-03 Establish Charges for Airport Takeoff and Landing Slots Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 500 2002 5002003 5002004 5002005 500 2001-2005 2,500 2001-2010 5,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

(Study), May 1992.In 1968, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established controls on airport takeoff and landing slots at four airports\u2014Kennedy International and LaGuardia in New York, O'Hare in Chicago, and Ronald Reagan WashingtonNational Airport\u2014and allocated them to airlines without charge. Airlines areallowed to buy and sell slots from and to each other, with the understanding thatthe FAA retains ultimate control and can withdraw the slots or otherwisechange the rules for using them at any time. Under this option, the FAA wouldcharge annual fees for slots at those airports. Estimating the revenue from charges for the slots is difficult under any circumstances because slot values vary by airport, time of day and season, andmarket conditions. Recent legislative and administrative actions have increaseduncertainty about slot policies and prices. In 1999, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed bills to lift restrictions on the slots. Both billswould eliminate slot restrictions at Kennedy and LaGuardia as of January 1,2007, and would allow interim increases in slots for regional jets serving smallhub and nonhub airports. At O'Hare, the House would begin phasing out re- strictions in March 2000 and would eliminate them in March 2002. The Senatewould phase in 30 additional slots at O'Hare over a three-year period. AtWashington National, the Senate would allow 24 additional slots per day; theHouse would allow six. This year, the Congress will resume its considerationof slot restrictions. If it eliminates them, the value of the slots would eventuallyreach zero. However, as long as the economy remains strong and the demandfor air travel is great, airlines will continue to place a high value on slots thatenable them to provide profitable service. CBO estimates receipts to be about$500 million annually, but they could be higher or lower depending on thestructure of the slots' leasing arrangements\u2014such as length, whether slots couldbe subleased, and usage requirements\u2014as well as market conditions affectingthe airline industry. The main argument for establishing charges for slots is that public air- space is scarce and private firms and individuals s hould pay for the benefits that result from that scarcity. Furthermore, the charges would provide an in-centive for using those scarce resources most efficiently. The main argument against charging for slots is that the scarcity of slots at the four airports mentioned arises mainly from a lack of land and runway space;the fees are not intended to provide more capacity. Furthermore, if the currentprices that airlines already pay in the private sale of slots accurately reflecttheir value, the proposal might not produce more efficient use of those scarceresources; the result would only redistribute the benefits from their use betweenthe private and public sectors.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 400 167 400-04 Increase User Fees for FAA Certificates and Registrations Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 4 2002 42003 42004 42005 4 2001-2005 20 2001-2010 40 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED OPTIONS : 300-10, 300-12, and 400-05The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees a large regulatory pro- gram to ensure safe operation of aircraft within the United States. It overseesand regulates the registration of aircraft, licensing of pilots, issuance of medicalcertificates, and other similar activities. The FAA issues most licenses andcertificates free of charge or at a price well below its cost of providing suchregulatory approvals. For example, the current fee for registering aircraft is $5,but the FAA's cost of providing the service is closer to $30. The FAA esti-mates the cost of issuing a pilot's certificate to be $10 to $15, but the agencydoes not charge for the certificates. Imposing fees to cover the costs of theFAA's regulatory services could increase receipts by an estimated $20 millionover the 2001-2005 period. Net savings could be somewhat smaller than thoseshown if the FAA needed additional resources to develop and administer fees. The Drug Enforcement Assistance Act of 1988 authorizes the FAA to impose several registration fees as long as they do not exceed the agency's costof providing that service. For general aviation, the act allows fees of up to $25for aircraft registration and up to $12 for pilots' certificates (plus adjustmentsfor inflation). Setting higher fees would require additional legislation. TheCongress could provide for them in the legislation currently under consideration that would reauthorize the FAA. Increasing regulatory fees might burden some aircraft owners and opera- tors. That effect could be mitigated by setting registration fees according to thesize or value of the aircraft rather than to the FAA's cost. FAA fees based onthe cost of service, however, would be comparable with automobile registrationfees and operators' licenses and thus are likely to be affordable, especiallywhen compared with the total cost of owning an airplane.168 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 400-05 Establish Marginal Cost-Based Fees for Air Traffic Control Services Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 2,000 2002 2,0002003 2,0002004 2,0002005 2,000 2001-2005 10,000 2001-2010 20,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

(Study), May 1992.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the air traffic control (ATC) system, which serves commercial air carriers, military aircraft, and suchsmaller users as air taxis and private corporate and recreational aircraft. Traf-fic controllers in airport towers, terminal radar approach control facilities(TRACONs), and air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) help guide aircraftsafely as they taxi to the runway, take off, fly through designated airspace,land, and taxi to the airport gate. Other ATC services include flight servicestations that provide weather data and other information useful to small-aircraftoperators. This option would impose fees for ATC services that reflect the FAA's marginal costs of providing the services. The marginal cost of a flight equalsthe costs of each ATC service (or contact) provided for that flight. For exam-ple, a commercial flight from New York to San Francisco entails contacts withtwo airport towers, two TRACONs, and seven ARTCCs. Under this option,the airline would pay the sum of the marginal costs of each of those contacts. A1997 FAA study estimated total marginal costs to be about $2 billion a year. Fees based on marginal costs would affect different types of airline opera- tions differently. Carriers mainly using hub-and-spoke networks would proba-bly face higher fees than those providing nonstop origin-destination flightsbecause of differences in the number of contacts with towers and TRACONs. Imposing fees for marginal costs would encourage users to use the ATC system efficiently. Noncommercial users might reduce their consumption ofATC services, freeing controllers for other tasks and increasing the system'soverall capacity. By analyzing the pattern of revenues from user fees, FAAplanners could better decide on the amount and location of additional ATCinvestment, which would make the system more efficient. The main argument against this option is that it would raise the cost of ATC services to users. Such a move could weaken the financial condition ofsome commercial air carriers.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 400 169 400-06 Impose a User Fee to Cover the Cost of the Federal Railroad Administration's Rail Safety Activities Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 77 2002 772003 772004 772005 77 2001-2005 385 2001-2010 770 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

Other functions includeissuing standards, procedures, and regulations; administering postaccident andrandom drug testing of railroad employees; providing technical training; andmanaging highway grade-crossing projects. Railroad safety fees, which had been authorized in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, expired in 1995. Before 1995, railroads weresubject to the FRA's safety oversight user fees that covered the safety enforce-ment and administrative costs of carrying out FRA's mandated safety responsi-bilities. Those fees offset a portion of federal spending on safety programs.Since this authority expired in 1995, FRA has not assessed user fees for operat-ing its safety program. This option would impose new user fees to offset the costs of the FRA's rail safety activities\u2014$700 million over 10 years. Those in favor of user feescontend that the specific recipients of government services should bear the costof those services. The user fees would relieve the general taxpayer of the bur-den of supporting the FRA's rail safety activities. People who oppose having users pay for the service contend that the gen- eral public is the main beneficiary of the FRA's rail safety activities. Critics ofthis option also note that other than businesses in the pipeline industry, no otherfreight or transportation businesses pay safety user fees. 450 Community and Regional Development Budget function 450 includes programs that support the development of physical and financial infrastruc- ture intended to promote viable community economies, including activities of the Department of Commerceand the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This function also includes spending to helpcommunities and families recover from natural disasters and spending for the rural development activities ofthe Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other agencies. CBO estimates that in2000, discretionary outlays for function 450 will be $11.4 billion. Over the past d ecade, spending for community and regional development has increased in most years.

Funds are generally allocated among thestates on the basis of their rural populations and the number of rural familieswith income below the poverty threshold. Within each state's allocation, thedepartment awards funds competitively to eligible applicants, including state andlocal agencies, nonprofit organizations, and (in the case of loan guarantees forbusiness and industry) for-profit firms. The terms of a particular recipient's assistance depend on the purpose of the aid and, in some cases, the economic condition of the recipient's area. For exam-ple, aid for water and waste-disposal projects can take the form of loans withinterest rates ranging from 4.5 percent to market rates, depending on the area'smedian household income; areas that are particularly needy may receive grants ora mix of grants and loans. For 2000, the Congress appropriated $719 million for RCAP's grants and the budgetary cost of its loans and loan guarantees, which is defined under creditreform as the present value of the interest rate subsidies and expected defaults.The Congress could reduce future spending by capitalizing state revolving loanfunds (SRLFs) for rural development and then ending federal RCAP assistance.The amount of federal savings would depend on the level and timing of the con-tribution to capitalize the SRLFs. Under one illustrative option, the federalgovernment would provide steady funding of $719 million annually for five moreyears to capitalize the funds, then cut off assistance in 2005. The option wouldyield savings of $1.7 billion from 2006 to 2010. That level of capitalizationalone would not support the volume of loans and grants now provided annuallyby RCAP. Accordingly, the Congress could choose to allow the SRLFs to usethe capitalization funds as collateral with which to leverage additional capitalfrom the private sector, as has been allowed with the SRLFs established underthe Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The main argument for replacing RCAP with a system of SRLFs is that the federal government should not bear continuing responsibility for local develop-ment; rather, programs that benefit localities, whether urban or rural, should befunded at the state or local level. On the basis of that argument, a few moreyears of federal funding to capitalize SRLFs would provide a reasonable transi-tion to the desired policy. One argument against converting RCAP is that without annual infusions of new federal money, states will feel a need to stretch their rural developmentfunds by reducing the number of grants and interest rate subsidies, making itharder for needier communities to find affordable assistance. In addition, prece-dent suggests that the estimated federal savings may not materialize: the Con-gress continues to appropriate additional grants to the state funds for wastewatertreatment systems, long past the point at which those funds were originally de-signed to be independent of federal support.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 450 173 450-02 Eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 66 7 2002 66 202003 66 402004 66 512005 66 59 2001-2005 330 177 2001-2010 660 507 Relative to WIDI 2001 67 7 2002 68 202003 69 412004 71 532005 72 62 2001-2005 347 183 2001-2010 725 546 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government provides annual funding to the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) for activities that promote economic growth in the Appala-chian counties of 13 states. For 2000, the Congress appropriated $66 millionfor ARC. The states are responsible for filing development plans and recom-mending specific projects for federal funding. The commission distributes thefunds competitively according to such factors as the area's growth potential, percapita income, and unemployment rate; the financial resources of the state andlocality; the project's pros pective long-term effectiveness; and the degree of private-sector involvement. ARC supports a variety of programs, including the Community Develop- ment Program, mainly to create jobs; the Human Development Program, toimprove rural education and health; and the Local Development District Pro-grams, to provide planning and technical assistance to multicounty organiza-tions. (In 1998, the Congress transferred the responsibility for the AppalachianDevelopment Highway System, previously another main ARC program, to thegeneral Transportation Trust Fund.) Federal funds also support 50 percent ofthe salaries and expenses of ARC staff. Discontinuing the programs f unded through ARC would reduce federal outlays by $7 million in 2001 and by $507million over the 2001-2010 period. The debate over eliminating ARC focuses on two main points. First, ARC's critics argue that the responsibility for supporting local or regional de-velopment basically lies with the state and local governments whose citizenswill benefit from the development, not with the federal government. ARC'ssupporters believe that the federal government has a legitimate role to play inredistributing funds among states to support development in the neediest areasand that reducing federal funding would reduce local progress in job creation,education, and health care. Second, the agency's critics note that all parts of thecountry have needy areas and argue that those areas in Appalachia have nospecial claim to federal dollars. According to such critics, needy Appalachianareas should, like other areas, get federal development aid through nationalprograms, such as those of the Economic Development Administration. ARC'sdefenders respond that Appalachia's size, physical isolation, and severe povertyhave created a unique situation requiring special attention.174 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 450-03 Drop Wealthier Communities from the Community Development Block Grant Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 : DiscretionaryThe Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides annual grants, by formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties through what isreferred to as its entitlement component. The program also allocates funds, byformula, to each state. Those funds are distributed among the states' smaller andmore rural communities, called nonentitlement areas, typically through a compet-itive process. In general, CDBG funds must be used to aid low- and moderate-income households, eliminate slums and blight, or meet emergency needs. Specificeligible uses include housing rehabilitation, infrastructure improvement, andeconomic development. Funds from the entitlement component may also be usedto repay bonds that are issued by local governments (for acquiring public prop-erty, for example) and guaranteed by the federal government under the Section108 program. For 2000, the CDBG program received a regular appropriation of$4.8 billion, including $3.0 billion for entitlement communities. Under current law, all urban counties, metropolitan cities, and other cities of 50,000 or more are eligible for the CDBG entitlement program. The formulafor allocating entitlement funds includes the following factors: population, thenumber of residents with income below the poverty level, the number of housingunits with more than one person per room, the number of housing units builtbefore 1940, and the extent to which an area's population growth since 1960 isless than the average for all metropolitan cities. The formula neither requires athreshold percentage of residents living in poverty nor excludes communitieswith high average income. Federal spending for the program could be reduced by focusing entitlement grants on more needy jurisdictions and lowering funding accordingly. Severalalternative changes to the current formula could yield similar results; one simpleapproach, however, would be to exclude communities whose per capita incomeexceeds the national average by more than a certain percentage. Data from theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development on the 1993 grants to entitle-ment cities (but not counties) suggest that restricting the grants to communitieswhose per capita income is less than 112 percent of the national average, forexample, would save 26 percent of the entitlement funds, in part by cutting thelarge grants to New York City and Los Angeles. To illustrate the general idea,the Congressional Budget Office has assumed a somewhat smaller cut of 20percent of entitlement f unding, which would save an es timated $12 million in 2001 and $4.7 billion from 2001 to 2010. Proponents of that change argue that if the CDBG program can be justified at all\u2014some argue that using federal funds for local development is generallyinappropriate\u2014its primary rationale is redistribution and that redistributingmoney to less needy communities serves no pressing interest. Opponents arguethat such a change would reduce efforts to aid low- and moderate-income house-holds in poverty pockets within those communities because local governmentswould not sufficiently redirect their own funds to completely offset the lostgrants.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 450 175 450-04 Eliminate the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 75 75 2002 75 752003 75 752004 75 752005 75 75 2001-2005 375 375 2001-2010 750 750 Relative to WIDI 2001 76 76 2002 77 772003 79 792004 80 802005 82 82 2001-2005 394 394 2001-2010 823 823 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is a public, nonprofit organization charged with revitalizing distressed neighborhoods. The NRCoversees a network of locally initiated and operated groups called Neighbor-Works \u00ae organizations, or NWOs, which engage in a variety of housing, neigh- borhood revitalization, and community-building activities. The corporationprovides technical and financial assistance to begin new NWOs; it also monitorsand assists current network members. As of 1998, the NeighborWorks \u00ae network had 181 members operating in 825 communities nationwide. For 2000, the NRC's appropriation is $75 million. With those funds, plus a few million dollars from fees and other sources, the corporation providesgrants, conducts training programs and educational forums, and produces publi-cations in support of member NWOs. The bulk of the grant money goes toNWOs, which use the funds to cover operating costs; conduct projects; purchase,construct, and rehabilitate properties; and capitalize their revolving loan funds.NWO revolving loan funds make home ownership and home improvement loansto individuals or loans to owners of mixed-use properties who provide long-termrental housing for low- and moderate-income households. In addition, the NRCawards grants to Neighborhood Housing Services of America to provide a sec-ondary market for the loans from NWOs. Eliminating the NRC would save$750 million over 10 years. One argument for eliminating the NRC is that the federal government should not fund programs whose benefits are local rather than national. A sec-ond argument is that the NeighborWorks \u00ae approach duplicates the efforts of programs from other federal agencies (particularly the Department of Housingand Urban Development, or HUD) that also rehabilitate low-income housing andpromote home ownership and community development. Third, critics of thecorporation argue that even within the NeighborWorks \u00ae approach, the NRC is a redundant funding channel. In 1997, NRC grants accounted for about one-quar-ter of the NWOs' governmental funding and roughly 6 percent of their total fund-ing. Larger shares came from private lenders, foundations, corporations, andHUD. The NRC's defenders argue that the large number of federal programs to assist local development is evidence of widespread support for a federal role\u2014particularly in areas where state and local governments may lack adequate re-sources of their own. They further argue that NWOs focus on whole neighbor-hoods rather than individual housing properties, and with their nonhousingactivities\u2014such as community organization building, neighborhood cleanup andbeautification, and leadership development\u2014provide economic and social bene-fits that other federal programs do not. Finally, defenders say that the NRC is avaluable part of the approach because of its flexibility in making grants, whichallows it to fund valuable NWO efforts that do not fit within the narrow criteriaof larger federal grantors, and the services it provides to the NWOs, such astraining, program evaluation, and technical assistance.176 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 450-05 Drop Flood Insurance for Certain Repeatedly Flooded Properties Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 58 2002 0 622003 0 672004 0 722005 0 77 2001-2005 0 336 2001-2010 0 822 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 450-06Data from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) show that a relatively small number of properties subject to repeated flooding account for a large shareof the losses incurred by the program. The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA), which administers the NFIP, has focused its attention on prop-erties that have incurred two or more losses of at least $1,000 each in any 10-year period since 1978 (the earliest year for which data are available). The morethan 87,000 properties fitting that definition account for about one-third of allclaims, by both number and dollar value, since 1978. Many of those propertiesno longer have flood insurance: in some cases, the property has been destroyed ormoved; in other cases, the owner dropped the policy\u2014for example, after FEMAlimited coverage under the NFIP for basement losses in 1983. The NFIP cur-rently insures roughly 43,000 repeatedly flooded properties, representing about 1percent of all policies in force but a much larger share of annual flood losses. The issue of repeatedly flooded properties raises concern in part because they generally are covered at premium rates that do not adequately reflect theirrisk of flood losses. FEMA data show that 95 percent of such properties werebuilt before the development of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for theirrespective communities\u2014which is not surprising, given the flood mitigationrequirements imposed on post-FIRM construction. Thus, almost all repeatedlyflooded properties are covered under the pre-FIRM premium rates that the gov-ernment explicitly subsidizes. (See the related discussion for option 450-06.) Inaddition, although some properties may incur losses twice in 10 years because ofa bad \"draw\" of storms or other random events, others have flooded four, five, oreven 10 or 20 times since 1978, demonstrating that the gap between the pre-FIRM rates and their true actuarial risk of flood loss is particularly large. One way to reduce federal costs for the flood insurance program would be to deny coverage after the fourth loss of at least $1,000 in any 20-year period.FEMA data indicate that the option would immediately affect about 8,800 prop-erties, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would reduce fed-eral outlays by $58 million in 2001 and $822 million over the 2001-2010period. The main argument for the option is that neither taxpayers nor otherpolicyholders should be required to provide an unlimited subsidy for propertiesknown to be at high risk for frequent flood damage. The loss or threat of losingNFIP protection would encourage owners of such properties to take appropriatemitigation measures, such as elevating their structures or rebuilding elsewhere. Opponents of dropping the flood insurance argue that it would be unfair to the property owners to suddenly withdraw their protection from flood risk\u2014especially owners who have occupied their properties since before the localFIRM was developed and cannot readily afford relocation or other costly mitiga-tion measures. Some opponents might prefer a more moderate change fromcurrent policy, such as adding a repetitive-loss surcharge to insurance premiumsor denying coverage only to policyholders who reject offers of mitigation assis-tance.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 450 177 450-06 Reduce the Flood Insurance Subsidy on Pre-FIRM Structures Net Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 25 2002 812003 1132004 1202005 137 2001-2005 466 2001-2010 1,185 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 450-05The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) charges two different sets of premi- ums: one for \"pre-FIRM\" buildings constructed before 1975 or before the comple-tion of a participating community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and anotherfor post-FIRM buildings. Post-FIRM premiums are intended to be actuarially sound\u2014that is, to cover the costs of all insured losses over the long term\u2014and are basedon buildings' elevations relative to the water level expected during a flood that ispredicted to occur less than once every 100 years. In contrast, pre-FIRM rates areheavily subsidized, on average, and do not take elevation into account. Currently,about one-sixth of all flood insurance coverage is provided at pre-FIRM rates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the flood insurance program, estimates that 31 percent of current policyholders are pay-ing pre-FIRM rates. Those rates are available only for the first $35,000 of coveragefor a single-family or a two- to four-family dwelling and for the first $100,000 of coverage for a larger residential, nonresidential, or small business building. Variouslevels of additional coverage are available at actuarially neutral rates. The programalso offers insurance for buildings' contents; again, policyholders in pre-FIRM build-ings pay lower rates for a first tier of coverage. The Congressional Budget Officeestimates that on average, the first-tier prices represent 38 percent of the coverages'actuarial value, implying a subsidy rate of 62 percent. The size of the subsidy for anyparticular building depends heavily on its elevation. For buildings that lie above the100-year-flood level, post-FIRM premiums are actually lower than the \"subsidized\"pre-FIRM rates. Owners of such properties can reduce their insurance costs bygetting the elevation certified, and many have done so. Reducing the average subsidy from 62 percent to 50 percent\u2014implying a premium increase of about 30 percent in the subsidized tier\u2014would yield net newreceipts of $25 million in 2001 and $1.2 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Thoseestimates take into account the likelihood that some current policyholders would droptheir coverage. Flood insurance is mandatory only for properties in special floodhazard areas that carry mortgages from federally insured lenders, and compliancewith the requirement is far from complete. Accordingly, CBO expects that the pro-posal would somewhat reduce the participation of both voluntary and mandatorypurchasers. Advocates of the proposal argue that the subsidy has outlived its original justi- fication as a temporary measure to encourage participation among property ownerswho were not previously aware of the magnitude of the flood risks they faced. Rais-ing premiums closer to actuarial levels, such advocates maintain, would make policy-holders pay more of their fair share for insurance protection and would give themstronger incentives to relocate or take preventive measures. Supporters of the current subsidy contend that a 30 percent increase in premi- ums would be an unfair burden to owners of pre-FIRM properties, which were builtbefore FEMA documented the extent of the flood hazards, and that the increasewould be particularly unjust for those policyholders who are already paying a nega-tive \"subsidy\" (because they are unaware that their properties lie above the 100-year-flood elevation). Subsidy supporters further argue that reduced rates of participationin the program would lead to increased spending on disaster grants and loans andthereby erode some of the savings projected for the option. Finally, they question theaccuracy of the maps FEMA uses to estimate the average long-run subsidy, notingthat for most pre-FIRM properties except a relatively few structures that repeatedlyflood, premiums now roughly equal the average losses incurred to date.178 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 450-07 Eliminate the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 80 15 2002 94 412003 94 712004 94 882005 94 93 2001-2005 456 308 2001-2010 926 778 Relative to WIDI 2001 81 15 2002 98 422003 99 732004 101 922005 102 99 2001-2005 481 321 2001-2010 1,022 847 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Congress created the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund in 1994 to expand the availability of credit, investment capital,and financial services in distressed communities. The fund provides equityinvestments, grants, loans, and technical assistance to CDFIs, which includecommunity development banks, credit unions, loan funds, venture capital funds,and microenterprise funds. In turn, the CDFIs provide a range of financialservices\u2014such as mortgage financing for first-time home buyers, loans andinvestments for new or expanding small businesses, and credit counseling\u2014inmarket niches underserved by traditional institutions. The CDFI fund alsoprovides incentive grants to traditional banks and thrifts to invest in CDFIs andto increase loans and services to distressed communities. For 2000, the Congress appropriated $95 million for the CDFI fund. Eliminating the fund would save $778 million over 10 years, taking into ac-count the small am ount of spending that would still be required by another agency (perhaps the Small Business Administration) for oversight of the fund'sexisting loan portfolio. Opponents criticize the fund on several grounds. First, as with many of the options in this section, some critics argue that local development should befunded at the state or local level, not by the federal government, since its bene-fits are not national in scope. Second, opponents see the fund as redundant,given that many other federal programs support home ownership and localeconomic development, including the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Commu-nities Program, housing loan programs of the Rural Housing Service, Commu-nity Development Block Grants, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation,and the Economic Development Administrati on, among others. Appropriations for those five programs totaled $6 billion in 1999. Third, some cr itics argue that assistance to CDFIs is likely to be inefficient, encouraging them to makeloans that would not pass market tests for creditworthiness. Fourth, opponentssay that the fund has been poorly managed: an oversight report from the HouseBanking Committee found that the fund had not followed accepted federal pro-cedures in making its first round of grants in 1996, had not accurately docu- mented the factors used in selecting applicants, and had paid excessive rates tooutside contractors hand-picked by CDFI officials. The fund's director anddeputy director resigned in August 1997. Supporters of the fund argue that the federal government has a legitimate role in assisting needy communities and that the fund provides an efficientmechanism for leveraging private-sector investment with a relatively smallfederal contribution. They also say that management has improved under thefund's new director, noting that its audit for fiscal year 1998 showed no mate-rial weaknesses and that the House Banking Committee reported a bill in 1999to reauthorize the fund for four years while providing some additional manage-ment controls.500 Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services Budget function 500 primarily includes federal spending within the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services for programs that directly provide\u2014or assist states and localities in provid-ing\u2014services to young people and adults. The activities that it covers include providing developmentalservices to low-income children, helping disadvantaged and other elementary and secondary school stu-dents, offering grants and loans to postsecondary students, and funding job-training and employmentservices for people of all ages.

Basic grants allocate federal fundson the basis of the number of children who live in families with income belowthe poverty level in a particular geographic area. Concentration grants provideadditional funds to school districts in counties in which the number of poorchildren exceeds 6,500 or 15 percent of the school-age population. AlthoughTitle I distributes funds on the basis of the number of poor students in a district,schools that receive the m oney may use it to provide services to any students who are performing well below their grade level. Title I funds reached about 45,000 schools in 1999 and served approxi- mately 10 million children. About 15,000 schools operated schoolwide pro-grams (which benefit all of the children in a specific school), and another30,000 participated in targeted assistance programs (which must focus thegrants on the children most in need of Title I services). This option would reduce funding for basic grants to local educational agencies by 5 percent, saving $17 million in federal outlays in 2001 and $3 billion over the 2001-2010 period. To direct cuts toward the schools with theleast need for Title I services, the eligibility criteria for receiving funding couldbe altered. Currently, the law restricts Title I basic grant funds to school dis-tricts that have 2 percent of their children living in families with income belowthe poverty level and at least 10 poor children. If the Congress raised the lowerbound on the criterion for the percentage of children living in poverty (for ex-ample, to 5 percent or 10 percent), funding could be maintained at its currentlevel for the school districts that satisfied the more restrictive eligibility criteria. Some proponents of eliminating federal funding for elementary and sec- ondary education argue that such support represents federal intervention intomatters that are primarily of state and local concern. Opponents, however,insist that federal funding augments state and local efforts and ultimately makesthem more successful. The primary argument for reducing Title I funding in particular is that there is little evidence that it improves the long-term academic performance ofstudents who receive its services. Many studies have compared students receiv-ing Title I services with groups of students that are similar by grade and pov-erty status. Such studies show that program participants do not improve theiracademic achievement relative to other students. However, supporters of theprogram maintain that Title I funds help underachieving students in schools thatserve many poor childr en. Advocates also note that such f unding is a major federal instrument for fostering school reform because states applying for thegrants must develop standards specifying what public school children shouldknow and be able to do at various points in their education.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 181 500-02 Eliminate Funding for Bilingual Education Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 248 30 2002 248 1982003 248 2432004 248 2482005 248 248 2001-2005 1,240 967 2001-2010 2,480 2,207 Relative to WIDI 2001 252 30 2002 256 2022003 270 265 2,722 2,400 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryFederal bilingual education programs authorized under title VII of the Elemen- tary and Secondary Education Act provide grants to school districts for in-structing students who have limited proficiency in English (so-called LEP stu-dents). School districts use the funds primarily to support bilingual instruc-tional services, to disseminate information on ways to serve students whoseEnglish is limited, and to train instructors to teach in bilingual classrooms. Bilingual education projects funded through title VII provide a range of services to LEP students. Most schools use English as a S econd La nguage projects to meet those students' needs. In the projects, teachers instruct chil-dren jointly in English and their native language but stress a rapid grasp ofEnglish. No more than 25 percent of federal funding for bilingual educationprograms may be used to support instruction conducted only in English. Eliminating federal funding for bilingual education programs under title VII would reduce federal outlays by $30 million in 2001 and $2.2 billion overthe 2001-2010 period. Supporters of this option contend that bilingual education programs under title VII do not effectively advance literacy in the English language and slowthe integration of LEP students into regular classrooms. They maintain that thefederal government should not fund programs requiring the use of a student'snative language but should en courage sc hool districts to move LEP students into regular classrooms as quickly as possible. Many supporters of this optionargue that \"immersion\" programs, in which LEP students are instructed solelyin English, are the most effective means to teach English to such students. Defenders of bilingual education assert that it serves a valuable purpose. By introducing students to the English language while continuing instruction intheir native language, the program helps students acquire knowledge in a vari-ety of academic subjects as they develop their English literacy skills. As aresult, supporters argue, students do not fall behind their schoolmates in othersubjects during their transition to English-only instruction.182 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-03 Reduce Funding to School Districts for Impact Aid Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 73 66 2002 73 712003 73 732004 73 732005 73 73 2001-2005 364 356 2001-2010 729 720 Relative to WIDI 2001 74 67 2002 75 742003 77 762004 78 782005 79 79 2001-2005 383 373 2001-2010 799 789 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Impact Aid program, authorized under title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, provides funds to school districts affected by activi-ties of the federal government. The program pays districts for federally con-nected pupils and for school construction in areas where the federal governmenthas acquired a significant portion of the real property tax base, thereby depriv-ing the school district of a source of revenue. For a school district to be eligible for Impact Aid's basic support pay- ments, a minimum of 3 percent (or at least 400) of its pupils must be associatedwith activities of the federal government\u2014for example, pupils whose parentsboth live and work on federal property (including Indian lands), pupils whoseparents are in the uniformed services but live on private property, and pupilswho live in federally subsidized low-rent housing. In addition, aid goes to afew districts enrolling at least 1,000 pupils (and 10 percent of enrollment)whose parents work but do not live on federal property. In 1999, approxi-mately 1,500 local education agencies received Impact Aid. This option would restrict Impact Aid to the school districts that are most affected by federal activities\u2014districts with children who live on federal prop-erty and have a parent who is in the military or is a civilian federal employeeand districts with children who live on Indian lands. The restriction wouldreduce federal outlays by $720 million during the 2001-2010 period. TheAdministration's budget for fiscal year 2000 included this option in its list ofrecommendations. Proponents of this alternative argue that restricting Impact Aid payments to students whose presence puts the greatest burden on school districts is appro-priate, given the limited funding available for federal discretionary programs.Opponents argue that eliminating payments for other types of children associ-ated with federal activities could significantly affect certain districts\u2014for ex-ample, those in which large numbers of military families live off-base but shopat military exchanges, which do not collect state and local sales taxes.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 183 500-04 Limit Federal Funding for State Education Reform Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 88 7 2002 131 732003 131 1172004 131 1,264 Relative WIDI 204 2002 155 2782003 170 1882004 186 1832005 201 187 2001-2005 810 1,039 2001-2010 2,060 2,191 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government currently supports education reform at the state and local levels through two programs that have related purposes but quite differentstructures. The first program, the Innovative Education Program Strategies(IEPS) state grants (authorized under title VI of the Elementary and SecondaryEducation Act), provides relatively untargeted f unding in the form of block grants to supplement state and local funding for elementary and secondaryeducation reform. Recipients may use funds from the grants to carry out pro-grams in a number of broad categories, but those activities need not be tied toany specific reform plan or set of standards. In contrast, funds under Goals 2000 may only be used to pursue a sys- temic model of reform, which involves setting goals and standards for reform,developing benchmarks to promote progress toward the goals, and pursuingreform at all levels of the education system. Activities that are consistent withthat model include developing state standards for reform, aligning local curric-ula with those standards, paying for professional development activities forteachers and other staff, and purchasing technology. Reducing federal funding for education reform activities now funded under IEPS state grants and Goals 2000 by 15 percent would cut federal out-lays by $7 million in 2001 and $1.1 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Law-makers could retain the current relative distribution of funding between the twotypes of approaches or shift funding to favor one approach or the other. Proponents of decreasing federal funding for both types of education re- form argue that state and local governments are already carrying out schoolreforms on their own and do not need additional federal support. Federal fund-ing for education reform is unnecessary, say those proponents, and constitutesneedless federal intervention into matters that are primarily of state and localconcern. Opponents of limiting federal support insist that federal funds aug-ment ongoing state and local reform efforts and contribute to their faster andmore complete implementation. Among supporters of some federal role in education reform, opinions differ about which type of program should receive the larger share of federalfunding. Proponents of more funding for the activities currently supportedunder the Goals 2000 program argue that those activities are better designed tofoster systemic reform. Because Goals 2000 links f unding to a state reform plan, supporters maintain that the funds are better directed and have a greaterimpact on the quality of schools within a state. In contrast, supporters of thetitle VI block grants insist that those grants are a better tool for supplementingstate education reform. By offering greater flexibility, supporters say, blockgrants allow states to fund the local reforms that are best suited to particularcommunities\u2014even if those reforms are not tied to a larger state effort.184 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-05 Eliminate Funding for Federal Initiatives to Reduce Class Size Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 400 65 2002 1,300 9102003 1,300 1,2352004 1,300 fiscal year 2000, the Congress appropriated $1.3 billion to reduce the size of elementary school classes nationwide. The law also allows school districtsto use up to 25 percent of local grants to improve teacher quality. Moreover,districts in which class sizes have already been reduced can use the f unds to improve the quality of teachers in the lower grades or to hire more teachers forupper grades. By eliminating funding for the program, the federal governmentcould save $11.3 billion in outlays over the next 10 years. In recent reviews of the scientific evidence for the benefits of small classes, the results of one study, Tennessee's Project STAR, are prominentbecause of the study's rigorous experimental design. Children entering kinder-garten were randomly assigned either to special small classes of between 13and 17 students or to \"regular\" classes of between 22 and 26 students. Withonly few exceptions, students remained in the same size class to which theywere initially assigned through the end of the third grade. Testing showed that students in the small classes outperformed students in the regular classes on both standardized and curriculum-based tests. In theearly grades, the positive effect of small classes on achievement among minor-ity students was twice that for nonminority students. Through eighth grade,students who had been in the small classes showed a decreasing but still signifi-cantly higher level of academic achievement than students in the r egular classes. Proponents of eliminating federal funding for class-size initiatives see limitations to Project STAR's success. If education is cumulative, with eachyear building on what was learned the year before, children assigned to a smallclass would be expected to pull further away from their counterparts in a regu-lar class for each year they remained in the small class. In fact, the evidenceshows such advances for youngsters in small classes only at the end of kinder-garten and, to a lesser extent, at the end of first grade. Critics of a policy advo-cating small class sizes also point to other evidence suggesting that class sizemust fall to about 15 students before it has an effect. Reducing class sizes tothose levels would be quite expensive, and the costs would increase over time.More classrooms would have to be built; new teachers would require servicessuch as staff training; and as they gained experience, those teachers' salarieswould increase. Finally, the critics note that strategies such as providingone-on-one or peer tutoring as well as cooperative learning achieve resultssimilar to those gained from reducing class size\u2014but at a fraction of the cost. Supporters of funding for initiatives to decrease class sizes find that ap- proach attractive because it moves resources directly to the classroom and tostudents. Furthermore, many analysts have concluded that enrollment in theearly grades in small classes of about 18 or fewer students can have positiveeffects on a student's academic achievement, compared with enrollment inclasses of between 25 and 30 students. Minority students in particular seem tobenefit from small classes. In addition, most of the benefits students gain frombeing in a small class appear to persist into later grades.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 185 500-06 Consolidate and Reduce Funding for Several Elementary and Secondary Education Programs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 328 24 2002 479 2912003 479 CATEGORY : DiscretionaryCurrent federal programs to aid elementary and secondary education are gener- ally categorical\u2014that is, they focus on specific populations of students withspecial needs (for example, disabled students or educationally disadvantagedstudents), on subject areas of high priority to policymakers (such as mathemat-ics or science), or on specific approaches to improving education (for instance,charter schools). The Congress adopted categorical forms of federal aid in cer-tain cases because of a belief that many states would be unable or unwilling tocommit funds to those priorities. Categorical programs focusing on educationreform and school innovation, for which the Congress appropriated a combined$4.8 billion in fiscal year 2000, could be consolidated under a single blockgrant. Funds from the grant could be used for any of the purposes previouslyauthorized for the categorical programs. To reduce federal outlays, the federal government could trim the consoli- dated block grant for education reform and school innovation by, for example,10 percent. Doing so would save $24 million in 2001 and $4.1 billion over 10years. Proponents of block grants for education point out that they give states and local education agencies the flexib ility to direct federal aid toward the schools' greatest needs. Block grants can circumvent the administrative re-quirements accompanying categorical aid programs, which may limit a school'sability to implement comprehensive reforms. Block grants also avoid the prob-lems created within a school by a proliferation of categorical programs thatmay lead to gaps in a child's instructional program in some areas and duplica-tion in others. Moreover, by requiring that funds be clearly associated with theintended beneficiaries, categorical grants may encourage schools to partiallysegregate children with special needs, track students by achievement level, orperpetuate lower expectations of their performance. Opponents of education block grants argue that they dilute the effect of federal funding on national educational priorities and provide less assurancethan categorical funding that federal aid will be used to meet national objec-tives. Moreover, opponents point out that alternative means, such as waivers,are now available to give state and local education agencies increased flexibil-ity in using funds from categorical programs without sacrificing federal priori-ties.186 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-07 Reduce Spending and Increase the Targeting of Funds for Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 41 5 2002 91 642003 91 862004 91 912005 91 91 2001-2005 405 336 2001-2010 859 791 Relative to WIDI 2001 46 5 2002 106 712003 116 1032004 127 1192005 138 129 2001-2005 532 428 2001-2010 1,389 1,242 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) funds pro- grams in schools, communities, and institutions of higher education to addressthe increasing use of illegal substances such as alcohol, cigarettes, and drugsamong youth and the related issue of violence in schools. Approximately 97percent of the nation's school districts receive funding under the act, and gener-ally students in grades 5 thr ough 12 participate in the programs. The wide distribution of SDFSCA funding has led to questions about whether such aidmight be more effective if it was focused on areas or groups of people with thegreatest need. In fiscal year 2000, states received $445 million of the program's total funding of $565 million. Half of each state's award is based on its school-agepopulation, and half is based on the number of poor children in the state. Thelaw requires states to distribute 80 percent of their grants to school districts,primarily on the basis of enrollment. The remaining 20 percent of state grantsgo to the governors for services to groups not served by the education system,such as incarcerated youth and school dropouts. Little evidence is available todate about whether SDFSCA programs reduce rates of substance use and vio-lence among youth. However, research shows that the programs have beeneffective in increasing awareness about the consequences of drug use. This option would reduce funding to the states by 15 percent and require them to direct the remaining funds toward areas or groups of people consideredmost likely to benefit from such grants. The option would reduce federal out-lays by $5 million in 2001 and $791 million over the 2001-2010 period. To better target SDFSCA grants, the federal government could change the formula for allocating funds among the states, reduce the number of schooldistricts within states that may receive grants, or target certain age groupswithin the schools. For instance, federal grant am ounts could be tied to a \"need\" indicator such as state rates of crime or drug use. Similarly, states intheir turn could be required to allocate grants to school districts either on thebasis of need or through a competitive process. The federal government couldalso require states to focus funds on children in the earlier grades. That pro-posal stems from research indicating that prevention programs might be mosteffective in changing those students' attitudes about drugs and violence. Focusing SDFSCA funds, as this option provides, could have several different effects. Districts with less crime and fewer drug problems might notreceive grants, whereas districts with higher levels of need might receive grantslarge enough to implement somewhat more comprehensive drug and violenceprevention programs than are possible with the current level and distribution offederal funds. Yet even in areas with low rates of crime and drug use, preven-tion programs may serve a proactive function by raising people's awareness ofthe problem. If such programs were eliminated, drug use and violence mightaccelerate and lead to even more costly interventions on the part of schoolsystems and the community.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 187 500-08-A Eliminate Interest Subsidies on Loans to Graduate Students Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 365 2002 5202003 5202004 5352005 545 2001-2005 2,485 2001-2010 5,340 Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-08-B and 500-08-CFederal student loan programs afford students and their parents the opportunity to borrow funds to attend postsecondary schools. Those programs offer threetypes of loans: \"subsidized\" loans to students who are defined as having finan-cial need, \"unsubsidized\" loans to students regardless of need, and loans toparents of students. Two programs provide all three types of loans; they are theFederal Family Education Loan Program, in which loans made by private lend-ers are guaranteed by the federal government, and the Ford Federal DirectStudent Loan Program, in which the government makes the loans throughschools. With all of the loans, borrowers benefit because the interest ratecharged is lower than the rates most of them could secure from alternativesources. With subsidized loans, borrowers benefit further because the federalgovernment pays the interest on the loans while students are in school andduring a six-month grace period after they leave. Federal costs could be reduced by limiting eligibility for subsidized loans to undergraduate students. Graduate students could substitute unsubsidizedloans for the subsidized loans they had received previously. That change wouldreduce federal outlays by $365 million in 2001 and $5.3 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Restricting subsidized loans to undergraduate students would direct funds toward achieving the goal of making an undergraduate education affordable.Because graduate students have completed their undergraduate work, they areoutside the group of students that constitutes the federal government's particularfocus. Under this option, graduate students who took unsubsidized loans toreplace the subsidized loans they had lost would ultimately be responsible forsomewhat higher loan payments. However, the federal student loan programshave several options for making repayment manageable for students who havehigh loan balances or difficult financial circumstances. Nevertheless, graduate students often amass large student loan debts because of the number of years of schooling required for their degrees. With-out the benefit of interest forgiveness while they were enrolled in school, theirdebt would be substantially larger when they entered the repayment periodbecause the interest on the amounts they had borrowed over the years would beadded to their loan balance.188 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-08-B Increase Origination Fees for Unsubsidized Loans to Students and Parents Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 100 2002 1552003 1602004 1602005 165 2001-2005 740 2001-2010 1,655 SPENDING CATEGORY Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-08-A and 500-08-CThe government recoups part of the cost of insuring student loans by collecting 3 percent of the face value of each loan from students and their parents as anorigination fee. (Guaranty agencies may collect an additional 1 percent of theface value as an insurance fee to replenish the federal reserve fund they man-age, but since 1998, very few have done so.) The fees are charged on subsi- dized, unsubsidized, and PLUS loans (Parent Loans to Undergraduate Stu-dents). Under this option, the origination and insurance fees in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) would be set to equal the origination fee onthe comparable loan in the Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Inaddition, fees in both programs on unsubsidized and PLUS loans would be 1percent higher (or 4 percent) than fees on subsidized loans (which are 3 per-cent). To implement the changes, the Congress would have to require the guar-anty agencies to collect the 1 percent insurance fee on all FFELP loans and theDepartment of Education to collect a 1 percent higher fee on the FFELP's coun-terpart loan in the direct student loan program. Those changes would reduceprogram outlays by $100 million in 2001 and $1.7 billion over the 2001-2010period. An argument for the change is that even with the higher origination fees, many students would still benefit substantially from the loans, in part becausethe government guarantees them. The guarantee means that lenders are willingto make loans to students who do not have a credit history and to make them atinterest rates below those available on most private loans. Furthermore, duringthe first five years of repayment, many borrowers can subtract the interest onthe loans from their income for the purpose of calculating federal income taxes.And because the change in the origination fees would affect only unsubsidizedand PLUS loans, it would produce savings without affecting the value of subsi-dized loans received by the neediest students. Increasing the origination fees, however, would reduce the net proceeds from any given loan. As a result, students would need to secure larger loans tofinance the same amount of educati on. That could pose a problem for many students who were already borrowing the maximum allowed by law and wouldnot be able to borrow more.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 189 500-08-C Restrict Eligibility for Subsidized Student Loans by Including Home Equity in the Determination of Financial Need Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 65 2002 902003 902004 952005 95 2001-2005 435 2001-2010 910 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-08-A and 500-08-BThe Higher Education Amendments of 1992 eliminated home equity from con- sideration in determining how much a student's family is expected to contributeto cover educational expenses\u2014a change that has made it easier for many stu-dents to obtain subsidized student loans. The amount a family is expected tocontribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax formula. Ineffect, federal calculations \"tax\" family incomes and assets above the amountsassumed to be required for a basic standard of living. Since 1992, the defini-tion of assets has excluded home equity for all families and excluded all assetsfor applicants whose income is below $50,000. Under this option, home equity would be included in calculating a family's need for financial aid for postsec ondary education. In addition, the income threshold under which most families are not asked to report their assets wouldbe lowered from $50,000 to its previous level of $15,000. Home equity wouldbe \"taxed,\" as other assets are now, at rates of up to about 5.6 percent after adeduction for allowable assets. The change would result in fewer studentsqualifying for subsidized loans or more students qualifying for subsidized loansof smaller amounts. Overall, by including home equity, outlays could be re-duced by about $65 million in 2001 and $910 million during the 2001-2010 period. Not counting home equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not. In today's economy, borrowing against home equity atan affordable interest rate is relatively simple. If families were unable or un-willing to take out home equity loans, students could take unsubsidized loans tofinance the family's expected contribution. That approach would cause rela-tively little difficulty for families' budgets because the interest payments onunsubsidized loans can be postponed while the student is in school. The inter-est is then simply added to the accumulated loan balance when the studentleaves school and begins repayment. However, because increases in incomes have not always kept pace with increases in housing prices, some families might have difficulty repaying theirmortgage if they borrowed against home equity to finance their children's edu-cation. In addition, having to value their home and other assets would compli-cate the loan application process for many families.190 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-09 Reduce Special Allowance Payments to Lenders in the Student Loan Program Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 235 2002 3852003 3452004 02005 0 2001-2005 965 2001-2010 965 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe largest federal student loan program is the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which guarantees 98 percent reimbursement on defaulted loans madeby private lenders to eligible students. Under the program, students and thefederal government together pay lenders an interest rate each year that is basedon changes in a reference rate determined in the financial markets. The federalpayments are called special allowance payments; their purpose is to approxi-mate a fair market return to lenders while subsidizing the cost to students offinancing their education. One such payment, which was added by the HigherEducation Amendments of 1998 and modified in 1999, applies to subsidizedand unsubsidized loans made after October 1, 1998, and before July 1, 2003.Under that provision, the federal government will make payments to lendersthat CBO estimates will average about 0.35 percentage points between October1, 2000, and July 1, 2003. This option would eliminate that payment on all new subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Savings would total $235 million in2001 and $965 million over the 2001-2 003 period, at the end of which the provision would expire. An argument for reducing the special allowance payment is that in most cases, it is not needed for lenders to achieve a fair market rate of return on theirloans. By using a reference rate that closely mirrors the interest rate that lend-ers pay on their own debts, the government has assured lenders a stable netincome from such loans. Moreover, nearly the entire loan amount is guaranteedby the federal government. In addition, a 1998 study by the Department of theTreasury concluded that even with a 0.5 percentage-point lower yield on loansmade under the program, lenders would earn returns that, on average, would besufficient to make the business attractive. The argument for retaining the payment is that without it, some lenders would, indeed, receive unacceptably low rates of return and leave the program.Such pruning of the lender ranks could create difficulties for financial aid offi-cers who administer student financial aid at postsecondary institutions and forstudents who seek loans. In general, student loans are quite small comparedwith, for example, mortgage loans, but the costs of servicing them are not pro-portionately lower. As a result, the interest rate necessary to yield sufficientincome to cover the costs of servicing needs to be higher. Furthermore, servic-ing costs vary by the size of the loan and the characteristics of the student, soreducing the profit margin for lenders might induce them to stop making loansto some students. Another risk of paying lenders less than a fair market rate ofreturn is that they might substantially reduce their investments in improving thequality of loan servicing or stop adapting their package of loan services to theparticular needs of the institutions that participate in the loan program.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 191 500-10 Eliminate Administrative Fees Paid to Schools in the Campus-Based Student Aid and Pell Grant Programs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 164 18 2002 164 1592003 164 1642004 164 1642005 164 164 2001-2005 820 669 2001-2010 1,640 1,489 Relative to WIDI 2001 167 19 2002 169 1612003 172 1702004 175 1732005 178 176 2001-2005 861 700 2001-2010 1,798 1,624 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryIn two types of federal student aid programs, the government pays schools to administer the programs or to distribute the funds, or both. In campus-basedaid programs, which include Federal Supplemental Educational O pportunity Grants, Federal Perkins loans, and Federal Work-Study Programs, the govern-ment distributes funds to institutions that in turn award grants, loans, and jobsto qualified students. Under a statutory formula, institutions may use up to 5percent of program funds for administrative costs. Similarly, in the Federal PellGrant Program, the schools distribute the funds, although eligibility is deter-mined solely by federal law. The Higher Education Act provides for a federalpayment of $5 per Pell grant to reimburse schools for a share of their costs ofadministering the program. The federal government could save about $144 million a year if schools were not allowed to use federal funds from the campus-based aid programs topay for administrative costs. The government could save another $20 million ifthe $5 payment to schools in the Pell Grant program was eliminated. Together,those options would produce savings of $18 million in 2001 and $1.5 billionover the 2001-2010 period. Arguments can be made both for eliminating the administrative payments and for retaining them. On the one hand, institutions benefit significantly fromparticipating in federal student aid programs even without the payments be-cause the aid makes attendance at the schools more affordable. In 2000, stu-dents will receive an estimated $10.9 billion in federal funds under the PellGrant and campus-based aid programs. On the other hand, the institutions do, indeed, incur costs for administer- ing the programs. Furthermore, if the federal government does not pay thoseexpenses, schools will simply pass along the costs to st udents in the form of higher tuition or fees.192 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-11 Eliminate the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 40 8 2002 40 412003 40 412004 40 402005 40 40 2001-2005 200 170 2001-2010 400 370 Relative to WIDI 2001 41 8 2002 41 412003 42 412004 43 422005 43 43 2001-2005 210 175 2001-2010 439 401 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program, formerly the State Student Incentive Grant program, helps states provide financiallyneedy postsecondary students with grant and work-study assistance while theyattend either academic institutions or schools that teach occupational sk ills.

Proponents of eliminating this program argue that it is no longer needed to encourage states to provide more student aid. When the LEAP program wasfirst authorized in 1972, only 28 states had student grant programs; now, all 50states provide such grants. An argument against eliminating the LEAP program is that not all states would increase their student aid appropriations to make up for the lost federalfunding and some might even reduce them. In that case, some students whoreceived less aid might not be able to enroll in college or might have to attend aless expensive school.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 193 500-12 End New Funding for Perkins Loans Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 100 10 2002 100 972003 100 1002004 100 1002005 100 100 2001-2005 500 407 2001-2010 1,000 907 Relative to WIDI 2001 102 10 2002 103 992003 105 1032004 107 1052005 109 107 2001-2005 526 425 2001-2010 1,097 988 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government provides student loans through three programs: Federal Family Education Loans, Ford Federal Direct Student Loans, and FederalPerkins Loans (formerly National Defense Student Loans). The Perkins Loanprogram is the smallest, with allocations made directly to approximately 2,000postsecondary institutions. Financial aid administrators at those schools thendetermine which eligible students receive Perkins loans. During the 1999-2000academic year, approximately 700,000 students will receive such loans. The money for Perkins loans comes from an institutional revolving fund, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in 2000, that has four sources: collectionsby the schools of payments on prior year student loans ($945 million in 2000),federal payments for loan cancellations granted in exchange for teaching inhigh-need areas or for military or public service ($30 million in 2000), federalcontributions from new appropriations ($100 million in 2000), and institutionalmatching contributions that for each school must equal at least one-third of thefederal contribution. Eliminating new appropriations for federal contributions would lower outlays by $907 million during the 2001-2010 period. The extent of the reduc-tion in funds for student loans would depend on the responses of postsecondaryinstitutions, some of which would make up part or all of the lost federal money.If institutions made up none of the lost federal funds but continued to contributeto the program at the level of their previous matching share, approximately64,000 fewer Perkins loans would be made. Reflecting the view that the main goal of federal student aid is to provide access to postsecondary education for needy students, the primary justificationfor this option is that the program may be failing to provide equal access toequally needy students. Federal contributions are allocated, first, on the basisof an institution's 1985 allocation and, second, on the basis of the financial needof its students. Because campus-based aid is tied to specific institutions, stu-dents with greater need at poorly funded schools may receive less than thosewith less need at well-funded institutions. Eliminating new funds for Perkins loans, however, would reduce the dis- cretion of postsecondary institutions in packaging aid to address the specialsituations of some students. It would also reduce total available aid. More-over, Perkins loans disproportionately help students at private nonprofit institu-tions (whose students get almost half of the aid, compared with about 20 per-cent of Pell Grant aid). Thus, cutting Perkins loans would make that type ofschool less accessible to needy students.194 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-13 Reduce Funding for the Arts and Humanities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 120 75 2002 120 1102003 170 1652004 170 1702005 170 170 2001-2005 750 690 2001-2010 1,600 1,540 Relative to WIDI 2001 145 95 2002 170 1502003 245 2352004 310 300 3,160 3,020 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government subsidizes various activities related to the arts and humanities. In 2000, combined funding for several programs totaled just over$1 billion; it included federal appropriations for the Smithsonian Institution($440 million), the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($310 million), theNational Endowment for the Humanities ($116 million), the National Endow-ment for the Arts ($98 million), the National Gallery of Art ($68 million), theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ($34 million), and the Instituteof Museum Services ($24 million). Cutting funding for those programs by 15 percent would reduce federal outlays over the 2001-2010 period by over $1.5 billion. (Savings from a re-duction in f unding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would not be realized until 2003 because the program receives its appropriations two yearsin advance.) The actual effect on arts and humanities activities would dependin large part on the extent to which other funding sources\u2014states, localities,individuals, firms, and foundations\u2014increased their contributions. Some proponents of reducing or eliminating funding for the arts and hu- manities argue that support of such activities is not an appropriate role for thefederal government. Other advocates of cuts suggest that the expenditures areparticularly unacceptable when programs addressing central federal concernsare not being funded fully. Some federal grants for the arts and human ities already require nonfederal matching contributions, and over half of all muse-ums charge or suggest that patrons pay an entrance fee. Those practices couldbe expanded to accommodate a reduction in federal funding. However, critics of cuts in funding contend that alternative sources would be unlikely to fully offset the drop in federal subsidies. Subsidized projects andorganizations in rural or low-income areas might find it especially difficult togarner increased private backing or sponsorship. Thus, a decline in govern-ment support, opponents argue, would reduce activities that preserve and ad-vance the nation's culture and that introduce the arts and humanities to peoplewho might not otherwise have access to them.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 195 500-14 Eliminate Funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 440 80 2002 440 4002003 440 4402004 440 4402005 440 440 2001-2005 2,200 1,800 2001-2010 4,400 4,000 Relative to WIDI 2001 445 80 2002 455 4102003 460 Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) funds part-time jobs for people age 55 and older who are unemployed and who meet incomeeligibility guidelines. To be eligible to participate in the program in 1999, anindividual's annual income had to be below roughly $10,000, which was 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline for a person living alone. ThroughSCSEP, which is authorized under title V of the Older Americans Act, grantsare awarded to several nonprofit organizations, the U.S. Forest Service, andstate agencies. The sponsoring organizations and agencies pay participants towork in part-time community service jobs, up to a maximum of 1,300 hours peryear. SCSEP participants work in schools, hospitals, and senior citizen centers and on beautification and conservation projects. They are paid the higher of thefederal or state minimum wage or the local preva iling rate of pay for similar employment. Participants also receive annual physical examinations, training,personal and job-related counseling, and assistance to move into private-sectorjobs when they complete their projects. Eliminating SCSEP would reduce outlays over the 2001-2010 period by about $4 billion. Opponents of the program maintain that it offers few benefitsaside from income support and that the presumed value of the work experiencegained by SCSEP participants would generally be greater if the experience wasprovided to equally disadvantaged young people, who have longer careers overwhich to benefit. In addition, the costs of producing the services now providedby SCSEP participants could be borne by the organizations that benefit fromtheir work; under current law, those organizations bear only 10 percent of suchcosts. That shift would ensure that only those services that were most highlyvalued would be provided. SCSEP, however, is the major federal jobs program aimed at low-income older workers, providing jobs for nearly 100,000 of them in 1998. Eliminatingthe program could cause hardship for older workers who were unable to findcomparable unsubsidized jobs. In general, older workers are less likely thanyounger workers to be unemployed, but those who are take longer to find work.Moreover, without SCSEP, community services might be reduced if nonprofitorganizations and states were unwilling or unable to increase expenditures tooffset the loss of federal funds.196 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-15 Eliminate Funding for the National and Community Service Act Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 415 40 2002 430 1902003 430 3002004 435 4,320 Relative WIDI 40 2002 455 1952003 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryAs a reward for providing community service, students may receive aid from the federal government to attend postsecondary schools thr ough the National and Community Service Act. The act funds the AmeriCorps Grants Program,the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Learn and Serve America,and the Points of Light Foundation, with AmeriCorps receiving the majority ofthe total appropriation. Those programs provide assistance for education, pub-lic safety, the environment, and health care, among other services. In manycases, the programs build on existing federal, state, and local programs. TheAmeriCorps Grants Program and NCCC provide participants with an educa-tional allowance, a stipend for living expenses, and, if they need them, healthinsurance and child care. Learn and Serve America participants generally donot receive stipends or education awards but may receive academic credit to-ward their degrees. Much of the total financial resources available for theAmeriCorps Grants Program comes from state and local governments and fromprivate enterprises. Eliminating federal funding for those programs would save $3.5 billion over the 2001-2010 period. (The estimate includes costs associated with termi-nating the programs.) Alternatively, some of the savings from eliminating theprograms could be redirected to the Federal Pell Grant Program, which is moreclosely targeted toward low-income students. Some critics who favor eliminating the programs maintain that community service should be voluntary rather than an activity for which a person is paid.An additional justification for this option is based on the view that the maingoal of federal aid to students should be to provide access to postsec ondary education for people with low income. Because participation in the programs isnot based on family income or assets, funds do not necessarily go to the pooreststudents. Supporters of the programs argue, however, that in addition to providing valuable services, the programs enable many students to attend postsecondaryschools. Moreover, they believe that opportunities to engage in national servicecan promote a sense of idealism among young people and should be supported.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 197 500-16 Reduce Funding for Head Start Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 DiscretionarySince 1965, Head Start has funded grants to local agencies to provide compre- hensive services to foster the development of preschool children from low-income families. The services supported by Head Start address the health, education, and nutrition of the children as well as their social behavior. Fundsare awarded to about 1,500 grantees at the discretion of the Secretary of Healthand Human Services, using state allocations determined by formula. Granteesmust contribute 20 percent of program costs from nonfederal funds unless theyobtain a waiver. In 1999, the program served about 835,000 children, approxi-mately 60 percent of whom were 4 years old. The average cost per child inHead Start that year was about $5,400 (compared with $7,200 per pupil spentby public elementary and secondary schools). Reducing the appropriation for Head Start in 2001 and subsequent years to its level for 1996 would reduce federal costs by about $600 million in 2001and nearly $16 billion over the 2001-2010 period. The primary argument for reducing funding for Head Start is that there is little evidence of its long-term effectiveness. The evidence that does exist sug-gests that Head Start does not improve the prospects of participants over thelong run. Although the program produces gains in children's intellectual, emo-tional, and social development after they have been in the program a year, thosegains diminish and disappear as participants move through elementary school.Some model early-childhood education efforts have provided evidence of long-term improvement in the lives of participants, but those projects were muchmore intensive\u2014and expensive\u2014than Head Start and were initiated severaldecades ago, when the social environment of the country, especially in urbanareas, was different. Furthermore, Head Start enrollment and funding haveexpanded rapidly during the 1990s, and some people question the ability of theprogram to effectively absorb the additional funds and students. Concerns havebeen raised as well about the qua lity of the program's services, including the limited qualifications of some staff. The main argument against reducing the appropriation for Head Start is that it appears to modestly lessen the probability that participants will be placedin special education programs and to increase the likelihood that students willbe promoted to higher grades. Proponents also ar gue that Head Start enrolls the most severely disadvantaged children and consequently should be creditedwith preventing participants from falling even further behind in their cognitive,social, and emotional development before they enter elementary school. Anadditional argument for not cutting Head Start funding is that the program hastaken several steps to improve the quality of services that its grantees provide.For example, 50 percent of the increase in appropriations for 2000 must beused for quality improvement activities. A new data collection system is alsobeing developed to produce longitudinal data on a nationally representativesample of participants.198 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 500-17 Reduce the 50 Percent Floor on the Federal Share of Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Payments Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 120 90 2002 130 1202003 140 1302004 150 1402005 160 160 2001-2005 700 640 2001-2010 1,670 1,610 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 500-18The Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs provide benefits and ser- vices to children who are in need. Foster Care supports eligible low-incomechildren who must reside in foster homes; Adoption Assistance subsidizesfamilies that adopt eligible low-income children with special needs. The federal government and the states jointly pay for the benefits provided by the two programs. The state and federal shares are based on the federalmatching rate for medical assistance programs, which depends on a state's percapita income. Higher-income states pay for a larger share of program benefitsthan do lower-income states. Currently, the federal share for the Foster Careand Adoption Assistance programs can vary between 50 percent and 83 per-cent. The federal government now pays a 50 percent share in 10 jurisdictions:Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland,Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York. This option would lower the floor on the federal share of benefits from 50 percent to 45 percent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that thisoption would save $90 million in 2001 and about $1.6 billion through 2010.Those amounts assume, however, that states would partially offset their highercosts by reducing benefits. With the 45 percent floor on the federal share of benefits, a state's contri- bution would relate more directly to its per capita income. As a result, higher-income states that chose to be relatively generous would pay a larger share oftheir higher benefits. Nevertheless, seven of the 10 jurisdictions would bepaying less than the formula alone would require. In part, however, higher incomes and benefits in the affected jurisdictions reflect higher costs of living and not simply greater wealth and generosity. Toaccommodate the drop in funding, the jurisdictions would have to reduce FosterCare and Adoption Assistance benefits, cut spending for other services, or raisetaxes. If, as CBO's estimates assume, states chose to compensate for theirhigher costs by partially reducing benefits, the programs' beneficiaries wouldbe adversely affected. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including Foster Care andAdoption Assistance\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if thestates lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilitiesto offset the loss of funding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexi-bility within the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs to make suchchanges, this option could constitute an unfunded federal mandate on thosejurisdictions under the law.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 500 199 500-18 Reduce the Federal Matching Rate for Administrative and Training Costs in the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Programs Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 140 115 2002 155 1502003 170 1652004 185 1802005 200 195 2001-2005 850 805 2001-2010 2,150 2,085 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 500-17The Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs provide benefits and ser- vices to eligible low-income children and families. The federal governmentpays 50 percent of most administrative costs for the programs, including thosefor child placement services, and states and local governments pay the remain-ing share. However, the costs of certain activities are matched at higher ratesto induce local administrators to undertake more of them than they would ifcosts were matched at the 50 percent rate. For example, the federal governmentpays 75 percent of the costs of training administrators and participating parents. Reducing the matching rates to 50 percent for all administrative and train- ing expenses in the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs would de-crease federal outlays by $115 million in 2001 and by almost $2.1 billion overthe 2001-2010 period. Cutting the higher matching rates to 50 percent would be appropriate if the need for special incentives for activities such as training no longer existed.However, states might respond to this option by reducing their administrativeefforts, which could raise program costs and offset some of the federal savings.Specifically, states might make less of an effort to eliminate waste and abuse inpayments to providers. Alternatively, this proposal might encourage states toprovide less training for administrators and prospective foster and a doptive parents or to reduce the payments and other services that the programs offer. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including Foster Care andAdoption Assistance\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if thestates lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilitiesto offset the loss of funding.

CBO estimates that in 2000, the federal governmentwill spend $115 billion on Medicaid and a total of almost $153 billion on function 550. Discretionaryoutlays make up only $29 billion of that total.

The Corps provides scholarships or loan repayment for healthprofessionals in exchange for the recipients' agreeing to serve in a shortagearea for a specified period. In recent years, over 2,400 health professionals have been serving with the NHSC\u2014most of them work in underserved ruralareas, but about 40 percent are in urban areas. Over half of the participants aredoctors, but a substantial fraction of Corps practitioners are dentists, nurse-practitioners, or physician assistants. This option would reduce budget authority for the NHSC by 25 percent, producing savings in outlays of $9 million in 2001. Five-year savings wouldtotal $115 million; savings over the 2001-2010 period would reach $260 mil-lion. Although some people living in underserved areas receive greater access to health services because of the Corps, critics of the program may questionwhether it distributes health professionals efficiently. Concerns center onwhether the services that an NHSC professional provides in an underservedarea outweigh the value of the services that he or she would have provided insome other location by enough to justify the public expense of a scholarship orloan repayment. Moreover, some NHSC participants may displace other healthprofessionals. For example, certain of the more desirable shortage areas mighthave been able to attract health professionals if a number of the potential pa-tients were not already being served by Corps professionals. In addition, someobservers might question whether NHSC funding represents a good return oninvestment. Although retention rates have increased substantially, almost halfof the recruits do not remain in their underserved location beyond their obliga-tion. Reducing funding for the NHSC would lessen access in some underserved areas to the services provided by health professionals, although the Corps mightbe able to mitigate the effects of budget cuts by spending more of its resourceson relatively inexpensive nonphysician providers. But even if the Corps refo-cused its remaining funds on nonphysician practitioners, the services of thoseprofessionals would not fully substitute for the skills and services offered byphysicians. In the event of a cut in funding, community health centers, whichobtain about a quarter of their physicians from the NHSC, would probablyreduce their services. Moreover, lower levels of funding would probably havea disproportionate impact on people from minority groups, who constitute themajority of patients served by Corps professionals.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 203 550-02 Reduce the Floor on the Federal Matching Rate in Medicaid Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 550-03The Medicaid program pays for medical assistance for certain low-income families, for low-income people who receive Supplemental Security Income,and for other low-income individuals\u2014mostly children and pregnant women.The federal government and the states pay for the program jointly, with thefederal government's share generally varying according to a formula that de-pends on a state's per capita income. High-income states pay for a larger shareof benefits than low-income states, but by law, the federal share can be no lessthan 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. In 2001, the 50 percent floor willapply to nine states: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland,Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York. (The floorwould also have applied to the District of Columbia, but the Balanced BudgetAct of 1997 established a permanent special exception for that jurisdiction.) Under this opti on, the 50 percent floor would be reduced to 45 percent, generating savings of about $3.7 billion in 2001 and $22.2 billion through2005. (The option assumes that matching rates for other programs that arejointly funded by the federal and state governments would be unaffected, eventhough some programs have matching rates that are tied to the rate forMedicaid. Savings would be greater if matching rates in those programs alsochanged.) Proponents of this change argue that the allocation formula does not ade- quately address differences in the tax base of the states and that high-incomestates should bear a larger share of the cost of their programs. If the floor wasreduced to 45 percent, federal contributions would be more closely related tothe state's per capita income, and six of the nine jurisdictions would still bepaying less than the formula alone would require. Opponents of reducing the 50 percent floor believe that higher incomes in the affected states partly reflect higher costs of living. If the option wasadopted, those states would have to compensate for the lower matching rates byeither reducing Medicaid benefits, reducing expenditures for other services, orraising taxes.204 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 550-03 Reduce the Enhanced Federal Matching Rates for Certain Administrative Functions in Medicaid Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 670 2002 8102003 1,0502004 1,1402005 1,240 2001-2005 4,910 2001-2010 RELATED OPTIONS : 550-02, 550-04-A, and 550-04-BUnder current law, the federal government pays part of the costs that states incur in administering their Medicaid programs. For most administrative activ-ities, the federal matching rate is 50 percent, but that rate is higher for certainactivities. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the costs ofskilled medical professionals who are employed in Medicaid administration, 75percent of the costs of utilization review, 90 percent of the development costs ofsystems for claims processing and management information, and 75 percent ofthe costs of operating such systems. The purpose of enhanced matching rates is to give states incentives to develop and support particular administrative activities that the federal govern-ment considers important for the Medicaid program. But once the administra-tive systems are operational, there may be less reason to continue to pay higherrates. If the federal share of all Medicaid administrative costs was 50 percent,savings would be $670 million in 2001, $4.9 billion over the 2001-2005 period,and $12.8 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Without high matching rates, states might be inclined to cut back on some activities, with adverse consequences for the quality of care and for programmanagement. States might, for example, hire fewer nurses to conduct utiliza-tion review and oversee care in nursing homes, or they might undertake fewerimprovements to their management information systems. However, if the Con-gress wished to protect certain administrative functions, it could maintain thehigher matching rates for some administrative activities and reduce them for others.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 205 550-04-A Restrict the Allocation of Common Administrative Costs to Medicaid Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 290 2002 3302003 3902004 3902005 390 2001-2005 1,790 2001-2010 3,740 Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 550-03 and 550-04-BPublic assistance programs have certain administrative requirements that are common to the enrollment process, such as the collection of information on afamily's income, assets, and other characteristics. Before the 1996 welfarereform law, the three major public assistance programs\u2014Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps, and Medicaid\u2014all reimbursedstates for 50 percent of most of their administrative costs. But states usuallycharged the common administrative costs of those programs to AFDC. The welfare reform law replaced AFDC and some related programs with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block-grant program.The block grants that states receive are based on historical federal welfareexpenditures, including administrative costs. Thus, insofar as states had previ-ously paid for the common administrative costs of public assistance programsout of AFDC funds, those am ounts are now included in their block grants. Although the welfare reform act is silent about the cost allocation process, theDepartment of Health and Human Services now requires states to charge partof the common administrative costs of Medicaid and TANF to Medicaid, evenif those costs are already included in the states' TANF block grants. This option would reduce federal reimbursement for Medicaid administra- tive costs to reflect the share of those costs that are assumed to be covered bythe TANF block grant; it would also prohibit states from using TANF funds topay for those costs. The amount of the reduction would be about one-third ofthe common costs of administering the Medicaid, AFDC, and Food Stampprograms that were charged to AFDC during the base period used for determin-ing the amount of the TANF block grant. (A similar adjustment has alreadybeen made in the amount the federal government pays the states for the admin-istrative costs of the Food Stamp program.) Savings would be $290 million in2001, $1.8 billion over the 2001-2005 period, and $3.7 billion over the 2001-2010 period. (If, however, the policy permitted the states to use TANF funds topay for those costs, savings would be $170 million in 2001, $2 billion over the2001-2005 period, and $2.4 billion over the 2001-2010 period.) The reductions would come at a time when states are attempting to expand their outreach activ ities to enroll more eligible children in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Because the share ofSCHIP spending that can be devoted to administration is capped, states mayseek to increase the share of the administrative burden that Medicaid bears.But states would be less likely to pursue that strategy if Medicaid administra-tive payments were reduced.

Under thisoption, the federal government would cap the amount per enrollee that it paidthe states for Medicaid administration. The per capita limit would grow at 5percent a year from the base-year amount, which would be the administrativecosts per enrollee for which the states claimed matching payments in 1996.Savings would be $1.7 billion in 2001, $10.5 billion over the 2001-2005 pe-riod, and $29.5 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Using this approach, states that before TANF allocated Medicaid's com- mon administrative costs to AFDC would not have those costs included in theirprojected Medicaid administrative costs. But states that claimed those coststhrough the Medicaid program would have them built into their Medicaid ad-ministrative cost base. The option would generate large savings because theactual average rate of growth of administrative costs was more than 5 percent ayear in the 1996-1999 period and is also projected to exceed 5 percent in 2000and later years.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 207 550-05 Convert Medicaid and Medicare DSH Payments into a Block Grant Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 MandatoryUnder current law, states are required to adjust Medicaid payments to hospitals that treat large numbers of low-income and Medicaid patients, which are knownas disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals. In the early 1990s, some states usedcreative financing mechanisms to generate large federal matching paymentsthrough the DSH program, and federal DSH costs soared. To curb that growth,the Congress enacted a series of restrictions on DSH payments, culminating inthose in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Federal outlays for Medicaid DSHpayments were $8.5 billion in 1999 and are projected to decline to $8.1 billionby 2002, when they will start to rise with inflation. In addition to Medicaid DSH payments, hospitals that serve a dispropor- tionately large share of low-income patients may also receive higher paymentrates under Medicare's prospective payment system. Implemented in 1986, theMedicare disproportionate share adjustment was intended to account for thepresumably higher costs of treating Medicare patients in such hospitals. Re-cently, however, the adjustment has been seen more as a means to protect accessto care for Medicare and low-income populations by providing financial supportto hospitals serving large numbers of indigent patients. Outlays for MedicareDSH payments rose rapidly between 1989 and 1997, reaching $4.5 billion in 1997. Under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, a 4 percent reduc-tion in Medicare DSH adjustments is set to expire in 2002. As a result, pay-ments in 2002 will be $5.3 billion. An alternative approach to providing federal financial support for health care institutions that serve the poor and uninsured would be to convert the cur-rent Medicaid and Medicare disproportionate share programs into block grants tothe states. The grants could be constrained to grow more slowly than DSH pay-ments would grow under current law. In exchange for slower growth, statescould be given flexibility to use the funds to meet the needs of their low-incomeuninsured populations in the most cost-effective ways. Under this illustrative option, which assumes a maintenance-of-effort re- quirement for states, the aggregate block grant in 2001 would be the sum ofMedicare DSH payments and Medicaid DSH allotments for 2000, reduced by 10percent. In subsequent years, the block grant would be indexed to the increase inthe consumer price index for urban consumers less 1 percentage point. Addi-tional savings would accrue to Medicare because lower DSH payments wouldreduce payment updates to plans participating in Medicare+Choice. Total sav-ings would be $1.2 billion in 2001, $12.3 billion for the 2001-2005 period, and$33.6 billion for the 2001-2010 period. Giving the states more discretion in the allocation of DSH payments could result in those funds being targeted more appropriately and equitably to facilitiesand providers that serve low-income populations. But allowing the states toallocate the payments could cause some large urban hospitals to receive consid-erably less public funding than they do now, possibly threatening their futuresurvival. In addition, determining how to allocate the block grant funds amongthe states would be difficult and controversial.208 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 550-06 Recover Unspent Funds from the State Children's Health Insurance Program Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 40 2002 3502003 3702004 3802005 350 State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide health insurance to low-income, unin-sured children. SCHIP gives states enhanced federal matching funds to coverchildren whose annual family income is too high to qualify them for Medicaidand who do not have private health insurance. Depending on per capita incomein a state, the federal government reimburses between 65 percent and 85 percentof the state's total SCHIP spending (compared with reimbursement of between 50percent and 83 percent of total Medicaid spending). Funds allocated to a s tate for a given year are available for three years, after which any unspent funds areto be redistributed to states that have used their respective allotments. The firstsuch redistribution of unspent funds from 1998 is scheduled to take place in2001. This option would leave the basic SCHIP program intact but elimin ate the redistribution of unspent funds. It would save $8.5 billion in budget authorityand $1.9 billion in federal outlays during the 2001-2010 period. Most of theoutlay savings would occur in the first five years because those are the years inwhich most of the rollover of funds is expected to occur. Thus far, states have been slow to spend their SCHIP allotments. The Congress appropriated approximately $4.2 billion annually for the program forfiscal years 1998 through 2001, $3.1 billion annually for 2002 through 2004,$4.1 billion for 2005 to 2006, and $5.0 billion for 2007. In 1998 and 1999 com-bined, states spent a total of only about $1 billion in federal SCHIP funds. CBOestimates that under current law, $1.9 billion in unspent funds from 1998 will bemade available in 2001 to states that have spent their 1998 allotments. Thestates' slow rate of spending could be the result of the effort involved in planningand implementing large new programs, or it could be attributable to other factorssuch as uncertainty about future funding or a low level of interest among somestates in creating large new programs. An independent study of the program'seffectiveness is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2001. Recovering unspent funds from SCHIP would produce budgetary savings for the federal government with little disruption to most states' plans for provid-ing health insurance to low-income, uninsured children. Because states cannotknow in advance how much funding will be available and how those funds willbe distributed, they probably do not depend on such funding when they plan andimplement their children's health insurance programs. Eliminating the redistribution of unspent SCHIP funds could, however, reduce the financing flexibility of states that would otherwise use those funds toprovide health insurance to low-income children. As a result, those states mightnot be as ambitious in creating and maintaining their programs as they would beunder current law or might spend more money in Medicaid to cover children.Moreover, elimin ating the redistribution could take away a poten tially useful spending cushion for states that use all of their allotments under the program.That factor could be particularly significant in 2002 through 2004, when overallfederal appropriations for SCHIP are slated to decrease by 25 percent.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 209 550-07 Reduce Subsidies for Health Professions Education Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 212 65 2002 212 1552003 212 1952004 212 2052005 212 205 2001-2005 1,060 825 2001-2010 2,120 1,860 Relative to WIDI 2001 215 65 2002 220 1602003 : DiscretionaryThe Congress provided $212 million to the Public Health Service in 2000 to fund subsidies to institutions for educating physicians, nurses, and public healthprofessionals. Those funds primarily furnish support through grants and con-tracts to schools and hospitals for designated training programs in the healthprofessions. The programs promote primary care and community-based train-ing for physicians and other health professionals as well as nursing education: oPrimary care and community-based training . Several programs provide federal grants to medical schools, teaching hospitals, and other trainingcenters to develop, expand, or improve graduate medical education inprimary care specialties and other allied health fields and to encouragepractice in rural and low-income urban areas. Funding for 2000 is $146million. oNursing education . The subsidies to nursing schools are meant to pro- mote nursing education, including graduate training for nurse administra-tors, educators, and nursing specialists such as nurse-midwives and nurse-practitioners. Funding for 2000 is $66 million. Eliminating those grants and subsidies would save about $800 million over the 2001-2005 period. Savings over the 2001-2010 period would be $1.9 billion. The principal justification for this option is that market forces provide strong incentives for people to seek training and jobs in the health professions.Over the past several decades, the number of physicians\u2014the principal healthprofession targeted by the subsidies\u2014has rapidly increased, rising from 142physicians in all fields for every 100,000 people in 1960 to 278 in 1996. In thecase of nurses, if a shortage, indeed, existed, higher wages and better workingconditions would attract more people to the profession and more trained nurses to nursing jobs, and would encourage more of them to seek advanced train-ing. The major disadvantage of eliminating the subsidies is that the incentives supplied by market forces may not be strong enough to entirely meet the goalsof the health professions programs. For example, third-party reimbursementrates for primary care may not encourage enough physicians to enter thosespecialties and may not include sufficient fi nancial inducements to increase access to care in rural and inner-city areas. In addition, fewer people might choose advanced training in nursing, which could limit the opportunities for theuse of relatively inexpensive physician substitutes.210 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 550-08 Combine and Reduce Public Health Service Block Grants Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 400 145 2002 400 3502003 400 CATEGORY : DiscretionaryIn its appropriations for 2000, the Congress provided about $4.0 billion for nine block-grant programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration (HRSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). Four of the nine programs\u2014the Maternal and Child Health Care Block Grant, HIV Care Grants to States, the Family Planning Block Grant, and theHealthy Start Initiative\u2014are administered by HRSA. Those grants supportprograms that provide child health services, including immunizations, well-child examinations, and services for children with special health care needs;medical care and social support services for people who have been diagnosedwith the human immunodeficiency virus; family planning services; and infantmortality efforts. CDC administers the Preventive Health and Health ServicesBlock Grant, which is distributed to the states for programs that supportHealthy People 2010, the nation's objectives for promoting health and prevent-ing disease. The remaining four block grants\u2014the Substance Abuse Performance Partnership Block Grant, the Mental Health Performance Partnership BlockGrant, the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH)program, and the Protection and Advo cacy Program\u2014are administered by SAMHSA. The grants fund substance abuse prevention programs, community-based mental health services for adults with serious mental illnesses and chil-dren with severe emotional disturbances, services for people with mental illnessor substance abuse disorders who are also either homeless or at risk of becom-ing homeless, and programs that investigate allegations of abuse and neglect infacilities that provide care for people with mental illness. This option would combine these funds into two large grants and reduce funding to 90 percent of the 2000 level. The bl ock grants currently adminis- tered by HRSA and the CDC would be combined and administered by HRSA,and the block grants currently administered by SAMHSA would be combinedand administered by that agency. The principal justification for this option is that each state would be given added flexibility to direct the grant funds toward programs that the state consid-ers likely to have the most favorable impact. Conditions vary substantially bystate, yet grant requirements often compel states to invest resources in programsthat may or may not meet a given state's needs. By reducing funds for lower-priority programs, states could allocate additional resources to programs thatthey considered more important. The option's major disadvantage is that improved flexibility might not entirely make up for the 10 percent cut in federal funds for state programs. Thestates would have to make difficult decisions to trim programs that benefitedvulnerable population groups. Alternatively, if reducing resources was notfeasible, they might have to raise state taxes or cut other state programs.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 211 550-09 Adopt a Voucher Plan for the FEHB Program Savingsa (Millions of dollars) Discre- tionarybManda- tory 2001 0 0 2002 260 2402003 520 7402005 1,100 1,040 2001-2005 2,680 2,500 2001-2010 13,730 13,140 a.

SPENDING CATEGORIES: Discretionary and mandatory RELATED OPTION: 550-10 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program provides health in- surance coverage for over 4 million active federal employees and annuitants, aswell as for their 4.6 million dependents and survivors, at a cost to the govern-ment of more than $13 billion in 2000. The cost-sharing structure of the FEHBprogram encourages federal employees to switch from high-cost to lower-costplans to blunt the effects of rising premiums; cost sharing also intensifies com-petitive pressures on all participating plans to hold down premiums. The Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997 set the federal government's share of premiums foremployees and annuitants (including family coverage) at 72 percent of theaverage weighted premium of all plans beginning January 1, 1999. (The em-ployer's costs are higher under the U.S. Postal Service's collective bargainingagreement.) The act still requires policyholders to pay at least 25 percent of thepremium of any particular plan. To reduce expenditures, the government could offer a flat voucher for health insurance premiums. It could pay the first $2,100 of premiums for em-ployees and retirees ($4,800 for family coverage). Those amounts are based onthe government's average expected contribution for nonpostal employees in2001 and would increase annually by the rate of inflation rather than by theaverage weighted rate of change for premiums in the FEHB program. Budget-ary savings would come from indexing the premiums to inflation rather than tothe growth of premiums, which the Congressional Budget Office expects willrise at a rate more than twice that of inflation. Savings in discretionary spend-ing from lower payments for current employees and their dependents would bezero in 2001, $2.7 billion over five years, and $13.7 billion over 10 years.Savings in mandatory spending from reduced payments for retirees would bezero in 2001, $2.5 billion over five years, and $13.1 billion over 10 years. The option would strengthen price competition among health plans in the FEHB program because almost all current enrollees would be faced with pay-ing all of the incremental premiums above the voucher amount. In add ition, removing the requirement that enrollees pay at least 25 percent of the premiumsshould increase price competition among low-cost plans to attract participants.In the lowest-cost plans, the government would pay almost the entire premium. On the downside, participants would pay an ever-increasing share of their premiums\u2014possibly over 40 percent by 2005\u2014if premiums rose as expected.The added cost to enrollees could exceed $700 per worker in 2005 and more inlater years. Currently, large private-sector plans provide better health benefitsfor their employees\u2014although not for their retirees\u2014which might make itharder for the government to attract and retain high-quality workers. In addi-tion, for current retirees and long-time federal workers, the option would cutbenefits that have already been earned. Moreover, the option could strengthenexisting incentives for adverse selection in FEHB plans.212 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 550-10 Base Retiree Health Benefits on Length of Service Savingsa (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 60 60 2002 120 1202003 180 1802004 3,830 3,830 a.

SPENDING CATEGORY: Mandatory RELATED OPTION: 550-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Federal retirees are generally eligible to continue receiving benefits from the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program if they have been partici-pants during their last five years of service and are eligible to receive an immedi-ate annuity. About 80 percent of eligible new retirees elect to receive retireehealth benefits. After age 65, FEHB program benefits are coordinated withMedicare; the program pays amounts not covered by Medicare (but no more thanthe amount it would have paid in the absence of Medicare). Participants and thegovernment share the cost of premiums. The government's share for annuitantsand employees is 72 percent of the weighted average premium of all participatingplans (up to a cap of 75 percent of the total premium). In 1999, the governmentpaid $4.5 billion in premiums for 1.8 million annuitants and their dependentsand survivors. Under this option, federal retiree health benefits would be reduced for those with relatively short federal careers while preserving the right of retirees to par-ticipate in the FEHB program. For new retirees only, the government's share ofthe premium could be cut by 2 percentage points for every year of service under30. For example, the government's contribution would fall to 52 percent of theaverage premium for a retiree with 20 years of service. In 1998, about 55 per-cent of the roughly 60,000 new retirees who continued in the FEHB program hadless than 30 years of service. The average new nonpostal retiree affected by theproposal would pay 48 percent of the premium rather than 28 percent, an annualincrease of $830 in 2001. The estimated savings to the government in manda-tory spending would total $60 million in 2001 and $910 million over five years.Ten-year savings would rise to $3.8 billion. The option might make the government's compensation mix fairer and more efficient by improving the link between service and deferred compensation. Theoption would also help bring federal benefits closer to those available from pri-vate firms. Federal retiree health benefits are significantly more generous thanthose offered by most large private firms, which have been aggressively paringand, in some cases, eliminating retiree health benefits in recent years. A surveyof all U.S. employers found that fewer than half provide medical benefits toretirees. And even with this change, federal retiree health benefits would remaincomparable with those offered by firms that continued to provide retiree benefits. A negative aspect of the option is that it would mean a substantial cut in benefits whose effects would be felt most strongly by the roughly 20 percent ofnew retirees with less than 20 years of service. The option could also encouragesome employees with short service careers to delay retirement, whereas othersmight accelerate retirement plans to avoid the new rules.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 550 213 550-11 Establish New User Fees for Medical Devices Regulated by the FDA Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 27 20 2002 46 402003 38 392004 39 392005 40 40 2001-2005 190 177 2001-2010 410 393 Relative to WIDI 2001 27 20 2002 46 402003 38 392004 39 392005 40 40 2001-2005 190 177 2001-2010 410 393 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from pharmaceutical manufac-turers to help speed up the review of applications for marketing and approval ofnew drugs. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997reauthorized the PDUFA user fee program but did not address user fees formedical devices. The Congress considered but did not pass legislation autho-rizing user fees for medical devices in 1994. The Administration's 2001 budgetincluded a proposal to impose user fees on medical devices as well as on otherproducts regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers must notify the FDA before they market any new medical device, and for certain products, they must obtain approval before marketingthem. Imposing fees of $7,000 for each new medical device requiring pre-market notification, $3,500 for those devices qualifying for abbreviated orspecial notification processes, $60,000 for each new medical device needingpremarket approval, and $7,000 for each application for a supplementalpremarket approval would raise $20 million in 2001 and $393 million duringthe 2001-2010 period. Taken together, those fees would ultimately constituteabout 30 percent of the cost of regulating medical devices. The estimates as-sume that only a few exemptions would be granted for small businesses ordevices with very small markets. Establishing new user fees for medical devices would require new autho- rizing legislation. To generate budgetary savings, that legislation would haveto permit user fee collections to offset other FDA appropriations for salariesand expenses. PDUFA does not permit that offset for prescription drug userfees. Proponents of user fees for medical devices argue that regulatory activi- ties benefit both consumers and industry. The FDA's primary function is toensure public safety by monitoring the quality of pharmaceutical products,medical devices, and food. Firms benefit from the public confidence that re-sults from the FDA's regulation, those proponents maintain, and should there-fore bear a share of the costs of those activities. People who oppose levying new user fees on medical devices might argue that the agency's current oversight of medical devices is excessive and unneces-sary. Rather than adding user fees, those opponents might contend that theFDA could cut costs by scaling back its regulatory requirements. 570 Medicare Budget function 570 comprises spending for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for elderly and eligible disabled people. Medicare consists of two parts, each tied to a trust fund. Hospital Insurance (PartA) reimburses providers for inpatient care that beneficiaries receive in hospitals, as well as care at skillednursing facilities, home health care related to a hospital stay, and hospice services. Supplementary MedicalInsurance (Part B) pays for physicians' services, outpatient services at hospitals, home health care, andother services.

Higher rates are paid to hospitals with t eaching pro- grams to cover their higher costs of caring for Medicare patients. Under theBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, the additional percentage paid toteaching hospitals in 2000 will be approximately 6.5 percent for each 0.1 in- crease in a hospital's ratio of full-time interns and residents to its number ofbeds. Teaching hospitals will receive 6.25 percent more in 2001 and 5.5 per-cent more in 2002 and subsequent years for every 0.1 increase in the resident-to-bed-ratio. (Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, teaching hospitals would have received 6.0 percent more in 2000 and 5.5 percent more in 2001and subsequent years for each 0.1 increase in the ratio.) The Congress enacted the additional payments to teaching hospitals to compensate them for indirect teaching costs\u2014such as the greater number oftests and procedures thought to be prescribed by interns and residents\u2014and tocover higher costs from factors that are not otherwise accounted for in settingthe PPS rates. Such factors might include more severely ill patients, a hospi-tal's location in the inner city, and a more costly mix of staffing and facilities,all of which are associated with large teaching programs. (An alternative ap-proach would base additional payments to teaching hospitals on the enhancedvalue of care in those settings. Such a proposal was recently m ade by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.) The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission has estimated that a 4.1 percent adjustment to Medicare's payments would more closely match theincrease in operating costs associated with teaching. If the teaching adjustmentwas lowered accordingly, outlays would fall by about $5.8 billion from current-law spending over the 2001-2005 period and by about $14.1 billion over the2001-2010 period. This option would better align payments with the actual costs incurred by teaching institutions. Furthermore, since the training that medical residentsreceive will result in a significant increase in their future income and sincehospitals benefit from using residents' labor, it is reasonable for some or all ofa hospital's indirect training costs to be borne by both residents and the hospi-tal. Some of those costs are now passed on in the form of stipends that arelower than the value of the residents' services to the hospital. A lower teachingadjustment would probably lead to even lower stipends, however, as well assmaller residency programs. An additional consideration is that if the teachinghospitals now use some payments to fund such activities as charity care, peoplewithout health insurance could have less access to health services under thisoption.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 217 570-02 Reduce Medicare's Direct Payments for Medical Education Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 800 2002 9002003 9002004 1,0002005 1,000 2001-2005 4,600 2001-2010 10,300 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-01, 570-03, and 570-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Medicare and Graduate Medical Education (Study), September 1995.Medicare's prospective payment system does not include payments to hospitals for the direct costs they incur in providing graduate medical education(GME)\u2014namely, residents' salaries and fringe benefits, teaching costs, andinstitutional overhead. Instead, Medicare makes those payments separately onthe basis of its share of a hospital's 1984 cost per resident indexed for increasesin the level of consumer prices. Medicare's direct GME payments, which arereceived by about one-fifth of all U.S. hospitals, totaled about $2.2 billion for1999. Under the proposed option, hospitals' direct GME payments would bebased on the national average of salaries paid to residents in 1987, updatedannually by the consumer price index for all urban consumers. Reimbursementwould be based on 120 percent of the national average salary. In effect, this option would reduce teaching and overhead payments for residents but continue to pay their salaries and fringe benefits. Unlike the cur-rent system, under which GME payments vary considerably from hospital tohospital, this option would pay every hospital the same amount for the sametype of resident. (Although the Congress took action in 1999 to lessen some ofthe variation among hospitals in payments per resident, considerable differ-ences remain under current law.) The option would also continue the current-law practice of reducing payments for residents who have gone beyond theirinitial residency period. The savings from current-law spending would totalabout $4.6 billion over the 2001-2005 period and about $10.3 billion over the2001-2010 period. The overall reduction in the level of subsidies might be warranted since market incentives appear to be sufficient to encourage a continuing flow of newphysicians. Moreover, since hospitals use resident physicians to care for pa-tients and since residency training helps young physicians earn higher incomesin the future, both hospitals and residents might reasonably contribute more tothose training costs. Residents would contribute more to those costs if hospitalsresponded to the changes in reimbursements by cutting residents' salaries orfringe benefits. If hospitals lowered residents' salaries or benefits, the costs of l onger residencies\u2014in terms of forgone practice income\u2014could exert greater influ-ence on the young physicians' decisions about pursuing a specialty. More resi-dents might choose to begin primary care practice rather than specialize further.That outcome could be negative for the individual resident; by contrast, theCouncil on Graduate Medical Education and other groups believe that a rela-tive increase in the number of primary care practitioners would be desirable.Finally, decreasing GME reimbursement could force some hospitals to reducethe resources they commit to training, possibly jeopardizing the quality of theirmedical education programs.218 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-03 Eliminate Additional Capital-Related Payments for Hospitals with Residency Programs Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 300 2002 3002003 3002004 3002005 400 2001-2005 1,600 2001-2010 3,600 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-01, 570-02, and 570-04Under the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital services, Medicare pays hospitals an amount for each discharge that is intended to compensate thehospital for capital-related costs.

Eliminating those extra payments would save the Medicare program about $0.3 billion in 2001. Five-year savings would equal a bout $1.6 billion, and savings over the 2001-2010 period would be $3.6 billion. In contrast to higher operating costs, which analyses indicate are indeed associated with teaching intensity, a hospital's capital costs per case appear tobe unrelated to intensity. Furthermore, paying teaching hospitals more thannonteaching hospitals for otherwise similar patients may dis courage efficient decisionmaking by hospitals. In addition, Medicare's payment adjustments forteaching intensity may distort the market for residency training by artificiallyincreasing the value (or decreasing the cost) of residents to hospitals. If resi-dents' training raises the costs of patient care for a hospital, arguably the hospi-tal should bear those costs in order to encourage an efficient amount of training.Hospitals are likely to shift such costs to residents in the form of lower stipendsor greater workloads. Residents will engage in such training if they perceivethat their future productivity, as reflected in their future incomes, will be greatenough to outweigh those costs. Eliminating the special capital-related payments would reduce revenues to teaching hospitals at a time w hen those hospitals already f ace pressures to reduce costs to remain competitive in the growing managed care environment.Teaching hospitals would probably have to reduce some services in response tothe decline in their revenues. Those reductions in services could include lessprovision of public goods, such as research or providing medical care to theindigent.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 219 570-04 Convert Medicare Payments for Graduate Medical Education to a Block Grant and Slow Their Rate of Growth Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 200 2002 1002003 2002004 3002005 400 2001-2005 1,100 2001-2010 6,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-01, 570-02, and 570-03 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Medicare and Graduate Medical Education (Study), September 1995.Three types of Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments are tied to the size or intensity of a teaching hospital's residency program: direct gradu-ate medical education payments, the indirect medical education adjustment forinpatient operating costs, and the indirect medical education adjustment forinpatient capital-related costs. Under provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of1997, teaching hospitals have begun to receive GME payments for participantsin Medicare+Choice health plans in addition to the payments that they havetraditionally received for fee-for-service Medicare patients. Several variablesdetermine the total amount of GME payments that a hospital receives, includingthe number and diagnoses of Medicare discharges and numerical factors usedfor annually updating payments for inpatient operating costs and capital-relatedcosts. Because of changes in those variables over time, the CongressionalBudget Office expects GME payments under current law to grow at an averageannual rate of 4.3 percent between 2001 and 2010. This option would replace the current system with a consolidated block grant to fund the special activities of teaching hospitals. Under the currentsystem, a hospital receives GME payments based on regulatory formulas, andtotal Medicare GME spending is the resulting sum of what Medicare owes eachhospital. The option considered here assumes that a switch to the block-grantprogram would occur in 2001 and that the amount of the grant would be basedon spending in 2000, increased for overall inflation. Compared with projectedspending under current law, federal outlays would be reduced by $1.1 billionover the first five years and $6.0 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Establishing a block grant for the three types of GME payments would allow the Congress to better monitor and adjust that funding. Another featureof the option is that Medicare would no longer pay different rates to hospitalsfor inpatient services merely because of differences in the size or presence ofresidency programs. However, because this option would reduce total payments to teaching hospitals below the amounts expected under current law, such hospitals would,on average, receive less revenue than they would otherwise. In response, teach-ing hospitals might reduce the amount or quality of some of their services ortheir provision of some public goods, such as medical research or care for indi-gent people.220 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-05 Eliminate Medicare's Additional Payments to Sole Community Hospitals Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 100 2002 1002003 1002004 1002005 100 2001-2005 500 2001-2010 1,300 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryUnder Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services, special rules apply to providers designated as sole community hospi-tals (SCHs). There are more than 700 SCHs, almost all of which are located inrural areas. Thus, about one-third of rural hospitals qualify for SCH status.Under the current rules, a hospital may be designated as an SCH if it meetsspecific criteria that define a sole provider of inpatient, acute care hospitalservices in a geographic area. In addition, some SCHs have been permitted toretain that status regardless of whether they meet the current sole-providercriteria. Payments to SCHs are generally equal to the highest of three amounts: the regular federal PPS payment that would otherwise apply, an amount basedon the hospital's costs in 1982 updated to the current year, or an amount basedon the hospital's costs in 1987 updated to the current year. In addition, theBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 allows certain SCHs to be paid ac-cording to their fiscal year 1996 costs. Hospitals that choose to receive theregular PPS payment\u2014about half of all SCHs\u2014are eligible to receive higherpayment adjustments for disproportionate share status than are other rural hos-pitals. Hospitals that receive payments based on their updated costs are ineligi-ble for those higher adjustments. If all sole community hospitals received the regular PPS payment rather than their updated costs, total PPS payments would be about $100 million lessin 2001 and $1.3 billion less for the 2001-2010 period. Those savings assumethat SCHs would continue to be eligible for higher disproportionate share ad-justments. A primary objective of the SCH rules is to assist hospitals in locations where closings would threaten access to hospital care, but the federal support isnot particularly well aimed at such essential providers. Moreover, whether anSCH actually receives higher payments under the special rules that permitpayments to be based on a hospital-specific am ount depends on whether its costs in any of the specified base years (1982, 1987, or 1996) were relativelyhigh, not on its current financial condition. If the special payment rules were eliminated, however, revenues of many sole community hospitals would be lower, which might cause financial distressfor some of them. And because many SCHs are the sole providers of hospitalservices in their geographic areas, access to health care or the quality of caremight be reduced in some rural locations.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 221 570-06 Institute a Single Global Payment for Hospitals' and Physicians' Services Provided During an Inpatient Stay Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 100 2002 1002003 1002004 1002005 100 2001-2005 500 2001-2010 1,200 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryHospitals receive payments under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) for the operating costs of providing inpatient services to the program's beneficia-ries. The payments are determined on a per-case basis; payment rates vary withthe patient's diagnosis, which Medicare classifies within a system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), and the char acteristics of the hospital. Those rates take into account reasonable variations in the treatment of patients with a given DRGand offer an incentive to the hospital to reduce the cost of treatment. PPS pay-ments do not cover all services rendered to p atients during the hospital stay. In particular, Med icare pays separ ately for physicians' services provided on an inpatient basis. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has explored the feasi- bility of making a single global payment for high-cost, high-volume inpatientprocedures. That payment would be lower than the separate payments that arenow made for hospitals' operating costs and phys icians' serv ices. In a recent demonstration project involving heart bypass surgery, discounted payment rateswere established through negotiations with participating hospitals in conjunctionwith teams of physicians. With a global payment, hospitals and physicians alikehave an incentive to reduce operating costs while maintaining a satisfactorystandard of care. The institutions hoped to offset the discounts in their Medicarepayments by two means: improvements in efficiency (and their resultant costsavings) and increases (using new marketing efforts) in the volume of heart by-pass patients. During the five-year project, Medicare outlays to the seven hospi-tals participating in the demonstration averaged about 10 percent less than wouldhave been spent otherwise. HCFA has also investigated ways to extend the global payment concept. One approach, similar to the heart bypass demonstration, identified other high-cost, high-volume inpatient procedures that might yield negotiated savings.(They included cataract surgery, coronary angioplasty, heart valve replacement,and joint replacement surgery.) That option might be attractive to hospitals,which could market themselves as \"centers of excellence.\" However, such termi-nology would be controversial because it might be construed as suggesting thatother hospitals did not offer high-quality care. Another disadvantage would bethat only a modest number of institutions and high-cost procedures might be-come eligible for global payments. Expanding the use of global payments wouldyield savings of $100 million in 2001 and $1.2 billion for the 2001-2010 period.222 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-07 Increase and Extend the Reductions in the Medicare PPS Market Basket Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 400 2002 1,0002003 2,5002004 4,1002005 5,900 2001-2005 13,900 2001-2010 Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-08Under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS), payments for hospitals' operating costs for inpatient services provided to beneficiaries are determinedon a per-case basis, according to preset rates that vary with the patient's diag-nosis and the characteristics of the hospital. Payment rates are adjusted eachyear using an update factor that is determined, in part, by the projected increasein the hospital market-basket index (MBI), which reflects increases in hospitalcosts. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced hospital update factors for 1998 through 2002. Specifically, the act froze the basic payment in 1998 andreduced the update by 1.9 percentage points in 1999, 1.8 percentage points in2000, and 1.1 percentage points in 2001 and 2002. Without those reductions,the updates would have been 2.1 percent in 1998, 2.4 percent in 1999, 2.9 percent in 2000, and more than 3 percent each year in 2001 and 2002. (Inseveral states, however, certain hospitals with negative PPS margins received a0.5 percentage-point adjustment in 1998 and a 0.3 percentage-point adjustmentin 1999.) After 2002, the update factor reverts to the full value of the MBI. Ifthe factor was reduced to the MBI minus 1.8 percentage points in 2001 andstayed at that level throughout the 2001-2010 period, total savings during thattime would be $75.8 billion. In 1997, average profit margins for hospitals on Medicare inpatient ser- vices were about 17 percent. Moreover\u2014although the data are not yet com-plete\u2014MedPAC (the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission) estimates thatdespite the payment freeze in 1998 and the large reduction in the update factorfor 1999, average Medicare inpatient profit margins exceeded 15 percent inboth years. Thus, further reductions in update factors could be justified. TheAmerican Hospital Association, however, maintains that high inpatient marginsreflect major efforts by hospitals to cut costs, which cannot continue indefi-nitely. Moreover, almost one-quarter of all hospitals have negative profit mar-gins on Medicare inpatient services, so further reductions in payment updatefactors could cause considerable hardship for those facilities, especially assome hospitals are only now beginning to feel the effects of past payment re-ductions.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 223 570-08 Reduce Medicare's Payments for Hospitals' Inpatient Capital-Related Costs Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 300 2002 3002003 4002004 5002005 500 2001-2005 2,000 2001-2010 4,600 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-07In 1992, Medicare revised its method of paying hospitals for their inpatient capital-related costs by replacing cost-based reimbursement with a prospectivepayment method. Under the prospective system, hospitals receive a predeter-mined amount for each Medicare patient to pay for capital-related costs, whichinclude depreciation, interest, taxes, insurance, and similar expenses for build-ings and fixed and movable equipment. The prospective system applies toabout 5,000 hospitals paid under Medicare's prospective payment system foroperating costs. A fully prospective federal payment rate for capital costs is being phased in over 10 years. During the transition period, payments are determined by acomplicated method based on a number of factors, including f ederal and hospital-specific payment rates. The federal and hospital-specific rates areincreased annually. By 2001, all hospitals will receive the federal rate, ad- justed for the hospital's mix of patients and certain other characteristics. Analyses conducted by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) suggest that the initial federal and hospital-specific rates were toohigh. The 1992 rates were based on actual 1989 and 1990 data (for the federalrate and hospital-specific rates, respectively) projected to 1992, but more recentdata indicate that the rate of growth of capital costs between 1989 and 1992was slower than expected. Moreover, the initial level of capital costs per casein 1989 was probably higher than would be optimal in an efficient market be-cause of incentives provided by the Medicare payments. Factors such aschanges in capital prices, the mix of patients treated by hospitals, and the \"in-tensity\" of hospital services contributed to the overestimate. On the basis ofHCFA's analysis, the estimated 1992 capital costs would have been reduced byabout 22 percent if those factors had been taken into account. The federal rate was reduced by 7.4 percent in the Omnibus Budget Rec- onciliation Act of 1993 in a provision that expired in 1996. The BalancedBudget Act of 1997 reduced the federal rate by 17.8 percent for capital pay-ments made to hospitals for patient discharges occurring in 1998 through 2002.A small part of that reduction, 2.1 percent, will be restored beginning in 2003.A further reduction of 5 percent (bringing the total reduction in capital pay-ments to about the level estimated by HCFA) would yield savings of $300million in 2001 and $4.6 billion for the 2001-2010 period. Most hospitals would probably be able to adjust to the reductions by lowering their capital costs or partially covering them with other sources ofrevenue, because Medicare's payments for capital costs are a small share ofhospitals' revenues\u2014less than 5 percent of their total revenues from all sources.Hospitals that are in poor financial condition, however, might have difficultyabsorbing the reductions. As a result, the quality of the care they offer mightdecline, and they might provide fewer services to people without insurance.224 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-09 Eliminate Medicare's Payments to Hospitals for Enrollees' Bad Debts Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 500 2002 6002003 6002004 7002005 700 2001-2005 3,100 2001-2010 7,400 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-10Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for certain deductible and coinsurance amounts when they receive hospital services. In calendar year 2000, the de-ductible amount is $766 per spell of illness, and beneficiaries must makecoinsurance payments for inpatient care in excess of 60 days and for servicesfurnished on an outpatient basis. Before enactment of the Balanced Budget Actof 1997 (BBA), if the hospital made a reasonable effort to collect the cost-sharing amounts from patients, Medicare would reimburse it for any remainingunpaid amounts. The BBA phased in a reduction in those bad-debt payments,cutting them to 55 percent of the amount that hospitals did not collect frombeneficiaries. Eliminating all reimbursement for enrollees' bad debts wouldreduce Medicare's payments by $500 million in 2001 and $7.4 billion over the2001-2010 period. This option would give hospitals incentives to improve their collection efforts, but they would not be able to collect all of the money that theirMedicare patients owed. In particular, low-income enrollees who were notcovered by Medicaid might not be able to pay their hospital bills. As a result,this option would reduce revenues the most for those hospitals that were mostlikely to serve low-income Medicare patients. Moreover, a drop in theirMedicare payments might lead some hospitals to cut back on the quality of theirservices or the amount of uncompensated care that they provide, or to raise therates that they charge for the care of other patients.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 225 570-10 Eliminate Medicare's Payments to Nonhospital Providers for Enrollees' Bad Debts Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 600 2002 8002003 8002004 9002005 1,000 2001-2005 4,100 2001-2010 10,300 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-09The Medicare program pays a variety of providers, in addition to hospitals, for the bad debts of their Medicare patients. Providers incur such debts whenMedicare patients do not pay the cost-sharing amounts that the program re-quires. Patients in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), for example, must pay acoinsurance amount of $97 per day in calendar year 2000 for care receivedfrom the 21st through the 100th day of a benefit period (spell of illness). (Abenefit period begins with the day the beneficiary is admitted to the hospitaland ends after the patient has been out of the hospital or SNF for 60 straightdays, or if the beneficiary remains in the SNF after 60 straight days withoutreceiving skilled nursing care.) Providers that are eligible for bad-debt pay-ments include SNFs, rural health clinics, and comprehensive outpatient rehabil-itation facilities. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced Medicare's pay-ments for hospitals' bad debts but did not affect bad-debt payments for non-hospital providers. This option would eliminate such payments for nonhospitalproviders, saving $600 million in 2001 and $10.3 billion over the 2001-2010period. As with hospitals, eliminating bad-debt payments would increase provid- ers' incentives to improve their collection efforts, but some bad debts wouldremain. The policy could, therefore, cause financial problems for providers thatserve a large number of low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Faced with unpaidbad debts, such providers might reduce the quality of their care or the amountof uncompensated care that they provide.226 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-11 Reduce Medicare Payments for Currently Covered Prescription Drugs Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 200 2002 4402003 5202004 6002005 700 2001-2005 2,460 2001-2010 7,230 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryMedicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) paid providers about $4 billion in 1999 for certain outpatient drugs. Prescription drugs are covered underPart B when they must be administered under a physician's supervision, as is thecase with many drugs requiring injection or infusion. Medicare also pays fordrugs that must be delivered by durable medical equipment covered under theprogram. In addition, some oral chemotherapy and antinausea drugs for cancerpatients as well as immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant recipients arecovered, as are certain vaccines. Medicare payments for covered prescription drugs have varied over time and across settings of care. Since 1997, the amount Medicare has allowed as areasonable charge for drugs delivered in physicians' offices and at home has beenset at 95 percent of the average wholesale price, or AWP, which is a publishedlist price established by the manufacturer. When several manufacturers make aproduct, the allowed charge is 95 percent of the median AWP among genericsuppliers or the lowest brand-name AWP when that price is less than the mediangeneric AWP. Medicare reimbursement for drugs delivered in hospital outpa-tient facilities is currently made on a cost basis, but under the Balanced BudgetAct of 1997, Medicare is expected to implement a prospective payment systemfor hospital outpatient services beginning in July 2000. Most drugs will beexempted from the prospective payment system until at least 2002, however, andfor them, the payment will be 95 percent of the AWP. Because the AWP is a list price and not the actual price providers pay for drugs, pegging Medicare's payment to the AWP has meant that providers andsuppliers could profit from administering or dispensing Medicare-covered drugs.The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services reportedthat actual wholesale drug prices available to physicians were about 30 percentless than the AWP in 1997. This option would limit Medicare's reimbursementsfor prescription drugs by decreasing the allowed charge from 95 percent to 85percent of the AWP and by limiting increases in the allowed charge for covereddrugs to changes in the rate of inflation. (Changes in the allowed charge wouldtrack the consumer price index for all urban consumers, excluding food andenergy.) As a result, Medicare Part B outlays would decrease by $7.2 billionbetween 2001 and 2010. One disadvantage of the option is that it would encourage manufacturers to introduce new drugs at AWPs that were higher than they would otherwise be inorder to restore the profit margins available to physicians and other suppliers.Physicians would prescribe newly introduced drugs more quickly as a result.Therefore, the option's effectiveness in limiting Part B spending growth wouldgradually erode as new drugs replaced older ones in the mix of covered drugs.Critics of the option also claim that the profit margins physicians now obtainwhen they administer drugs to Medicare patients subsidize the cost of drug ad-ministration, which is not now adequately reimbursed. Savings would be re-duced and patient care might suffer if patients were diverted from physicians'offices to hospital outpatient settings, where Medicare reimbursements arehigher. CBO's estimate includes a modest reduction in savings to account forthat possibility.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 227 570-12 Index Medicare's Deductible for SMI Services Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 100 2002 2902003 5102004 7202005 950 2001-2005 2,570 2001-2010 OPTIONS : 570-13-A, 570-13-B, 570-14, and 570-15Medicare offers insurance coverage for physicians' and hospital outpatient services through the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program. Theprogram has a number of cost-sharing requirements. One way to achieve fed-eral savings in SMI is to increase the deductible\u2014that is, the amount that en-rollees must pay for services each year before the government shares responsi-bility. The deductible is now $100 a year and has been increased only threetimes since Medicare began in 1966, when it was set at $50. In relation toaverage annual per capita charges under the SMI program, the deductible hasfallen from 45 percent in 1967 to about 3 percent (projected) for 2000. Increasing the SMI deductible for 2001 and later years according to the growth in SMI charges per enrollee would save $100 million in 2001, $2.6billion over the five-year period, and $11.3 billion over the 10-year period. In2001, the deductible would be $108. An increase in the amount of the deductible would enhance the economic incentives for prudent consumption of medical care while spreading the impactof an increase in cost sharing among most enrollees. No enrollee's out-of-pocket costs would rise by more than $8 in 2001. However, the additional out-of-pocket costs under this option might dis- courage some low-income enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid fromseeking needed care. In addition, costs to states would increase because theirMedicaid programs pay the deductibles for Medicare enrollees who also re-ceive benefits under Medicaid.228 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-13-A Simplify and Limit Medicare's Cost-Sharing Requirements Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 7702004 9802005 1,260 2001-2005 3,900 OPTIONS : 570-13-B and 570-15 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.Medicare's cost-sharing requirements in its fee-for-service sector are varied and difficult for beneficiaries to understand. Moreover, in contrast to most privateinsurance plans, Medicare places no limit on the cost-sharing expenses forwhich enrollees may be liable. As a result, most fee-for-service enrollees seeksupplementary coverage (either through their employers or by purchasing indi-vidual medigap plans) to protect them from the potentially catastrophic ex-penses they might be left with under Medicare. Those enrollees with thenearly first-dollar coverage that medigap plans provide no longer have financialincentives to use medical services prudently. Consequently, Medicare's costsare higher than they would be if there were no medigap supplements. Medicare could simplify and limit cost-sharing requirements in the fee- for-service sector while also reducing federal costs. For example, the currentcomplicated mix of cost-sharing requirements could be replaced with a singledeductible, a uniform coinsurance rate of 20 percent for am ounts above the deductible, and a cap on each beneficiary's total cost-sharing expenses\u2014whether they arose from Part A or Part B of the Medicare program. If thoseprovisions were in place beginning in January 2001 with a deductible of $800and a cap on total cost sharing of $2,000, federal savings would be $0.3 billionfor 2001, $3.9 billion over five years, and $14.7 billion over 10 years. Thoseestimates assume that both the deductible and the cap would be indexed togrowth in per capita benefits paid by Medicare. For three reasons, such changes in Medicare's cost-sharing requirements would increase the incentives for enrollees to use medical services prudently.First, because about 40 percent of the medigap plans pur chased do not now cover the deductible, more of the services used by those policyholders would beexempt from medigap coverage under Medicare's higher deductible. Second,over time, fewer enrollees would purchase medigap plans because their cost-sharing expenses would be capped under Medicare. Third, the uniform coinsur-ance rate on all services would encourage enrollees without supplementarycoverage to consider relative costs appropriately when choosing among alterna-tive treatments. Although this option would generally reduce out-of-pocket costs for en- rollees who had serious illnesses or were hospitalized during the year, it wouldincrease out-of-pocket costs for most enrollees. On average, enrollees' cost-sharing expenses under Medicare would increase by about $45 a year in 2001.Expenses would fall for about 10 percent of enrollees, rise for about 70 percent,and be unchanged for all others. The option would also introduce cost-sharingrequirements for services\u2014such as home health care\u2014that are not now subjectto them, increasing administrative costs for the affected providers.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 229 570-13-B Restrict Medigap Coverage Outlay Savings (Millions of 570-12, 570-13-A, 570-15, and 570-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.Savings from option 570-13-A could be substantially increased by restricting or prohibiting medigap coverage in addition to changing Medicare's cost-sharingprovisions. Alternatively, some or all of the additional savings from restrictingmedigap coverage could be used to improve Medicare's coverage by reducingthe deductible or cap. If, for example, medigap plans were prohibited from covering any part of Medicare's new deductible (as discussed in option 570-13-A), savings would be$23.1 billion over five years and $63.5 b illion over 10 years. By raising Medicare's deductible and prohibiting medigap plans from covering it, theincentives for more prudent use of health care services would be appreciablystrengthened for enrollees who now have medigap plans. Those incentiveswould be still greater if medigap coverage was prohibited altogether. However,despite Medicare's new copayment cap, which would protect enrollees againstvery large cost-sharing expenses, some enrollees would object to any policythat denied them access to first-dollar coverage.230 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-14 Collect Deductible and Coinsurance Amounts on Clinical Laboratory Services Under Medicare Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 490 2002 1,0002003 1,1202004 1,2102005 1,320 2001-2005 5,140 2001-2010 13,880 Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-12 and 570-15Medicare currently pays 100 percent of the approved fee for clinical laboratory services provided to enrollees. Medicare's payment is set by a fee schedule,and providers must accept that fee as full payment for the service. For mostother services provided under Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance(SMI) program, beneficiaries are subject to both a deductible and a coinsurancerate of 20 percent. Imposing the SMI program's usual deductible and coinsurance require- ments on laboratory services would yield appreciable savings. If this policywas in place beginning on January 1, 2001, federal savings would be $490 million in 2001, $5.1 billion over five years, and $13.9 billion over 10 years. In addition to reducing Medicare's costs, this option would make cost- sharing requirements under the SMI program more uniform and therefore easierto understand. Moreover, enrollees might be somewhat less likely to undergolaboratory tests with little expected benefit if they paid part of those costs. However, enrollees' use of laboratory services would probably not be substantially affected because decisions about what tests are appropriate aregenerally left to physicians, whose judgments do not appear to depend on en-rollees' cost-sharing liabilities. Hence, the Congressional B udget Office as- sumes that a small part of the expected savings under this option would stemfrom more prudent use of laboratory services, but the greater part would reflectthe transfer to enrollees of costs now borne by Medicare. Billing costs forsome providers, such as independent laboratories, would be higher under theoption because they would have to bill both Medicare and enrollees to collecttheir full fees. (Currently, they have no need to bill enrollees directly for clini-cal laboratory services.) In addition, states' Medicaid costs would increase forenrollees who also received Medicaid benefits.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 231 570-15 Impose a Copayment Requirement on Home Health Visits Under Medicare Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) With $5 Copay- mentWith $10 : 570-12, 570-13-A, 570-13-B, and 570-14The use of home health services and the resulting costs are growing rapidly under Medicare.

If the copayment was $10, five-year savings would be $10.9 billion and 10-yearsavings would be $31.1 billion. Those estimates assume that the copaymentwould be indexed to the consumer price index after 2001. This option would reduce Medicare's costs for home health care not only by shifting a small part of the cost per visit to users but also by reducing en-rollees' use of the service\u2014at least among the 15 percent of fee-for-serviceenrollees with no supplementary coverage for their cost-sharing expenses.However, little or no drop in use would be expected among the 85 percent ofenrollees who have either Medicaid, medigap, or employment-sponsored sup-plementary coverage. Further, the option would increase private insurancepremiums for the 35 percent of enrollees with medigap supplements, and it would increase Medicaid program costs on behalf of the 15 percent of enrolleeswho also receive Medicaid benefits. Moreover, it would increase the risk ofvery large out-of-pocket costs for those with no supplementary coverage.232 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-16 Prohibit First-Dollar Coverage Under Medigap Policies Outlay Savings (Millions RELATED OPTION : 570-13-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.About 35 percent of Medicare's fee-for-service enrollees purchase individual supplementary private insurance (medigap coverage) that covers all or most ofthe cost sharing that the Medicare program requires. On average, medigappolicyholders use at least 25 percent more services than they would if they didnot have first-dollar coverage. However, the federal government throughMedicare and not medigap insurers pays most of the costs of those additionalservices. Federal costs for Medicare could be reduced if medigap plans were pro- hibited from offering first-dollar coverage for Medicare's cost-sharing require-ments. If, for example, medigap plans were barred from paying any portion ofthe first $1,500 of an enrollee's cost-sharing liabilities for calendar year 2001,use of medical services by medigap policyholders would fall and federal sav-ings in 2001 would total $3.8 billion. Assuming that the medigap limit waslinked to growth in the average value of Medicare's costs for later years, sav-ings over the 2001-2005 period would total $37.8 billion. Over 10 years, sav-ings would total $98.0 billion. Only enrollees who have medigap policies would be directly affected by this option, and most of them would be financially better off under it. Becausetheir medigap premiums would decrease more than their out-of-pocket liabili-ties would increase, most medigap enrollees would have lower yearly expensesunder this approach. Indirectly, all enrollees might be better off because Medi-care's premiums would be lower than under current law. Medigap policyholders, however, would have to assume a higher level of financial risk for Medicare-covered services than they do now. Because theymight feel more uncertain about their expenses, some policyholders might ob-ject to eliminating their option to purchase first-dollar coverage, even if in mostyears they would be financially better off. Moreover, in any given year, abouta quarter of people with medigap policies would actually incur higher expensesunder this option, and those with expensive chronic conditions might be worseoff year after year. Finally, the decrease in use of services by medigap policy-holders that would generate federal savings under this option might not belimited to unnecessary care, so the health of some policyholders might be ad-versely affected.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 233 570-17 Increase the Premium for SMI Services Under Medicare to 30 Percent of Program Costs Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 OPTION : 570-18Benefits under Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program are partially funded by monthly premiums paid by enrollees, with the remainderfunded by general revenues. Although the SMI premium was initially intendedto cover 50 percent of the cost of benefits, premium receipts between 1975 and1983 covered a declining share of SMI costs\u2014falling from 50 percent to lessthan 25 percent. That drop occurred because premium increases were limitedby the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits (which isbased on the consumer price index) but the per capita cost of the SMI programrose faster. Since 1984, premiums have been set to cover about 25 percent ofaverage benefits for an aged enrollee, a provision that was made permanent inthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997. If the SMI premium was set to cover 30 percent of costs for 2001 and all years thereafter, outlay savings would be $2.9 billion in 2001, $23.3 billionover five years, and $60.9 billion over 10 years. The premium for 2001 wouldbe $59.10 a month instead of $49.30. Those estimates assume a continuationof the current hold-harmless provision, which ensures that no enrollee's monthlySocial Security benefit will fall as a result of the Social Security COLA (whichis based on the whole benefit) being smaller than the SMI premium increase. Most SMI enrollees would pay a little more under this option, in contrast to proposals\u2014such as increasing cost-sharing requirements\u2014that could sub-stantially raise the out-of-pocket costs of those who become seriously ill. Thisoption need not affect enrollees with income below 120 percent of the federalpoverty threshold because all of them are eligible to have Medicaid pay theirMedicare premiums. (Some people who are eligible for Medicaid do not applyfor benefits, however.) Low-income enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid could find the increased premium burdensome. A few might drop SMI coverage and either dowithout care or turn to sources of free or reduced-cost care, which could in-crease demands on local governments. In addition, states' expenditures wouldrise because states would pay part of the higher premium costs for thoseMedicare enrollees who also receive Medicaid benefits.234 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-18 Tie the Premium for SMI Services Under Medicare to Enrollees' Income Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 1,8902004 2,1902005 2,530 2001-2005 8,760 : 570-17 and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS: The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Staff Working Paper), October 1988. Subsidies Under Medicare and the Potential for Disenrollment Undera Voluntary Catastrophic Program (Study), September 1989.Instead of increasing the basic premium to 30 percent of costs for all enrollees in the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program (see option 570-17),this option would collect relatively more from higher-income people. For ex-ample, people with modified adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 andcouples with income lower than $75,000 would pay only the basic premium, setat 25 percent of SMI costs per aged enrollee. Premiums would rise progres-sively for higher-income enrollees, however. The maximum total premiumwould be set to cover 50 percent of costs for people with income exceeding$100,000 and for c ouples with income exceeding $150,000. The income- related premiums would have to be collected through the income tax system sothat rates could be aligned with income. Current premiums are deducted auto-matically from Social Security checks for most enrollees. If this option was in place in calendar year 2001, savings would total $480 million in fiscal year 2001, $8.8 billion over five years, and $28.2 billionover 10 years. Those estimates assume that the current hold-harmless provi-sions would continue only for people subject to the basic 25 percent premium.(The hold-harmless provisions ensure that no enrollee's Social Security checkwill decrease because an increase in the SMI premium exceeds the cost-of-living adjustment.) Most SMI enrollees would be unaffected by tying a portion of the pro- gram's premium to income. Roughly 86 percent of enrollees would f ace the basic 25 percent premium, about 3 percent would pay the maximum premium,and 11 percent would pay a premium somewhere in between. Enrollees subject to the income-related premium would pay substantially more, however. The maximum monthly premium for 2001 would be $98.60instead of the $49.30 premium projected under current law. That increasemight lead some enrollees to drop out, although it is estimated that fewer than0.5 percent would do so. Those enrollees with retirement health plans that donot require Medicare enrollment (mainly, retired government employees) wouldbe most likely to drop out. Some healthy enrollees who have no other source ofhealth insurance might do so as well, if they were not averse to the risk thatthey might incur large health care costs.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 570 235 570-19-A Increase Medicare's Age of Eligibility to Match Social Security's Normal Retirement Age Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 2002 02003 3902004 1,0602005 1,790 2001-2005 3,240 OPTIONS : 570-19-B and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (Report), May 1998, Chapter 4.Under current law, the normal retirement age (NRA) for Social Security will gradually increase from 65 to 67 in the first quarter of the next century. How-ever, eligibility for Medicare based on age will remain at 65. Because the twoprograms affect the same population and because eligibility is based on thesame work history, some people have argued that the age requirements shouldbe the same. If the age at which a person became eligible for Medicare was raised in step with increases in the NRA for Social Security, the first c ohort to be af- fected would be people who turned 65 in 2003\u2014for that group, eligibility forMedicare would be delayed by two months. The age of eligib ility would be increased by an additional two months each year through 2008 and then remainat 66 for 12 years. Beginning in 2020, the age of eligibility would again in-crease by two months a year until it reached 67 in 2025. Under that option,federal budget savings would total $390 million in 2003, $3.2 billion through2005, and $29.5 billion through 2010. Reduced spending for Medicare wouldbe partially offset by increased spending under Medicaid, the Federal Employ-ees Health Benefits program, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program ofthe Uniformed Services (reflected in the savings estimates). In addition, off-budget outlays for Social Security would fall by $8.5 billion over the 10-yearperiod because some people who were affected would delay retirement. (Thatdrop in costs is not reflected in the estimates.) The same reasons that have been used to justify increasing the NRA for Social Security apply to this option as well. Life expectancy has increasedsubstantially since Social Security and Medicare began, and a majority ofworkers now live well beyond the age of eligibility. When Social Security wasestablished in 1935, average life expectancy at birth was less than 65 years;now average life expectancy is greater than 75 years. Unless changes are madein those programs, longer expected lifetimes, together with the population bulgeof the baby-boom generation, will increase costs enormously under SocialSecurity and Medicare after 2010. Only three general options for change areavailable: reduce the number of people eligible for benefits, reduce benefits pereligible person, or increase taxes. As a practical matter, it is likely that allthree options will be called into play. However, about 70 percent of Social Security beneficiaries retire before the normal retirement age\u2014generally at Social Security's early retirement ageof 62, which entitles them to benefits at a reduced level. Increasing Medicare'sage of eligibility would also raise the number of years during which early re-tirees would be at risk of having no health insurance\u2014just when their need forhealth care would be expected to increase significantly and their access to pri-vate individual insurance would be limited.236 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 570-19-B Permit Early Buy-In to Medicare and Increase the Normal Age of Eligibility Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 -30 2002 -3902003 -602004 5402005 1,210 2001-2005 1,270 OPTIONS : 570-19-A and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for FiscalYear 1999 (Report), March 1998, Appendix B. Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (Report), May 1998, Chapter 4.One way to alleviate the problem that early retirees may have in continuing health insurance coverage until they are eligible for Medicare would be to intro-duce an early age of eligibility (62) for nondisabled retirees. (Disabled peopleare already eligible for Medicare regardless of their age.) That change wouldmake the conditions for age-based eligibility under Medicare wholly consistentwith those for Social Security. Allowing people to \"buy in\" to Medicare at age 62 beginning in January 2001, together with the gradual move to a later normal age of eligib ility (67) described in option 570-19-A, would reduce federal costs by $1.3 billion overthe 2001-2005 period and by $23.8 billion through 2010. Social Security costswould increase in the early years when only the buy-in was in place, but (off-budget) savings would occur after 2004 as delays in retirement due to the in-crease in the eligibility age for Medicare more than offset earlier retirementamong those taking advantage of the buy-in option. Those estimates assume thatpeople who used the early buy-in option would pay an actuarially fair premiumfor their age group during the buy-in years. The estimates also assume that oncebuy-in participants reached the normal age of eligibility, they would pay a pre-mium surcharge to compensate for any excess costs incurred during their buy-inyears. (Buy-in participants are likely to be more costly to Medicare than theaverage person in their age group.)600 Income Security Budget function 600 covers federal income-security programs that provide cash or in-kind benefits to individuals. Some of those benefits (such as food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, TemporaryAssistance for Needy Families, and the earned income tax credit) are means-tested, whereas others (such asunemployment compensation and Civil Service Retirement and Disability payments) do not depend on aperson's income or assets. CBO estimates that in 2000, federal outlays under function 600 will total $248.9billion, including $42.2 billion in discretionary outlays. Early in the past decade, discretionary spending infunction 600 grew significantly; since then, annual growth has been much slower.

To obtain assistance, such workers must petitionthe Secretary of Labor for certification and then meet other eligibility require-ments. Cash benefits are available to certified workers receiving training butonly after their unemployment insurance benefits are exhausted. Ending the TAA program would reduce federal outlays by about $150 million in 2001 and by $3.2 b illion during the 2001-2010 period. Affected workers could apply for benefits under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998(WIA), which authorizes a broad range of employment and training services fordisplaced workers regardless of the cause of their job loss. (Because fundingfor WIA is limited, however, TAA cash benefits alone could be eliminated, andthe remaining TAA funds for training and related services could be shifted toWIA. Doing so would reduce the total savings by about one-quarter during the10-year period.) The rationale for this option is to secure under federal programs more equivalent treatment of workers who are permanently displaced as a result ofchanging economic conditions. Since WIA provides cash benefits only underlimited circumstances, workers who lose jobs because of foreign competitionare now treated more generously than workers who are displaced for otherreasons. Eliminating TAA cash benefits would, however, cause economic hardship for some of the long-term unemployed who would have received them. In addi-tion, TAA now compensates some of the workers adversely affected by changesin trade policy. Some people argue, therefore, that eliminating TAA benefitscould lessen political support for free trade, which benefits the overall econ-omy.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 239 600-02 End the Expansion of Programs for Building New Housing Units for Elderly and Disabled People Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 811 0 2002 811 102003 811 1152004 811 8,110 Relative SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-11Since the early 1980s, federal activities to provide rental subsidies for low- income people have shifted sharply from constructing low-income housing tousing less costly existing housing subsidized with vouchers and certificates.Two construction programs under which new commitments are still being madeare the Section 202 and Section 811 programs for elderly and disabled people,respectively. For 2000, $811 million was appropriated to construct up to 9,400new units and subsidize their operating costs. (The appropriation allows asmuch as $50 million of those funds to be used for vouchers for disabled peo-ple.) Eliminating funding for additional new units under those programs would reduce outlays by $4.7 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Initially, savings inoutlays would be substantially smaller than savings in budget authority becauseof the long lags involved in building new projects and thus in spending autho-rized funds. Proponents of this option see little need to subsidize any new construction. The overwhelming housing problem today, they argue, is not a shortage ofrental units but the inability of low-income households to afford those thatexist. For example, average overall annual vacancy rates have consistentlyexceeded 7 percent since 1986. In any event, if elderly and disabled peopleneed more housing assistance, it could be provided less expensively throughvouchers or certificates. Opponents of the option argue that national statistics on the supply of rental units mask local shortages of certain types of units. In particular, manyhouseholds with an elderly or disabled person need housing that can providespecial social and physical services that are not generally available. Peoplewho support subsidized construction of units for low-income elderly and dis-abled households also maintain that the high cost of pr oducing such units re- quires the certainty of a guaranteed stream of income that only project-basedsubsidies can provide.240 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-03 Increase Payments by Tenants in Federally Assisted Housing Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 330 170 lower-income renters who receive federal rental assistance are aided through various Section 8 programs or the public housing program, all of whichare administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD). Those programs usually pay the difference between 30 percent of ahousehold's income after certain adjustments and either the actual cost of thedwelling or a payment standard. In 1999, the average federal expenditure perassisted household for all of HUD's rental housing programs combined wasroughly $5,000. That amount includes both housing subsidies and fees paid toadministering agencies. This option would increase tenants' rent contributions over a five-year period from 30 percent to 35 percent of their adjusted income. Budgetary sav-ings would total $15.3 billion over the 2001-2010 period, including $11.4 bil-lion for Section 8 programs and $4.0 billion for public housing. (Those esti-mates are based on the assumption that the Congress will provide budget au-thority to extend the life of all commitments for housing aid that are due toexpire during the 2001-2010 period.) To diminish or eliminate the impact ofthis change on assisted tenants, state governments\u2014which currently contributeno funds toward the federal rental assistance programs\u2014could be encouragedto make up some or all of the decreased federal support. One rationale for directly involving states in housing assistance is that those programs generate substantial local benefits, such as improved quality ofthe housing stock. If all states paid 5 percent of the adjusted income of thosetenants receiving assistance, housing costs for assisted families would not rise.Moreover, since eligibility for housing aid is determined by each area's medianincome, tying states' contributions to renters' incomes would ensure that lower-income states would pay less per assisted family than would higher-incomestates. Finally, if a state chose not to participate and consequently rent pay-ments by its households increased to 35 percent of adjusted income, those out-of-pocket costs would still be well below the nearly 50 percent of income paidby the typical unassisted renter who is eligible for assistance. Because not all states might make up the reduction in federal assistance, housing costs could increase for some current recipients of aid, who generallyhave very low incomes. This option could also cause some higher-incomerenters in assisted housing projects to move to unassisted housing b ecause it might now cost less to rent. As those tenants were replaced by new ones withlower income, the concentration of families with very low income in thoseprojects would increase. In turn, the savings from this option could decreasesomewhat.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 241 600-04 Reduce Rent Subsidies to Certain One-Person Households Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 35 20 2002 70 552003 105 852004 135 1202005 170 155 2001-2005 510 430 2001-2010 1,805 1,665 Relative to WIDI 2001 35 20 2002 70 552003 105 852004 135 1202005 170 155 2001-2005 510 430 2001-2010 1,805 1,665 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryGenerally, recipients of federal housing aid live in housing units that are specif- ically designated for use by federally assisted tenants, or they rent units of theirown choosing in the private rental market. Support for that second type of aidcomes in the form of Section 8 certificates and vouchers, which generally re-duce what recipients spend for housing to 30 percent of their income. Startingin 2000, the certificate and voucher programs will be combined into one pro-gram that will pay the difference between 30 percent of a tenant's income andthe lesser of the tenant's actual housing cost or a payment standard determinedby local rental levels. The payment standard and the amount of the federal subsidy both vary according to the type of unit in which the tenant resides. One-person house-holds may generally reside in apartments with up to one bedroom, whereaslarger households may reside in larger units. Linking the rent subsidy for anewly assisted one-person household (or a currently assisted household thatmoves to another housing unit) to the cost of an efficiency apartment rather thana one-bedroom apartment would save $20 million in federal outlays in 2001and nearly $1.7 billion over the 2001-2010 period. An argument in favor of this option is that an efficiency unit would pro- vide adequate living space for a person who lived alone. An argument againstthe option is that individuals in some areas might have difficulty finding suit-able housing under this new rule and as a result might have to spend more than30 percent of their income to pay for available housing.242 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-05 Stop Expansion of the Number of Rental Assistance Commitments Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 345 5 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-11Each year between 1975 and 1995, and again in 1999 and 2000, the Congress expanded the stock of Section 8 certificates and vouchers to increase the num-ber of low-income renters who receive housing aid. Those forms of housingassistance provide subsidies that allow recipients to live in private housing oftheir own choosing, provided the units meet certain standards. At the end of 1999, a total of about 1.6 million commitments for rental assistance were out-standing in both programs, at a total cost of about $8.1 billion in that year. For2000, the C ongress authorized $347 million to fund an additional 60,000 vouchers, and the Congressional Budget Office's baseline assumes that thisamount of funding for new units will also be appropriated for each year in thefuture. Stopping expansion of the number of rental assistance commitments would reduce federal outlays by $14.9 billion over the 2001-2010 period.(That estimate is based on the additional assumption that the Congress willprovide budget authority to extend the life of all vouchers and certificates thatare due to expire over the 2001-2010 period.) An argument in favor of this option is that expanding rental assistance programs is inappropriate in light of the cutbacks that have occurred in otherareas of federal spending. Furthermore, existing commitments will continue toassist many new eligible households each year because of turnover amongassisted renters. In addition, no current recipients would lose their housingassistance as a result of this option. An argument against the option is that less than one-third of eligible rent- ers actually receive housing assistance. If the number of commitments wasfrozen, the proportion of eligible renters receiving aid would fall because ofcontinued growth in the number of eligible households. As a result, the numberof eligible households with one or more housing problems\u2014such as paying arelatively large share of income for rent or living in a physically inadequate orcrowded dwelling\u2014would probably increase.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 243 600-06 Reduce Funding for Employment and Training in the Food Stamp Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 140 25 2002 85 352003 90 452004 90 502005 100 70 2001-2005 505 225 2001-2010 1,045 750 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-07The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) established a new work and training requirement for certain foodstamp recipients. The act limited food stamp eligibility to a maximum of threemonths in any 36-month period for adults not engaged in work or job trainingwho are able-bodied, are between the ages of 18 and 50, and have no dependentchildren. Under PRWORA, the requirement applies unless the Secretary ofAgriculture waives it for a locale because of a high level of unemployment orinsufficient job opportunities. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided certain exemptions from the PRWORA work/training requirement as well as $600 million to fundnew work/training program slots. The Agricultural Research, Extension, andEducation Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185) reduced work/training funds by$100 million in 1999 and $45 million in 2000. This option would eliminate the remaining funds for work/training slots under the BBA. It would also provide additional savings in the Food Stampprogram from not paying benefits to the people who would have occupied thecanceled slots. In total, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that theoption would reduce outlays by $25 million in 2001 and about $750 million forthe 2001-2010 period. An argument for eliminating the remaining work/training funds provided under the BBA is that states have not been using all of the funds allotted tothem. States receive basic federal funding for employment and training of foodstamp recipients under the Food Stamps Act of 1985, and those funds can beused for able-bodied adults without dependent children. People facing thework/training requirement under PRWORA can also apply to other programsthat operate independently of the Food Stamp program. States with economi-cally distressed areas, which might have fewer alternative work/training oppor-tunities than more prosperous locales, can also apply for waivers from thePRWORA requirement. An argument against this option is that the unspent funds are not necessar- ily evidence of a lack of need. States have had little time to develop the work/training programs that the BBA authorizes. Such programs must be targetedprimarily at able-bodied adults without dependent children and may not simplysubstitute for state-funded programs. To ensure that BBA funds are spent onnew work/training efforts, the act requires states to maintain their 1996 statespending levels for work/training programs in order to collect the BBA funds.Another argument for maintaining the funds available under the BBA is thatthey offer some flexibility because they do not have to be spent in a particularfiscal year. The funds may be carried over and reallocated by the Secretary ofAgriculture among the states on the basis of year-to-year changes in the distri-bution of covered individuals.244 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-07 Reduce the Exemptions from Employment and Training Requirements for Food Stamp Recipients Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 30 30 2002 30 302003 30 302004 30 302005 35 35 2001-2005 155 155 2001-2010 340 340 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-06The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is intended to encourage people to work or pursue job training.Thus, the act restricts food stamp eligibility to a maximum of three months inany 36-month period for able-bodied adults not engaged in work or trainingwho are 18 to 50 years of age and have no dependent children\u2014unless theSecretary of Agriculture has waived the work/training requirement for theirlocale. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), however, states mayexempt from the requirement up to 15 percent of such able-bodied food stamprecipients. This option would eliminate the 15 percent exemption to the PRWORA work/training requirement, which the Congressional Budget Office estimateswould reduce outlays by $30 million in 2001 and $340 million for the 2001- 2010 period. The BBA exemption allows states to use different food stamp eligibility rules for different childless adults. Eliminating the exemption would requirestates to use the same eligibility criteria for all 18- to 50-year-old able-bodiedpeople with no dependent children who live in a particular local area. An argu-ment against this option is that the exemption provides a safety net for a needypopulation that can be difficult to serve.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 245 600-08 Reduce the $20 Unearned Income Exclusion Under the Supplemental Security Income Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 90 90 2002 120 1202003 120 1202004 125 1252005 135 135 2001-2005 590 590 2001-2010 1,225 1,225 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-09The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides federally funded monthly cash payments\u2014based on uniform, nationwide eligibility rules\u2014tolow-income elderly and disabled people. In addition, most states provide sup-plemental payments. Because SSI is a means-tested program, recipients' out-side income reduces their SSI benefits, subject to certain exclusions. For un-earned income, most of which is Social Security, $20 a month is excluded;benefits are reduced dollar for dollar for unearned income above that amount.The program allows a more liberal exclusion for earned income in order tomaintain work incentives. This option would reduce the monthly $20 unearned income exclusion to $15. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the savings from thatchange would be $90 million in 2001 and $1.2 billion over the 2001-2010 period. A program that ensures a minimum living standard for its recipients need not provide a higher standard for people who happen to have unearned income.Nevertheless, reducing the monthly $20 exclusion by $5 would decrease by asmuch as $60 a year the incomes of the roughly 2.5 million low-income people(approximately 40 percent of all federal SSI recipients) who would benefit fromthe exclusion in 2001. Even with the full $20 exclusion, the incomes of mostSSI recipients fall below the poverty threshold.246 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-09 Create a Sliding Scale for Children's SSI Benefits Based on the Number of Recipients in a Family Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 55 552003 120 1202004 130 1302005 150 150 2001-2005 455 455 2001-2010 1,255 1,255 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-08The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides cash payments \u2014based on uniform, nationwide eligibility rules\u2014to elderly and disabled peoplewith low incomes. In addition, most states provide supplemental payments toSSI recipients. In 1999, children received approximately $4.9 billion in federalSSI benefits, accounting for almost one-sixth of federal SSI benefits paid thatyear. Unlike other means-tested benefits, the amount of the SSI benefit for an additional child does not decline as the number of SSI recipients in a familyincreases. In 2000, a family with one child qualifying for SSI benefits couldreceive up to $512 a month, or $6,144 a year, if the family's income (excludingSSI benefits) was under the cap for the maximum benefit. If the family hadadditional eligible children, it could receive an additional $512 a month for eachone. (A child's benefit is based only on the presence of a severe disability andthe family's income and resources, not on the nature of the qualifying disabilityor on participation by other family members in the SSI program.) This option would create a sliding scale for SSI disability benefits, so that a family would receive smaller benefits per child as the number of children re-ceiving SSI increased. The sliding scale used for this option was recommendedby the National Commission on Childhood Disability in 1995. It would keep themaximum benefit for one child as it is in current law but reduce additional bene-fits for additional recipient children in the same family. If that sliding scale wasin place in 2000, the first child in a family qualifying for the maximum benefitwould receive $512, the second child would receive $320 (38 percent less), andthe third would receive $273 (47 percent less). Benefits would continue to de-crease for additional children. About 90 percent of child recipients would beunaffected by the new scale, and the remaining 10 percent would have their bene-fits reduced by about one-fourth, on average. As with current SSI benefits, thesliding scale would be adjusted each year to reflect changes in the consumer priceindex. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that this option would not be implemented until 2002, because the Social Security Administration does notmaintain data on multiple SSI recipients in a family and implementation of thesliding scale would therefore require significant effort. Savings from this optionwould total $55 million in 2002 and $1.26 billion over the 2002-2010 period. Proponents of this option argue that the proposed reductions in benefits reflect economies of scale that generally affect the cost of living for families withmore than one child. Proponents might also note that the high medical costs thatdisabled children often incur, which would not be subject to economies of scale,would continue to be covered because SSI participants generally are covered byMedicaid. Still, opponents could argue that children with disabilities sometimeshave unique needs that may not be covered by Medicaid, including housingmodifications and specialized equipment. With the proposed drop in benefits,some families might be unable to meet such needs.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 247 600-10 Reduce the Federal Matching Rate for Administrative Costs in the Child Support Enforcement Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 980 980 2002 1,070 : MandatoryThe Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, assists states in their effort to improve the payment of child support by noncustodial parents.The federal government pays 66 percent of the program's administrative costs,provides incentive payments, and allows states to retain some of the money theycollect. This option would reduce the federal share of administrative costs from 66 percent to 50 percent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that lower-ing the federal matching rate could save $980 million in 2001 and $14.1 billionthrough 2010. Several arguments can be made for shifting greater responsibility for CSE administrative costs to the states. For one thi ng, it would encourage states to make their CSE efforts more efficient because states would be paying a largershare of the costs of any inefficiencies. Moreover, it would bring the federalshare of CSE administrative costs more in line with the share of such costs thatthe federal government bears in comparable programs. Lowering the matching rate would entail some risks, however. Because caseloads for child support workers are already high, states are not likely to beable to improve the program's efficiency enough to offset the reduction in fed-eral payments. As a result, states might cut their CSE services, and child sup-port collections might drop. A reduction in collections could also mean higherstate costs for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) because statecollections of child support partly offset states' TANF benefit payments. Statesmight respond to their greater share of the costs by reducing their benefits andservices for needy families. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including the Child SupportEnforcement program\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if thestates lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilitiesto offset the loss of funding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexi-bility within the CSE program to make such changes, this option could consti-tute an unfunded mandate on those jurisdictions under the law.248 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-11 Reduce TANF Block Grants to States Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 819 75 2002 819 752003 814 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryUnder the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), the federal government provides block grants to states forTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The amounts of the blockgrants are based on spending levels for three programs that PRWORA repealedand TANF replaces: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Emer-gency Assistance for Needy Families, and the Job Opportunities and BasicSkills (JOBS) training program. To r eceive TANF f unds, a state must spend from its own funds a predetermined \"maintenance-of-effort\" amount based onits pre-TANF spending. In addition, the state must maintain minimum workparticipation rates for recipient families, require parents and caretaker recipi-ents to engage in work activities after receiving no more than 24 months ofTANF benefits (with some exemptions), and impose a five-year limit on receiptof federally funded TANF benefits. Currently, the Congress has authorized$16.5 billion annually for TANF through 2002. This option would reduce the TANF block grants to states by 5 percent, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would reduce budget author-ity by $819 million and outlays by $75 million in 2001. For 2001 to 2010, CBO estimates that this option would reduce budget authority by $7.8 billionand outlays by $6.1 billion. Budget authority is projected to fall by less than the full 5 percent reduc- tion in the TANF block grant because of the increase in spending for foodstamps that would occur when TANF benefits were reduced. Outlays wouldinitially fall by less than the reduction in budget authority because caseloads inthe AFDC and TANF programs have declined significantly over the past sixyears and many states have been accumulating TANF budget authority from their current annual block grants. The cut in budget authority would result inlower outlays only after a state had depleted its stored budget authority. An argument for reducing the TANF block grants is that most states need much less money for their programs than legislators expected when PRWORAwas enacted. An argument against the cut is that it would reduce federal spend-ing immediately in several states that have been exhausting their TANF blockgrants, which could cause those states to cut their TANF benefits and services.In addition, reducing federal funding could be viewed as an abrogation of aprior agreement between the federal and state governments and could makefuture agreements on block grants more difficult.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 249 600-12 Reduce Funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 110 85 2002 110 1102003 110 1102004 110 1102005 110 110 2001-2005 550 525 2001-2010 1,100 1,075 Relative to WIDI 2001 110 85 2002 125 1202003 145 1402004 165 1602005 185 180 2001-2005 730 685 2001-2010 1,970 1,895 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps some low- income households pay their home energy costs. Aut horized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and distributed through block grants to thestates, LIHEAP funding is $1.1 billion in 2000. States may use the grants to helpeligible households pay home heating or cooling bills, provide energy \"crisisintervention\" for those in immediate need, and fund low-cost weatherizationprojects. Additionally, the LIHEAP appropriation includes $300 million forenergy emergencies designated by the President. Households may be eligible for the program if they receive assistance under certain means-tested programs or if their income is sufficiently low. Eligibilityrequirements are set by the states within federal guidelines. For example, thestates may give preference to households with the highest energy costs (relativeto income). Cutting LIHEAP funding by 10 percent would save nearly $1.1 billion in federal outlays during the 2001-2010 period. (To achieve savings in 2001, thefunding reduction would have to be applied to funds that have already been ap-propriated.) One way of achieving that reduction in spending would be for statesto forgo weatherization spending, which includes funds for new windows, doors,and furnaces that reduce future energy use. In 1996, states spent an average ofjust over 10 percent of their LIHEAP block grants for weatherization. Currently,states can spend up to 15 percent of their grant funds for weatherization, with theoption of obtaining a waiver that allows expenditures of as much as 25 percent.Each year between 1995 and 1998, five states on average received that type ofwaiver. An argument in favor of reducing LIHEAP funding is that the program was created in response to rapid increases in the price of home energy sources in thelate 1970s and early 1980s. Even with their recent rise, however, real energyprices (adjusted for inflation) have decreased by almost 30 percent since 1981.In addition, the small number of waivers that states have obtained to increaseweatherization spending sup ports the claim that most do not regard weatherization as a priority for LIHEAP f unds. The federal government already provides similar assistance through the Department of Energy's (DOE's)Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income people, which has an appro-priation of $135 million in 2000 and serves about 70,000 households per year. An argument against reducing LIHEAP funding is that spending for the program has already declined. In real terms, its 2000 appropriation is about halfof its first appropriation. From 1981 to 1999, the percentage of eligible house-holds receiving assistance dropped from 36 percent to 15 percent. Moreover,many communities have yearlong w aiting lists for assistance from DOE's weatherization program, making it unlikely that the DOE program would be ableto make up for LIHEAP's decreased coverage. In addition, it would be impossi-ble for all of the s tates to limit cuts in funding to weatherization assistance. In 1996, six states did not fund any weatherization projects. To comply with thisoption, those six states and others that use less than 10 percent of their grantfunds for weatherization would have to cut their basic LIHEAP spending.250 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-13-A Defer Cost-of-Living Adjustments for CSRS Annuitants Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 355 355 2002 510 5102003 430 4302004 520 5202005 665 665 2001-2005 Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998. Federal civilian retirement programs cover about 2.7 million active employees and 2.4 million retirees and survivors. Federal civilian pension payments to-taled $44 billion in 1999. Civilian workers covered by the Civil Service Re-tirement System (CSRS), which covers most civilian employees hired beforeJanuary 1, 1984, receive full cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs). Civilian employees hired after that date receive less generous protection from inflation.Employees covered by the post-1983 civilian plan, the Federal EmployeesRetirement System (FERS), receive a so-called diet-COLA, generally 1 per-centage point less than inflation. Moreover, COLAs are generally paid only toFERS retirees who are age 62 and older. This option and options 600-13-B and 600-13-C illustrate three basic approaches to reducing the cost of COLAs: deferring adjustments for inflation,limiting the size of those adjustments, and reducing adjustments for middle- andhigh-income retirees. All three options would still give federal retirees betterprotection against inflation than private-sector pensions give to their retirees.However, as with any cut in benefits, those reductions could make recruitmentand retention harder for federal civilian programs. Deferring COLAs until age 62 for all nondisabled civilian employees who retired before that age would yield savings in direct spending of $355 million in2001, $2.5 billion over five years, and $8.3 billion over 10 years. Consistentwith the military retirement system, this option allows a one-time catch-upadjustment at age 62, increasing pensions to the amount that would have beenpayable had full COLAs been in effect. Under the COLA-deferral approach, aCSRS-covered annuitant retiring at age 55 with an average annuity of $25,000in 2001 would lose $17,000 over seven years. Deferring COLAs would align COLA practices for CSRS with those under FERS and encourage federal employees to work longer. A major disad-vantage of this option is that for current retirees or those nearing retirement, itcould be regarded as a revocation of earned retirement benefits. In add ition, although CSRS benefits are more generous than the total package of benefitstypically offered by private employers, they fall short of those offered by manylarge private firms, which compete directly with the federal government inlabor markets. Moreover, because CSRS benefits are already less generousthan those available under FERS, this option would worsen the disparity be-tween the government's civilian retirement plans.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 251 600-13-B Limit Some COLAs for Federal Retirees Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 165 165 2002 385 3852003 Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) receive a nnual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) that offer 100 percent protection againstinflation. Annuitants under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)receive full protection only when the annual rate of inflation is less than 2 per-cent. If inflation in a year is between 2 percent and 3 percent, FERS annuitantsreceive COLAs of 2 percent. If inflation is over 3 percent, the adjustment is theincrease in inflation less 1 percentage point. This option would limit COLAs for CSRS annuitants to half a percentage point below inflation. Moreover, when inflation fell below 3 percent, FERSretirees would receive a COLA equaling the rate of inflation less a percentagepoint. The smaller one-half point reduction for CSRS retirees would produce acut roughly comparable with the 1 percentage-point limit for FERS enrollees,who are also covered by Social Security. Savings in direct spending for civilian pensions would amount to $165 million in 2001, $3.1 billion over five years, and $12.1 billion over 10 years.Over five years, the average CSRS retiree would lose $2,200. (Savings fromthis option would fall by $460 million over five years if it was coupled withoption 600-13-A, which would defer COLAs until age 62 for CSRS workers.)The Congress could also consider limiting COLAs only for the more generousFERS plan. The main argument for this approach, as with the other COLA options, is that COLA protection under federal pension plans exceeds that offered by pri-vate pension plans. COLAs are becoming less prevalent in the private sector.According to a 1995 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less than 10 per-cent of private-sector annuitants received any inflation protection in the previousfive years. The main argument against cutting any retirement benefit is that such an action hurts both retirees and the government's ability to recruit a qualityworkforce. Advocates for federal workers argue that although certain provisionsof federal retirement plans are generous, total compensation should be the basisof comparison between federal and private-sector employment. Annual surveysindicate that federal workers may be accepting salaries below private-sector ratesfor comparable jobs in exchange for better retirement provisions. In essence,workers pay for their more generous retirement benefits by accepting lowerwages during their working years. This option, however, would hurt those retir-ees most dependent on their pensions. It would also renege on an understandingthat workers covered under CSRS who passed up the chance to switch to FERSwould retain their full protection against inflation. Finally, critics note that someprotection from inflation for federal retirees has been restricted in the past. TheGeneral Accounting Office calculated that COLA delays and reductions duringthe 10-year period from 1985 through 1994 effectively reduced COLAs to about80 percent of inflation.252 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-13-C Reduce COLAs for Middle- and High-Income Federal Retirees Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 235 235 2002 560 Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Another alternative would tie reductions in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to annuitants' benefit levels. For example, the full COLA could beawarded only on the first $700 of a retiree's monthly benefit; a half COLAcould be given on the remainder. The average pension for a civilian retiree was$1,800 a month in 1999. The threshold of $700 per month is about equal to theprojected poverty level for an elderly person in 2000 and could be indexed tomaintain its value over time. Similar proposals have been considered for SocialSecurity. This approach would save about $235 million in direct spending for civil- ian pensions in 2001, $4.5 billion over the 2001-2005 period, and $17.4 billionover 10 years. The average retiree under the Civil Service Retirement System(CSRS) who was affected by the cut would lose $2,460 over five years. Be-cause the full COLA would be paid only to beneficiaries with small annuities,this option would better focus COLAs on retirees who had the greatest need forprotection from inflation. Retirees receiving Federal Employees RetirementSystem (FERS) benefits already receive a reduced COLA, so this changewould affect them less than those receiving CSRS benefits. As a result, theoption would widen the existing gap between total benefits provided by FERS\u2014including Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan\u2014and those providedby CSRS, leaving FERS even more generous relative to CSRS than it had beenin the past. The disadvantage of the option is that it would reduce the ability of the federal government to hire and retain middle- and upper-level managers andprofessionals. In addition, restricting COLAs would undercut a major strengthof the federal retirement system\u2014its ability to offer indexed pensions. Fullyindexed benefits provide insurance against inflation, which generally is notoffered in the private sector. Furthermore, many people object to any reduc-tions in earned retirement benefits. They also point out that federal pensionsare fully taxable under the individual income tax in the same proportion thatthey exceed the contributions that employees made during their working years.Moreover, pension benefit levels are not always reliable indicators of totalincome. As a result, unrestricted COLAs might be paid to recipients who hadsubstantial income from other sources.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 253 600-14 Modify the Salary Used to Set Federal Pensions Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 20 20 2002 55 552003 95 952004 130 1302005 170 170 2001-2005 Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Both of the government's major civilian employee retirement plans, the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement Sys-tem (CSRS), provide initial benefits based on the average salary for an em-ployee's three highest-earning years. If a four-year average was adopted forfuture retirees under FERS and CSRS, initial pensions would be about 1.5 percent to 2 percent smaller for most new civilian retirees. In 2001, total sav-ings to the government in direct spending for civilian pensions would be $20million; savings would total $470 million over five years and $1.8 billion over10 years. This option would align federal practices more closely with those in the private sector, which commonly uses five-year averages. The change in figur-ing the base salary would encourage some employees to remain on the joblonger in order to boost their pensions to reflect the higher salaries they receivewith more years on the job. That incentive could help the government keep experienced people, but it would hinder efforts to reduce federal employmentand promote younger hires. The major drawback to the option is that it would cut benefits and conse- quently reduce the attractiveness of the government's civilian compensationpackages. Under this option, FERS benefits\u2014including Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)\u2014would remain more generous than those offered bylarge private firms, but CSRS benefits would fall below those received by manyretirees in the private sector. The average new CSRS retiree would lose $500in 2001 and $2,600 over five years, whereas the average new FERS retireewould lose $150 in 2001 and just $800 over five years because of the smallerdefined benefit under that system. Retirees participating in FERS would con-tinue to receive their full Social Security benefits and distributions from theTSP. In contrast, Social Security does not cover CSRS participants, and thegovernment makes no contributions to TSP accounts established by CSRSparticipants.254 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-15-A Restrict the Government's Matching Contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 665 665 2002 700 7002003 730 600-13-C, 600-14, 600-15-B, and 600-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998. Comparing Federal Salaries with Those in the Private Sector (Memorandum), July 1997.The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal civilian employees is a defined contri- bution pension plan similar to the 401(k) plans that many private employersoffer. Federal agencies automatically contribute to the TSP an amount equal to1 percent of an individual's earnings on behalf of each of the 1.5 million workerscovered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). In addition, theemploying agency matches voluntary deposits by employees dollar for dollar onthe first 3 percent of their pay and 50 cents for each dollar on the next 2 percent.The total federal contribution is 5 percent of pay for employees who also putaside 5 percent. Employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System(CSRS), which covers most civilian federal employees hired before January 1,1984, can contribute 5 percent of their pay to the TSP, but agencies contributenothing on behalf of those employees. If the government limited its matching contributions to a uniform rate of 50 percent on the first 5 percent of pay, its maximum contribution would fall to 3.5percent of pay. Savings from that proposal would total $665 million in 2001and $3.7 billion over five years relative to the 2000 funding level. Ten-yearsavings would reach $8.2 billion. (The estimates exclude savings realized by the Postal Service because reductions in its operating costs eventually benefit only mail users.) Assuming that agencies continued the automatic 1 percentcontribution, this arrangement would remain more generous than the definedcontribution pension plans that are typically offered in the private sector. Limiting the matching contributions would reduce the disparity between the government's two major retirement systems. Benefits under FERS are cur-rently more generous than those under the older CSRS for most participants.Yet restricting the matching contributions would have several drawbacks.Middle- and upper-income employees rely on the government's contributions tomaintain their standard of living during retirement because Social Security re-places a smaller fraction of their income than it does for lower-income employ-ees. Part of the TSP's appeal derives from its individual accounts for each par-ticipant, which enjoy some protection from cuts imposed by subsequent changesin law. The security and portability of the TSP were major factors in the deci-sion of many employees to switch from CSRS to FERS, because the TSP com-pensated for a less generous defined benefit plan. Changing the TSP's provi-sions would be unfair to that group, whose decision to switch plans reasonablyassumed that changes would not be made. Opponents of restricting the matchingrate also argue that doing so would diminish employees' savings for retirement,a problem that would be intensified if the cut reduced TSP participation. Re-search shows, however, that private-sector employees' contributions to their401(k) plans tend to be responsive to the offer of employer matching contribu-tions but not to the size of the match.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 600 255 600-15-B Restructure the Government's Matching Contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 310 310 2002 325 3252003 340 600-13-C, 600-14, 600-15-A, and Comparing Federal Employee Ben- efits with Those in the Private Sec-tor (Memorandum), August 1998. Comparing Federal Salaries with Those in the Private Sector (Mem- orandum), July 1997.Federal workers covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) can contribute up to 10 percent of their salary into the Thrift Savings Plan(TSP), which is similar to a 401(k) plan. However, an employee can receive thehighest contribution the government is willing to make to the TSP, an amountequal to 5 percent of the employee's pay, by contributing only 5 percent of earn-ings. Restructuring the government's contribution schedule so that the govern-ment would make the full 5 percent contribution only when employees contributethe 10 percent maximum amount would save $310 million in 2001 and $1.7billion over five years. Ten-year savings would reach $3.8 billion. Currently, federal agencies automatically contribute an amount equal to 1 percent of salaries into the TSP for their FERS employees. In addition, employ-ing agencies match the first 3 percent of voluntary employee contributions dollarfor dollar and the next 2 percent at 50 cents on the dollar. (Employees coveredby the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) are not eligible for either theautomatic or the matching contributions but may contribute 5 percent of pay tothe TSP.) This option would spread the government's total 5 percent contribution over the 10 percent maximum contribution for employees. It would do so bymatching voluntary contributions ranging from 1 percent up to 6 percent at therate of 50 cents per dollar (for a maximum 3 percent match), and those rangingfrom 7 to 10 percent at 25 cents per dollar (for a maximum 1 percent match).The government would continue to automatically contribute an amount equal to1 percent of employee earnings. Changing the government's matching schedule would bring the govern- ment's practices more in line with those of defined contribution plans in theprivate sector, which usually provide less generous matching contributions andno automatic contributions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, themost prevalent practice among medium and large private firms is to match em-ployee contributions up to 6 percent of pay at 50 cents on the dollar. Somefederal employees, especially those currently contributing 5 percent of pay,would have an incentive to contribute more to the TSP and as a result wouldhave more savings available to them when they retired. Further, restructuringmatching contributions might reduce the disparity between the government's twomajor retirement systems. Benefits under FERS are currently higher and costthe government more than those under the older CSRS for most participants. This option has several drawbacks, however. First, a lower government match on smaller contributions may reduce the retirement resources for someemployees by weakening their incentive to contribute. Second, the governmentmay achieve its savings at the expense of employees who are least likely tocontribute a higher percentage of earnings into the TSP\u2014namely, young work-ers and others with relatively low earnings. Third, changing the TSP may beconsidered unfair because many people accepted employment with the govern-ment or switched from CSRS to FERS based on the assumption that TSP bene-fits would not change.256 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 600-16 Increase Employee Contributions for Federal Pensions Savings (Millions of dollars) 2001 0 Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 temporarilyraises federal civilian employees' contributions to the retirement funds by 0.5percent of pay; it also raises nonpostal agencies' contributions for CSRS partic-ipants by 1.5 percent of pay. The government began phasing in those increasesin January 1999\u2014employee contributions initially rose by 0.25 percent of pay.The increases are scheduled to expire after 2002. This option would makethose higher employee and agency contributions for civilian pensions perma-nent. Adopting this option for civilian employees would increase savings in mandatory programs by $3.2 billion over five years and $8.5 billion over 10years. (The estimates assume that agencies' contributions for employees underFERS remain unchanged.) Requiring employees to contribute to their retirement funds is one way to offset the generosity of federal civilian pension benefits relative to those in theprivate sector yet maintain a high level of salary replacement once people re-tire. On the downside, for most federal civilian employees, the option would beroughly equivalent to a 0.5 percent pay cut and would further diminish thefederal government's compensation package relative to that of the private sec-tor. (Private firms seldom require employees to contribute to pension plans.)Those factors would weaken the government's ability to attract new personnel.The government as a result might attract a less skilled workforce or be forcedto raise cash compensation for its employees.700 Veterans Benefits Budget function 700 covers programs that offer benefits to military veterans. Those programs, most of which are run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, provide health care, disability compensation, pen-sions, life insurance, education and training, and guaranteed loans. CBO estimates that outlays for function700 will total $44.8 billion in 2000, including discretionary outlays of $20.4 billion. Over the past decade,discretionary outlays for veterans' benefits have increased almost every year.

Borrowers takingadvantage of the program pay a one-time, up-front funding fee. In contrast, borrowersusing private mortgage insurance generally pay monthly fees. This option would replace the up-front fee in the VA program with an annual premium, paid monthly, starting in 2001. Budget savings to the VA would total $1.3billion over five years and $3 billion through 2010. Under current law, the up-front feewill decline in 2003. About half of the saving estimated for this option would comefrom not reducing that fee in 2003; the other half would come from the additionalchange to monthly premiums. Actual savings from the option, however, would dependon future economic conditions: savings could be lower if the program experiencedhigh rates of default or high rates of refinancing to conventional loans. Besides saving money for the VA, changing from an up-front to a monthly fee would have advantages for program participants. First, it would increase fairnessamong borrowers by charging them for mortgage insurance only for the years that theyneeded and used it. Active-duty military personnel who regularly change their dutystation would pay less than they do under the current fee structure. For example,borrowers who sold their home after five years would save more than $700 (on apresent-value basis) with a monthly fee, compared with a 2 percent up-front fee on aloan with no down payment. An additional element of fairness among borrowerswould result because the monthly fee would cause borrowers who defaulted on theirmortgage to pay significantly more toward their insurance than they do now. Whenthe up-front fee is financed as part of the mortgage\u2014as it typically is today\u2014borrow-ers who subsequently default pay very little of the fee. Second, the annual fee assumed in this option (0.35 percent) is significantly lower than premium rates that private mortgage insurers charge for comparable cover-age. Thus, the program would continue to provide a significant benefit to militarypersonnel. Third, because the up-front fee is usually financed as part of the mortgage, adopting a monthly fee would reduce mortgage amounts, making it easier for borrow-ers to sell their homes, and thus reduce rates of default and foreclosure. Today, sincemost VA mortgages combine financing of the up-front fee with a zero downpayment,the program creates \"upside-down\" loans whose balances are greater than the underly-ing property values. Borrowers in that situation must wait for the price of their hometo appreciate significantly before they can afford to sell it and move. If the price doesnot rise fast enough, default becomes a viable option when the borrower must move to a new location. The January 1999 Report of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance raised concern about upside- down loans and their added risk of default. Changing the fee structure for VA mortgage insurance could have drawbacks, however. First, the department would need to establish a system to receive monthlypremium receipts from lenders, which could necessitate new accounting and computersystems. Second, the change would require borrowers to either make slightly highermonthly mortgage payments (an average of $17 higher during the years in which thepremiums were due), purchase homes of lower value (an average of $2,300 lower), orsome combination of the two.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 700 259 700-02 End Future Veterans' Compensation Payments for Certain Veterans with Low-Rated Disabilities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 22 20 2002 67 642003 114 1102004 163 1592005 232 229 2001-2005 SPENDING CATEGORY: Mandatory RELATED OPTION: 700-03Approximately 2.3 million veterans who have service-connected disabilities receive veterans' disability compensation benefits. The amount of compensa-tion is based on a rating of the individual's impairment that is intended to reflectan average reduction in the ability to earn wages in civilian occupations. Vet-erans' disability ratings range from zero to 100 percent (most severe). Veter-ans who are unable to maintain gainful employment and who have ratings of atleast 60 percent are eligible to be paid at the 100 percent disability rate. Addi-tional allowances are paid to veterans who have disabilities rated 30 percent orhigher and who have dependent spouses, children, or parents. About 50,000 veterans with disability ratings below 30 percent are added to the rolls every year, receiving benefits of between $70 and $188 a month.Federal outlays could be reduced by $2.5 billion during the 2001-2010 periodby ending benefits for those low-rated disabilities in future cases. Making veterans with new disability ratings below 30 percent ineligible for compensation would concentrate spending on the most impaired veterans.Performance in civilian jobs depends less now on physical labor than when thedisability ratings were originally set, and improved reconstructive and rehabili-tative techniques are now available, so physical impairments rated below 30percent may not reduce veterans' earnings. Those impairments include condi-tions such as mild arthritis, moderately flat feet, or amputation of part of afinger\u2014conditions that would not affect the ability of veterans to work in manyoccupations today. Veterans' compensation could be viewed, however, as career or lifetime indemnity payments owed to veterans disabled to any degree while serving inthe armed forces. Moreover, some disabled veterans\u2014especially older oneswho have retired\u2014might find it difficult to increase their working hours orotherwise make up the loss in compensation payments.260 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 700-03 End Future Awards of Veterans' Disability or Death Compensation When a Disability Is Unrelated to Military Duties Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 75 69 2002 230 2172003 393 3792004 and 700-04Veterans are eligible for disability compensation if they either receive or aggra- vate disabilities while on active-duty service. Service-connected disabilitiesare defined as those resulting from diseases, injuries, or other physical or men-tal impairments that occurred or were intensified during military service (ex-cluding those resulting from willful misconduct). Disabilities need not be in-curred or made worse while performing military duties to be consideredservice-connected; for example, disabilities incurred while on leave also qual-ify. The federal government gives death compensation awards to survivorswhen a service-connected disability is related to the cause of death. As many as 50 percent of veterans receiving compensation payments may qualify on the basis of injuries or diseases that were neither incurred nor aggra-vated while performing military duties. Ending disability and death compensa-tion awards in such cases in the future would reduce outlays by almost $8.8 bil-lion over 10 years. Approximately 5 percent of those savings would come fromreduced death compensation awards. This option would make disability compensation of military personnel comparable with that of federal civilian employees under workers' compensa-tion arrangements. However, because military personnel are assigned to placeswhere situations may sometimes be volatile, they have less control than civil-ians over where they spend their off-duty hours. Therefore, in many cases itmight be difficult to determine whether a veteran's disease, injury, or impair-ment was entirely unrelated to military duties. The formal appeals system ofthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could be extended to cover rulingsspecifying that disabling conditions were unrelated to military duties. Data collected by the VA indicate that more than 200,000 veterans re- ceive a total of $1.3 billion a year in VA compensation payments for diseasesthat, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), are generally neithercaused nor aggravated by military service. Those diseases include arterio-sclerotic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Hodgkin's disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and pulmo-nary emphysema), hemorrhoids, schizophrenia, osteoarthritis, and benign pros-tatic hypertrophy. Ending new awards only for veterans with those diseaseswould have a more limited impact than this option because it would not affectall veterans whose compensable disabilities are unrelated to military service.However, it could eliminate compensation for some veterans whose disabilitiesare not generally service-connected, according to GAO, but whose circum-stances constitute an exception to that general conclusion. Such an approachwould yield smaller savings than the main option\u2014about $1.4 billion over the2001-2010 period.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 700 261 700-04 Eliminate \"Sunset\" Dates on Certain Provisions for Veterans in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 764 and 700-06Five provisions in law that affect veterans will cease to apply on September 30, 2002\u2014their \"sunset\" date. As a result, starting in fiscal year 2003, outlays willbe higher than if the provisions remained in effect. Those provisions: o Protect the monthly benefit for certain pensioners who have no dependents and are eligible for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care, thus lower-ing pension costs for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) but increas-ing costs for the Medicaid program, which is paid for by the federal andstate governments; o Authorize the Internal Revenue Service to help the VA verify incomes reported by beneficiaries, for the purpose of establishing eligibility forpensions and benefits; o Increase the fees charged for first-time and repeated use of the veterans' home loan program and make the VA more cost-effective in securitizingloans and acquiring property: o Authorize the VA to collect from any health insurer that contracts to insure a veteran with service-connected disabilities the reasonable cost of medicalcare that the VA provides for the treatment of non-service-connected dis-abilities; and o Authorize the VA to charge copayments to certain veterans receiving inpa- tient and outpatient care and outpatient medication from VA facilities. This option would make the effects of those provisions permanent by elimi- nating the sunset date in each case. In addition, it would eliminate the VA'scurrent authority to spend the medical care collections. Beginning in 2003, those collections would revert back to the Treasury. If all five provisions weremade permanent and medical receipts were deposited in the Treasury, savingsduring the 2001-2010 period would total almost $6.6 billion compared with thecurrent level of spending. The main advantage of this option is that it would convert the temporary savings achieved by those provisions into continuing savings. The main disad-vantage is that certain veterans or their insurers would be worse off financially.States would also face higher Medicaid costs because of withdrawn federal funds for nursing home care.262 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 700-05 Extend and Increase Copayments for Outpatient Prescriptions Filled at VA Pharmacies Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 0 0 2002 0 02003 156 1562004 211 2112005 268 268 2001-2005 Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS: 050-21 and 700-04In 1990, the Congress gave the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) temporary authority to charge copayments for care and services at VA facilities to certainveterans\u2014namely, those with relatively high income and no service-connecteddisabilities. Copayments for outpatient prescriptions filled at VA pharmacies were set at $2 for a 30-day supply of drugs. The Congress later ext ended the authority to collect that copayment through 2002 but did not increase thecopayment amount, even though the VA's prescription drug expenditures rose byan average of 11 percent per year between 1991 and 1999. The MillenniumHealth Care and Benefits Act of 1999 has given the VA authority to chargemore than $2 for a 30-day supply of drugs, but the department does not yet knowhow it will implement that authority or what the final copayment will be. (Anyincrease in revenues would not count as savings since the VA also has authorityto spend the money.) This option would make three sets of changes. First, it would eliminate the provision under which the copayment will expire in 2002 and would extend thatpayment indefinitely. It would also require the VA to collect copayments in allapplicable cases and would remove the department's discretion to waive thecopayment. Currently, the VA bills veterans from a central office on the basisof information forwarded by VA pharmacies. Under this option, copaymentswould be collected by those pharmacies as they dispensed prescriptions. Sec-ond, this option would increase the copayment amount by $1 each year until itreached $5 for a 30-day supply. Third, the option would send those collectionsto the Treasury rather than allowing the VA to spend them, as under current law.Those three actions would take effect in 2003 and would save more than $2billion through 2010. Proponents would argue that eventually requiring a $5 copayment for pre- scription drugs would encourage more prudent consumption and make the VAdrug benefit consistent with that of other health care delivery systems, includingmanaged care plans in the private sector. Opponents, by contrast, would charge that some veterans with mu ltiple chronic illnesses could be overburdened by the higher cost sharing. Even limit-ing the number of prescriptions subject to copayments in one month could placean undue financial burden on chronically ill veterans and their families, accord-ing to critics.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 700 263 700-06 Increase Beneficiaries' Cost Sharing for Care at VA-Operated Nursing Facilities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 182 182 2002 188 1882003 194 1942004 200 2002005 206 206 2001-2005 970 970 2,097 2,097 SPENDING CATEGORY: Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 700-04Veterans may receive long-term care in nursing homes operated by the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) depending on the availability of resources. Thatcare is rationed primarily on the basis of service-connected disabilities andincome. Under certain conditions, a veteran may receive care at the VA's ex-pense in state-operated or privately run nursing facilities. The VA may charge copayments to veterans with no service-connected disabilities and high enough income when they receive more t han 90 days of care in VA-run nursing homes. In 1998, the copayment rate was equivalent toabout $13 a day. A study by the General Accounting Office found that thecopayment recovers just 0.1 percent of the costs of providing nursing homecare. In contrast, state-operated nursing facilities for veterans and communitylong-term care facilities that treat veterans have their own copayment policies.As a result, those facilities offset a larger share of their operating expenses thanthe VA, recovering as much as 43 percent through copayments. (Estate-recov-ery programs are another way they offset costs.) This option would authorize the VA to revise its cost-sharing policies to recover more of the cost of providing care in VA nursing facilities. The depart-ment would be required to collect a minimum of 10 percent of its operatingcosts, but it could determine the type of copayments charged and who would beeligible to pay them. For example, it could apply the current copayment to abroader category of veterans or require the veterans who now make copaymentsto pay more. Recovering 10 percent of the VA's operating costs would save$182 million in 2001 and $2 billion over 10 years. Achieving those savingswould require depositing the receipts in the Treasury rather than allowing theVA to retain and spend them. (The Millennium Health Care and Benefits Actof 1999 gave the VA authority to increase copayments charged to the above-mentioned veterans, but the department does not yet know how it will imple-ment that authority or what the structure of copayments will be. Furthermore,any increase in revenues would not count as savings since the VA has authorityto spend the money.) Proponents of this option would argue that veterans in VA nursing facili- ties are getting a far more generous benefit than similar veterans in non-VAfacilities. Because VA-run nursing homes are relatively scarce, veterans luckyenough to be admitted to one receive an unfair advant age over similarly situ- ated veterans. Recovering more of the expense at VA facilities would makethat benefit more equitable among veterans and different sites of care. Opponents of this option would argue that beneficiaries in nursing facili- ties may be less able to make copayments than beneficiaries receiving othertypes of care. They would also argue that allowing the VA to charge veteranswith service-connected disabilities would be inconsistent with other medicalbenefits that those veterans receive. The VA could continue to exempt thoseveterans, but it would have to charge high-income veterans without service-connected disabilities even more to achieve the 10 percent recovery level. 750 Administration of Justice Budget function 750 covers programs that provide judicial services, law enforcement, and prison operation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and thefederal court system are all supported under this function. CBO estimates that discretionary outlays forfunction 750 will total $26.8 billion in 2000. Over the past 10 years, this function has experienced steadyand often significant annual increases in outlays, reflecting continued concern about drug-related and othercrime.

Of that amount, approximately $3.2 billion is designatedfor efforts to prevent drugs from entering the United States. Both domesticagencies and the Department of Defense carry out law enforcement efforts tocontrol illegal drugs. Approximately two-fifths of the funds for interdiction andinternational activities are allocated under the administration of justice budgetfunction. Another one-fourth is allocated to defense-related efforts. (The re-mainder is split between the transportation and international affairs budgetfunctions.) Eliminating funds for drug interdiction and international activities,which may be relatively less effective than domestic antidrug efforts, wouldsave $1.7 billion in the first year, $11.5 billion over five years, and $24.3 bil-lion over 10 years. Critics of the funding claim that interdiction and internati onal activ ities are both more costly and less effective than other antidrug efforts; that no clearproof of their efficacy exists; and that the federal government could drasticallyreduce the resources devoted to such activities without affecting drug use overthe long term. In fact, some sources show that illicit drugs are less expensiveand more readily available now than they were before the federal governmentbegan trying to control them. Interdiction and international activities do notreduce the demand for drugs and have less impact on the price users pay thanstate and locally funded efforts. Interdiction and international activities affectproducers' costs, which are only a small part of the users' charges. The bulk ofthose charges are added in the later stages of processing and delivery. (Ofcourse, local and state efforts to control the supply of drugs also face severalobstacles: competition among producers and distributors, the large markupfrom wholesale to retail prices, and the ability of distributors to dilute the drugto maintain an end price that customers can afford.) Proponents argue that a variety of reasons exist to support interdiction and international activities. Notable successes, including the destruction of majordrug trafficking organizations and the large quantities of illegal drugs seized ordestroyed, contradict claims of ineffectiveness. In fact, supporters of interdic-tion and international activities argue that street prices would have been muchlower, and the availability of drugs much greater, without extensive funding forcriminal justice efforts. Moreover, if the goal of the federal government is tocontrol, and not simply to reduce, the use of illegal drugs, some effort to reducethe flow of drugs into the country will be necessary. Proponents of antidrugactivities argue that given the unacceptably high level of drug use, the govern-ment should reform allegedly ineffective programs rather than eliminate them.Finally, in cases in which antidrug activities are integrated with other agencyfunctions, cutting back funding for interdiction and international efforts wouldalso disrupt those related activities.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 750 267 750-02 Reduce Funding for Justice Assistance and Certain Justice-Related Activities Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 696 309 2002 758 5582003 and 800-05In addition to the law enforcement activities that the Department of Justice carries out directly, it and related government entities provide various types oflaw enforcement or legal assistance to individuals, community organizations,and state and local law enforcement agencies. That assistance, which willamount to about $1.5 billion in 2000, often takes the form of financial grants tosupport researach, training, and other programs. This option would consolidate and reform justice assistance programs and reduce the amount spent on them by 20 percent. It would also terminate theLegal Services Corporation and the State Justice Institute. Those cuts can, ofcourse, be considered separately. Taken together, they would save $309 mil-lion in 2001, $3.1 billion over five years, and $6.9 billion over 10 years. The major criticisms of the justice assistance programs are that they do not respond to local concerns and priorities and that they often address prob-lems that are not federal responsibilities. Consolidating grant programs wouldyield administrative savings, and switching from categorical to block grantswould allow grant recipients to focus their efforts on areas of greatest needrather than on problems that, though significant nationally, are less importantlocally. Similar arguments apply to the Legal Services Corporation, whichprovides legal assistance to the poor in civil matters. Cr itics contend that re- sponsibility for such assistance more properly lies with state and local govern-ments. Some critics also charge that the activities of Legal Service lawyerstend to focus on advancing social causes rather than on helping poor peoplewith routine legal problems. (The Congress modified the Legal Services Cor-poration in 1996, restricting the types of cases and clients it could represent by,for example, prohibiting the corporation's lawyers from representing plaintiffsin class-action suits.) The State Justice Institute, which makes grants for re-search on criminal justice matters, likewise faces questions of res ponsibility and jurisdiction. The criticisms leveled against the institute are that much ofthe research it sponsors is similar to that conducted elsewhere and that in ne-glecting to publicize the research or cooperate with the courts in ins tituting reforms and new ideas, it does too little to affect the states' actual administra-tion of justice. Supporters of funding for justice assistance argue that it is merited on practical grounds. The categorical grant system, they maintain, is working asintended: in certain cases, the problems the grants address have a nationalscope but might be ignored by states without the i ncentive of federal f unds. Reduced federal spending would, moreover, disproportionately affect thosestate-run programs that depend heavily on federal fundi ng, such as juvenile justice. In defending the Legal Services Corporation and the State Justice Insti-tute, opponents of this option argue that the federal government has an obliga-tion to provide assistance in areas with scarce support from state and privatesources. 800 General Government Budget function 800 covers the central management and policy responsibilities of both the legislative and executive branches of the federal government.

Thegovernment makes the property available free or at deep discounts. In 1999,according to GSA data, the government donated 90 pieces of property valued at$81 million. For the 1995-1999 period, the value of donations totaled about $500 million. If the government discontinued the program and instead soldsurplus property at market value, it could increase offsetting receipts by a totalof $450 million over 10 years. (That number represents the net of roughly$500 million in additional receipts less GSA's authority to retain and spend 12percent of such amounts\u2014or about $50 million over the 10-year period.) According to supporters of this option, selling surplus property, rather than giving it away, would raise revenue for the government and would ensure,through open competition for assets in the market, that property is put to itsmost highly valued use. They note that the government already provides abun-dant direct and indirect assistance to states and localities to support conserva-tion, education, and other public services. They also point out that nonprofitorganizations will receive about $30 billion in federal support in tax deductionsfor charitable contributions in 2000. In addition, the program provides unevenassistance, which favors areas with a heavy federal presence, according to those who would restrict it. Advocates of transferring surplus property argue that the program pro- vides valuable support to localities, nonprofit organizations, and others strug-gling to offer useful public services in areas such as education, conservation,and transportation. During periods of fiscal restraint, such programs also offerthe government a way to support causes it deems worthy, without having tomake appropriations. In add ition, advocates argue that transferring surplus property to communities may offset some of the local impact of closing federalinstallations.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 800 271 800-02 Eliminate General Fiscal Assistance to the District of Columbia Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 28 28 2002 28 282003 28 282004 28 282005 28 28 2001-2005 140 140 2001-2010 280 280 Relative to WIDI 2001 28 28 2002 29 292003 29 292004 30 302005 30 306 SPENDING CATEGORY: DiscretionaryUnder the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act (Revitalization Act) of 1997, the federal government assumed responsibil-ity for providing certain services to the District of Columbia in exchange foreliminating the annual payment of general assistance to the District.

For fiscal year 1998, the Revitalization Act included slightly more than $200 million in assistance for the District that was not related to the obligationsspecifically assumed by the federal government. For fiscal year 1999, the cityreceived $232 million in such funding, compared with $28 m illion for fiscal year 2000. The amount for 2000 includes funds for defraying out-of-statetuition costs, providing adoption incentives, and preventing the supply of nar-cotics. Eliminating such funds would save $280 million over the 2001-2010period. One argument for eliminating such funding is that the federal government relieved the District of Columbia government of the cost of a substantial, andincreasing, portion of its budget\u2014criminal justice, Medicaid, and pensions.The proposed trade-off for assuming responsibility for those functions waseliminating other assistance, including the annual federal payment. Eliminatingassistance would be consistent with that policy. Furthermore, b ecause the District of Columbia's financial situation has recently improved considerably,the city needs less assistance. One argument against eliminating such funding is that the Cons titution gives the Congress responsibility for overseeing the District of Columbia(which the Congress has largely delegated to the city government) and the citystill has major problems with its public schools, roadways, and other essentialcity services. Therefore, opponents of this option argue that the need continuesfor funding assistance. Moreover, the Congress prevents the District of Colum-bia from imposing commuter taxes as other cities do. Such taxes are levied onnonresidents who work in a city and benefit from city services. Two of threedollars earned in the District of Columbia are earned by nonresidents. Finally,opponents note that continued assistance is justified because a large portion ofcity property is exempt from local taxes, including the property owned by thefederal government or foreign nations that accounts for over 40 percent of prop-erty in the city.272 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 800-03 Eliminate Mandatory Grants to U.S. Territories Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 28 2 2002 28 82003 28 112004 28 162005 28 22 2001-2005 140 59 2001-2010 280 197 SPENDING CATEGORY: MandatoryAs part of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the federal government agreed to provide financial assistanceto CNMI, a U.S. territory. During the 1978-1992 period, the federal govern-ment provided CNMI with $420 m illion for operations, economic development, and infrastructure. After 1992, the financial assistance agreement between the United States and CNMI requires, in the absence of a new agreement, that grants to the Com-monwealth continue indefinitely at the 1992 funding amount\u2014$28 million. In1996, Public Law 104-134 reallocated the $28 million in annual grants amongCNMI; the territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands; andthe freely associated states of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The reallo-cation was made, in part, because the government believed that the goals of theoriginal financial assistance agreements had been met and that other areas hada greater need for assistance. Of the $28 million, more than $11 million contin-ues to go to CNMI. The option and savings assume a new agreement with CNMI. Eliminating the mandatory grants to the U.S. territories and freely associated states wouldsave about $200 million over the 2001-2010 period. Because the territoriesspend new grants relatively slowly, eliminating the grants would not save muchmoney in the first several years. The Department of the Interior could includeadditional funding for infrastructure and other purposes as part of its annualappropriation request; however, the territories would no longer be entitled tothe $28 million, and requests for add itional appropriations for infrastructure grants would compete with all other appropriation requests. For instance, infiscal year 2000, the Congress appropriated $42 million in assistance to theterritories. Aside from reducing direct spending, eliminating the grants would put assistance for capital needs on equal footing with other assistance to the territo-ries and with similar grants to state and local governments. In addition, somepeople argue that the reason for providing mandatory assistance to CNMI hasended because its goals have been met. The decision to reallocate the annualfunds among the insular areas would seem to support that conclusion. In addi-tion, CNMI has had considerable difficulty developing projects, raising match-ing funds, and receiving approval from the Department of the Interior, all ofwhich suggests that the goals for which the funding was designed have been met. Those who would continue the grants argue that the insular areas still have significant needs and that the mandatory grants ensure that f unding is available. In addition, CNMI has a growing economy and increasing self-suffi-ciency, which supporters of this option cite as proof that the federal assistanceworks. Others argue that any further change in CNMI's funding should be partof a new financial agreement between the United States and CNMI. Otherwise,CNMI could view the unilateral ending of the assistance as a br each of good faith on the part of the U.S. government, which could have political and legalrepercussions.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 800 273 800-04 Require the IRS to Deposit Fees from Installment Agreements in the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 92 86 2002 94 942003 96 962004 94 942005 96 96 2001-2005 472 466 2001-2010 980 974 SPENDING CATEGORY: MandatoryThe fiscal year 1996 appropriation act for the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain inde-pendent agencies authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establishnew fees and increase existing fees. The act also allows the IRS to retain andspend receipts collected from those fees, up to an annual limit of $119 million.The IRS has used the authority mainly to charge taxpayers a fee for enteringinto payment plans with the agency. In fiscal year 1999, the IRS collected $88million and spent $90 million in fee receipts (including $2 million in fees col-lected before 1999). Requiring the IRS to deposit those receipts in the Treasury would elimi- nate the IRS's ability to spend them. That would reduce the IRS's direct spend-ing by nearly $100 million a year, or $974 million over the 2001-2010 period.That estimate assumes that removing the spending authority would not substan-tially reduce the amount the IRS collects each year from such fees. An argument for eliminating the IRS's authority to spend the receipts is that processing payment plans with the taxpayers is an administrative functiondirectly related to the IRS's mission\u2014getting citizens to pay the taxes they owe\u2014and for which the agency already receives an annual appropriation. Forfiscal year 2000, for instance, the IRS received $8.25 billion in direct appropri-ations (not counting transfers). That argument may have particular merit be-cause the IRS does not directly use the receipts collected from fees for install-ment agreements to fund the processing of those agreements. A second argu-ment is that the spending authority could create the incentive for the IRS tounnecessarily encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes in installments. Similarly,it could encourage the agency to seek new and unnecessary fees. An argument for continuing to allow the IRS to spend the receipts is that given the constraints on total discretionary spending, allowing the IRS to gener-ate and use fee receipts helps ensure that the federal government's main revenuecollector has sufficient funding to fulfill its mission. Some people would arguethat even an annual decrease of roughly $100 million could negatively affectrevenue collection. In addition, eliminating the spending authority could reducethe IRS's incentive to allow, or its ability to provide for, installment payments,thus hurting those taxpayers who would benefit from such arrangements.274 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 800-05 Eliminate Federal Antidrug Advertising Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 185 56 2002 185 1482003 185 1852004 185 1852005 185 185 2001-2005 925 759 2001-2010 1,850 1,684 Relative to WIDI 2001 188 56 2002 191 1512003 194 1922004 198 1952005 201 198 2001-2005 Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS: 750-01 and 750-02The fiscal year 1998 appropriation act for the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain inde-pendent agencies authorized and provided funding of $195 million to the Officeof National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) for a national antidrug media cam-paign. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropria-tions Act provided $185 million for the program in fiscal year 1999 and autho-rized $195 million for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2002. Amounts pro-vided to ONDCP can be used to test and evaluate advertising, purchase mediatime, and evaluate the effects. In addition, the agency must try to get donationsfrom nonfederal sources to finance part of the costs. For fiscal year 2000, the Treasury and General Government Appropria- tions Act provided $185 million for the antidrug media program. Thus, elimi-nating it would save $1.7 billion over the 2001-2010 period, assuming that theCongress will otherwise continue to provide the same level of funding for theprogram that it provided for fiscal year 2000. Arguments for terminating funding of the advertising campaign are many. First, solid empirical evidence of media campaigns' effectiveness in either pre-venting or reducing drug use is lacking. Some analysts claim that media spotsdo not reduce drug use by minors as effectively as treatment or interdiction.Furthermore, since nonprofit organizations, such as the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, already conduct educational programs about the dangers of druguse, ONDCP's campaign may duplicate private and local efforts. In any event,with more than $300 million in available balances at the start of this year andthe authority to solicit and use public donations, ONDCP could continue the media campaign, on a much smaller scale, without an annual appropriation. Other analysts argue that educating the young about the hazards of drug use is a national responsibility. Some point to the \"Just Say No\" campaignbegun by former First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 1980s as an example of thesuccessful use of the national media to raise young people's awareness of the dangers of drugs. Proponents of the program also argue that the cost of drugabuse to the country is so high that it is worthwhile to maintain a program thatreduces drug use even slightly.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 800 275 800-06 Eliminate the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 62 0 2002 61 02003 60 292004 60 2262005 SPENDING CATEGORY: MandatoryDuring each Presidential election cycle, the federal government distributes money from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund to candidates and politi-cal parties who agree to limit their campaign expenditures. All candidates\u2014even those who do not accept public funds\u2014are also bound by federal limitson campaign contributions, established in 1974, that restrict donations by indi-viduals to $1,000. This option would, after the 2000 election, eliminate the fund and stop the flow of public funds to Presidential candidates and political parties. (Policy-makers may, in conjunction with this option, wish to change the rules limitingcontributions by individuals, but such changes would not directly affect thebudget.) The first savings from this option would not appear until 2003, so totalsavings over the first five years would be only $269 million, but the total sav-ings through 2010 would be $596 million. Proponents of this option argue that the current system is unjustified and inefficient. Many critics feel that federal funding has done little to reduce thetime or effort candidates spend raising money from private sources. They alsocharge that candidates have found numerous indirect means of circumventinglimits on expenditures, such as \"issue advertisements\" paid for by parties orspecial interest groups. They dispute the need to give public funds either tomajor parties and candidates, which are already well-financed, or to minorparties and candidates, which have little chance of success. Finally, the propor-tion of taxpayers that choose to earmark a portion of their tax liability for thefund has declined steadily over the past two decades to less than 15 percent,which suggests that the program has little public support. Opponents of this option believe that the current system limits the influ- ence of special interests and wealthy contributors and allows poorly f unded candidates to positively influence the national debate. They argue that publicfunding has reduced candidates' and parties' dependence on contributions fromspecial interest groups, corporations, and the wealthy. They note that the fundsgiven to candidates from a minor party constitute only a small portion of totalpublic spending on Presidential elections (for the five elections between 1976and 1992, the amount was less than 2 percent) and allow such candidates tobring public attention to issues that might otherwise be ignored. 920 Allowances The President's budget and the Congressional budget resolution sometimes include amounts in function 920 to reflect proposals that are not clearly specified or that would affect multiple budget functions. Since theCongress actually appropriates money for specific purposes, there are no budget authority or outlay totalsfor function 920 in historical data. In this volume, function 920 includes options that cut across programsand agencies and would affect multiple functions.278 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 920-01 Eliminate Requirements That Agencies Purchase Alternative-Fuel Vehicles Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 11 8 2002 11 112003 11 112004 11 112005 11 11 2001-2005 55 52 2001-2010 110 107 Relative to WIDI 2001 11 8 2002 12 112003 13 122004 14 132005 15 14 2001-2005 65 58 2001-2010 152 143 SPENDING CATEGORY: Discretionary RELATED OPTION: 920-03As part of the federal government's efforts on behalf of cleaner air, the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) requires federal agencies to acquire light-duty cars andtrucks that can operate using an alternative fuel, such as compressed naturalgas, denatured ethanol, or electricity. Beginning in 1999, with certain excep-tions, 75 percent of light-duty vehicles acquired for federal fleets in high-density areas must be manufactured or converted to operate as a bi-fuel (gaso-line or alternative fuel), flexible-fuel (mixture), or dedicated-fuel (alternativefuel only) vehicle. EPACT annually applies to more than 20,000, or just underhalf, of new vehicles. Although agencies have yet to meet any of EPACT's annual targets for acquiring alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs), they increasingly add AFVs to theirfleets. According to the Department of Energy (DOE), to date the government(primarily the United States Postal Service) has ordered, acquired, or convertedmore than 55,000 AFVs, which can be considerably more expensive to buy andoperate than conventional vehicles. For example, the government spends about$4,000 more for a vehicle equipped to operate using compressed natural gas.Eliminating the EPACT requirement would save $107 million in federal trans-portation costs through 2010. The estimate of annual savings assumes that agencies will continue under current law to fall short of the 75 percent requirement until the end of the 10-year period. If agencies were to immediately meet current-law targets, increas-ing their use of AFVs, savings would be greater. The estimated budgetaryeffect of eliminating the EPACT requirement excludes annual savings to thePostal Service, which is classified as off-budget. An obvious advantage of eliminating the requirement is that it would reduce transportation costs to the federal government and the taxpayers. Inaddition, given the annual limits set in law for total discretionary spending, itmay no longer be desirable to require agencies to purchase the more expensiveAFVs. A disadvantage of eliminating the requirement is that the federal govern- ment would no longer be leading the conversion to AFVs. Such a policychange could discourage similar efforts at the state and local levels. In addition,the development of the AFV market and of less expensive vehicles of that typecould slow. Such a result could hurt clean air efforts. However, according toinformation from the General Services Administration and DOE, many agen-cies are primarily buying bi-fuel vehicles that comply with EPACT but that donot require the use of alternative fuels.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 920 279 920-02 Reduce the Number of Political Appointees Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 71 702003 75 752004 115 1132005 86 87 2001-2005 386 382 2001-2010 877 872 NOTES: Savings measured from the 2000 funding level adjusted forpay raises and changes in em-ployment. n.a. = not applicable. SPENDING CATEGORY: Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing the Pay and Benefits of Federal and Nonfederal Executives (Memorandum), November 1999.The term \"political appointee\" generally refers to employees of the federal government who are appointed by the President, some with and some withoutSenate confirmation, and to certain policy advisers hired at lower levels. Forthis discussion, the term \"political appointee\" refers to cabinet secretaries,agency heads, and other Executive Schedule employees at the very top ranks ofgovernment; top managers and supervisors who are noncareer members of theSenior Executive Service; and confidential aides and policy advisers referred toas Schedule C employees. The total number of employees in such positions,according to Congressional Budget Office projections, will average about2,700 over the next 10 years. If the government instead capped the number ofpolitical appointees at 2,000, savings over 10 years would total almost $900 million. The current average salary for political appointees, in CBO's calcula-tions, is estimated to be $89,000. Reports from several groups, including the National Commission on the Public Service and the Twentieth Century Fund, have called for cuts in thenumber of political appointees. The National Commission on the Public Ser-vice, also known as the Volcker Commission, called for setting a limit similarto the one described here. In addition to the problem of excessive organiza-tional layering, the Volcker Commission described concerns about many ap-pointees' lack of expertise in government operations and programs. In politicalappointments, the commission noted, political loyalties generally count morethan knowledge of government. Moreover, few appointees are in office longenough to acquire the necessary skills and experience to master their job. Thatlack of experience, according to the commission, means that political appoint-ees in many instances are not effective in carrying out the policies of the Presi-dent they serve and can disrupt an agency's daily operations. As a result, ca-reer managers become frustrated and demoralized, making recruitment andretention difficult in the top ranks of the career civil service. Critics of reducing the number of political appointees cite the importance of a President's establishing control over the vast bureaucracy by having like-minded individuals and allies strategically situated. Those appointees, criticsnote, form an important link to the electorate because they help to ensuregovernmentwide leadership that is consistent with the philosophy of eachelected President. Such appointees, moreover, can offer fresh perspectives andinnovation. The high rate of turnover among appointees, critics argue, meansthat those officials make way for someone new before they reach the point ofburnout.280 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 920-03 Charge Federal Employees Commercial Rates for Parking Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) 2001 110 2002 1102003 1102004 1102005 110 2001-2005 550 2001-2010 1,100 SPENDING CATEGORY: Mandatory RELATED OPTION: 920-01The federal government leases and owns more than 200,000 parking spaces, which it allocates to its employees\u2014in most cases without charge. Requiringfederal government employees to pay commercial rates for their parking couldyield receipts of $110 million in 2001, $550 million over five years, and $1.1billion over 10 years. Federal workers in the largest metropolitan areas would bear the brunt of the new charges. Those in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area would beaffected the most, paying about 75 percent of the total charge. (Federal em-ployees in less commercially developed areas, where charging for parking isuncommon, would not f ace new parking charges.) Employees who continued to use federally owned or managed parking would, on average, pay about $120per month; employees who currently use free or heavily subsidized parkingcould choose alternative means of transportation, such as public transportationor carpooling, to avoid the charge. Supporters of this option favor charging commercial rates for parking because it would encourage federal employees to use public transportation orcarpool. That would reduce the flow of cars into urban areas, cutting down onenergy consumption, air pollution, and congestion. By acting as a model em-ployer in this regard, the federal government could more effectively call onothers to reduce pollution and energy consumption. In addition, commercialpricing would indicate the demand for parking by federal workers more accu-rately, enabling the government to allocate spaces to those who valued them themost. Moreover, if commercial rates reduced demand for spaces sufficiently,the government might be able to put the unused spaces to new, higher-valueduses. Finally, some observers argue that the federal government should notprovide a valuable commodity, such as parking, free to workers who can affordto pay for it. Critics of this option argue that by charging for parking, the government would unfairly penalize workers in urban areas who have difficulty obtainingaccess to alternative transportation or who drive to work for valid personalreasons. Charging for parking would also reduce federal employees' total com-pensation. In addition, critics note that many private-sector employers providefree parking. Some people also have argued that charging commercial rateswould merely re-ration the existing spaces without reducing the number ofpeople who drive to work. According to that view, the spaces would simply beallocated by willingness to pay rather than by rank, seniority, or other factors.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 920 281 920-04 Impose a Fee on GSE Investment Portfolios Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays 2001 700 700 2002 700 7002003 700 7002004 700 7002005 700 700 2001-2005 3,500 3,500 2001-2010 7,000 7,000 SPENDING CATEGORY: Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 370-10 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS: Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac (Report), May 1996. The Federal Home Loan Banks in the Housing Finance System (Re- port), July 1993. Controlling the Risks of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (Report), April 1991.Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private financial institutions chartered by the federal government to support the flow of funds to agriculture,housing, and higher education. GSEs achieve their public purposes by borrow-ing on the strength of an implicit federal guarantee of their debt obligations.Investors infer the guarantee from the exemption of GSE securities from thenormal protection afforded to investors, Congressional support for the enter-prises' public purposes, their exemption from state and local taxes, and the hugevolume of their outstanding obligations. The implicit guarantee lowers GSEs'cost of borrowing, thus conveying subsidies that give them a competitive ad-vantage in financial markets. Before the 1990s, GSEs generally used the money they borrowed to make loans or buy loans made by other lenders. More recently, the three largestGSEs\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System\u2014have used borrowed funds to acquire enormous portfolios of debt securities.The investments consist mainly of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) but alsoinclude corporate bonds, mortgage revenue bonds, and asset-backed securities.At the end of 1999, the investment portfolios of those three enterprises totaled$745 billion, or 51 percent of their combined assets. A fourth GSE, FarmerMac, has acquired a smaller investment portfolio. The four enterprises conductan arbitrage between the market for GSE debt and that for private securities,profiting from the difference between the yields on their investments and theirown subsidized cost of funds. Imposing an annual fee on the four GSEs that earn arbitrage profits that would equal 10 cents for every $100 (10 basis points) of each GSE's holdingsof private securities that the enterprise finances with debt would save $700 million in 2001, $3.5 billion over five years, and $7.0 billion through 2010.The fee would reduce the compe titive advantage that GSEs have in holding private securities and, at least initially, would reduce the net income of the fourthat do so; their net income exceeded $8.0 billion (after taxes) in calendar year1999. The enterprises could avoid the fee by reducing their investment portfo-lios but would probably not do so because their cost advantage in issuing debtexceeds the fee. The GSEs could also try to recoup lost arbitrage profits byincreasing their risk or the prices they charge. Proponents of imposing the fee argue that the affected GSEs could still achieve their public missions with the fee. The Congress never intended theGSEs to crowd other investors out of the markets for MBSs and other debtsecurities. The profits of each enterprise subject to the fee would remain abovecompetitive levels (except for Farmer Mac, which earns low profits now). Thethree housing GSEs would still increase their purchases of MBSs when pricesfell, thereby stabilizing that market. Critics counter that greater risk taking bythe four enterprises could increase the government's risk exposure. Federalrisk-based capital requirements and regulatory examinations, if effective, wouldlimit the amount of any increase in the GSEs' risk borne by the government.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could possibly raise the interest rates on newmortgages they bought, but competition from wholly private firms and betweenthose two GSEs would limit their ability to do so.282 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 920-05 Repeal the Service Contract Act Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 960 915 2002 960 9602003 960 9602004 960 Contract Act of 1965 (SCA) sets basic labor standards for employees working on government contracts whose main purposeis to furnish labor, such as laundry, custodial, and guard services. Contractorscovered by the act generally must provide those employees with wages andfringe benefits that at least equal those prevailing in the contractors' locality orthose specified by a collective bargaining agreement of the previous contractor.The Department of Labor measures prevailing wages in an area according tothe specific wages and benefits earned by at least 50 percent of workers in aparticular type of job or by the average of the wages and benefits paid to work-ers in that type of job. The provision about collective bargaining agreementsapplies to successor contractors, regardless of whether their employees arecovered by such an agreement. In 1999, the SCA covered approximately 28,000 contracts valued at about $30 billion. The Department of Defense accounted for about half of that dollarvalue. The cost of services procured by the federal government could be reduced by repealing the SCA. Repealing the act would reduce outlays by about $900million in 2001 and by about $9.6 billion over the 2001-2010 period, providedthat federal agency appropriations were reduced to reflect the anticipated reduc-tion in costs. Federal procurement costs would fall because repealing the SCA would promote greater competition among bidders, although the precise magnitude ofthe savings is difficult to measure. Repealing the SCA would give contractorsadded flexibility that could allow them to reduce the costs of providing services.Opponents of this option are concerned, however, that it would allow bidders toundermine existing collective bargaining agreements. In additi on, repealing the SCA would reduce the compensation of workers in some firms that provideservices to the government, which opponents argue could reduce the quality ofsuch services.CHAPTER THREE SPENDING OPTIONS: FUNCTION 920 283 920-06-A Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 630 265 2002 630 7102003 Davis-Bacon Act has required that \"prevailing wages\" be paid on all federally funded or federally assisted construction projects with contractsof $2,000 or more. The Department of Labor measures prevailing wages in anarea according to the specific wages and benefits earned by at least 50 percentof workers in a particular type of job or the average of the wages and benefitspaid to workers in that type of job. Those procedures, as well as the classifica-tions of workers who receive prevailing wages, favor union wage rates in somecases. In 1999, approximately $57 billion in federal discretionary funds was authorized for construction projects covered by the Davis-Bacon Act. Fifty-four percent of that amount went to transportation projects, 13 percent went tothe Department of Housing and Urban Development and other community andregional development projects, and 14 percent went to the Department of De-fense. (Most of the spending authority for transportation projects is controlledby limitations on obligations rather than by budget authority.) The federal government could reduce outlays for construction by repealing the Davis-Bacon Act. Doing so would reduce discretionary outlays by about$265 million in 2001 and $10.5 b illion over the 2001-2010 period, provided that federal agency appropriations were reduced to reflect the anticipated reduc-tion in costs. Mandatory spending would fall by about $10 million in 2001 and$255 million over the 10-year period. Repealing the Davis-Bacon Act would allow the federal government to spend less on construction, although the precise effect of repealing the act oncontractors' costs is difficult to measure. In addition, it would probably in-crease the opportunities for employment that federal projects would offer lessskilled workers. However, such a change would lower the earnings of some construction workers. In addition, opponents of this option argue that eliminating Davis-Bacon requirements could jeopardize the quality of federally funded or feder-ally assisted construction projects. They contend that by requiring firms to payat least the locally prevailing wage, the people they hire are more likely to beable workers, resulting in fewer defects in the finished projects and more timelycompletion.284 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 920-06-B Raise the Threshold for Coverage Under the Davis-Bacon Act Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Relative to WODI 2001 205 50 2002 205 1552003 205 2152004 205 2452005 205 260 2001-2005 1,025 925 2001-2010 2,010 2,250 Relative to WIDI 2001 210 50 2002 215 1602003 220 2202004 225 2502005 230 270 2001-2005 repealing the Davis-Bacon Act (see option 920-06-A) would be to raise the threshold for determining which projects are covered by the act.In recent years, several bills have been introduced that would raise the thresh-old by various amounts. Raising it from $2,000 to $1 million would save about$50 million in 2001 and about $2.3 billion in discretionary outlays over the2001-2010 period, provided that federal agency appropriations were reduced toreflect the anticipated reduction in costs. In addition, it would save $1 millionin 2001 and $30 million over the 10-year period in mandatory spending. Al-though this option would save only about one-fifth of the amount that would besaved by repealing Davis-Bacon, the option would reduce firms' and the gov-ernment's administrative burden by restricting coverage to the largest contracts. As with repealing the Davis-Bacon Act, raising the threshold would allow the federal government to spend less on construction, although the precise effectof raising the threshold on contractors' costs is difficult to measure. In addition,it would probably increase the opportunities for employment that federal pro-jects would offer less skilled workers. However, such a change would lower the earnings of some construction workers. In addition, opponents of this option argue that raising the thresholdcould jeopardize the quality of federally funded or federally assisted construc-tion projects. They contend that by requiring firms to pay at least the locallyprevailing wage, the people they hire are more likely to be able workers, result-ing in fewer defects in the finished projects and more timely completion.Chapter Four Revenue Options CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 287 REV-01 Limit Mortgage Principal Eligible for Interest Deduction to $300,000 Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 2.6 2002 3.72003 4.12004 4.52005 4.9 2001-2005 19.8 2001-2010 51.3 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-02A home is the largest consumer purchase and the main investment for most Americans. The tax code has historically treated homes more favorably thanother investments. Most investments pay their return in cash that is subject toincome taxes. Homes, however, pay their return in housing services directly tothe owner, and that return is not subject to taxation. Furthermore, owners whohelp finance their home purchase with a mortgage are allowed to deduct theinterest even though the investment produces no taxable income. The tax codealso exempts most capital gains from home sales. Limiting mortgage interest deductions would reduce the preferential treat- ment of home ownership for owners who must borrow to purchase their homes.Under current law, taxpayers may deduct interest on up to $1 m illion of debt that they have incurred to acquire and improve first and second homes. Theymay also deduct interest on up to $100,000 of other loans they have securedwith a home (home-equity loans), regardless of purpose. No other type ofconsumer interest is deductible. Current law also limits the extent to whichinterest deductions for carrying assets other than first and second homes canexceed income from such assets. Lowering the limit on the amount of principal eligible for the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $300,000 would reduce deductions for 1.2million taxpayers with large mortgages and increase revenues by $51.3 billionover the 2001-2010 period. That change would reduce the deduction only forowners of relatively expensive homes. Only 5 percent of new mortgages origi-nated in 1998 exceeded $300,000. The fraction affected would be greatest inhigh-cost areas such as Honolulu and San Francisco. Preferential treatment for home ownership encourages people to become homeowners and to purchase larger homes. Increasing home ownership maycontribute to social and po litical stability by strengthening people's stake in their communities and governments. In addition, such preferential treatmentmay stabilize neighborhoods by encouraging longer-term residence and homeimprovement. The amount of preference, however, is probably larger thanneeded to maintain a high rate of home ownership among people buying homesvalued over $300,000. Canada achieves about the same rate of home owner-ship as the United States without allowing the deduction of mortgage interest.Instead of the deduction, some provinces provide a limited tax credit for low-and middle-income people who save for a down payment. A disadvantage of providing preferential tax treatment for investment in home ownership is that it reduces the amount of savings available for invest-ment in taxable business enterprises. Between one-quarter and one-third of netprivate investment typically goes into owner-occupied housing. Consequently,a reduction in investment in owner-occupied housing could raise investment noticeably in other sectors.288 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-02 Limit the Mortgage Interest Deduction for Second Homes Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.5 2002 0.72003 0.72004 0.72005 0.8 2001-2005 3.4 2001-2010 7.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-01Taxpayers who borrow to purchase or improve a second home may deduct the interest on that mortgage on the same terms as for a first home. The only limiton the amount borrowed for the two homes is that it be under $1 million. Fur-thermore, equity in both homes may be used as collateral to borrow $100,000that can be used for any purpose and whose interest may be deducted (home-equity loans). Several arguments for and against limiting the deductib ility of all mort- gage interest appear in option REV-01. Additional considerations apply tomortgage interest on second homes. Permitting taxpayers to deduct the interestfrom mortgages on second homes\u2014many of which are vacation homes\u2014mayseem inequitable when taxpayers cannot deduct interest from consumer loansused to finance either medical expenses or other consumer purchases. How-ever, limiting the deduction of mortgage interest to a single home would retainthe current deduction for taxpayers with high mortgage interest on a costlyprimary home while partially denying it for other taxpayers with equal com-bined mortgage interest on two less costly homes. The deductibility of mortgage interest could be limited to debt that tax- payers incur to acquire and improve a primary residence, plus $100,000 of other debt secured by that home. That approach would require interest deduc-tions for second homes to qualify under the $100,000 limit on home-equityloans if they are to be deductible. The limitation would increase revenue by$7.6 billion for the 2001-2010 period.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 289 REV-03 Limit Deductions of State and Local Taxes to the Amount Exceeding 2 Percent of Adjusted Gross Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 5.9 2002 19.82003 20.32004 20.92005 on Taxation.In determining their taxable income, taxpayers may claim a standard deduction or itemize and deduct from their adjusted gross income (AGI) certain specificexpenses, including state and local income, real estate, and personal propertytaxes. For taxpayers who itemize, those deductions provide a federal subsidyfor state and local tax payments. Consequently, the deductions indirectly fi-nance increased state and local government spending at the expense of otheruses of federal revenues. Limiting the deductibility of state and local tax payments to the amount in excess of 2 percent of AGI would continue the mitigating effect of the deduc-tion on differences in taxes among states and increase federal revenues byabout $202 billion over the 2001-2010 period. An alternative approach wouldbe to prohibit deductions above a fixed ceiling, which also might be a percent-age of AGI. A ceiling set at 5.85 percent of AGI would increase revenues byabout the same amount\u2014$206 billion in 2001 through 2010. A floor and aceiling, however, would have very different effects on incentives for state andlocal spending. A floor would retain the incentive for increased spending, but aceiling would reduce it. As a way to assist state and local governments, deductibility of state and local taxes has several disadvantages. First, the deductions reduce federal taxliability only for itemizers. Second, because the value of an additional dollar ofdeductions increases with the marginal tax rate, the deductions are worth moreto higher-bracket taxpayers. Third, deductibility favors wealthier communities.Communities with a higher average income level have more residents whoitemize and are therefore more likely to spend more because of deductibilitythan lower-income communities. Fourth, deductibility may discourage statesand localities from fin ancing services with nondeductible user fees, thereby discouraging efficient pricing of some services. An argument against restricting deductibility is that a taxpayer with a large state and local tax liability has less ability to pay f ederal taxes than one with equal total income and a smaller state and local tax bill. In some areas, ataxpayer who pays higher state and local taxes may receive more benefits frompublicly provided services, such as recreational facilities. In that case, thetaxes are more like payments for other goods and services (for example, privaterecreation) that are not deductible. Alternatively, higher public expendituresresulting from deductibility benefit all members of a community, includinglower-income nonitemizers who do not receive a direct tax saving.290 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-04 Limit Deductions for Charitable Gifts of Appreciated Property to Tax Basis Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.3 2002 1.72003 1.72004 1.82005 1.8 2001-2005 7.3 2001-2010 17.2 SOURCE: Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-05, REV-23-A, REV-23-B, and REV-24Under current law, taxpayers who itemize deductions may deduct the value of contributions they make to qualifying charitable organizations up to a max-imum of 50 percent of adjusted gross income in any year. In 1996, 32 milliontaxpayers claimed just over $86 billion of deductions for charitable contribu-tions, reducing federal revenues by about $22 billion. In addition to cash dona-tions, taxpayers may deduct the fair market value of a contribution of appreci-ated property that they have held for more than 12 months, regardless of howmuch they paid for the property. The deduction provides significant government support for charitable activities. But one criticism of the deduction is that it provides unequal federalmatching rates for contributions by different taxpayers. The government sub-sidy rates can approach 40 percent of contributions for the highest-incometaxpayers but are only 15 percent for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket andzero for people who do not itemize deductions. Another cr iticism is that the electorate as a whole, and not individual donors, should make decisions aboutwhich activities deserve taxpayer support. Limiting the deduction of appreciated property to a taxpayer's cost of an asset under the regular income tax would increase revenues by about $0.3 bil-lion in 2001 and by more than $17 billion over 10 years. The existing provi-sion allows taxpayers to deduct the entire value of assets they contributed eventhough they paid no tax on the gain from appreciation. That outcome providespreferential treatment to one kind of donation relative to other kinds and ex-pands the preferential treatment of capital gains (see options REV-23A, REV-23B, and REV-24). Indisputably, however, the current provision encouragespeople to donate appreciated assets, such as stock or art, to eligible activitiesrather than leave them to their heirs at death, when any gains also escape in-come tax (see also option REV-05).CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 291 REV-05 Limit Deductions for Charitable Giving to the Amount Exceeding 2 Percent of Adjusted Gross Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.7 2002 11.32003 11.82004 12.32005 12.9 2001-2005 50.0 2001-2010 125.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-04Current law allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct the value of contributions they make to qualifying charitable organizations up to a maximum of 50 per-cent of adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year. It also allows contributions ofappreciated property to be deducted at fair market value. One proposed changewould limit the deduction for donations of appreciated property to its tax basis(see option REV-04). Another way to limit the charitable deduction but retainan incentive for giving would be to allow taxpayers to deduct only contributionsthat exceed 2 percent of AGI. Such a limit would retain the incentive for increased giving by people who donate a large share of their income, but it would remove the incentive forpeople who contribute smaller amounts. It would completely disqualify thecharitable deductions of about 17.6 million taxpayers in 2000 and reduce al-lowed deductions for roughly another 16.1 million. The option would increaserevenues by nearly $2 billion in 2001 and by about $125 billion over the2001-2010 period. Such a cha nge would eliminate the tax incentive for just over half of the taxpayers who currently make and deduct charitable contribu-tions. As a result, overall charitable giving would decline. In add ition, it would encourage taxpayers who planned to make contributions over severalyears to lump them together in one tax year to qualify for a deduction with the2 percent floor.292 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-06 Phase Out the Child and Dependent Care Credit Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.5 2002 1.92003 1.92004 1.92005 1.8 2001-2005 8.0 2001-2010 16.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-12Taxpayers who incur employment-related expenses for the care of children and certain other dependents may claim an income tax credit. The credit per dollarof qualifying expenses declines from 30 percent for taxpayers whose adjustedgross income (AGI) is $10,000 or less to 20 percent for taxpayers whose AGIis $28,000 or more. Tax law limits creditable expenses to $2,400 for one childand $4,800 for two or more. The maximum credit for a taxpayer with one childand income above $28,000 is thus $480 each year. Creditable expenses cannotexceed the earnings of the taxpayer or, in the case of a couple, the earnings ofthe spouse with lower earnings. In 1998, taxpayers claimed about $2.5 billionin credits on 6 million tax returns. About two-fifths of the credit benefits taxpayers with AGI of $50,000 or more. Retaining the credit for only lower-income families would reduce itsrevenue cost. One way to do that would be to lower the percentage of credit asincome rises. For example, trimming the credit percentage by 1 percentagepoint for each $1,500 of AGI over $30,000\u2014and thus eliminating it completelyfor those with AGI over $58,500\u2014would raise $16 billion from 2001 through2010. That option would reduce or eliminate the credit for about 72 percent ofcurrently eligible families. Alternatively, phasing out the credit between$50,000 and $78,500 would raise about $11.3 billion in the same period. Thatoption would reduce or eliminate the credit for nearly half of the eligible fami-lies. Finally, phasing out the credit between $65,000 and $93,500 would raise$8.2 billion in the same period, reducing or eliminating the credit for about one-third of eligible families. The credit provides a work subsidy for families with children. Phasing out the credit for higher-income families targets the subsidy toward familieswith greater economic need, but it may dis courage parents in fam ilies with a reduced credit from working outside the home. If the credit was phased out, higher-income employees could seek other tax benefits for dependent care by asking their employers to provide subsidizedday care. Current law allows workers to exclude from taxable income up to$5,000 of a nnual earnings used to pay for dependent care thr ough employer- based programs. If more employer-subsidized dependent care was provided,budgetary savings would fall. To preclude taxpayers from using that alterna-tive, the Congress could limit the use of that fringe benefit (see option REV-12).CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 293 REV-07 Include Social Security Benefits in the Phaseout of the Earned Income Tax Credit Added Revenuesa (Billions of dollars) 2001 b 2002 0.92003 0.92004 0.92005 0.9 2001-2005 3.6 2001-2010 8.7 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Includes outlay savings. b. Less than $50 million.Under current law, the earned income tax credit (EITC) is phased out as the larger of earned income or adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a certainthreshold. To phase out the EITC, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 expandedthe definition of AGI to include tax-exempt interest and nontaxable distribu-tions from pensions, annuities, and individual retirement arrangements notrolled over into similar vehicles. The modified AGI still excludes most transferincome, however. Low-income families with significant transfer income canthus claim the EITC with total income that would reduce or deny the credit tootherwise equivalent families whose income is fully included in their AGI. Forsingle taxpayers with income above $25,000 and joint filers with income above$32,000, AGI includes up to half of Social Security benefits. This optionwould require that taxpayers include all Social Security benefits in a modifiedAGI used to phase out the EITC. That change would increase federal revenuesand decrease outlays for the EITC by a total of $0.9 billion in 2000 and $8.7billion over the 2001-2010 period. Counting all Social Security benefits to phase out the EITC would give the same EITC to low-income taxpayers receiving Social Security and claimingthe EITC as that received by otherwise comparable taxpayers whose incomederives entirely from sources fully included in AGI. The Internal RevenueService (IRS) already receives information on taxpayers' Social Security bene-fits, so administering this option would require only minor procedural changes. Because the modified AGI would still exclude some forms of transfer income, however, this option would not remove all differences in EITC forfamilies with the same total income. The IRS does not currently receive infor-mation on most forms of taxpayers' transfer income. As a result, counting alltransfer income would require a substantial expansion of information reportingto the IRS and a marked increase in taxpayers' compliance costs. Furthermore,because most transfer income not included in AGI is means-tested, counting alltransfers in phasing out the EITC would offset, at least in part, the goal of pro-viding income to poor recipients. Even so, excluding any transfers from theincome measure used to phase out the EITC would result in differential treat-ment of otherwise equivalent taxpayers. In addition, counting Social Security benefits for the EITC phaseout would increase compliance costs for Social Security recipients claiming thecredit and would further complicate the already complex form taxpayers mustcomplete to claim the credit. That would run counter to recent efforts to sim-plify procedures for claiming the EITC.294 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-08 Limit the Tax Benefit of Itemized Deductions to 15 Percent Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Taxation.Current law allows taxpayers to reduce taxable income by the amount of item- ized deductions. Taxpayers who itemize may deduct state and local income andproperty taxes, home mortgage interest payments, contributions to charity,employee business expenses, moving expenses, casualty and theft losses, andmedical and dental expenses. Taxpayers benefit from itemizing if their deduc-tions exceed the standard deduction. Current law limits some itemized deduc-tions to the amount in excess of a percentage of adjusted gross income, and itreduces all itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The tax benefit of itemized deductions, like that of all deductions, in- creases with a taxpayer's marginal tax bracket. For example, $10,000 in item-ized deductions would reduce taxes by $1,500 for a taxpayer in the 15 percenttax bracket, $2,800 for a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket, and $3,960 for ataxpayer in the 39.6 percent bracket. Most taxpayers do not itemize deduc-tions. Of the 30 percent of taxpayers who do itemize, however, about half are intax brackets above 15 percent. This option would limit the tax benefit of item-ized deductions to 15 percent for those higher-bracket taxpayers. The limitwould increase revenues by about $440 billion over five years and $1,094billion over 10 years. Limiting the tax benefit of itemized deductions would make the income tax more progressive by raising average tax rates for most middle- and upper-income taxpayers. The limit might also improve economic efficiency because itwould reduce tax subsidies that lower the after-tax prices of selected goods,such as mortgage-financed, owner-occupied housing. The itemized deductions for health expenses, casualty losses, and em- ployee business expenses, however, are not subsidies of voluntary activities butare instead allowances for costs that reduce the ability to pay income tax.Under this option, some taxpayers would pay tax on income they use to defraysuch costs because they would pay tax on their gross income at rates above 15percent but could deduct only 15 percent of the cost of earning income. Thus,an individual with unusually high medical bills, for example, would pay moretax than another individual with the same ability to pay but low medical bills. Like other limits on itemized deductions, this option would create incen- tives for taxpayers to avoid the limit by converting itemized deductions intoreductions in income. For example, taxpayers might draw down assets to repaymortgages, reducing both income and mortgage payments, or donate time orservices rather than cash to charities. The option would also make calculatingtaxes more complex for itemizers.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 295 REV-09 Impose an Excise Tax on Nonretirement Fringe Benefits Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 5.7 2002 8.52003 9.02004 9.62005 10.1 2001-2005 42.9 2001-2010 103.2 Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-10, REV-11, and REV-12Unlike employee compensation paid in cash, many fringe benefits are exempt from income and payroll taxes. The exemption of employer-paid health and lifeinsurance premiums from tax will cost about $63 billion in income taxes and$50 billion in payroll taxes in 2001. In add ition, the law explicitly excludes from gross income employer-paid dependent care and miscellaneous benefitssuch as employee discounts and parking valued below a specified limit. Impos-ing an excise tax on fringe benefits would diminish the effects of those exclu-sions. Excluding fringe benefits from gross income effectively subsidizes their cost, leading people to consume more of such benefits than they would if theyhad to pay the full price. As a result, resources may be allocated inefficiently.For example, excluding employer-provided health insurance has contributed tothe large and growing demand for health care services (see option REV-10). Such exclusions are inequitable because individuals whose compensation is paid all in cash pay more tax than others with the same total income paidpartly in fringe benefits. That inequity is exacerbated to the extent that employ-ees' higher demand for fringe benefits drives up their price for people who haveto purchase them with after-tax dollars. Moreover, because the tax exclusion isworth more to taxpayers in higher tax brackets and because higher-incometaxpayers receive more fringe benefits than lower-income people, the tax sav-ings from the exclusion are unevenly distributed among income groups. Making all fringe benefits taxable poses difficulties in valuing benefits and in assigning their value to individual employees. That problem could beavoided by imposing on employers an excise tax on the value of the benefitsthey provide. Those benefits would include the employer's share of healthinsurance (see option REV-10); premiums to f und the first $50,000 of life insurance, the part that is excluded from income (see option REV-11); depend-ent care (see option REV-12); athletic facilities; employee discounts; and park-ing with a value up to the amount above which it is currently taxed. (Undercurrent law, employees must include in taxable income in 2000 the marketvalue in excess of $175 per month of any parking provided free of charge by anemployer.) A 3 percent excise tax imposed on fringe benefits, for example,would raise $103.1 billion from 2001 through 2010. The bulk of those reve-nues would come from taxing employer-paid health insurance. This option would require that employers know only their total fringe benefit costs, not the value of benefits paid to each employee. Because theexcise tax rate would be much lower than the tax rate on wages, this optionwould maintain most of the incentive for employers to provide fringe benefitsinstead of taxable wages. An excise tax on employers would be relatively morefavorable to employees in higher-wage firms than including fringe benefits inemployees' taxable income because the excise tax rate would not rise with em-ployees' income.296 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-10 Limit the Tax Exemption of Employer-Paid Health Insurance Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Income TaxPayroll Tax 2001 7.7 5.9 2002 12.2 9.32003 13.7 10.32004 188.9 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Tax Treatment of Employment- Based Health Insurance (Study), March 1994.Employees do not pay taxes on income they receive in the form of employer- paid health insurance. In addition, health insurance premiums and health carecosts paid through cafeteria plans are generally excludable from income andpayroll taxes. Those exclusions will reduce income tax revenues and payrolltax revenues by a total of about $113 billion in 2001. One way to limit the exclusion would be to treat as taxable income for employees any employer contributions for health insurance plus health carecosts paid through cafeteria plans that exceed $500 a month for family cover-age and $200 a month for individual coverage. Those amounts are estimatedaverage contributions for 2001 and would be indexed to reflect future increasesin the general level of prices. The option would increase income tax revenuesby $189 billion and payroll tax revenues by $138 billion over the 2001-2010period. Including employer-paid health care coverage in the Social Securitywage base, however, would lead to increased outlays for Social Security bene-fits in the future that could offset a significant part of the added payroll tax revenues from this option over the long run. This option would eliminate the tax incentive to purchase additional cov- erage beyond the ceiling. Employees would have more incentive to economizein the medical marketplace, which could reduce both upward pressure on medi-cal care prices and the provision of unnecessary or marginal services. Theoption would index the ceiling amounts to the overall inflation rate, and sincehealth care costs have been rising faster than that, it could constrain health carecosts even more over time. The Congress has already limited the exclusion foremployer-paid group term life insurance in a similar way. One disadvantage of limiting the tax exemption of employer-paid medical insurance premiums is the difficulty of determining when extensive coveragebecomes excessive. In addition, the level of coverage purchased by a givenpremium depends on such factors as geographic location and the characteristicsof a firm's workforce. As a result, a uniform ceiling would have uneven effects.Finally, if health insurance costs continued to rise faster than the general levelof prices, indexing to reflect that level would gradually reduce subsidies foremployer-paid health insurance. Taken together, those factors could increasethe number of workers without health insurance and generate inequities amongtaxpayers by region and type of employer.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 297 REV-11 Include Employer-Paid Life Insurance in Taxable Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Income TaxPayroll Tax 2001 1.1 0.6 2002 1.6 0.92003 1.6 0.92004 1.7 1.02005 1.7 1.0 2001-2005 7.7 4.4 2001-2010 17.2 10.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

The exclusion is not available to the self-employed. Employer-paid life insurance is the third most expensive tax-advantaged fringe benefit(after health insurance, discussed in option REV-10, and pensions). Includingemployer-paid premiums in taxable income would add $17.2 billion to incometax revenues and $10.1 billion to payroll tax revenues from 2001 through 2010. Like the tax exclusion for other employment-based fringe benefits, the tax exclusion for life insurance creates a subsidy for that benefit, which causespeople to purchase more life insurance than they would if they had to pay thefull cost themselves. Furthermore, the tax exclusion allows workers whoseemployers purchase life insurance for them to pay less tax than workers whohave the same total compensation but must purchase insurance on their own(see option REV-09). In addition, the value of employer-paid life insurance,unlike some other fringe benefits, could be accurately measured and allocated.Employers could report the premiums they paid for each employee on the em-ployee's W-2 form and compute withholding in the same way as for wages.Indeed, employers already withhold taxes on life insurance premiums that funddeath benefits above the $50,000 limit. A tax subsidy to provide life insurance might be called for, however, if people buy too little life insurance because they systematically underestimatethe potential financial hardship to their families resulting from their death. Butwhether people purchase too little insurance for that reason is unclear. More-over, even if it was clear, a more efficient way of allocating resources might beto provide a direct tax subsidy to all purchasers of life insurance and avoidlimiting the subsidy to insurance provided by employers.298 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-12 Eliminate the Employer Exclusion for Dependent Care Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.1 2002 0.42003 0.42004 0.42005 0.5 2001-2005 1.8 2001-2010 4.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-06 and REV-09The tax system provides two types of subsidies for child and other dependent care expenses of working taxpayers. Those subsidies are provided as exclu-sions from income paid to an employee or as a tax credit for those not usingemployment-based subsidies. Although those subsidies provide benefits for thesame activities, the value of the subsidy from employer-based exclusions canbe much larger than that provided under the child and dependent care credit.Eliminating the exclusions and making all tax benefits for child and dependentcare available only through the credit would increase revenues by $4.5 billionfrom 2001 through 2010. Employers may exclude up to $5,000 for child and dependent care ex- penses from the taxable wages of their employees, either as care provided di-rectly by the employer or as other-than-employer care if the employer has es-tablished a qualified plan. The maximum amount of the exclusion is limited toa taxpayer's earnings or the earnings of the lesser-earning spouse for marriedtaxpayers, and\u2014as with all types of exclusions\u2014the value of the exclusiondepends on the marginal tax rate of the taxpayer. The exclusion also reducesemployers' and employees' liability for Social Security and Medicare payrolltaxes. Taxpayers who do not receive employment-based subsidies may claim a nonrefundable income tax credit, limited to expenses of $2,400 for one depend-ent and $4,800 for two or more dependents. As with the exclusion, the totalamount of qualifying expenses may not exceed the earnings of the taxpayer or,in the case of a couple, the lower-earning spouse. The credit rate per dollar ofqualifying expenses is 30 percent for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income(AGI) is $10,000 or less and is phased down to 20 percent for taxpayers whoseAGI is $28,000 or more. Most taxpayers receive the 20 percent rate with aresulting maximum credit of $480 for one child and $960 for two or more chil-dren. In 1996, about 6 million taxpayers claimed $2.5 billion in credits. Even though they subsidize the same activities, the credit and the exclu- sion provide significantly different benefits. For example, a high-income tax-payer with one child may receive an income tax benefit of up to $1,980 underthe employer exclusion but only $480 under the credit. In addition, the exclu-sion reduces payroll taxes, but no such benefit is available with the credit.Eliminating the exclusion would provide equitable treatment for taxpayers withsimilar dependent care circumstances regardless of whether their employer hasestablished a qualifying exclusion program. In addition, it would reduce com-plexity by simplifying taxpayer calculations. However, eliminating the exclusion would reduce the total subsidies available for dependent care expenses and could induce some workers (particu-larly second earners in couples) to leave the labor force. If dependent care isconsidered a cost of employment, then eliminating the exclusion may be inap-propriate since some costs of employment are excludable.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 299 REV-13 Include the Income-Replacement Portion of Workers' Compensation and Black Lung Benefits in Taxable Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.9 2002 5.42003 5.62004 5.82005 6.0 2001-2005 24.7 2001-2010 58.9 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Current law exempts workers' compensation and Black Lung benefits from in-come tax.

The remaining portion of benefits,which reimburses employees for their medical costs (about 40 percent), wouldcontinue to be exempt from taxation. Taxing the income-replacement portion of those benefits would make their tax treatment comparable with that of unemployment benefits and the wage-replacement benefits that employers provide through sick pay and disabilitypensions. It would also improve work incentives for disabled workers who areable to return to work. (Under current law, the after-tax value of the wages theyare able to earn may be less than the tax-free benefits they receive while dis-abled.) Taxing any portion of workers' compensation would, however, be a depar- ture from the treatment of settlements for non-work-related injuries. Adjudicatedawards and noninsurance settlements for such injuries are not taxable to therecipient even though they are deductible to the payer to the extent that theyrepresent compensatory damages. Current-law treatment of workers' compensa-tion benefits is consistent with this approach, but the proposed change is not. Neither the current treatment of workers' compensation benefits nor the proposed change is entirely consistent with the treatment of private insurancesettlements for non-work-related injuries. Such settlements are not taxable to therecipient, but the premiums for such insurance are paid out of after-tax income.That is the equivalent of including employer contributions to workers' compensa-tion funds in the taxable income of employees. If the insurance fund is workingproperly, such an arrangement will, over the long term, generate a similaramount of revenue as will taxing benefits. That arrangement, however, distrib-utes the burden of the tax much more broadly than does the proposal to tax bene-fits. Finally, if the current levels of wage-replacement benefits were established under the assumption that they would not be taxed, this option would reducebenefits below desired levels. Enacting the option might therefore lead to effortsto increase benefits, thereby potentially reducing the budget surplus.300 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-14-A Include 85 Percent of Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in Taxable Income for All Recipients Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 8.7 2002 22.02003 22.82004 23.62005 24.3 2001-2005 101.4 2001-2010 REV-14-C, and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION: Reducing Entitlement Spending(Study), September 1994.Under current law, most benefits from Social Security and Railroad Retirement are not subject to tax. Only if the sum of adjusted gross income (AGI), nontax-able interest income, and one-half of Social Security and Tier I benefits exceedsa fixed threshold does a recipient pay tax on any benefits. If that sum exceeds$25,000 for single returns or $32,000 for joint returns, up to 50 percent ofbenefits are subject to tax. Above a second set of thresholds\u2014$34,000 (single)and $44,000 (joint)\u2014up to 85 percent of benefits are subject to tax. Aboutone-third of households receiving Social Security will pay income tax on someportion of their benefits in 2001, and about one-half of those households willpay tax on 85 percent of their benefits. Because the thresholds remain fixedover time, as nominal incomes increase, the percentage of households that paytax on benefits will grow to 36 percent in 2004. Bills to remove the 85 percentrate have been proposed in recent years but have not been enacted. Requiring all beneficiaries to include 85 percent of their benefits in their AGI would raise $234.7 billion from 2001 through 2010. That change wouldincrease the share of recipients paying tax on their benefits from 31 percent to72 percent. Other features of the tax code would continue to exempt about one-fourth of elderly households from taxation. Eliminating the thresholds would reduce tax disparities among middle- income households. Social Security beneficiaries receive a tax preference notavailable to other taxpayers because they may exclude a portion of their in-come\u2014benefits below the thresholds\u2014from AGI. As a result, middle-incomeelderly families pay less tax than nonelderly families with comparable income. This option would treat Social Security roughly the same as contributory pension plans. Workers receiving benefits from the latter pay income tax onthe excess of benefits over their own contributions. Social Security actuariesestimate that among workers now entering the labor force, employee-paid pay-roll taxes will amount to no more than 15 percent of expected benefits. Thus,85 percent is the minimum fraction of benefits in excess of past contributions. Retirees might feel that increased taxes on benefits violate the implicit promises of the Social Security and Railroad Retirement programs. The gov-ernment has, however, changed the Social Security and Railroad Retirementprograms often, altering the benefit formula, introducing partial taxation ofbenefits, and raising payroll tax rates to finance the programs. Finally, in-creased taxation of benefits is one way to apply a means test to program pay-ments.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 301 REV-14-B Include 85 Percent of Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in Taxable Income for Higher-Income Recipients and Include 50 Percent for All Other Recipients Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 4.2 2002 10.62003 11.02004 11.32005 11.6 2001-2005 48.7 2001-2010 : REV-14-A, REV-14-C, and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Under current law, low-income Social Security recipients pay no income tax on their benefits. Recipients with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) above$25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers) pay tax on up to half of their Social Securitybenefits; those with modified AGI above $34,000 ($44,000 for joint filers)must include up to 85 percent of their benefits in taxable income (see optionREV-14-A). This option would continue to tax up to 85 percent of benefits fortaxpayers with income above the higher thresholds but would require all otherrecipients to include half of their benefits in AGI. It would raise $112 billionfrom 2001 through 2010. Under this option, the Social Security benefits of couples with combined income below $32,000 and individuals with combined income below $25,000would be subject to tax. Compared with the previous option (REV-14-A), thisproposal would protect a larger share of benefits received by lower-incomebeneficiaries from taxati on. Roughly 40 percent of beneficiaries would con- tinue to pay no taxes, compared with about 28 percent under the previous op-tion. Under this option, however, beneficiaries with somewhat higher income (whose benefits now are taxed at less than 50 percent) would receive lowerafter-tax benefits. Any such reduction in benefits might be viewed by recipi-ents as violating promises made during their working years about the benefitsthey could expect to receive during retirement.302 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-14-C Include 85 Percent of Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in Taxable Income for Higher-Income Recipients Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 2.5 2002 5.12003 5.62004 6.02005 6.5 2001-2005 25.7 2001-2010 67.1 SOURCE: Joint on Taxation.

This option would continue to exempt the Social Security benefitsof low-income recipients from taxation but would require recipients with modi-fied AGI above $25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers) to include up to 85 percent oftheir benefits in AGI. It would raise $67.1 billion from 2001 through 2010.Moreover, it would almost exclusively affect individuals with income between$25,000 and $34,000 and couples with modified income between $32,000 and$44,000. Few of the 69 percent of all recipients whose benefits are not now subject to the income tax would be taxed under this option. Because 85 percent ratherthan 50 percent of benefits would be included in modified AGI measuredagainst the thresholds, some of those beneficiaries who now fall just below thethresholds would move above them and have a portion of their benefits subjectto tax. Like option REV-14-A, this option would treat Social Security benefits the same as private pensions, taxing roughly that portion of benefits that ex-ceeds the recipient's own contributions. But by maintaining the thresholds, lower-income recipients would continue to receive the favorable tax treatmentnow accorded to their Social Security benefits. Continuing to have thresholds, however, would also maintain some disin- centive for workers to save for their retirements. Recipients whose benefits areonly partly over the taxable threshold face increased effective taxes on incomefrom savings. An additional dollar of interest income, for example, would incurnot only an income tax on that dollar but would also make an add itional 85 cents of Social Security benefits subject to tax by pushing that additionalamount over the threshold. The dollar of interest income would thus face aneffective tax rate 1.85 times that incurred by a person whose benefits are eithertaxed fully or not at all. Therefore, a taxpayer in the 15 percent tax bracketwould owe an additional $27.75 of tax on $100 more of interest income. Al-though current law also has a disincentive to saving, its effect would be exacer-bated by the increase in the share of benefits subject to taxation above thethresholds from 50 percent to 85 percent.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 303 REV-15 Include Investment Income from Life Insurance and Annuities in Taxable Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 11.1 2002 22.52003 23.22004 23.82005 24.5 2001-2005 105.1 2001-2010 on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-11Life insurance policies and annuities often combine features of both insurance and tax-favored savings accounts. The investment income from the savings,sometimes called \"inside buildup,\" is not taxed until it is paid out to the policy-holder. If it is left to the policyholder's estate or used to pay for life insurance,it can escape taxation entirely. Under this option, life insurance companies would notify policyholders annually of the investment income realized on their account, just as mutualfunds do now. Individuals would incl ude those am ounts in their taxable in- come. Life insurance disbursements and annuity benefits would no longer betaxable as they were paid. Making the investment income taxable in that waywould raise almost $239 billion in 2001 through 2010. Investment incomefrom annuities purchased as part of a qualified pension plan or qualified indi-vidual retirement account would still be tax-deferred until benefits were paid. The tax deferral currently allowed for life insurance and annuities is simi- lar to the deferral allowed for unrealized capital gains income. Taxing theinvestment income from life insurance and annuities annually would equalizetheir tax treatment with that of a bank account, taxable bond, or mutual fund. A tax incentive to purchase life insurance is desirable if people system- atically underestimate the financial hardship on spouses and families caused bytheir own death. Such shortsightedness could cause them to buy too little lifeinsurance. Similarly, it might cause people to buy too little annuity insurance toprotect them against ou tliving their assets. But it is not currently known whether people would buy too little insurance without the tax incentive or theextent to which the tax incentive might increase the amount of life insurance orannuity coverage purchased. If the incentive is justified to correct for people'sshortsightedness rather than subsidize the inside buildup, a better policy mightbe to subsidize life insurance directly by allowing a tax credit or partial deduc-tion for insurance premiums. Annuities receive other tax incentives through thespecial tax treatment of pensions and retirement savings. A tax preference for inside buildup in life insurance policies and annuities has an uncertain effect on savi ng. It may encourage saving because it would increase people's income when they are older for each dollar they saved whenthey were younger. The tax preference might, however, reduce saving becauseit also enables people to save less when they are younger without reducing theirexpected income when they are older.304 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-16 Include an Income-Related Portion of the Insurance Value of Medicare Benefits in Taxable Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Tax HI OnlyTax SMI OnlyTax Both 2001 3.1 1.9 5.2 2002 8.0 5.1 13.32003 8.6 5.7 14.62004 9.5 6.4 16.32005 10.5 190.1 = Hospital Insurance; SMI = Supplementary 570-18, 570-19-A, and 570-19-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Even though Social Security benefits are at least partially taxable under current law (see options REV-14-A, REV-14-B, and REV-14-C), Medicare benefitsare not subject to tax. This option would include 85 percent of the insurancevalue of Hospital Insurance (HI) and 75 percent of the insurance value of Sup-plementary Medical Insurance (SMI) in adjusted gross income (AGI), to theextent that combined income (AGI plus nontaxable interest income plus one-half of Social Security, Railroad Retirement, and Medicare benefits) exceeds$34,000 for single returns and $44,000 for joint returns. Administering thisoption would be straightforward because a mechanism is already in place fortaxing Social Security benefits. (The percentages roughly represent the shareof program costs not paid for by recipients through either payroll taxes duringtheir working years or SMI premiums.) Taxpayers with combined incomebelow those thresholds but above $25,000 (single) and $32,000 (joint) wouldinclude 50 percent of the insurance value of both HI and SMI in AGI. Taxpay-ers with lower income would be unaffected. Because the thresholds are notindexed for inflation, however, a larger fraction of Medicare insurance benefitswould become taxable over time. From 2001 through 2010, the HI tax alone would increase federal reve- nues by $109.8 billion, and the SMI tax alone would yield $76.1 billion. Im-posing both taxes simultaneously would raise revenues by about $190.1 billionover 10 years. The combined tax would generate more revenue than the sum ofthe HI and SMI taxes because some taxpayers would face higher tax rates astheir AGI increased. In addition, combining HI and SMI taxes would movemore enrollees above the threshold. Earmarking revenues from taxing HI benefits for the HI trust fund would delay the deficit of the trust fund. A tax on SMI benefits would shift some SMIcosts from taxpayers to enrollees. Using income thresholds would leave lower-income enrollees unaffected. In fact, because many enrollees do not have topay income taxes, this proposal would affect only about 33 percent of enrolleesin 2001. Because the tax would apply to in-kind benefits rather than cash income, some enrollees might object that the additional taxable amounts do not repre-sent cash with which to pay the tax liability. An alternative option would forgo income thresholds and include 85 per- cent of the insurance value of HI benefits and 75 percent of the insurance valueof SMI in AGI for all taxpayers. With no income thresholds, the HI and SMItaxes would raise $294.9 billion over the 2001-2010 period.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 305 REV-17 Raise the Age Limit for the Kiddie Tax from 14 to 18 for Taxing Investment Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 a 2002 0.12003 0.12004 0.12005 0.2 2001-2005 0.5 2001-2010 1.8 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Gain of less than $50 million.Under current law, investment income received by a dependent child under age 14 in excess of specified limits is subject to federal income tax at the parents'marginal tax rate. In 1999, the applicable limit was $1,400. The provision\u2014often referred to as the \"kiddie tax\"\u2014is intended to limit the ability of parentsto reduce the income tax on investment income by transferring ownership ofassets to their young children. It does not, however, preclude parents fromreducing their tax bills by giving investment assets to children older than 13.Under current law, income from assets in the name of a child over age 13 istaxed at the child's rate, generally 15 percent, rather than at the parents' taxrate, which can be as high as 39.6 percent. On annual asset income of $10,000,for example, that difference can cut the family's tax bill from $3,960 to $1,500,or more than 60 percent This option would raise from 14 to 18 the age limit below which a child's investment income is taxed at parents' rates. It would increase income taxrevenues by $1.8 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Extending the kiddie tax to older children would help prevent parents from sheltering assets to reduce their tax liability. However, not all assets are ownedby older children because their parents want to shelter investment income byshifting assets into their children's names. An older child may have earned andsaved substantial funds for many years, in which case it is reasonable that theincome from those assets should be taxed at the child's rate rather than theparents' rate. Imposing the parents' higher rate could discourage teenagers fromsaving earnings or gifts.306 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-18 Expand Medicare Coverage to Include State and Local Government Employees Not Now Covered Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.1 2002 1.52003 1.42004 1.32005 1.3 2001-2005 6.6 2001-2010 11.3Certain groups of state and local government employees are not covered by Medicare, despite expansions of coverage in 1985 and 1990. (All federal em-ployees have been covered since 1983, as required by the Tax Equity and Fis-cal Responsibility Act of 1982.) The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcili-ation Act of 1985 mandated that state and local employees who began workafter March 31, 1986, pay Medicare payroll taxes, but it did not make coveragemandatory for those hired before that date. The Omnibus Budget Reconcilia-tion Act of 1990 expanded Medicare coverage to include all state and localgovernment employees not covered by any retirement plan. Under current law, many state and local employees will qualify for Medi- care benefits on the basis of other employment in covered jobs or their spouse'semployment. Those employees will receive benefits as if they had workedcontinuously in covered employment. One out of eight state and local employ-ees is not covered by Medicare through employment, but most of those notcovered receive Medicare benefits through their spouse or because of work incovered employment. Requiring all state and local employees to pay Medicare payroll taxes would make their coverage resemble that of federal employees. Broader cover-age would reduce the inequity from the high benefits those employees receive inrelation to payroll taxes paid. Expanding Medicare coverage to include morestate and local employees would increase the government's liability for futureprogram benefits. The additional revenues, however, would most likely morethan offset increased benefits permanently. Expanding Medicare coverage to include state and local government employees who began work before April 1, 1986, would raise $11.3 billionfrom 2001 through 2010. The annual revenue gain would decline gradually asemployees who were hired before April 1986 leave state and local governmentpayrolls.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 307 REV-19 Make Calculation of Taxable Wages for Self-Employed People Equivalent to Calculation for Other Workers Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) On- BudgetOff- Budget 2001 0.1 0.1 2002 0.2 0.12003 0.2 0.12004 0.2 0.12005 0.2 0.1 2001-2005 0.9 0.5 2001-2010 2.2 1.1Social Security and Medicare taxes come in two forms: the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax paid on wages and the Self-Employment Contri-bution Act (SECA) tax paid on self-employment income. For FICA taxes,employees and employers each pay a 6.2 percent Social Security tax on wagesup to a taxable maximum ($76,200 in 2000) and a 1.45 percent Medicare taxon all wages. Until 1983, the SECA rate was explicitly set lower than the combined employer and employee FICA rate. As part of the Social Security Amendmentsof 1983, the Congress increased effective SECA rates starting in 1984. Theconference comm ittee said that the law was \"designed to achieve parity be- tween employees and the self-employed\" beginning in 1990. Nonetheless, thecurrent method for calculating SECA taxes allows a self-employed taxpayer topay less tax than a non-self-employed worker with the same nominal income.For example, an employee earning $50,000 and his or her employer each pay$3,825 in FICA taxes, so that employee's total compensation is $53,825 and thetotal FICA tax But self-employed sibling also earnstotal compensation of $53,825, under current law that person would pay only$7,605 in SECA taxes, $45 less than the non-self-employed sibling would pay. For people with earnings above the taxable maximum, the amount of Social Security tax paid is the same for the self-employed and the non-self-employed; however, the amount of Medicare tax paid is less for the self-em-ployed. For example, an employee earning $100,000 and his or her employereach pay $4,501 in Social Security taxes and $1,450 in Medicare taxes, so thatemployee's total compensation is $105,951 and the total FICA tax is $11,902.That person's self-employed sibling\u2014with the same total compensation\u2014paysthe same maximum Social Security tax but a Medicare tax of only $2,838, or$62 less. High-income, self-employed taxpayers may have a SECA Medicaretax liability as much as 6.3 percent less than that of non-self-employed taxpay-ers. That difference has existed since 1991, when the Congress first set theMedicare taxable maximum higher than the Social Security taxable maximum.Correcting the difference would require a slight addition to Schedule SE, but itwould directly affect only self-employed taxpayers with income above the tax-able maximum. Changing the SECA calculation formula would increase on-budget reve- nues by $2.2 billion from 2001 to 2010. Off-budget SECA revenues, which aredeposited into the Social Security trust funds, would increase by $1.1 billion.308 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-20 Eliminate the Source Rules Exception for Inventory Sales Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.2 2002 2.72003 2.92004 3.12005 3.4 2001-2005 13.3 2001-2010 34.3 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-21Under current law, income allocation rules effectively subsidize the export of U.S.-made products of some multinational corporations. The \" title passage\" rule, which specifies the allocation of income between domestic and foreignbusiness activities, routinely allows U.S. multinational corporations to use ex-cess foreign tax credits to offset about half of the U.S. tax on their export in-come by characterizing it as foreign-source income, even if the inventory ispurchased in the United States and the income from the sale is not subject toforeign tax. U.S. corporations generally pay U.S. tax on their worldwide income. Corporations are allowed a tax credit against their U.S. tax liability on foreignincome for the amount of income tax paid abroad on that income. The credit islimited to the U.S. tax liability that would have been assessed on that income.If the corporation paid more foreign tax on foreign income than it would havepaid on otherwise identical domestic income, the firm has excess foreign taxcredits. The title passage rule allows a company with excess foreign tax creditsto classify more of its export income as foreign source than it could justifysolely on the basis of the location of its business activities, implicitly giving thecompany an export subsidy. About half of the export income of such compa-nies is effectively exempted from U.S. tax. Replacing the title passage rule with an activity-based rule, which would apportion income on the basis ofactual economic activity, would increase tax revenues by $1.2 billion in 2001and by $34.3 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Export subsidies increase investment and employment in export indus- tries, but most economists agree that such subsidies do not increase the overalllevels of domestic investment and domestic employment and, in fact, typicallyreduce domestic well-being. Foreign-exchange effects cause imports to in-crease as much as exports, thus reducing investment and employment in import-competing industries in the United States. Export subsidies distort the alloca-tion of resources domestically and abroad; as a result, the United States re-ceives fewer imports in exchange for exports. In addition, the existing rulegives U.S. multinational exporters a competitive advantage over U.S. exportersthat conduct all of their business domestically. Current allocation rules makeU.S. corporations with excess foreign tax credits more competitive with foreigncorporations operating in the same markets; U.S. corporations without foreigntax credits do not receive that advantage. Finally, the U.S. income tax treatysystem, established since the title passage rule was enacted 70 years ago, oftenprotects U.S. export sales income from local taxation in the country where thegoods are sold. Because export sales income is not usually subject to foreigntax, it may not be appropriate to allow foreign tax credits to be used to offsetU.S. tax liability on that income.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 309 REV-21 Treat Foreign Sales Corporations Like Other Foreign Subsidiaries Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.3 2002 3.02003 3.22004 3.42005 3.7 2001-2005 14.6 2001-2010 37.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-20The tax code effectively subsidizes U.S. exports through rules for foreign sales corporations (FSCs). Intended to encourage U.S. firms to produce exports athome rather than overseas, those rules offer U.S. companies an opportunity toexempt about 15 percent of their export income from U.S. tax by characterizingit as income of a foreign subsidiary that is not effectively connected with a U.S.trade or business. According to a decision by the governing council of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), export income can be ex-empted from U.S. tax only if the economic activity that produces the incometakes place outside the United States. In response to the GATT decision, theCongress amended the tax code to allow U.S. companies to charter FSCs inlow-tax countries and either supply goods to the FSCs for resale abroad or paycommissions to them on export sales. The United States is appealing a 1999ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that these tax rules constitutean illegal subsidy under two WTO agreements\u2014one on subsidies on counter-vailing measures and one on agriculture. Many FSCs are largely paper corporations with very few employees. Under the tax code, when a U.S. company sells exports through an FSC, about23 percent of the total income from production and marketing is attributed tothe FSC and about 65 percent of the FSC's export income is exempt from U.S.tax. The exempt income, which is approximately 15 percent of the income fromthe sale, remains free from U.S. tax when the company receives it as a dividendfrom the FSC. The rules provide an incentive for U.S. taxpayers to locate in-vestment domestically. Export subsidies, such as FSCs, reduce global economic welfare and typically even reduce the welfare of the country granting the subsidy, eventhough domestic export-producing industries benefit. FSC rules may reduce theincentive for U.S. corporations to move economic activity, such as manufactur-ing, abroad. However, the effects of export subsidies on foreign exchange,which raise the value of the dollar and lower the cost of imports, cause importsand exports to increase. Consequently, companies in import-competing indus-tries reduce domestic investment and employment. This option would curtail the subsidy resulting from FSC rules by treating FSCs like other foreign subsidiaries. In general, all of the income repatriatedfrom FSCs would be subject to U.S. tax. The tax on any income from an FSCthat was deemed foreign-source income could be offset by unused foreign taxcredits. This option would increase tax revenues by $1.3 billion in 2001 and by$37.6 billion over the 2001-2010 period.310 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-22 Make Foreign Subnational Taxes Deductible Rather Than Creditable Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 2.4 5.52005 Taxation.Under current law, U.S.-owned corporations deduct U.S. state and local income taxes from taxable income, but they receive tax credits for income taxes paid toforeign governments, including foreign subnational governments, such as for-eign states, cities, and provinces. That tax treatment may encourage U.S. tax-payers to invest abroad rather than domestically. That may occur if the combi-nation of federal and local income taxes imposed on domestic income exceedsthe foreign tax imposed by national and subnational governments on the sametype and amount of foreign-source income. This option would equalize the tax treatment of domestic and foreign subnational income taxes by allowing corporations to credit foreign taxes to theextent that they exceed a fixed percentage of foreign-source income or a fixedpercentage of foreign income taxes. The fixed percentage would be set to re-flect the overall U.S. ratio of local to federal income taxes. Taxes for whichcredits are denied under this option would be deducted from foreign-sourcegross income to yield foreign-source taxable income. The rule could defer to oroverride existing tax treaties. Making the federal tax treatment of foreign subnational income tax pay- ments consistent with the tax treatment of domestic state and local income taxpayments would increase tax revenues by $2.4 billion in 2001 and $57.5 billionover the 2001-2010 period. It would also level the playing field between do-mestic and foreign investment: it would reduce the slight incentive that U.S.-based multinational corporations have to make additional investments in coun-tries where the overall level of foreign income tax on a foreign investment islower than the combination of U.S. federal and local tax on domestic invest-ment. In turn, equalizing the tax rates between foreign and domestic investmentwould increase the economic efficiency of the international allocation ofcapital. In some cases, however, removing the creditability of foreign subnational income taxes would make U.S. corporations operating in a foreign country lesscompetitive with other foreign corporations operating in that country. In addi-tion, firms would probably reduce their repatriation of income from prior over-seas investments to avoid paying the additional U.S. tax required under theprovision. Finally, if foreign countries implemented similar rules for the U.S.-earned income of their corporations, the amount of capital flowing into theUnited States might decline.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 311 REV-23-A Include Accrued Capital Gains in the Last Income Tax Return of the Deceased Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 a 2002 10.52003 10.12004 9.62005 9.2 2001-2005 39.4 2001-2010 78.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a.

The owner may deduct anyrealized losses against realized gains, and when the owner has no gains inexcess of losses, he or she may deduct up to $3,000 of the loss against otherincome. An exception occurs when an owner holds an asset until death. In that case, tax law allows the inheritor to \"step up\" the basis to the asset's value as ofthe date of the decedent's death. When the asset is sold, the inheritor paysincome tax on the gain that accrued after the decedent's death. The gain that accrued before the decedent's death is permanently excluded from taxable in-come. The estate of the decedent may pay taxes under the separate estate tax,but that tax applies equally to assets on which the decedent previously paidincome tax and to assets with accrued capital gains that had escaped incometaxation. Stepping up basis at death provides a tax break for capital gains income not available for other income such as wages, interest, and rental income. Thatencourages people to hold assets until death that they would have preferred tosell earlier. If holding those assets until death offered less of a tax benefit,people would feel freer to adjust their asset holdings as their circumstanceschanged. Furthermore, stepping up basis at death has spawned many tax-shel-tering schemes in which, for example, people borrow against their assets forcurrent consumption but have the loan paid off by selling the assets after theydie. A disadvantage of taxing gains at death is that the tax might force the decedent's family to sell assets to pay the tax. Sales of illiquid assets at aninopportune time can reduce their value substantially. Forcing heirs to sell afamily farm or business would impose a particular hardship on families wantingto continue the enterprise. Another disadvantage of taxing gains at death is thatthe decedent may have left inadequate documentation of the asset's basis. Taxing accrued but unrealized gains on the final income tax return of the decedent would raise about $78.5 billion from 2001 through 2010. This optionwould exclude gains on assets that a spouse inherits. Instead, the spouse wouldassume the basis of the decedent and pay tax on the full gain only when theasset was sold. Any gains on assets that the decedent left to charity would alsobe exempt. This option also includes special provisions to defer taxes for fam-ily businesses, allow use of the exclusion for gains on a home, and excludesmall gains on personal property. A bout 10 percent of decedents would owe taxes on accrued gains on their final income tax return. Finally, taxes paid ongains realized at death would be deductible under the estate tax.312 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-23-B Enact Carryover Basis for Capital Gains Held Until Death Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 a 2002 1.12003 2.02004 3.12005 4.3 2001-2005 10.5 2001-2010 47.8 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a.

RELATED OPTIONS : REV-04, REV-23-A, and REV-24Carrying over a decedent's basis in assets (known as carryover basis) is an alternative to taxing gains held at death on the last income tax return of a de-ceased person (see option REV-23-A). Under this option, heirs would adoptthe basis of the decedent on assets they inherit. The decedent's capital gainswould then be taxed when the heirs sold the assets. To allow for inadequaterecordkeeping by decedents on an asset's basis, the option would allow heirs toset the basis of an inherited asset at 50 percent of the asset's current value. Inaddition, if the decedent's estate paid any estate tax, shares of that tax would beadded to the basis of all of the estate's assets in proportion to the assets' share ofthe estate's value. This option would raise roughly $47.8 billion from 2001through 2010. Carryover basis would avoid a major disadvantage of taxing gains on the final income tax return of the deceased: the heirs would not be faced with anoverwhelming tax bill that could force the sale of the assets at an inopportunetime. Carryover basis could also ease the way for a family seeking to continueto operate the deceased's business. But it would not ease the problem of inade-quate recordkeeping by the deceased, except to the extent that the 50 percentrule suggested above would create a safe harbor. Carryover basis would achieve some of the objectives of taxing gains on the final tax return of the deceased. It would make most gains held at deathtaxable eventually, removing some of the inequity that arises from never taxinggains held until death. Furthermore, it would reduce the barrier to adjustingasset holdings before death as circumstances change. Finally, it would reducethe rewards to tax shelters that provide access to investment funds before deathwithout an outright sale of the asset until after death. Carryover basis wouldsucceed less in achieving those objectives than would taxing gains at death,however, because it would still provide the benefits of deferral for heirs whocould afford to postpone the sale of inherited assets with large capital gains. Gains held until death have always been exempt from income tax. The Congress enacted a carryover basis in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 but post- poned it in 1978 and repealed it in 1980. Therefore, it never took effect. Theprimary objection voiced in the C ongress at the time carryover basis was re- pealed was that recordkeeping by many asset owners would be inadequate fortheir heirs to document basis.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 313 REV-24 Eliminate Like-Kind Exchanges Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.92003 1.02004 1.12005 1.1 2001-2005 4.3 2001-2010 10.8 SOURCE: Joint on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-04, REV-23-A, and REV-23-BThe tax law requires that people who sell or exchange capital assets report any capital gain or loss as income. An exception occurs for exchanges of certainlike-kind assets, mainly real estate. No gain or loss is recognized if propertyheld for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged forproperty of a like kind that is to be held for the same reasons. In those ex-changes, the gain in the original property carries over to the new property, andits recognition is deferred until the new property is sold. Like-kind real estateassets are broadly defined as any properties located in the United States. Exchanges can involve the concurrent swapping of like-kind property between two owners, but in many exchanges a single owner sells one propertyto a second party and purchases a replacement property from a third party. Forthose transactions to qualify as like-kind exchanges, the proceeds from the saleof the original property must be held outside the seller's control\u2014for example,by a qualified intermediary\u2014and used to purchase the replacement property. Inaddition, the like-kind replacement property must be designated within 45 daysand purchased within 180 days. Capital gains cannot be deferred on the trading of many financial assets. Any gain from the selling of one stock to purchase another and of a share in onepartnership to purchase another is taxable in the year of the exchange. Gainsfrom trades of bonds, mortgages, and other debt instruments are taxed simi-larly. Eliminating the deferral for like-kind exchanges would provide the sametax treatment for people who buy and sell real estate as that for people who buyand sell stocks, bonds, or shares in partnerships. The option would raise $10.8billion from 2001 to 2010. A justification for continuing like-kind exchanges is that the new property is a continuation of the same investment as the previous one, and no tax shouldbe levied until the owner leaves that line of investing. Also, when propertiesare swapped without cash payments, no money becomes available for paymentof the tax. Furthermore, allowing like-kind exchanges facilitates propertyexchanges in response to changing conditions of the taxpayer or property mar-kets. But those justifications apply to many exchanges of stocks, bonds, andpartnership shares as well and therefore do not support continuing the currentdifferential tax treatment of those assets. One reason for either continuing thecurrent differential treatment or phasing it out slowly is that many investorspurchased properties with the understanding that they would be able to ex-change them for other properties without paying capital gains taxes. Changingthe treatment abruptly would impose hardships on some investors and couldpossibly depress property prices. Finally, some tax-deferred swaps of corpo-rate equities are permitted, such as those that take place in business mergers. The Congress has previously considered limiting the amount of gain that can be deferred under like-kind exchanges of real property. Proposals havealso been made to limit deferral of gain to exchanges of properties that aresimilar or related in service or use. That stricter standard already applies togains on certain involuntary conversions, but it would be difficult to apply on abroader scale.314 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-25 Convert the Credit for State Death Taxes to a Deduction Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 4.32003 4.72004 4.92005 5.2 2001-2005 19.1 2001-2010 49.9 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-26 and REV-27Current law imposes a gift tax on some transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's lifetime and an estate tax on transfers at death. A credit for state death taxes isamong those credits used to offset final federal tax liability: a fraction of thetaxes paid to states is directly deductible from federal estate and gift tax liabil-ity. Gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits built intothe system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so less than 2percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Act of1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to prevent thenumber of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. The credit for state death taxes built into the federal estate tax system lowered revenues by about $4.3 billion in 1997, which is over 25 percent of estate tax revenue in that year. State death taxes currently reduce a taxpayer'sfederal tax liability by a credit that ranges from 0.8 percent on transfers of$40,000 to 16 percent on transfers of more than $10 million. When enacted in1926, the credit virtually eliminated the federal tax liability in some cases be-cause the top marginal rate in the federal estate and gift tax was 20 percent. The credit acts as a state revenue-sharing system for estates taxed up to the 16 percent exclusion level. Consequently, a majority of states have adoptedstate death tax systems that simply redistribute estate tax revenues from thefederal to state governments. That shift is accomplished by imposing statedeath taxes according to a schedule that exactly matches the am ount of the federal credit. Changing the credit to a deduction would raise about $49.9 billion over the 2001-2010 period and would correspond to the treatment of state and localincome and property taxes as itemized deductions under the federal income tax.The immediate effect of changing the credit to a deduction would be to raise theeffective tax rate on state death taxes from zero to one minus the marginal taxrate under the federal estate tax, which ranges from 37 percent to 55 percent forpositive tax liabilities. That would cause the biggest increase in taxes for tax-payers in states where death taxes are high. In the long run, states may choose to change their own death tax rules to partially restore the levels and distribution of effective estate tax rates. If statesbehave that way, reduced state tax revenues will offset any increase in federaltax revenues, and the reduced state revenues will have to be made up by someother changes in state-level taxes or spending.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 315 REV-26 Include Life Insurance Proceeds in the Base for Estate Taxes Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 0.52003 0.52004 0.52005 0.5 2001-2005 2.0 2001-2010 5.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-25 and REV-27Current law imposes a gift tax on transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's life- time and an estate tax on transfers at death. One form of wealth transfer getspreferential treatment under the estate tax: payouts on life insurance policiesare not counted as transferred wealth if the owner of the policy is not the dece-dent. Including life insurance proceeds in the tax base would raise estate taxrevenues by about $5.1 billion between 2001 and 2010. Gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits built intothe system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so that less than2 percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Act of1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to prevent thenumber of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. Wealth transferred at death through life insurance is generally not subject to estate tax; if the policyowner is not the decedent, the policy payout amount isnot taxable. Thus, one important element of estate tax planning during awealthy taxpayer's lifetime is to make life insurance payments, with the in-tended heirs as the beneficiaries, directly or through trust arrangements. Premi-ums paid are not taxed as long as the am ounts are below the $10,000 annual gift exclusion. Life insurance proceeds were first included in the estate tax base in 1918, two years after the modern estate and gift tax system was put in place. The1918 act included in the base proceeds from policies owned by the decedentand payouts in excess of $40,000 on policies owned by others. In 1942, allproceeds from policies in which the decedent paid the premiums or owned thepolicies were also made taxable. Legislation enacted in 1954 dropped the\"premiums paid\" test, leading to the current system in which only policiesowned by the decedent are included in the estate tax base. The tax advantage of excluding life insurance from the base for estate taxes can be significant. The initial transfer of premiums does not affect taxliability because those amounts could be transferred tax-free under the annual$10,000 exclusion for any reason. The real benefit comes later, however, aspremiums invested in whole-life plans earn interest and dividends not subject toincome tax. Another argument for excluding life insurance from the base for estate taxes is to lower the cost of transferring wealth when assets are not liquid. Forexample, the owner of a closely held business can use life insurance to prepaythe estate tax that will be liable on the business, and the heirs can avoid havingto sell the business to pay the taxes. This option would increase the cost of thatpractice.316 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-27 Eliminate Nonbusiness Valuation Discounts Under the Estate Tax Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0 2002 0.72003 0.72004 0.72005 0.7 2001-2005 2.8 2001-2010 7.3 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-25 and REV-26Current law imposes a gift tax on transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's life- time and an estate tax on such transfers at death. One accounting practicetaxpayers are using is transferring marketable securities, such as stocks andbonds, to holding companies, which then issue shares (claims to the securities)to intended heirs. Although transferred assets are still taxable, the commonpractice of discounting minority holdings of business assets is often applied tosecurity holding companies to undervalue the assets for the taxable estate com-putation. The gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits builtinto the system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so that lessthan 2 percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Actof 1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to preventthe number of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. The value of minority interests in nonpublicly traded business assets is typically discounted when computing taxable estates. The practice is justifiedon the grounds that a buyer purchasing a minority share in an ongoing operationwould generally not pay market value for the fractional interest because themajority owners can adversely affect the long-term value of the fractionalowner's share. For example, if the majority owners are also officers of thecompany, they could in theory make decisions that would increase their incomeat the expense of the minority owners. Because the goal of the estate tax sys-tem is to tax only the value of the asset that would be paid by a willing buyer,large discounts are standard. The use of such a practice for nonbusiness assets cannot be defended on the same grounds. In nonbusiness situations, a taxpayer contributes marketableassets to a family limited partnership or limited liability company and simul-taneously gives or bequeaths minority interests in the holding company to in-tended heirs. The taxpayer then claims discounts on those gifts, using theguidelines generally agreed on for transferring business assets. The taxpayerclaims a reduced value in the marketable asset simply because it was placed ina holding company before being given or bequeathed. Restricting the practice of valuation discounts to active businesses would raise $7.3 billion over the 2001-2010 period. The exact proposal would requirethat interests in an entity be valued at a pr oportional share of the fair market value of the entity's net worth to the extent that net worth includes readily mar-ketable assets (cash, cash equivalents, foreign currency, publicly traded securi-ties, real property, annuities, royalty-producing assets, commodities, options,swaps, and non-income-producing property such as art or collectibles) whengiven or bequeathed. If the entity is part of an active business, the net worthheld in marketable securities for working capital would be subject to the usualbusiness valuation practices.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 317 REV-28 Eliminate Private-Purpose, Tax-Exempt Bonds Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.72003 1.12004 1.62005 2.0 2001-2005 5.6 2001-2010 20.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Tax law permits state and local governments to issue bonds that are exempt from federal taxation and thus bear lower interest rates than taxable bonds. For the mostpart, the bonds' proceeds finance public investments such as schools, highways, andwater and sewer systems. But state and local governments also issue tax-exemptbonds to finance quasi-public facilities and private-sector projects. Private-purpose bonds (so-called because the beneficiaries of the tax-exempt borrowing are nongovernmental entities) include mortgage bonds for rental housingand single-family homes; bonds for exempt facilities, such as airports, docks,wharves, mass transit, and solid waste disposal; small-issue bonds for manufacturingfacilities and agricultural land and property for first-time farmers; student loan bonds,which state authorities issue to increase funds available for guaranteed student loans;and bonds for nonprofit institutions, such as hospitals and universities. Although private-purpose bonds provide subsidies for activities that may merit federal support, tax-exempt financing is not the most efficient way to provide assis-tance. With a direct subsidy, the benefit would go entirely to the borrower; with tax-exempt financing, the borrower of funds shares the benefit with the investor in tax-exempt bonds. In addition, because tax-exempt financing is not a budget outlay, theCongress may not routinely review it as part of the annual budget process. The Congress has placed restrictions on tax-exempt financing several times, beginning in 1968. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 included interest earned on newlyissued private-purpose bonds in the base for the alternative minimum tax and placeda single state-by-state limit on the volume of new issues of tax-exempt facility bonds,small issues, student loan bonds, and housing and redevelopment bonds. The currentstate limits on volume are the greater of $75 per resident or $200 million a year.Bonds for publicly owned airports, ports, and solid waste disposal facilities andbonds for nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations (primarily hospitals and educational institutions) are exempt from the limits on issues of new bonds. However, largeprivate universities and certain other nonprofit institutions may not issue tax-exemptbonds if they already have more than $150 million in tax-exempt debt outstanding. If the Congress eliminated tax exemption for all new issues of private-purpose bonds, the gain in revenue would be about $20 billion in 2001 through 2010. Elimi-nating the tax exemption would eventually raise the cost of the services provided bynonprofit hospitals and other facilities that currently qualify for tax-exempt financing,but it would also result in a more efficient allocation of resources. Including all bonds for private nonprofit and quasi-public facilities under a single state limit on volume\u2014while raising the limits beginning in 2000 to, say, $100per capita or $250 million a year\u2014would increase revenues by $3 billion in 2001through 2010. Those changes would curb the growth of all private-purpose bondswithout sharply reducing their use. The curb would primarily affect bond issues fornonprofit hospitals, which are not included in the current cap. The proposal wouldalso apply to bonds for airport facilities, such as departure gates, that are for theexclusive private use of airlines under long-term leases, but it would continue toallow unlimited tax-exempt financing of public airport facilities, such as runways andcontrol towers.318 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-29 Reduce Tax Credits for Rehabilitating Buildings Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.22003 0.22004 0.22005 0.2 2001-2005 1.0 2001-2010 1.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.The Congress enacted tax credits for rehabilitation to promote the preservation of historic buildings, encourage businesses to renovate their existing premisesrather than relocate, and encourage investors to refurbish older buildings. Thecredit rate is 10 percent for expenditures on commercial buildings built before1936 and 20 percent for commercial and residential buildings that the Depart-ment of the Interior has certified as historic structures because of their architec-tural significance. The credits favor commercial use over most rental housing and may there- fore divert capital from more productive uses. Moreover, in favoring renova-tion over new construction, the credits may encourage more costly ways ofobtaining additional housing and commercial buildings. Rehabilitation may have social benefits when it discourages the destruc- tion of historically noteworthy buildings. The government could promote thatobjective at a lower cost, however, by permitting a credit only for the renova-tion of certified historic buildings and lowering the credit rate. Some surveysindicate that a 15 percent credit would be sufficient to cover the extra costs ofboth obtaining certification and undertaking a rehabilitation of historic quality.Reducing the credit for historic structures to 15 percent and repealing the creditfor nonhistoric structures would increase revenues over the 2001-2010 periodby about $1.5 billion. Repealing both credits would raise about $4 billion overthe same period.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 319 REV-30 Repeal the Low-Income Housing Credit Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.1 2002 0.22003 0.52004 0.92005 1.3 2001-2005 3.0 2001-2010 15.7 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : 370-06The low-income housing credit (LIHC) subsidizes the construction or purchase of buildings that are used to provide low-income rental housing. Individualsand corporations who qualify receive tax credits over a 10-year period that areworth up to 70 percent of construction costs or 30 percent of the purchase priceof the low-income rental units. Costs of substantial rehabilitation are treatedlike new construction costs. Two-thirds of qualifying projects have been newconstruction. To qualify for the LIHC, project owners must set aside at least 20 percent of rental units for families whose income is below 50 percent of area medianincome, or 40 percent of units for families whose income is below 60 percent ofmedian income. Rents are restricted. The set-aside and rent restrictions applyfor at least 15 years. State housing agencies allocate the credits subject tostatutory limits. The LIHC is estimated to reduce federal revenue by $1.3 billion in 2000. Repealing the tax credit for new projects would raise $15.7 billion from 2001through 2010. The LIHC is not large enough relative to the costs of new construction and substantial rehabilitation to permit projects developed with the credits to rent tothe lowest-income households. As a result, these households are mostly servedin LIHC projects when the project, the tenant, or both receive additional subsi-dies. An argument for repealing the credit is that in most places, housing vouchers could assist the same number of people at lower cost. Low-incometenants use housing vouchers to pay for all or part of the rent for the housing oftheir choice, as long as it meets minimum standards for habitability. Housingvouchers are cheaper in most places because the existing stock of dwellingsthere can provide adequate housing services more cheaply than either newconstruction or substantial rehabilitation. Extra overhead costs also make somehousing subsidized by the LIHC even more expensive to produce and rent. An argument for retaining the credit is that in some neighborhoods, exist- ing housing that meets minimum standards at affordable rents is scarce. Fur-thermore, building new housing and rehabilitating existing housing contributesto neighbor hood revitalization, whereas similar expenditures on housing vouch- ers are unlikely to have a noticeable, sustained impact on any specific neighbor-hood. Thus, in some circumstances, a supply subsidy such as the LIHC can bemore effective than a demand subsidy such as housing vouchers. The programalso benefits lower-middle income people who are typically neglected byvoucher and public housing programs, which help poorer families.320 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-31-A Tax Credit Unions Like Other Thrift Institutions Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.4 2002 0.72003 0.72004 0.72005 0.8 2001-2005 3.3 2001-2010 7.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-31-BCredit unions are nonprofit institutions that provide their members with finan- cial services such as accepting deposits and making loans. The federal incometax treats credit unions more favorably than competing thrift institutions, suchas savings and loan institutions and mutual savings banks, by exempting theirretained earnings from taxation. That situation reduces economic efficiencybecause different tax treatment of like institutions hinders competition and theprovision of services at the lowest cost. In addition, more credit unions andfewer taxable thrift institutions now exist than would otherwise be the case. Credit unions, savings and loans, and mutual savings banks were origi- nally all tax-exempt, but in 1951 the Congress removed the tax exemptions forsavings and loans and mutual savings banks. It considered those institutions tobe similar to profit-seeking corporations. Credit unions, unlike the other depos-itory institutions, were designed to be cooperatives whose members shared acommon bond. Since 1951, many credit unions have come to resemble other thrift institu- tions. Credit unions no longer limit membership to people sharing the commonbond of having the same employer or occupati on. Since 1982, credit union regulators have allowed credit unions to extend their services to members ofother organizations. Although that was legally challenged, recent legislation(the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998) allows multiple, unrelatedgroups to join the same credit union as long as the group has 3,000 or fewermembers when it joins the credit union. In addition, most credit unions allowmembers and their families to participate permanently, even after membershave left the sponsoring organization. Credit union membership has grown from about 5 million in 1950 to about 70 million today. Credit unions, like taxable thrifts, now serve the gen-eral public. They also resemble thrift institutions in that they retain earnings.Although credit unions argue that earnings retention protects them against un-expected events, other thrift institutions complain that credit unions use theretained earnings to finance expansion. Finally, credit unions now provide many of the services offered by savings and loans and mutual savings banks. A significant number of credit unionsoffer mortgages and car loans, direct deposit, access to automatic tellers, pre-authorized payments, credit cards, individual retirement accounts, safe depositboxes, and discount brokerage services. Moreover, some large credit unionsoffer electronic account access by telephone as well as business loans. Taxing credit unions like other thrift institutions would raise $3.3 billion over the five-year period from 2001 to 2005 and $7.6 billion from 2001 to 2010.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 321 REV-31-B Tax Credit Unions with More Than $10 Million in Assets Like Other Thrift Institutions Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.4 2002 0.62003 0.72004 0.72005 0.7 2001-2005 3.1 2001-2010 7.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

Unlike large credit unions, small creditunions are similar to nonprofit mutual organizations and should have similartax treatment. Most small credit unions have members with a single commonbond or association. In some cases, volunteers from the membership manageand staff the credit union. In addition, many of the small credit unions do notprovide services comparable with those of other thrift institutions. To protect the smaller credit unions, the Congress could choose to tax only credit unions with assets greater than $10 million. Such an action wouldexempt 8 percent of all assets in the credit union industry and about two-thirdsof all credit unions from taxation. Taxing credit unions with more than $10 million in assets like other thrift institutions would raise $3.1 billion over the five-year period from 2001 to2005 and $7.2 billion from 2001 to 2010.322 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-32 Repeal the Expensing of Exploration and Development Costs for Extractive Industries Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 2.8 2002 3.72003 2.92004 2.12005 1.2 2001-2005 12.7 2001-2010 15.0 RELATED OPTIONS : REV-33, REV-34, REV-36, and REV-41The current tax system favors extractive industries (oil, gas, and minerals pro- ducers) over most other industries through various tax preferences (see optionREV-33). One preference allows certain types of oil and gas producers andproducers of hard minerals to deduct some exploration and development costswhen they are incurred (a process called expensing) rather than over time as theresulting income is generated. That immediate deduction of costs contrasts withthe normal tax treatment facing other industries, in which costs are deductedmore slowly according to prescribed rates of depreciation or depletion. TheTax Reform Act of 1986 established uniform capitalization rules that requirecertain direct and indirect costs allocatable to property to be either deductedwhen inventory is sold or recovered over several years as depreciation deduc-tions (so that any deduction of costs is postponed). However, intangible drill-ing and development costs and mine development and exploration costs areexempt from those rules. Thus, the expensing of such costs results in a taxpreference for extractive industries that other industries do not have. (See op-tions REV-34, REV-36, and REV-41 for other exceptions.) Expensible exploration and development costs include costs for excavat- ing mines and drilling wells. They also include prospecting costs for hard min-erals but not for oil and gas. Although current law allows full expensing forindependent oil and gas producers and noncorporate mineral producers, it limitsexpensing to 70 percent of costs for \"integrated\" oil and gas producers (compa-nies involved in substantial retailing or refining activities) and corporate min-eral producers. Firms subject to the 70 percent limit must deduct the remaining30 percent of costs over a 60-month period. Although the original rationale for expensing was that the costs of explo- ration and development were considered ordinary operating expenses, continu-ing the preference has been justified on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strate-gic minerals,\" essential to national energy security. However, expensing dis-torts the efficient allocation of resources in several ways. First, it causesresources to be overallocated to drilling and mining, when some of those re-sources might be used more productively elsewhere in the economy. Second,although the preference might reduce dependence on imported oil in the shortrun, it encourages current extraction, perhaps at the cost of reduced future ex-traction and greater future reliance on foreign production. Third, expensingmay result in an inefficient allocation of production within those extractiveindustries because the extent of the subsidy depends on factors not systemati-cally related to economic productivity\u2014such as the difference between theimmediate deduction and the true useful life of such capital as well as onwhether the producer must pay the alternative minimum tax (in which caseexpensing is limited). Repealing the expensing of exploration and development costs would improve the allocation of resources and raise $15 billion from 2001 through2010, assuming that firms could still expense costs from unproductive holes andmines.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 323 REV-33 Repeal the Percentage Depletion for Extractive Industries Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.3 2002 0.32003 0.32004 0.32005 0.3 2001-2005 1.5 2001-2010 3.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-32 and REV-34The current tax system favors extractive industries (oil, gas, and mineral pro- ducers) over most other industries in various ways. One way is by allowingproducers to deduct exploration and development costs when they are incurred(see option REV-32). Another way is by allowing some firms to use the \"per-centage depletion\" method to recover costs rather than the standard \"cost deple-tion\" method. The percentage depletion method of cost recovery allows certain types of extractive companies (independent producers and royalty owners, or non-integrated companies) to deduct a certain percentage of a property's gross in-come in each taxable year, regardless of the actual capitalized costs. In con-trast, other industries (and since 1975, integrated oil companies as well) use thecost depletion method. Under cost depletion, the costs recovered cannot exceedthe taxpayer's expenses in acquiring and developing the property. But underpercentage depletion, they may. Thus, the percentage depletion method resultsin a tax preference for certain types of extractive companies that other compa-nies do not have. Unlike the expensing of exploration and development costs,however, percentage depletion applies only to a small subset of total oil, gas,and minerals production because it excludes the large integrated producers. Current law typically allows nonintegrated oil and gas companies to de- duct 15 percent of the gross income from oil and gas production up to 1,000barrels per day. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 made per-centage depletion even more generous, however, for nonintegrated companiesthat are considered to be \"marginal\" producers (those with very low total pro-duction or production that is entirely made up of heavy oil). The deduction formarginal properties can be up to 25 percent of gross income if the market priceof oil drops low enough. Producers of hard minerals may also use percentagedepletion, but the statutory percentages vary from 5 percent to 22 percent de-pending on the type of mineral. Tax law limits the amount of percentage deple-tion to 100 percent of the net income from an oil and gas property and 50 per-cent of the net income from a property with hard minerals. Percentage depletion has been justified on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strategic minerals,\" essential to national energy security. Percentage depletiondistorts the allocation of resources, however, by encouraging production inthose industries over other types of industries. It can also cause an inefficientallocation of production by extractive businesses in the same way thatexpensing does and in other ways as well. In particular, percentage depletionsubsidizes firms according to gross i ncome and not according to investment. Thus, it encourages developing existing properties over exploring for new ones. Repealing the percentage depletion for extractive industries would im- prove the allocation of resources and raise about $3 billion over the 2001-2010period.324 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-34 Repeal the Tax Credit for Enhanced Oil Recovery Costs and Expensing of Tertiary Injectants Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.1 2002 0.22003 0.22004 0.22005 0.2 2001-2005 0.9 2001-2010 1.7 SOURCE: Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-32, REV-33, REV-36, and REV-41 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Climate Change and the Federal Budget (Memorandum), August 1998.The tax code provides a 15 percent credit for the costs of recovering domestic oil by a qualified \"enhanced oil recovery\" (EOR) method. Qualifying methodsare those that allow the recovery of oil that is too viscous to be extracted byconventional methods. The costs of labor, materials, equipment, repairs, intan-gible drilling, and development qualify for the credit, which is phased out foroil prices above $28 per barrel (adjusted for inflation). Without the credit,EOR would not be realistic because it is more expensive than recovering oil byconventional methods. In addition, the tax code provides for the expensing of tertiary injectants \u2014the fluids, gases, and other chemicals that are injected into oil or gas reser-voirs to extract highly viscous oil. The tax code permits deducting the full costof the chemical injectants in the year in which the injectants are used to extractoil. The expenditures for injectants also qualify for the 15 percent EOR credit;however, the credit must be subtracted from the deduction if both are claimedfor the same expenditure. Without tax incentives, the use of tertiary injectantsto extract oil would not be economical. The EOR credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia- tion Act of 1990 to increase the domestic supply of oil and reduce the demandfor imported oil, particularly from producers in the Persian Gulf and otherpolitically unstable areas. The expensing of tertiary injectants was enacted in1980 for similar reasons but also to ensure that the costs of injectants would betreated the same as intangible drilling costs, which are also expensed. Both provisions offer capital subsidies to lower the cost of producing oil by unconventional, more expensive methods. Whether the federal governmentshould subsidize the production of high-cost domestic oil depends on the exter-nal costs of oil imports. Increased domestic production lessens short-termdependence but depletes domestic resources, encouraging long-term dependenceon imports. Oil production in the United States has been declining. Although the United States is more dependent on foreign oil than it used to be, it is less vul-nerable to supply disruptions because of the stockpiling of oil under the Strate-gic Petroleum Reserve, the weakened power of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, and the increased competitiveness in world oil markets. Eliminating both the EOR credit and the expensing of tertiary injectants would increase revenues by $1.7 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Elimi-nating the EOR credit alone would increase revenues by $1.4 billion, and elimi-nating expensing alone would increase revenues by $0.3 billion during the sameperiod. CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 325 REV-35 Repeal the Partial Exemption for Alcohol Fuels from Excise Taxes on Motor Fuels Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.4 2002 0.62003 0.62004 0.62005 0.6 2001-2005 2.8 2001-2010 6.3 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-47 and 270-03The tax code imposes excise taxes on motor fuels, but it partially exempts fuels that are blends of gasoline and alcohol. Repealing the partial excise taxexemption would raise $6.3 billion in revenues over the 2001-2010 period.That estimate assumes that the Congress also repeals the alcohol fuels credit, analternative tax benefit that can be used instead of the partial excise tax exemp-tion. The credit, however, is in almost all cases less valuable than the exemp-tion and is rarely used. Ethanol (an alcohol fuel produced primarily from corn and sugar) used as a fuel is eligible for a nonrefundable tax benefit (through credit or exemption)of up to 54 cents per gallon of ethanol. The exact size of the tax benefit de-pends on the percentage of alcohol in the fuel and whether the alcohol wasmade from a fossil (nonrenewable) or nonfossil (renewable) fuel source. Theexemption applies only to alcohol fuels produced from nonfossil fuel sources.For example, gasohol, which is 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol (arenewable source) receives a 5.4 cents per-gallon exemption from the 18.3cents per- gallon tax on gasoline. The Transportation Equity Act of 1998 extended the ethanol fuels credit, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 1999. The taxbenefit rate drops to 53 cents per gallon for 2001 to 2002, 52 cents per gallonfor 2003 to 2004, and 51 cents per gallon for 2005 to 2007. The entire taxbenefit is now scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 2007. One purpose of the tax benefit\u2014enacted in the late 1970s\u2014was to in- crease national security by reducing the demand for imported oil and therebyreduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. Another purpose was to pro-vide an additional market for U.S. agricultural products by encouraging domes-tic production of ethanol. Use of oxygenated fuels in motor vehicles generallyproduces less carbon monoxide pollution than does gasoline. The tax benefitappears to have successfully encouraged energy producers to substitute ethanolfor gasoline. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, however, reduced the need for the partial excise exemption by mandating the minimum oxygen content of gas-oline used in areas with poor air quality. Moreover, since ethanol productionuses more resources than gasoline production, the allocation of resources result-ing from the partial exemption may be economically inefficient if the value ofthose resources in alternative uses outweighs the value of the reduction in airpollution. Repealing the excise tax exemption could result in higher federal outlays for price support loans for grains. But any increase in outlays\u2014not included inthe budget estimates shown above\u2014would probably be much smaller than theestimated revenue increase.326 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-36 Capitalize the Costs of Producing Timber Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.4 2002 0.52003 0.52004 0.52005 0.5 2001-2005 2.4 2001-2010 4.5 SOURCE: Joint on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-32, REV-34, and REV-41The current tax system allows timber producers to deduct (\"expense\") most of the production costs of maintaining a timber stand when those costs are incurred.That tax treatment contrasts with the uniform capitalization rules applied to mostother industries. (See options REV-32, REV-34, and REV-41 for other excep-tions.) Established under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86), such rulesrequire that production costs not be deducted until the sale of the produced goodsor services. When businesses do not account for costs properly, business incomeis not measured correctly because the costs of producing goods and services arenot matched with the sale of the goods or services. Although the costs of planting a timber stand are in fact subject to capital- ization rules, subsequent maintenance and production costs are not. Timberproducers can expense indirect carrying costs, such as property taxes, interest,insurance costs, and administrative overhead, as well as the costs of labor andmaterials to remove unwanted trees and to control fire, disease, and insects. Byallowing timber producers to deduct such production costs before the timber isharvested or sold, the tax code in effect subsidizes timber production by deferringtax that producers otherwise would owe on their income. (Under certain circum-stances, however, the deferral granted to noncorporate producers of timber maybe greatly curtailed by the limits of the tax code on losses from passive businessactivities.) The original rationale for expensing the costs of timber production was a general perception that such costs were for maintenance and thus deductible asordinary costs of a trade or business. When TRA-86 established uniform capi-talization rules, the general reason given for exempting timber was that applyingthe rules to that industry might have been unduly burdensome. Expensing the costs of timber production distorts investment behavior in two ways: more private land is devoted to timber production, and trees are al-lowed to grow longer before they are cut. Unless timber growing offers spilloverbenefits to society that are not captured by market prices, the tax preference leadsto an inefficient allocation of resources and an inefficient harvesting rate. Whether or not timber production offers important spillover benefits is unclear. Standing timber provides some spillover benefits by deterring soilerosion and absorbing carbon dioxide (a gas linked to global warming), butcutting timber can lead to soil erosion. In addition, producing and disposing ofwood and paper products contribute to pollution. Capitalizing the costs of timber production incurred after December 31, 1999, would raise $4.5 billion in revenue from 2001 through 2010 by accelerat-ing tax payments from timber producers. In the short run, capitalizing the cost oftimber production might lower the price of domestic timber because producerswould have an incentive to harvest earlier. In the longer run, however, it wouldraise the price of domestic timber and lower the value of land used to grow it.Moreover, lease payments to private land owners by timber growers would prob-ably fall, causing some land that historically has been devoted to growing timberto be used in other ways.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 327 REV-37 Replace Corporate Credit with a Deduction for Employer FICA on Certain Tip Income Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.32003 0.32004 0.32005 0.3 2001-2005 1.4 2001-2010 3.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Since 1993, employers in the food and beverage industry have been entitled to a nonrefundable corporate income tax credit against Federal Insurance Contri-butions Act (FICA) taxes paid on employee tips (except for any amount of tipsthat makes up the difference between regular wages and the minimum wage).Replacing that tax credit with a deduction, which is the standard tax treatmentfor such labor costs, would increase revenues by $3.2 billion from 2001 to 2010. Until 1988, all employers were required to pay FICA tax on tips only to the extent that the federal minimum wage exceeded the actual wage paid by theemployer. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 expanded thedefinition of wages subject to FICA tax to include all cash tips. Opponents of the expanded definition of wages tried to repeal it several times. One provision in the Revenue Act of 1992 would have retained theexpanded definition for FICA purposes but would have granted a full,nonrefundable credit against the new FICA tax as part of the general businesscredit, which applies mostly to corporate taxpayers. Legislators used that indi-rect approach because Congressional budget rules make lowering Social Secu-rity revenues particularly difficult. Although both houses passed the bill, Presi-dent Bush pocket-vetoed it. A similar provision was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1993, but the credit applied only to tips received at food and bever-age establishments. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 expandedthe credit to tips received in connection with food served for takeout or deliv-ered off premises, relaxed restrictions on the timing of affected wages, andallowed the credit to apply to tips not reported by the employee. Proponents of replacing the credit with a deduction argue that the credit creates jobs. But because the credit grants a tax preference to a specific indus-try (food service) and a specific form of compensation (tips), the credit could becreating jobs in one sector at the cost of more productive jobs in other sectors.Proponents also assert that tips differ from wages since they are paid by cus-tomers, not employers. From an economic perspective, however, tips are thesame as wages because they are earned by employees for services performed.Tips could be considered self-employment income, but such treatment wouldgreatly increase the administrative burden of tax collection. Because the wages of waiters and waitresses are much lower than those of most employees, the credit makes the overall tax system more progressive, atleast to the extent that the credit is passed through by the recipient firms to theservers instead of to the customers, shareholders, or higher-paid employees.328 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-38 Repeal the \"Lower of Cost or Market\" Inventory Valuation Method Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.42003 0.42004 0.32005 0.3 2001-2005 1.6 2001-2010 2.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Under the inventory valuation method called \"lower of cost or market\" (LCM), businesses may deduct immediately the accrued losses on year-end inventoriesbut defer paying tax on gains until the year of sale. That situation providesfavorable tax treatment, although only to firms using the first-in, first-outmethod of inventory accounting. Furthermore, under either the LCM or the costmethod of inventory valuation, firms may deduct immediately any losses frominventory goods that arise from damage, imperfections, broken lots, or certainother causes (subnormal goods method). In that case as well, firms receivefavorable tax treatment to the extent that such goods are sold\u2014and hence in-come is realized\u2014in later tax years. This option would repeal LCM and the subnormal goods method of inven- tory valuation for all firms with gross receipts averaging more than $5 millionannually over a three-year period. It would therefore require the businesses tovalue their inventories at cost and include in taxable income both gains andlosses from the change in inventory value only when those goods are sold. TheAdministration proposed this option in its past four budgets. LCM not only causes a timing mismatch between recognition of gains and losses, but it also has two mechanical shortcomings. First, once a firm hasreduced the value of inventories using the LCM method, it need not ever recordan increase in the value, even if the actual value of the inventories subsequentlyrises. Second, the definition of market value is somewhat skewed. Retailersare allowed to deduct losses on inventory following a markdown of the retailprice, even if the new retail price remains above the original cost. Those short-comings could be addressed, however, without repealing the LCM method. This option would increase revenues by $2.2 billion over the 2001-2010 period. The increase in tax liability has two components\u2014a one-time increasefrom the revaluation of existing inventory to exclude unrealized (accrued)losses and a smaller, permanent increase from growth in the excluded lossesover time. Because the option phases in the new rules, the one-time revaluationcomponent raises liability every year for four years. The permanent componentincreases over time because unrealized losses grow annually.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 329 REV-39 Tighten Rules on Interest Deductions for Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.3 2002 0.42003 0.42004 0.42005 0.5 2001-2005 2.0 2001-2010 4.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Corporations purchase life insurance policies in part as protection against fi- nancial loss from the death of their more important employees or owners. Pur-chases of cash-value life insurance provide a tax benefit if corporations indi-rectly finance them by increasing debt or other liab ilities and then deduct the resulting interest expense from taxable income. The Internal Revenue Servicedisallows the interest deduction if it can establish a direct link between in-creases in debt or other liabilities and the purchase of cash-value insurance. Adirect link is difficult to establish, however, because firms increase liabilitiesfor many purposes. This option would disallow a proportion of a firm's total interest deduc- tions equal to the proportion of its total assets invested in cash-value life insur-ance policies. The option would not apply to insurance on the life of ownerswith 20 percent or more interest in the firm. It would raise an estimated $4.6billion over the 2001-2010 period. The tax code allows the tax benefit by exempting the investment income (or \"inside buildup\") of a life insurance policy from corporate income tax andpermitting a corporation to deduct from taxable income the interest on debt thatis indirectly used to finance the investment. Such asymmetric treatment pro-vides an opportunity for tax arbitrage because corporations can generate inter-est deductions that they can use to shelter other taxable income. Individualsmay not use that tax benefit because the tax code does not allow them to deductthose interest payments. In 1996, the Congress disallowed the deductibility of interest on loans from an insurance company with the cash-value policy as collateral (with ex-ceptions for insurance on certain key employees). In 1997, the Congress en-acted a proportional disallowance of interest deductions, but it applied only tofirms that purchased cash-value insurance on the life of people who were notemployees or owners. This option would further disallow such interest deduc-tions except for purchases of insurance on the life of those who own at least 20percent of the firm. The Administration has proposed this option in its pastthree budgets. In 1986, the Congress also enacted a similar disallowance of aproportion of interest deductions for financial institutions that purchased stateand local government securities whose interest was tax-exempt. Opponents of this option argue that a firm may have business reasons to purchase life insurance policies on its employees and owners as well as otherbusiness reasons to issue debt and that the firm may not be linking the twodecisions to create a tax shelter. Proponents of the option argue, however, thatfirms intend to use the policies and debt as tax shelters.330 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-40 Repeal Tax-Free Conversions of Large C Corporations to S Corporations Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 a 2002 a2003 0.12004 0.12005 0.1 2001-2005 0.3 2001-2010 0.7 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Less than $50 million.Under current law, a C corporation may reduce taxes on some income by elect- ing to be treated as an S corporation or by converting to a partnership. Theincome of C corporations is generally taxed twice\u2014once when it is earned bythe corporation and again when it is distributed to stockholders. S corporationand partnership income is taxed only once, at the personal tax rates of the firm'sowners. Over time, the distinction between S corporations and partnerships hasbecome somewhat blurred, but conversion from a C corporation to either ofthose two corporate forms continues to receive differential tax treatment. The election of S corporation filing status receives preferential tax treat- ment compared with conversion to a partnership. Converting to an S corpora-tion is tax-free under many situations; converting to a partnership is taxable andrequires the corporation to recognize any built-in gain on its assets and theshareholders to recognize any such gain in their corporate stock. Under section1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a C corporation converts to an S corpora-tion, the appreciation of the corporation's assets while it was a C corporation isnot subject to the corporate-level tax unless the assets are sold within 10 yearsof the conversion. Current law allows a corporation to avoid the two-tier cor-porate tax by converting tax-free to an S corporation. This option would repeal tax-free conversions for corporations with a value of more than $5 million at the time of conversion, thereby making the taxtreatment of the two types of conversions more similar. When a C corporationwith a value of over $5 million converted to an S corporation, the corporationand its shareholders would immediately recognize the gain in their appreciatedassets. This option would increase income tax revenues by $0.7 billion over the2001-2010 period. Repealing those tax-free conversions would equalize the tax treatment of economically similar conversions from two-tier corporate systems to single-tierflow-through systems, reducing the effect of tax considerations on decisionsabout organizational form. People who think S corporations more closely re-semble corporations than they do flow-through entities, such as partnerships,may consider preserving the current differential tax treatment beneficial. Ac-cording to that viewpoint, current law merely allows a corporation to change itsfiling status from that of C corporation to S corporation, providing it meets thelegal requirements, without having to pay tax for changing its choice of corpo-rate form.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 331 REV-41 Repeal the Expensing of Certain Agricultural Costs Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.4 2002 2.22003 1.12004 0.52005 0.3 2001-2005 4.5 2001-2010 5.1 SOURCE: Joint on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-32, REV-34, and REV-36Like its treatment of some costs of producing timber, the current tax code al- lows most farmers\u2014except farm corporations, partnerships, and tax shelters\u2014to expense (deduct immediately) certain capital outlays and production costs,even when such investments generate income over several years. That taxtreatment contrasts with the depreciation and uniform capitalization rules appli-cable to most other industries, which deduct such costs more slowly. (See op-tions REV-32, REV-34, and REV-36 for other exceptions.) Agricultural expenses qualifying for immediate deduction include tool purchases; the costs of breeding, feeding, and raising livestock; certain soil andwater conservation expenses; fertilizer purchases; and the costs of developingand planting crops that require two years or less between planting and harvest-ing. Because in many cases such investments produce income over a period exceeding one year, expensing those costs understates income in the year ofdeduction and overstates income in the year of realization. Thus, farmers candefer taxes, which reduces their effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Acts of1976 and 1986 limited the use of expensing for farm corporations and tax-shelter operations; the 1986 act required most other types of businesses to de-duct production and resale costs more slowly according to the uniform capital-ization rules. Thus, current law regarding expensing of agricultural costsfavors production of small farms over that of larger ones and of the agriculturalindustry in general over most other industries. Such a tax preference can leadto an inefficient allocation of resources. The original justification for the expensing of such costs, however, was to simplify financial recordkeeping for farmers. Although the administrative costsof recordkeeping are clearly lower today than they used to be, it may still besimpler for farmers to deduct costs in one period than in several periods. Agriculture receives other special tax treatment as well. One example is income averaging, in which farmers may elect to average all or a portion oftaxable income over the previous three-year period in computing current yeartax liability. The Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 made that provi-sion permanent to mitigate the adverse tax consequences resulting from fluctu-ating income levels. It also extended the carryback period for net operatinglosses from two to three years for farming losses incurred from disasters thathave been designated as such by the President. Subjecting all farms to the normal depreciation and uniform capitalization rules would level the tax treatment among businesses and industries, neutraliz-ing the effects of the tax system on economic decisions. Such a change wouldraise $5.1 billion in revenue from 2001 through 2010.332 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-42 Eliminate Exemption of Income for Cooperatively Owned Electric and Telephone Utilities Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.32003 0.32004 0.32005 0.3 2001-2005 1.4 2001-2010 3.2 SOURCE: Taxation.

Eliminating thosetax exemptions and taxing those co-ops as regular for-profit corporations wouldraise $0.2 billion in 2001 and $3.2 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Cooperatives may exclude from income amounts that they are required to distribute as dividends to their members. In addition to that exclusion, electricand telephone co-ops also may exclude earnings from other sources from tax-able income, as long as at least 85 percent of their income is collected frommembers for providing their primary service (electricity or telephone service).Some forms of outside income are not even counted toward the remaining 15percent, including rental income from telephone poles that are leased to cable ortelephone companies and income from the Yellow Pages, cable TV, and In-ternet access. In addition, distributions of dividends to cooperative members,whether cash or payments in kind in the form of household utility services, arefree from income tax. Eliminating the tax exemption on dividends to individu-als could generate additional revenues. Those tax breaks, along with the low-interest loan program available through the Rural Utilities Service (see option 270-05) were created to encour-age the wiring of rural areas for service. However, since 95 percent of theUnited States is already connected to the electricity grid, the cost to distributorsis probably the same for rural and urban customers. Moreover, all electriccooperatives have those subsidies, even generation c ooperatives, which may not need subsidies. Generating electricity does not cost more in rural areas. If the tax exemption ends and cooperatively owned electric and telephone utilities must pay the same corporate income tax as other suppliers of electric-ity, then electricity rates to the cooperatives' customers may rise. Electric andtelephone co-ops would be subject to taxes that other co-ops do not pay. Pri-vately owned utilities claim, however, that subsidies to rural cooperatives areunnecessary and unfair. If electricity is deregulated, this tax exemption willtreat electric cooperatives differently than the investor-owned utilities they willbe competing with for customers. If policymakers decide that subsidies areneeded for distributing electricity in rural areas, a more direct approach wouldbe through universal service provisions, which would provide a fund to subsi-dize the wire portion of the electricity service.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 333 REV-43 Eliminate Exemption for Interest Income on Debt Issued by Electric Utilities for Generation or Transmission Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 a 2002 0.12003 0.12004 0.12005 0.2 2001-2005 0.5 2001-2010 1.9 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a.

Increasing competition in the electricity industry may make this taxexemption unnecessary and anticompetitive. Eliminating those tax exemptionsand taxing the interest earned on bonds used by utilities for generation or trans-mission would raise $1.9 billion over the 2001-2010 period. State and locallyowned utilities also use tax-exempt bonds to finance the distribution and retail-ing of electricity. This option does not apply to the distribution and retailingfunctions, although eliminating those tax exemptions could generate additionalrevenues. Allowing some utilities to issue tax-exempt bonds effectively lowers the cost of debt borrowing for those utilities. Investors are willing to a ccept a lower interest rate for those bonds since the interest income is exempt fromincome tax. State and locally owned utilities are the main beneficiaries of thatexemption. Other utilities, including most cooperatively owned utilities andinvestor-owned utilities, must pay higher rates of interest to attract debt capital.Unlike the utilities that use tax-exempt debt for distribution purposes\u2014gen-erally serving populations of less than 10,000\u2014utilities that issue tax-exemptdebt for generation and transmission serve large urban areas or are participantsin large wholesale markets. The market for electricity is becoming increasingly compe titive. Many states have already deregulated the generation sector of the electricity industry,allowing customers to choose their electricity supplier. More states are ex-pected to deregulate in the future. Those utilities that have access to tax-ex-empt financing may rely more heavily on debt financing than other providers ofelectricity, giving them an advantage against competitors. Any cost advantagethat they have will grow as the market for electricity becomes increasinglycompetitive. If this tax exemption ends and all electric utilities must pay the same interest rate to attract capital as other suppliers of electricity, the electricityrates that the utilities issuing tax-exempt bonds charge may rise. Most of thoseutilities are publicly owned entities and thus are precluded from raising capitalin alternative ways that are available to investor-owned utilities, such as issuingstock.334 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-44 Increase the Excise Tax on Cigarettes by 50 Cents per Pack Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 5.4 2002 6.92003 6.92004 6.92005 6.9 2001-2005 33.0 2001-2010 Taxation.

(The proposaldiscussed in this publication doesnot reflect the final settlement.)Taxes on certain goods and services can influence consumer choices, causing people to purchase less of the taxed items. That generally leads to a less effi-cient allocation of society's resources unless some costs associated with thetaxed items are not reflected in their price. Tobacco creates costs to societythat are not reflected in its pretax cost. Examples of those \"external costs\"include higher health insurance costs to cover the medical expenses linked tosmoking and the effects of cigarette smoke on the health of nonsmokers. Taxesincrease prices and can result in consumers paying the full cost of smoking. Currently, the federal cigarette excise tax is 34 cents per pack; it will increase to 39 cents in 2002. (Other tobacco products have similar taxes.)Federal tobacco taxes raised about $5.4 billion in fiscal year 1999, about 0.3 percent of total federal revenues. Increasing the cigarette tax by 50 cents apack (in addition to the scheduled increases) would increase net revenue by $68billion between 2001 and 2010. State excise taxes will average about 40 centsper pack in 1999. In addition, settlements reached between state attorneysgeneral and major tobacco manufacturers require payments equivalent to anexcise tax of about 45 cents per pack. Some economists estimate the external costs of smoking to be signifi- cantly less than those taxes and fees, but others think that taxes should be in-creased more. Technical issues cloud the debate; for example, the magnitude ofthe health impact of secondhand smoke is uncertain. But much of the debateinvolves varying theories, such as whether to consider the health effects onsmokers' families or the public health and pension savings that arise because smokers have shorter lives. Increasing excise taxes may be desirable regardless of the magnitude of external costs if consumers underestimate the harm of smoking or how addic-tive nicotine is. Teenagers, especially, may not be prepared to evaluate thelong-term effects of beginning to smoke. However, all populations know thatsmoking has health risks. Increasing excise taxes leads to reduced consumption of tobacco. Each 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is likely to lead to a decline in cigaretteconsumption of 2.5 percent to 5 percent, probably with a larger decline for teenagers. Both because lower-income people are more likely to smoke than higher- income people and because expenditures on cigarettes for those who smoke donot rise appreciably with income, taxes on tobacco are regressive; that is, suchtaxes take up a greater percentage of income for low-income families than formiddle- and upper-income families. Several bills introduced in the 105th Congress proposed raising the excise tax. In his 2001 budget, the President proposed an increase of 25 cents perpack in the tobacco tax.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 335 REV-45 Increase All Alcoholic Beverage Taxes to $16 per Proof Gallon Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 4.0 2002 4.82003 4.92004 4.92005 5.0 2001-2005 23.6 2001-2010 on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-46 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Federal Taxation of Tobacco, Alcoholic Beverages, and MotorFuels (Study), August 1990.Federal excise taxes on distilled spirits, beer, and wine raised $7.7 billion in fiscal year 1999, about 12 percent of all excise tax revenues and almost 0.4 percent of total federal revenues. Current federal excise taxes remain muchlower on beer and wine than on distilled spirits in tax per ounce of ethyl alco-hol. The current tax on distilled spirits of $13.50 per proof gallon results in atax of about 21 cents per ounce of alcohol; the current tax on beer of $18 perbarrel results in a tax of about 10 cents per ounce of alcohol (assuming analcohol content for beer of 4.5 percent); and the current tax on table wine of$1.07 per gallon results in a tax of about 8 cents per ounce of alcohol (assum-ing an average alcohol content of 11 percent). Increasing the federal excise tax to $16 per proof gallon for all alcoholic beverages would raise about $49 billion between 2001 and 2010. A tax of $16per proof gallon is equivalent to about 25 cents per ounce of ethyl alcohol. Itwould raise the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of distilled spirits from about$2.14 to $2.54, the tax on a six-pack of beer from about 33 cents to 81 cents,and the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of table wine from about 21 cents to 70cents. Alcohol consumption creates costs to society that are not reflected in the pretax cost of alcoholic beverages. Examples of those \"external costs\" includehealth costs covered by the public, productivity losses borne by others, and theloss of lives and property in alcohol-related accidents and crime. Calculatingthose costs creates both practical and theoretical difficulties, but a study spon-sored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated thatthe external economic costs of alcohol abuse exceeded $80 billion in 1992. By raising the price of alcoholic beverages, excise taxes generally result in consumers paying more of the costs of drinking. Studies consistently showthat higher prices lead to lower consumption and less abuse of alcohol, evenamong heavy drinkers. Therefore, increasing taxes would reduce the totalexternal costs of alcohol abuse. Increasing excise taxes to reduce consumption may be desirable regard- less of the effect on external costs if consumers are either unaware of or under-estimate the harm that their drinking causes to them and others or how addictivealcohol can be. Taxes on alcoholic beverages are regressive when compared with annual family income; that is, such taxes take up a greater percentage of income forlow-income families than for middle- and upper-income families. In addition,alcohol taxes fall not only on problem drinkers but also on drinkers who imposeno costs on society and are thus unduly penalized. Taxes are also likely toreduce consumption by some light drinkers who would have received beneficialhealth effects.336 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-46 Index Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Rates for Inflation Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.3 2002 0.62003 0.92004 1.22005 1.5 2001-2005 4.5 2001-2010 17.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

The Proposed Tobacco Settlement: Issues from a Federal Perspective (Paper), April 1998. (The proposaldiscussed in this publication doesnot reflect the final settlement.)Federal alcohol and tobacco taxes raised over $13 billion in 19 99, including about $7.7 billion from taxes on distilled spirits, beer, and wine and about $5.4billion from taxes on tobacco. Together those taxes represented nearly one-fifth of revenues from all excise taxes and almost 0.7 percent of total federalrevenues. Tobacco and alcohol excise taxes are currently imposed on a per-unit basis. In the absence of legislation, their real cost declines with inflation.For example, despite several small legislative increases, excise taxes on dis-tilled spirits have declined by nearly 80 percent in real terms since 1951. Indexing the tax rates for tobacco and alcoholic beverages for inflation would raise more than $17 billion in the 2001-2010 period. Indexing those taxrates would prevent inflation from eroding real tax rates and would avoid theneed for abrupt nominal increases in the future. Smoking and drinking create costs to society that are not reflected in the pretax prices of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, which cover only productionand distribution costs. Examples of those \"external costs\" include medicalexpenses linked to smoking and drinking that are covered by the public, theeffects of cigarette smoke on the health of nonsmokers, and the loss of lives andproperty in alcohol-related accidents. By raising the price of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, excise taxes can result in consumers paying the full cost of smoking and drinking. Since in-creased excise taxes lead to reduced consumption of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, such increases will reduce the total external costs of smoking anddrinking. If those external costs come mainly from heavy or abusive consump-tion by a minority of consumers, however, higher excise taxes could undulypenalize moderate and occasional smokers and drinkers. Taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages are regressive when compared with annual family income; that is, such taxes are a greater percentage of in-come for low-income families than for middle- and upper-income families. Inrecent years, tobacco taxes have become increasingly regressive as the smokingrate has declined faster among wealthier groups. An alternative to indexing would be to convert to ad valorem taxes, which equal a percentage of the manufacturer's price. That method would link taxrevenues to price increases, although it would tie revenues to the price of taxedgoods, not the general price level. A shortcoming of the ad valorem tax is thatit creates incentives for manufacturers to artificially lower the prices theycharge company-controlled wholesalers, thus reducing their tax liability.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 337 REV-47 Increase Motor Fuel Excise Taxes by 12 Cents per Gallon Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 11.8 2002 15.92003 15.82004 15.82005 16.1 2001-2005 75.4 2001-2010 Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-35 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Federal Taxation of Tobacco, Alcoholic Beverages, and MotorFuels (Study), August 1990.Federal motor fuel taxes are currently 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel. Increasing those t axes could encourage conservation by making petroleum more expensive, reduce pollution, and de-crease the country's dependence on foreign oil suppliers while raising signifi-cant amounts of revenue. This option would raise fuel excise taxes by 12 centsper gallon, raising revenue by $11.8 billion in 2001 and $162.6 billion over the2001-2010 period. It would raise the total federal tax rate for gasoline to 30.4cents per gallon. To bolster the overall budget, the Congress could allocate theincreased revenues to the general fund rather than use the additional revenues tofinance further highway spending. Imposing new or higher petroleum taxes would raise petroleum prices and reduce consumption. To the extent that taxes on oil reduced the demand forimported oil, foreign suppliers would absorb part of the tax through lowerworld oil prices. To the extent that petroleum taxes reduced petroleum con-sumption, the taxes would also reduce car bon dioxide emissions and could therefore help reduce global warming. Taxing petroleum is not the only way of reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies. Stockpiling oil would arguably be a better way of coping with therisks of increased dependence on imports because it would not artificially re-duce current energy use by households and businesses. That argument is basedon the premise that aside from the problem of interruptions in supply, world oilprices accurately reflect real resource costs and thus already provide an appro-priate incentive to conserve. A tax increase would reduce consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel by encouraging people to drive less or purchase more fuel-efficient cars andtrucks. In addition, the tax would offset, though imperfectly, the costs of pollu-tion and road congestion that automobile use produces. A rate increase onmotor fuel taxes would not adversely affect U.S. producers relative to foreignproducers because final consumers and the domestic transportation industrypurchase most of the motor fuel. Moreover, the overall motor fuel tax rate islow in the United States compared with the rates in other countries. Increasing tax rates on motor fuels would impose an added burden on the trucking industry and on people who commute long distances by car, who arenot necessarily the highway users who impose the highest costs of pollution andcongestion on others. Pollution and c ongestion costs are much higher in densely populated areas, primarily in the Northeast and coastal California,whereas per capita consumption of motor fuel is highest in rural areas. In addi-tion, taxes on gasoline and other petroleum products take up a greater percent-age of income for low-income families than for middle- and upper-incomefamilies.338 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-48-A Tax Water Pollutants on the Basis of Biological Oxygen Demand Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 1.9 2002 2.72003 2.62004 2.52005 2.4 2001-2005 12.1 2001-2010 23.3 SOURCE: RELATED OPTIONS : REV-48-B, REV-49-A, REV-49-B, REV-49-C, and REV-49-DMajor facilities that discharge pollutants directly into water or indirectly into sewer systems have to abide by regulations that specify pollution abatementtechnology or impose concentration limits on their discharges. Taxes on waterpollutants discharged by those facilities could encourage further reductions inpollution below the level required by current regulations. Taxes can reducepollution cost-effectively by encouraging firms with the lowest abatement coststo reduce pollution and by allowing firms with high abatement costs to continuepolluting and pay the tax. Reductions in discharges caused by the tax wouldincrease welfare if the additional abatement costs were less than or equal to thesocial benefits from reduced pollution levels. According to a recent evaluation of water quality submitted to the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency by states, tribes, and other jurisdictions, about 40percent of the nation's rivers, lakes, and estuaries assessed failed to meet water-quality st andards. (Author ities judged a water body to have failed quality standards if they determined that the water was not clean enough to supportbasic uses, such as swimming and fishing.) Organic water pollutants contributeto that failure by depleting the oxygen in the water as they decompose. Dis-solved oxygen is necessary to sustain fish and other aquatic life. Biologicaloxygen demand (BOD) measures the intensity of oxygen-demanding wastes inwater. (One BOD equals 1 milligram of oxygen consumed per 2.2 pounds ofeffluent, or discharge.) One option is to impose a tax on the level of BOD in discharges. Gener- ally, firms that are subject to water pollution standards do not pay taxes or feesbased on effluents that regulations still allow. Most of the high-volume BODdischargers, sometimes referred to as point sources, are publicly owned treat-ment works (POTWs), paper and pulp mills, food processors, metal producers,and chemical plants. Discharges by point sources total a bout 16.6 million pounds of effluent per day, and publicly owned treatment works dischargeabout 8.4 million pounds of that amount. The cost of controlling discharges at POTWs and many industries that are subject to Clean Water Act regulations averages about 50 cents to 75 cents perpound of effluent removed. A charge on BOD levels in discharges could en-courage manufacturing facilities and POTWs with lower abatement costs toreduce pollution. Assuming effluents record an average concentration of 22BOD, a tax of about 65 cents per pound of effluent discharged would raise $12billion from 2001 thr ough 2005 and a bout $23 billion over the 2001-2010 period. The costs of administering a BOD water pollution excise tax would be small because allowable levels of BOD discharges are specified in the permitsthat state and local governments issue to regulated sources of water pollution.Levying a tax on effluents from POTWs and large industrial dischargers wouldensure that the tax base included all of the largest dischargers of BOD. The taxoption, however, might raise constitutional issues about federal taxation oflocal governments. In that case, POTWs (or a federal authority) could collectthe tax directly from polluters that discharge into municipal sewer systems.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 339 REV-48-B Impose an Excise Tax on Toxic Water Pollutants Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.2 2002 0.22003 0.22004 0.22005 0.2 2001-2005 1.0 2001-2010 1.9 SOURCE: RELATED : REV-48-A, REV-49-A, REV-49-B, REV-49-C, and REV-49-D RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Decreasing the Discharge of Bioaccumulative Toxic Water Pollutants: A Policy Analysis (Memorandum), December 1992.Taxes on major facilities that discharge water pollutants can both raise revenue and provide incentives for firms to reduce pollution cost-effectively (see optionREV-48-A). Harmful levels of toxic chemicals and metals in the water are akey concern because they do not readily break down in natural ecosystems,allowing them to accumulate in the environment. One option is to impose a taxof varying rates on companies that discharge certain toxic substances. Manufacturers in the United States discharged 218 million pounds of toxic substances into water directly in 1997 and 269 million pounds into waterindirectly through sewers. Toxic pollutants generally include organic chemicals(such as solvents and dioxins), metals (such as mercury and lead), and pesti-cides. Those pollutants may threaten the aquatic environment and humanhealth. The amount of environmental harm that toxic water pollutants cause de- pends on their toxicity. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has de-vised a weighing method to indicate the toxicity of various pollutants. Usingthat weighing system makes it possible to measure the quantities of differenttypes of toxic pollutants by their \"toxic pound equivalents,\" which the EPAdefines as the pounds of the pollutant multiplied by its toxic weight. This op-tion adopts tax rates developed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS)in a study on the discharges of manufacturing firms in 1987. CRS defined fivecategories of pollutants on the basis of their toxic ities. The tax rates varied from 65 cents per pound for the least toxic category of pollutants to $63.40 perpound for the most toxic category. Those rates correspond to a charge of$32.35 for the equivalent of each toxic pound. The variable tax rates providefirms with a greater incentive to reduce their most toxic discharges. According to the EPA, the cost of controlling the equivalent of an incre- mental toxic pound varies among industries, ranging from $1.50 to $606.00 (in1991 dollars). The tax, therefore, could encourage industries and firms withlow abatement costs to reduce their toxic discharges and would raise $1.9 bil-lion from 2001 through 2010. The Internal Revenue Service could use information that the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) provides on toxic discharges by manufacturing firmsto assess tax payments, or the EPA could collect the tax on behalf of the Inter-nal Revenue Service. An important considerati on, however, is that the accu- racy of TRI data is questionable. The TRI contains self-reported data, andmany facilities that meet the reporting r equirements fail to file reports or file inaccurate ones. To improve the accuracy of the TRI database and enhanceenforcement, frequent auditing would be necessary.340 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-49-A Impose a Tax on Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.6 2002 0.82003 0.82004 0.72005 0.7 2001-2005 3.6 2001-2010 6.4 SOURCE: REV-48-B, REV-49-B, REV-49-C, REV-49-D, andREV-50 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION Affecting the Relative Success of EPA's NOx Cap-and- Trade Program (Paper), June 1998.Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national standards for ambient air quality designed to protect public health andwelfare. The EPA defines acceptable levels for six \"criteria\" air pollutants:sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), and lead. Along with emissions from natural sources, emis-sions of air pollutants from stationary sources (such as industrial facilities andcommercial operations) and mobile sources (automobiles, trains, and airplanes)contribute to the ambient levels of those criteria pollutants. Sulfur dioxide belongs to the family of sulfur oxide gases formed during the burning of fuel containing sulfur (mainly coal and oil) and during the opera-tion of metal smelting and other industrial processes. Exposure to high concen-trations of SO 2 may promote respiratory illnesses or aggravate cardiovascular disease. In addition, SO2 and NOx emissions are considered the main cause of acid rain, which the EPA believes degrades surface waters, damages forestsand crops, and accelerates corrosion of buildings. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 adopted a program to control acid rain that introduced a market-based system for emission allowances toreduce SO 2 emissions. An emission allowance is a limited authorization to emit a ton of SO2. The EPA allots tradable allowances to affected electric utilities according to their past fuel use and statutory limits on emissions. Once theallowances are allotted, the act requires that annual SO 2 emissions not exceed the number of allowances held by each utility plant. Firms may trade allow-ances, bank them for future use, or purchase them through periodic auctionsheld by the EPA. Firms with relatively low abatement costs have an economicincentive to reduce emissions and sell surplus allowances to firms that haverelatively high abatement costs. In general, taxes on emissions can also help reduce pollution in a cost-effective manner by encouraging firms with the lowest abatement costs toreduce pollution and allowing firms with high abatement costs to continue pol-luting and pay the tax. Options REV-49-B, REV-49-C, and REV-49-D wouldalso base tax rates on an estimate of the average cost of reducing an additionalton of pollution. Consequently, some firms with lower-than-average abatementcosts might reduce their pollution levels below allowable standards. One option is to tax emissions of SO 2 from stationary sources not already covered under the acid rain program. Imposing a tax of $210 per ton of SO2 emissions from those sources would raise more than $6 billion over the 2001-2010 period. Most firms do not pay taxes or fees on emissions that regulationsstill allow, although major stationary sources must pay fees annually to coverprogram costs of operation permits under the Clean Air Act Am endments of 1990. Basing the tax on the terms granted in those air pollution permits wouldminimize the cost of administering the tax for the Internal Revenue Service.Opponents argue that such a tax would impose an additional burden on manyfirms that already incur costs to comply with current regulations on emissions.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 341 REV-49-B Impose a Tax on Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 6.8 2002 9.72003 9.22004 9.02005 8.8 2001-2005 43.5 2001-2010 85.3 SOURCE: REV-48-B, REV-49-A, REV-49-C, REV-49-D, andREV-50 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION Affecting the Relative Success of EPA's NOx Cap-and- Trade Program (Paper), June 1998.Nitrogen oxides (NOx) usually enter the air as the result of high-temperature combustion processes such as those found in automobiles and power plants.Nitrogen oxides play an important role in the atmospheric reactions that gener-ate ground-level ozone (smog) and acid rain. The Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) believes that nitrogen oxides can irritate the l ungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. NO x and pollutants formed from NOx can be transported over long distances, so problems associ- ated with the pollutant are not confined to areas where NOx are emitted. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires states to implement programs to re- duce ground-level ozone. Since NOx and ozone can be transported long dis- tances, the CAA requires upwind states to establish programs that will helpdownwind states meet statutory standards. The EPA ruled in 1998 that 22northeastern states and the District of Columbia have to revise their plans tofurther reduce NO x emissions (the Ozone Transport rule). The rule would not mandate how NOx are to be reduced but would give each affected state a NOx emission target. The goal of the rule is to have programs in place by 2003 thatreduce NO x emissions by about 1.2 million tons in the affected states by 2007. Certain aspects of the Ozone Transport rule are based on the new ozone stan-dards that were remanded to EPA. Consequently, in May 1999, the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also issued a stay of the Ozone Transport rule. The EPA is also encouraging the formation of a regional NO x allowance trading program similar to the national SO2 trading program. Such a program could be structured to encourage firms with relatively low costs for abatementto reduce their emissions and sell surplus NO x allowances to firms that have relatively high costs for abatement. One way to help control NOx would be to tax emissions from stationary sources. The cost of controlling NOx from stationary sources ranges between $600 and $10,000 per ton abated. A tax of $1,500 per ton of NOx emissions from stationary sources would encourage abatement at facilities with lowerabatement costs. For example, firms might adopt currently available abatementtechniques whose capitalized costs are lower than the tax they would otherwisepay. A tax at that level would raise about $85 billion from 2001 to 2010. If aregional allowance trading program was put into place, another option would beto tax only the stationary sources of NO x that do not participate in the program. Such a tax would raise about $39 billion over the 2001-2010 period, assuminga high participation rate in a trading program. Proponents of pollution taxes argue that such taxes discourage activities that impose costs on society. Opponents argue that the additional cost to firmsof such a tax may be greater than the additional benefits to society. Accurateestimates of additional social benefits from reducing pollution levels may notexist in some cases.342 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-49-C Impose a Tax on Particulate Matter Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 0.5 2002 0.72003 0.62004 0.62005 0.6 2001-2005 3.0 2001-2010 6.0 SOURCE: : REV-48-A, REV-48-B, REV-49-A, REV-49-B, REV-49-D, andREV-50Particulate matter (PM) is the general term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid drop lets found in the air. Those particles come in a wide range of sizes: fine par ticles are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and coarse parti- cles are larger than 2.5 micrometers. The particles originate from many differentstationary and mobile sources as well as from natural sources. Fine par ticles result from fuel combustion in motor vehicles, power generation, and industrialfacilities as well as from residential fireplaces and wood stoves. Coarse particlesare generally em itted from power plants and f actories and sources such as vehi- cles traveling on unpaved roads, materials handling, crushing and grindingoperations, and windblown dust. Some particles are emitted directly from theirsources such as smokestacks and cars. In other cases, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitro- gen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds interact with other com- pounds in the air to form PM. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies, emissions of PM (alone or combined with other air pollutants) are linked to some adversehealth effects. For example, particulate matter can carry heavy me tals and can- cer-causing organic compounds into the lungs, increasing the incidence andseverity of respiratory diseases. Other health effects may include increased hos-pital admissions and emergency room visits for respiratory-related illnesses andchronic bronchitis. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national standards for ambient air quality and is directed to review those standards every five years. In 1997, theEPA completed its review of the standards, finalized standards for fine particu-late matter, and revised those for ozone and coarse particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded those standards tothe EPA for further consideration. The new standard for fine par ticles would require that a national monitoring network be established before states developplans showing how areas will attain the new PM standard. Under the EPA'scurrent timetable, states would begin to submit plans for controlling fine PM forEPA approval in 2008. Since monitoring systems and a permit system are already in place for coarse particle emissions, one option would be to tax such emissions from sta-tionary sources. That tax could be administered similarly to the taxes on SO 2 and NOx. A tax of $500 per ton of coarse PM would raise about $6 billion from 2001 through 2010. A tax on coarse PM may cause some electric utilities and manufacturing plants to install improved electrostatic precipitators, wet scrubbers, or otherequipment to reduce their PM emissions and lower their tax burden. Reductionsin emissions caused by the tax would be economically efficient if the additionalabatement costs were less than the social benefits from reduced pollution. Opponents of such a tax argue that it would impose an excessive burden on firms that already incur costs to comply with current standards. Furthermore, tothe extent that a tax on PM would eventually raise the price of energy, it mightbe regressive.CHAPTER FOUR REVENUE OPTIONS 343 REV-49-D Impose a Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 9.2 2002 13.32003 12.42004 11.82005 11.2 2001-2005 57.9 2001-2010 REV-48-B, REV-49-A, REV-49-B, REV-49-C, andREV-50Ground-level ozone has remained a pervasive pollution problem in many areas of the United States. Ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is formed bythe reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone occurs naturally in the stratosphere(the upper atmosphere) and provides a protective layer high above the Earth.At ground level, however, ozone is the prime ingredient of smog. Short-termexposures (one to three hours) to ambient ozone concentrations have beenlinked to increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for respira-tory ailments. Repeated exposure to ozone may make people more susceptibleto respiratory infection and lung inflammation. In 1997, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) revised the national ambient air-quality standards forozone. The new standard would replace the 0.12 parts per million (ppm) stan-dard measured over one hour with a more stringent 0.08 ppm standard mea-sured over eight hours. In a ruling of May 1999, the tougher standard for ozonewas remanded to the EPA for further review by the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe D.C. Circuit. To control ozone pollution, the EPA has traditionally focused on reducing emissions of VOCs (and, more recently, NO x). VOCs include chemicals such as benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, and methyl chloroform. VOCs arereleased from burning fuel (gasoline, oil, wood, coal, natural gas, and the like)or from using solvents, paints, glues, and other products. One option is to tax emissions of VOCs from stationary sources. (See op- tions REV-49-B and REV-50 on taxing emissions of NO x and emissions from mobile sources, respectively.) Those sources range from huge industrial facili-ties, such as chemical plants, petroleum refineries, and coke ovens, to smallsources, such as bakeries and dry cleaners. The vast number and diversity ofstationary sources make it difficult to estimate emissions and the cost of abate-ment. A tax of $2,300 per ton on all VOC emissions from stationary sourcesmight promote some abatement and would generate slightly over $111 billion inrevenues from 2001 through 2010. The advantage of a broad-based tax on VOCs is that it would affect large and small sources of the compounds. The EPA estimates that the small sourcesaccount for a large portion of emissions from stationary sources. B ecause stationary sources em itting less than 2.5 tons of VOCs per year are not cur- rently subject to federal regulation, however, a broad-based VOC tax would beadministratively harder to implement than a tax on the large sources alone.Imposing the tax on small sources of VOCs through technology-based estimatesof emissions rather than measured emissions would reduce administrative costs,but it would also somewhat reduce the incentive to emit less. A disadvantageof such a broad-based tax is that it may be regressive. To the extent that thetax raises the prices of consumer goods, including food, it may take up a largershare of household income for low-income consumers than for higher-incomeconsumers.344 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 REV-50 Impose a One-Time Tax on Emissions from New Automobiles and Light Trucks Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) 2001 2.1 2002 3.12003 3.12004 3.12005 3.1 2001-2005 14.5 2001-2010 30.3 SOURCE: Taxation.

They raised the tailpipestandards for cars, buses, and trucks and expanded inspection and maintenanceprograms to include more regions with pollution problems and to promote morestringent testing. The amendments also introduced several regulations to reduceair pollution from mobile sources, including regulations for selling improvedgasoline formulations in some polluted cities to reduce pollutant levels. Inaddition, the amendments provided new programs that tighten emission stan-dards for vehicles to encourage the development of even cleaner cars and fuels. Despite progress to date in controlling air pollution from motor vehicles, mobile sources continue to significantly affect national air quality. On averagenationwide, highway motor vehicles account for over one-quarter of all volatileorganic compound (VOC) emissions, almost one-third of nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions, and about 60 percent of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. A tax onemissions from mobile sources could provide an additional incentive for con-sumers to purchase cleaner cars and trucks, which could help to reduce emis-sions from those sources. One option is to tax emissions of VOCs, NO x, and CO from mobile sources. A one-time tax imposed on new automobiles and light trucks could bebased on grams of VOCs (measured in grams of hydrocarbons), NO x, and CO emitted per mile as estimated by the emissions tests that the EnvironmentalProtection Agency requires for every new vehicle. The tax could be adminis-tered like the \"gas guzzler\" excise tax. The auto dealer would collect the tax onbehalf of the Internal Revenue Service from the vehicle's purchaser. Such a tax averaging $275 per new passenger car and light-duty truck could raise $30 billion in revenues from 2001 through 2010. Vehicles made inearlier years have been excluded from the estimate because of the administra-tive problems of collecting the tax. A disadvantage of excluding older vehicles,however, is that they account for a larger share of emissions from mobilesources than do new vehicles. Opponents of this option argue that such a taxwould raise vehicle prices and therefore might encourage people to delay pur-chasing new vehicles.Appendix Scorekeeping Guidelines These budget scorekeeping guidelines are to be used by the House and Senate Budget Commit-tees, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget (the \"score-keepers\") in measuring compliance with the Congres-sional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), as amended, andGRH as amended. 1 The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that the scorekeepers measure the effects oflegislation on the deficit consistent with establishedscorekeeping conventions and with the specific re-quirements in those Acts regarding discretionaryspending, direct spending, and receipts. These rulesshall be reviewed annually by the scorekeepers andrevised as necessary to adhere to the purpose. Theserules shall not be changed unless all of the score-keepers agree. New accounts or activ ities shall be classified only after consultation among the score-keepers. Accounts and activities shall not be reclassi-fied unless all of the scorekeepers agree. 1. CLASSIFICATION OF APPROPRIATIONS : Following (pages 1014-1053 of conference report) is alist of appropriations that are normally enacted in ap-propriations acts. The list identifies appropriatedentitlements and other mandatory spending in appro-priations acts, and it identifies discretionary appropri-ations by category. 2. OUTLAYS PRIOR : Outlays from prior-year appropriations will be classified consistent with thediscretionary/mandatory classification of the accountfrom which the outlays occur.3. DIRECT SPENDING PROGRAMS : Entitle- ments and other mandatory programs (including off-setting receipts) will be scored at current law levels asdefined in section 257 of GRH, unless Congressionalaction modifies the authorization legislation. Substan-tive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law orother mandatory spending law in appropriations lawswill be scored against the Appropriations Committeesection 302(b) allocations in the House and the Senate.For the purpose of CBA scoring, direct spending sav-ings that are included in both an appropriation bill anda reconciliation bill will be scored to the reconciliationbill and not to the appropriation bill. For scoring un-der sections 251 or 252 of GRH, such provisions willbe scored to the first bill enacted. 4. TRANSFER OF BUDGET AUTHORITY FROM A MANDATORY ACCOUNT TO A DIS-CRETIONARY ACCOUNT : The transfer of budget authority to a discretionary account will be scored asan increase in discretionary budget authority and out-lays in the gaining account. The losing acc ount will not show an offsetting reduction if the account is anentitlement or mandatory. 5. PERMISSIVE TRANSFER AUTHORITY : Permissive transfers will be assumed to occur (in fullor in part) unless sufficient evidence exists to the con-trary. Outlays from such transfers will be estimatedbased on the best information available, primarily his-torical experience and, where applicable, indicationsof executive or congressional intent. This guideline will apply both to specific transfers (transfers where the gaining and losing accounts and 1.

REAPPROPRIATIONS : Reappropriations of expiring balances of budget authority will be scored asnew budget authority in the fiscal year in which thebalances become newly available. 7. ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS : Advance ap- propriations of budget authority will be scored as newbudget authority in the fiscal year in which the fundsbecome newly available for obligation, not when theappropriations are enacted. 8. RESCISSIONS AND TRANSFERS OF UN- OBLIGATED BALANCES : Rescissions of un- obligated balances will be scored as reductions in cur-rent budget authority and outlays in the year themoney is rescinded. Transfers of unobligated balances will be scored as reductions in current budget authority and outlaysin the account from which the funds are being trans-ferred, and as increases in budget authority and out-lays in the account to which these funds are beingtransferred. In certain instances, these transactions will result in a net negative budget authority amount in the sourceaccounts. For purposes of section 257 of GRH, suchamounts of budget authority will be projected at zero.Outlay estimates for both the transferring and receiv-ing accounts w ill be based on the spending patterns appropriate to the respective accounts. 9. DELAY OF OBLIGATIONS : Appropriation acts specify a date when funds will become availablefor obligation. It is this date that determines the yearfor which new budget authority is scored. In the ab-sence of such a date, the act is assumed to be effectiveupon enactment. If a new appropriation provides that a portion of the budget authority shall not be available for obliga-tion until a future fiscal year, that portion shall be treated as an advance appropriation of budget author- ity. If a law defers existing budget authority (or unobligated balances) from a year in which it wasavailable for obligation to a year in which it was notavailable for obligation, that law shall be scored as a rescission in the current year and a reappropriation inthe year in which obligational authority is extended. 10. CONTINGENT LEGISLATION : If the author- ity to obligate is contingent on enactment of a subse- quent appropriation, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the subsequent appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on enactmentof a subsequent authorization, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on the fulfill- ment of some action by the Executive Branch or some other event normally estimated, new budget authoritywill be scored with the appropriation and outlays willbe estimated based on the best information about when(or if) the contingency will be met. Non-law makingcontingencies within the control of the Congress are not scoreable events. 11. SCORING PURCHASES, LEASE-PUR- CHASES, CAPITAL LEASES, AND OPERATINGLEASES: When a law provides the authority for an agency to enter into a contract for the purchase, lease-purchase, or lease of an asset, budget authority andoutlays will be scored as follows: For lease-purchases and capital leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in theyear in which the budget authority is first made avail-able in the amount of the estimated net present govern-ment's total estimated legal obligations over the life ofthe contract, except for imputed interest costs calcu-lated at Treasury rates for marketable debt instru-ments of similar maturity to the lease period and iden-tifiable annual operating expenses that would be paidby the government as owner (such as utilities, mainte-nance, and insurance). Property taxes will not be con-sidered to be an operating cost. Imputed interest costswill be classified as mandatory and will not be scoredagainst the legislation or for current level but willcount for other purposes. For operating leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in the year in which thebudget authority is first made available in the amountnecessary to cover the government's legal obligations.The amount scored w ill include the estimated total payments expected to arise under the full term of aAPPENDIX SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES 347 lease contract or, if the contract will include a cancel- lation clause, an amount sufficient to cover the leasepayments for the first fiscal year during which thecontract is in effect, plus an amount sufficient to coverthe costs associated with cancellation of the contract.For funds that are self-insuring under existing author-ity, only budget authority to cover the annual leasepayment is required to be scored. Outlays for lease-purchase in which the Federal government assumes substantial risk--for example,through an explicit government guarantee of thirdparty financing -- will be spread across the period dur-ing which the contractor constructs, manufactures, orpurchases the asset. Outlays for an operating lease, acapital lease, or a lease-purchase in which the privatesector retains substantial risk, will be spread acrossthe lease period. In all cases, the total amount of out-lays scored over time against legislation will equal theamount of budget authority scored against that legisla-tion. No special rules apply to scoring purchases of assets (whether the asset is existing or is to be manu-factured or constructed). Budget authority is scored inthe year in which the authority to purchase is firstmade available in the amount of the government's esti-mated legal obligations. Outlays scored will equal theestimated disbursements by the government based onthe particular purchase arrangement, and over timewill equal the amount of budget authority scoredagainst that legislation. Existing contracts will not be rescored.To distinguish lease purchases and capital leases from operating leases, the following criteria will beused for defining an operating lease: -- Ownership of the asset remains with the lessor during the term of the lease and is not trans-ferred to the government at or shortly after theend of the lease period. -- The lease does not contain a bargain-price pur- chase option. -- The lease term does not exceed 75 percent of the estimated economic lifetime of the asset.-- The present value of the minimum lease pay- ments over the life of the lease does not exceed90 percent of the fair market value of the assetat the inception of the lease. -- The asset is a general purpose asset rather than being for a special purpose of the governmentand is not built to unique specification for thegovernment as lessee. -- There is a private-sector market for the asset.Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor. Risk is defined in terms of how governmental in nature the project is. If a project is less governmentalin nature, the private-sector risk is considered to behigher. To evaluate the level of private-sector riskassociated with a lease-purchase, legislation and lease-purchase contracts will be considered against the fol-lowing type of illustrative criteria, which indicateways in which the project is less governmental: -- There should be no provision of government financing and no explicit government guaranteeof third party financing. -- Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor unless the Government was atfault for such losses. -- The asset should be a general purpose asset rather than for a special purpose of the Gov-ernment and should not be built to unique spec-ification for the Government as lessee. -- There should be a private-sector market for the asset. -- The project should not be constructed on Gov- ernment land. Language that attempts to waive the Anti-Defi- ciency Act, or to limit the amount or timing of obliga-tions recorded, does not change the government's obli-gations or obligational authority, and so will not affectthe scoring of budget authority or outlays.348 BUDGET OPTIONS March 2000 Unless language that authorizes a project clearly states that no obligations are allowed unless budgetauthority is provided specifically for that project in anappropriations bill in advance of the obligation, thelegislation will be interpreted as providing obligationauthority, in an amount to be estimated by thescorekeepers. 12. WRITE-OFFS OF UNCASHED CHECKS, UNREDEEMED FOOD STAMPS, AND SIMILARINSTRUMENTS : Exceptional write-offs of un- cashed checks, unredeemed food stamps, and similarinstruments (i.e., cumulative balances that have builtup over several years or have been on the books forseveral years) shall be scored as an adjustment to themeans of financing the deficit rather than as an offset.An estimate of write-offs or similar adjustments thatare part of a continuing routine process shall be nettedagainst outlays in the year in which the write-off willoccur. Such write-offs shall be recorded in the ac-count in which the outlay was originally recorded. 13. RECLASSIFICATION AFTER AN AGREE- MENT: Except to the extent assumed in a budget agreement, a law that has the effect of altering theclassification of spending and revenues (e.g., fromdiscretionary to mandatory, special fund to revolvingfund, on-budget to off-budget, revenue to offsettingreceipt), will not be scored as reclassified for the pur-pose of enforcing a budget agreement. 14. SCORING OF RECEIPT INCREASES OR DIRECT SPENDING REDUCTIONS FOR ADDI-TIONAL ADMINISTRATION OR PROGRAMMANAGEMENT EXPENSES : No increase in re- ceipts or decrease in direct spending will be scored asa result of provisions of a law that provides directspending for administration or program managementactivities.15. ASSET SALES : If the net financial cost to the government of an asset sale is zero or negative (a sav-ings), the amount scored shall be the estimated changein receipts and mandatory outlays in each fiscal yearon a cash basis. If the cost to the government is posi-tive (a loss), the proceeds from the sale shall not bescored for the purposes of the CBA or GRH. The net financial cost to the Federal government of an asset sale shall be the net present value of thecash flows from: (1) estimated proceeds from the asset sale;(2) the net effect on Federal revenues, if any, based on special tax treatments specified inthe legislation; (3) the loss of future offsetting receipts that would otherwise be collected under contin-ued government ownership (using baselinelevels for the projection period and esti-mated levels thereafter); and (4) changes in future spending, both discretion- ary and mandatory, from levels that wouldotherwise occur under continued govern-ment ownership (using baseline levels forthe projection period and at levels estimatedto be necessary to operate and maintain theasset thereafter). The discount rate used to estimate the net present value shall be the average interest rate on marketableTreasury securities of similar maturity to the expectedremaining useful life of the asset for which the esti-mate is being made, plus 2 percentage points to reflectthe economic effects of continued "}
