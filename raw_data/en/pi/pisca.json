The scientific discoveries of quantum physics show that we, and in fact everything in the known universe, are made up of high-energy photons, which are patterns of light and information. Energy Medicine works at the level of understanding that as patterns of energy, we can shift our physical and mental realities by shifting our subtle energy patterns. Energy medicine views illness as imbalances in the body's energy field, and that by re-balancing the body's energy field health can be restored. This holds true for other imbalances that we experience in life as well, such as relationship issues, financial issues, accidents, ect. Oftentimes the cause of imbalance is energy that is stagnant and unable to flow. The Chinese concept of Qi or the Indian concept of prana view energy flow as the primary factor in health. When the energy is flowing as it should, imbalances in health and life naturally smooth themselves out. There are many types of therapies that have the philosophy of Energy Medicine as their foundation, and they are very different in nature. At Mandala, we offer [Reiki](https://bouldermandala.com/reiki), The Clearday Healing Method, and [Homeopathy](https://bouldermandala.com/homeopathy), which all work on the subtle energy level to provide big change and true healing on the physical level of health and well being.
