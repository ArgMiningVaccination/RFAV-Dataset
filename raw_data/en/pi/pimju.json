November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 17 Strengths Licensing External Stakeholder Comments Board Presence 1. I am glad that there is a board in place to assist and aid in the acupuncture profession since it validates and justifies our profession. California Acupuncture Licensing Exam (CALE) 1. improves exam 2. High quality question pool. 3. Good comprehensive test 4. Very difficult exam and high level of criteria for taking the exam 5. A high standard exam all inclusive exam 6. Testing 7. Administering tests for licensing which are of a higher caliber than the NCCAOM and maintaining a higher standard of credentialing. 8. the CA state board is highly respected by everyone compared to NCCAOM test questions. 9. Highly rigorous examination procedure that excludes practitioners trained in other moda lities or in programs with lesser requirements from other states. 10. It appears to be a thorough exam, and at least in the last 15 -20 years was considered among the best in the US. As in, if you were licensed in CA, you were good in other states. 11. Strong exam when it is well organized, reflects herbal training and Western medicine High standards with regard to the exam eligibility requirements and knowledge content liability (i.e., laws & regs, medical red flags) 12. I feel the CAB does very well with licensing (so this answers the weakness question as well) throug h the California licensing exam 13. CALE 14. strict and fair control of availability for licensing exam. 15. Highly rigorous examination procedure that excludes practitioners trained in other modalities or in program s with lesser requirements from other states. However, see weaknesses... Customer Service 1. The Board has continued to meet the needs of a rising number of licensees, even with that being a very diverse population. 2. They call you back right away, they are good at what they say they will do in change of address other clerical issues. They actually have a person talk to you instead of send you on a wild trip to the phillipines with phone operators that don't know what is going on. The people talking have been informed and know how to resolve small issues. 3. Given the volume of applicants entering the field, I have found the Board Staff very efficient and responding to applications and issuing licenses. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 18 Strengths Licensing External Stakeholder Comments Custom er Service (continued) 4. Integrity currently in place 5. A person answers the phone when you call 6. Improved communication in the last few years Licensure Requirements 1. As one of the few states that has its own Board exam, California has been a leader in terms of licensing. 2. Maintaining a high standard for licensure 3. The Board has been consistent in their regulation of licensing. 4. Strict adherence to rules and regs. 5. I feel the CAB does very well with licensing (so this answers the weakness question as well) throug h very clear licensing requirements and appropriate renewal requirements. 6. requiring regular education (ceus) to maintain license. 7. California 8. continuing education National Examination 1. The board has been responsive to interest in having one national exam for licensing 2. One exam Processes 1. Process applications 2. Well established procedures. 3. Very organized. 4. Systematic management through long history of Licencing system. 5. New licensees from California schools have a clear -cut path to licensure. 6. online integration for licensee lookup 7. Goes to great lengths to make sure there isn't cheating Board Member Comments California Acupuncture Licensing Exam (CALE) 1. CALE (California Acupuncture Licensing Exam) is effective because when graduates come out their clinical skills may be at different levels so the exam exams competency for consumer protection and public safety. Also, the Office of Professional Examination Services (OPES) analysis that demonstrated the CALE meets the standard and California laws, rules and regulations. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 19 Strengths Licensing Board Member Comments California Acupuncture Licensing Exam (CALE) (continued) 2. CALE enables portability of license to other states because its high standard. 3. CALE exam costs are well priced and is a day exam. 4. CALE exam is delivered entirely and not portions like other exams which can be unsafe. The licensee has to use all knowledge to make diagnostics so it should also be examined entirely versus in sections. 5. CALE in diverse languages including Korea and Manda rin. CALE has done a good job translating exam, since original language can be lost in translation which loses effectiveness. It is good that CALE sustains diverse languages because there are consumers who are non - English speakers and prefer frequent Acupu ncturists who speak their language. Also, some consumers build trust with Acupuncturists who that speak their language. 6. CALE, standard curriculum required hours 3,000 hours, which is different throughout the country. Exam Decision 1. In a position to make decisions regarding the test in an objectively manner. The board has the capability and makes use of tools and resources available to make accurate decisions regarding test. Licensing Performance 1. The Licensing system has improved, it runs smoothly. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments California Acupuncture L icensing Exam (CALE) 1. Examination is a great strength. The B oard has a robust exam in the nation. Licensing Efficiency 1. Licensing is a great strength. The Board exceeds target licensing performance metrics. 2. For being an understaffed unit, work seems to flow as best as smoothly as it can. 3. Licensing is very strong, thanks to [redacted] worked hard to get the backlog of work completed and to improve processes and or implement processed to improve this section 4. Despite being severely underpaid, the [redacted] employee has been making sure this unit runs as smoothly as possible by taking on greater responsibility including training [redacted] and problem solving for mistakes [redacted] staff member consistently makes. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 20 Strengths Licensing Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Licensing Efficiency (continued) 5. Process times and customer service 6. Fast turnaround time for renewals and initial license processing. Friendly staff Licensing Process 1. The Board finally added a part -time staff to replace the full -time staff who took an in -house promotion. 2. Seems to be better than 3 -4 yrs. ago 3. Upholds the Standards required of Licensing as required by the Acupuncture Practice Act November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 21 Weaknesses Licensing External Stakeholder Comments Background Checks 1. The board should check the applicants for exam, check more details from out side of country. There are too much fake transcripts even Korea. 2. Review of out -of-state and out -of-country credentials is very slow. Communication with Stakeholders 1. lack of na tional cooperation between state agencies for licensing 2. Changes requirements for sitting for the exam year to year without first publishing how it plans to change. Students prepare as specified only to be told that regulations have changed and their educa tion no longer is valid. 3. workers not knowing enough when students call. 4. Changing or re -interpreting exam qualification requirements without properly notifying schools and giving time to make adjustment is unfair to applicants. Efficiency /Effectiveness 1. Timeframe for processing too slow 2. Everything by mail 3. They are an ineffective self serving organization 4. Issuing licenses in a timely fashion after the testing process has been successfully completed 5. we can not renew online. 6. The computer system, BreEZe, i s slow. 7. Staff edication 8. They don't always know what is legal and not in our scope of practice. 9. The quality of the wallet license issued is quite bad when compared to those issued by other State Agencies and Contractors. Given that we must carry them with us, they should be done differently. Follow CAMTC example for massage therapy. Hard Card license, with photo, and all pertinent information, issued every 2 years. Exam Accessibility 1. testing only offered 2x a year. This testing could be computerized and offered year round. 2. students should be able to take the exam anytime during the year. it should not have to be a predetermined 1 or 2 times a year event. 3. The licensing exam itself is horrible. The exam should have a set score required to pass. The chan ging score makes the exam peer evaluated and not truly objective. The exam should be standardized so that it can be taken at any exam center such as other professional exam requirements are done. The process itself is so slow! It takes too long to get veri fied to take the exam and too long to get the results. The whole process should be rethought and revamped to modernize and standardize the licensing process. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 22 Weaknesses Licensing External Stakeholder Comments Exam Accessibility (continued) 4. Why are examinations only held twice a year? Why is the examination process such that after a student graduates they have to spend months waiting to take the exam and then waiting for results. As someone who is a single mom of 3, it is disheartening to think how many months I will have to endure taking care of my children and myself financially whilst already starting to pay back a huge amount in student loans. The process needs work. Also, why is a NCCAOM exam not satisfactory in the state of California? I feel th e exam process, etc in general is a huge weakness. 5. The exam is uneven, year to year. 6. slow, costly, biannual licensing exams; 7. There could be better more testing dates/options for graduates so they don't have to wait so long and start earning $ 8. having exam ination only twice yearly prohibits graduates from getting on with professional life. 9. Rigid twice a year Licensing Exam policy when many licensing exams are online and more flexible. 10. There needs to be more opportunities to take the licensing exam. Dependin g on when a student graduates it can be a long time before they can take the exam. How about a test every other month!!! 11. The test is only offered twice/year in 1 location, in contrast to the National Acupuncture Board exam, which is offered multiple times/ year in locations in practically every U.S. city. Language Requirement 1. Also, whoever coming for ca license from abroad, the board should require the English capability. Within the USA 2. Should require english language licensing exams only 3. students, the CAB required the certain score of TOEFL. Licensure Portability /Barriers to Licensure 1. The board sets requirements for licensure that far exceed the needs of public health and safety. As such, they create barriers to entry and success that a re anticompetitive and possibly violate antitrust law according to a recent Supreme Court case. 2. Variability in requirements, not equal to national testing and requirements, lack of portability of license or reciprocity 3. Current requirements for school appr oval and licensing in California are the strictest in the nation with no commensurate differentiation in patient safety or satisfaction. It leaves one wondering why California approval and licensing are so different from other states. 4. CA Acu Board license is not transferable to other states. 5. The National Acu Board lic ense is non -transferable in CA. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 23 Weaknesses Licensing External Stakeholder Comments Licensure Portability/Barriers to Licensure (continued) 6. They should get rid of the 50 percent only applicable to getting licensed in California if a licensed acupuncturist has been treating pTients for over 3 years in another state. National Exam versus State Exam 1. None that I am aware of. The board should focus only on disciplinary actions for true malpractice and crimes and accept NCCAOM and ACAOM standards in lieu of spending tax dollars on this. 2. Having separate exam for CA 3. Dependence on state run board exams is outdated and not the professional standard. Move to NCCAOM exams. 4. Tests are ridiculous and have heard nothing good about the last one in Sacto. Absurd questions since no one knows any acupuncturist that offers nutrition advice or foods for cold/hot, etc., questions were weird and not in the best E nglish, and the responses were really not well connected to the question or case study. Makes me fearful to even sit in CA but go to another state with the National exam. 5. More of an NCCAOM weakness in NOT raising its standards to that of CA. However, I suggest looking at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidelines for Classification & Qualifications, General Schedule Qualification Standards for Medical Officer Series, 0602: This will insure that as those of us in federal employment fighting to have our GS -12 status restored the profession (per CAAB) continues to maintain a standard which supports the OPM 0602 series and allows for acupuncturists to make a livable wage substantiated by our education and student loan debt. 6. Also, the CA license should combine with the NCCAOM board to standardize a license without having to take multiple exams. 7. Not transferab le to the national exam license 8. CALE is an unfair, unorganized exam. 9. Poorly written test and no practical (2) 10. Examination qualities. 11. Chinese and Korean licensing exams are not fair CALE is not fair 12. The CALE is poorly developed and SMEs are not great...The board is particularly pedantic and behind the times when it comes to interpreting regulations.This applies to distance education, independent study, clinical supervision. 13. Depending on a state license exam that is not compatible nationally. Members tend to be involved too much with \"politics\" and sometimes do not have the best interest of the profession. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 24 Weaknesses Licensing External Stakeholder Comments National Exam versus State Exam (continued) 14. doesn't not recognize national licensing examination 15. Exams are overreaching, way beyond keeping the public safe. 16. The curriculum and exam relies on TCM or \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\" curriculum currently espoused by Communist China and their standardized \"westernized\" hospitals, which is divorced from th e roots of ancient Chinese medicine 17. test administration seemed inconsistent and somewhat haphazard. The NCCAOM seemed to administer a thorough yet consistently fair test without melodrama or questionable evaluations 18. the cale does not focus on patient safet y. a test for patient safety would be much simpler and straight forward. Board Member Comments Barrier to Entry 1. Decreasing the barrier of entry. The Board should encourage candidates to take exam. 2. Students from other states are not prepare because of curriculum requires different hours of training. Communication 1. Open line of communicate between ACAOM and the Board. Efficiency/Effectiveness 1. The computer system, BreEZe, is slow. 2. In both the licensing and exam unit there has been human errors. Manual input necessary to complete the licensing process contained huge errors. For example, the exam results notification letter was disseminated containing error in the scoring. Can a compu ter do it so humans do not have to enter the score or something to the effect? 3. The California exam portion should be computer based to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and accessibility like the national exam. 4. The Board's makes responsive (versus pro active) decisions and takes direction from legislature. It also waits for other offices to makes decisions before it acts. Licensing F ees 1. Lack of increase in licensing fees. It has been a long time since fees were evaluated. The Board needs income for fin ancial security and longevity November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 25 Weaknesses Licensing Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Barrier to Entry 1. The Board does not require graduation from a program, only to completion of a curriculum for acceptance to the licensing exam. 2. Transition to the national exam creating a high barrier of entry to the practice through roughly $2,000 and $625 exams. Licensing Fees 1. No raise in fees for over 20 years Recruitment 1. Staffing an analytical position to generate and analyze licensing reports. 2. Understaffed. 1 full time, 1 new intermittent, and 1 TAU employee that has been carrying the bulk of the weight this unit. 3. The original 2 full time Licensing Technicians is now d own to 1 full time and 1 part time staff. The main phone line was to handle by 1 -full time staff, 2 -part time staffs, and 1 -part time seasonal clerk, but the reality is only the seasonal staff handles 80 percent of the incoming calls with [redacted] limite d time in the office, the newly hired is yet to be trained to handle the volume of calls the Board receives, the other part time staff answers calls intermittently and is absent on sick calls most days. The Board is contemplating to cancel the contract wit h the Call Center and this can pose an imminent threat which can ripples down to other units that is already under staffed. 4. No analyst in the Unit, not enough control over errors caused by Central Cashiering. 5. Currently only 1 staff, which is a licensing of fice technician, could use an Analyst position. 6. Understaffed National Exam versus State Exam 1. Set High standards of minimum requirements to sit for the California Acupuncture Licensing Examination 2. NCCAOM taking over the CA exam 3. Moving to the National Exam because of political pressure from schools and legislature. 4. Ensuring the transition to a national exam while adequately testing the minimum competency of licensees. Staff Performance 1. Personnel needs to be better at response time, correctness in handling problems and completing work that needs to be done. 2. Staff lacks vital information about meetings, website content, etc. Written responses to email inquiries are poorly written.

You are ta king only the s ide of customers. Not practionars. You need to support practioners rights 2. protect the practitioner from the rising cost of all the protections they need to have from the consumers. protect the profession from having to put bogus labels on herbal formulas ie label that say that the formulas cause cancer. protect the profession from bogus laws that even medical doctors do not have to have ie the notice of informed consent that recently was required. weakness in attracting more acupuncturists to participate o n the board so that we are not governed by other professions in majority. weakness of the board to to create incentives that attract acupuncturist to be part of lobbying for our profession.\" Case De cisions 1. They take a punish all approach instead of addre ssing each incident separately 2. execute by complaints only Complaint/Investigation Process 1. I have reported a clinic using the name \"Chinese Doctor Acupuncture\" in Albany as being potentially in violation for use of the word \"doctor\" multiple times. Each time I've reported it, they've acted like they've never gotten the previous complaint. So, the complaint process is broken, and investigation of complaints and follow -up communication with those making allegations is, in my own personal experience, non -existent. 2. Unless you get a complaint, nothing seems to be proactive. 3. Not following practitioners for infection control etc. Effectiveness 1. There is no enforcement! 2. The board is not structured well enough to truly enforce the rules and regulations. The board is not effective as it should be. 3. Allowing anyone convicted of sexual impropriety to continue to practice. 4. I don't see anywhere they are enforcing laws and regs when once the acupuncturist is licensed. 5. When applicants took the test with fake or false transcripts, even they passed the exam, I think the board should take an action. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 29 Weaknesses Enforcement External Stakeholder Comments Performance 1. Nepotism, cronyism, discrimination. You get the point. 2. Unfamiliar with the practice of acupuncture in a professional sense. 3. They do not adhere to their own guidelines and are driven by one or two persons personal agenda Reference Materials 1. Monitoring of business practices through multi -lingual consumer educational materials, especially when CA has such a diverse population 2. The board publishes NO checklists for licensees to self -evaluate. Disciplinary hearings are closed sessions so others do not have the opportunity to learn from disciplinary actions. The Board's stated meme is \"with enforcement c omes compliance\" and there is no effort to an ancillary, more productive and less expensive philosophy of \"with education comes compliance.\" There really is no concise, easy -to-read document explaining to licensees what they cannot do, what the conseque nces are if they do these things, and exactly what is the process for enforcement. It is perceived as subjective and punitive because there is no prior education effort until severe enforcement occurs, namely fines plus 2 -3 years of probation with the thr eat of license seizure. Even those of un in strong trade associations feel left out of this process to the point of guessing what Enforcement will come up with next. Staffing 1. Lack of staff resources 2. Short of manpower Time Process 1. takes to long to enforce regulations 2. The time from accusation to investigation to action is intolerably long. If the primary objective of CAB is public safety, it has failed in this task. 3. slow response time 4. The process of enforcement takes long time, which can generate vast victims. Due to insufficient manpower? Unlicensed Activity 1. PT's are doing acupuncture illegally in CA, and the CAB hasn't done anything that I'm aware of to warn and prosecute. 2. We seem to hear reports from time to time of unlicensed people practici ng in this State. Seems that the Board could do better in this regard. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 30 Weaknesses Enforcement Board Member Comments Case Decisions 1. The Board's ethics and poor judgement. Translators 1. Translators during case hearings who bail out on the provider in the last minute. Need backup translators. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Disciplinary Guidelines 1. outdat ed disciplinary guidelines Performance 1. Processing complaints and investigations. The Board needs to improve performance measures to meet or come under targeted goal. The Board is meeting most targeted goals; however, all goals need to be met. Recruitment 1. Understaffed. 2. As any other units, th ere is a constant need for an OT to perform basic clerical, filing tasks to allow the enforcement analysts to focus on the more critical missions of handling the non - compliant licensed practitioners to protect the people of California. 3. Lack of support staf f for a lot of technical work, growing probation population without the staff to support it 4. [redacted] don't have enough staff to enable our [redacted] analysts to focu s mainly on analytical duties. [redacted] need technical staff to assist. 5. As with all units of the board, there is a shortage of staff. 6. Staffing. Enforcement needs more support both at the office tech and analyst level. 7.

The Board is concerned that TCM education is strong 4. I feel the CAB continues to work with the schools to strengthen the education requirements of acupuncture students Continuing Education 1. There are rules requiring continuing education hours. 2. Strong standards lots of required hours. 3. improved passing rates for new coming students . There are interesting course work for continuing education and the cost is favorable due to great incentives. 4. The amount of continuing education required by a licensed practitioner is very high compared to other states. It keeps the practitioner ever -learning.

Provide guidelines of curriculum 2. Strong curriculum standards. 3. I've seen some standards come up. 4. Rigorous requirements of schools 5. The board is doing very effective reviews for school paper works, such as curriculum review, syllabus review and so on, they can point out the exact deficiency very quickly. Miscellaneous 1.

Adequate education for passing the licensing exams 4. The board has good intentions. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 32 Strengths Education Board Member Comments Curriculum Standards 1. California has the highest education standards in the country. 2. The Board has done great job with the curriculum standards which is regarded a high standard in the industry. Collaboration with Stakeholders 1. Staff maintain good relationship with schools. T he Board has received a lot of feedback from the school regarding issues that plague them. Staff Performance 1. Staff is knowledgeable in this area. Also, knowledgeable in the technicality of curriculums. 2. Historically its been consistency and staffing. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Communication 1. The Board communicates effectively with Bureau for Postsecondary Private Education and American and Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) for curriculums approval. 2. Good communication with schools, tutorial students, and CE providers. Efficiency 1. The Board reviews and process curriculums efficiently. 2. Runs smoothly and effectively. 3. Better process for assessing curriculum in place 4. Process times on CE course applications is better. 5. The Board has created new processes and efficiency in both training program oversight and administration of Con tinuing education compliance. Performance 1. We have qualified staff in this position. 2. Quality of staffing has greatly improve over the last 5 years Recruitment 1. This Unit is finally staffed with 2 full time staffs in the Examination Unit, and 2 Full time staff Education Unit after operating with only 2 full time staffs for 18 months between management transition. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 33 Weaknes ses Education External Stakeholder Comments Board Composition /Educational Standards 1. There are no professional educators on the board, but they are required to evaluate educational programs. 2. No professional educators on staff or board. 3. Way behind the times in current educational theory. No one on staff or the board has education experience. Interprets rules in the most narrow and backward way. Enforces things that shouldn't be enforced and creates rules out of thin air and docks schools (in particular, the site visits demanded schools use California's workers comp pain scales even though no one uses them outside of that system and they are completely non -standard; but schools got reprimanded). Is reactionary and not proactive (the DAOM a nd DAcM programs). 4. It appears tht all decisions made in education requirements are arbitrary, and of nominally qualified persons. You have no professional educators on staff, no one that has even worked in OM education offering opinions. It looks as if th e CAB staff are on power trips that do not serve the stated goal of public safety. 5. The board does not seem to understand the school settings very well. 6. Very unclear, outdated policies that are very unfriendly to the current and future students. Policies on educational standards and implementation methods are very unclear and are susceptible for various interpretations. Leadership is weak and perhaps not competent. Appointed Board needs good training and must run the day to day activities. The staff must guide and not take control of the board. Continuing Education Course/ Providers Approval 1. Low standards for continuing education course approvals 2. Continuing Education. Many approved courses are a joke, while DAOM courses offered by approved schools are not eligible. I am a student with the Institute of Functional Medicine www.ifm.org Completing my continuing education only diverted my resources -time and money -from learning new things that will help me treat patients. As far as I am concerned, allowing acup uncturists at IFM is a gift. Most are practicing MD's. There is no way the IFM will jump through hoops to get approval from the Board. With the amount of money the L.Ac's pay for licensing, there should be someone at the Board that approves courses like these. Each IFM course is equal to any course in any medical school, western or eastern. Thank you 3. Also, arbitrarily refusing courses that are online is unfair. Most students that are taking these hard science classes at community colleges are taking th em online, so you are discriminating against certain people based on the language of their transcripts. If it's a real rule, then please enforce it across the board. 4. the quality of continuing education is not regulated. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 34 Weaknesses Education External Stak eholder Comments Continuing Education Course/Providers Approval (continued) 5. Standards for certification of continuing education courses are not very high. Some courses do not teach very much, and some courses teach material not related to acupuncture nor topics relevant to our scope of practice. 6. Allowing goofs to provide CEU classes that make us look like quacks to other medical professionals. 7. Not having enough qualify review on CEU courses provided and its targeted audiences / format of teaching 8. Review of CEUs is a bit bureaucratic but not well organized to check for real trainings Curriculum Standards 1. Review of new school credentials such as dual -licensures and similar can take months and perhaps years. There seems to be no will to move forwar d and no clear direction as to what to do. 2. low training standards leads to poor protection of the health and safety for consumers 3. Overly literal in interpretation of educational guidelines. 4. There is simply too much required, and NEEDED, to cram this unto an MS degree anymore. The Board needs to get behind the Doctorate as the standard. 5. Actively resisted and delayed the implementation of first professional doctorates though they met all regulations. 6. There are reports of fake practioners, schools are not reg ulated tightly enough, 7. Excessive curriculum requireme nts that increases student dept 8. Training at school are scattered and mess 9. The transfer system within CA licensed schools are not standardized. Depending on the academic dean of a school, the transfer un its are different. There is no standard criteria between schools. This affects the students matriculation. 10. Some of school have the different program is going on now, I do not think to teach the same level of each program which is Korean program, Chinese pr ogram and English program. They should have the same standard. 11. Again, not sure if this is a board matter but I personally feel after working very closely with anesthesiologists, PM&R physicians, PT's, etc... in an integrative medical environment for the pa st 3+ years that the curriculum approved by ACAOM and available in most schools does not emphasize Biomedical training heavily enough. L.Ac.'s need to better following graduation especially in the areas of Biomedical exam, evaluation, and diagnosis. This deficiency in our field is what is contributing to our lack of acceptance and perceived credibility by many biomedical providers, etc... 12. New licensees should be required to do internship/mentorship programs with experience practitioners after licensure November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 35 Weaknesses Education External Stakeholder Comments Curriculum Standards (continued) 13. From my experiences the amount of western medical training that is required is simply not enough. As a future acupuncturist with a pre -medical background, I notice a substantial gap between myself and fellow classmates whom have had much less education in western pathology, differential diagnosis, and pharmacology to name a few. 14. There are some schools out there that should not be accredited. They produced below average practitioners 15. Need to adjust to modern educational standards, online education, need to adjust clinical education standards in accordance with other health care professions 16. creating paid residencies for acupuncturist by giving incentives to the old timers . creating business education for upcoming graduates as well as nonstudents with in successful clinics around the country by giving incentives. Create more jobs for our profession by working the acupuncture profession into everyday health care. More needs to be done in including continuing education courses for helping clinics make it in basic business. More needs to be done to limit clinics owned by business entities that only care about the bottom line and are not practitioners themselves. More education in acquiring secure jobs for our profession and increased pay. 17. The curriculum and exam relies on TCM or \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\" curriculum currently espoused by Communist China and their standardized \"westernized\" hospitals, which is divorced from the roots of ancient Chinese medicine. 18. Poor curriculum monitoring 19. the basic framework of the standards for training have not changed since its initial implementation; adjustments have been on the periphery of the program. Thorough in depth reexamination o f our training content is needed. 20. The Board misses when school don't even require students to be present during clinical training; and then becomes overly prescriptive with other schools. Curriculum Standards : Authority 1. Too prescriptive on how education should be taught -in particular clinical education. The board is not an accreditation agency. Leave the education standards to ACAOM and Dept of Ed regional accrediting agencies for higher education.. 2. I dont feel the Board should be responsible for educat ion as much as they are. the Board should focus on licensing and regulation and making sure practitioners are upholding the law with regards to the profession. Education prior to licensing should be left for an entity such as WASC who is adept at working w ith schools on educational standards/curriculum. 3. None that I am aware of. Should defer to ACAOM and stop spending tax dollars. 4. Requiring ACAOM accreditation would be helpful. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 36 Weaknesses Education External Stakeholder Comments Curriculum Standards: Aut hority (continued) 5. I am also concerned as a student about the approval of DACM programs. I know my program is very rigorous and I take my schooling/future career choice very seriously. I am not understanding why it is taking so long to recognize our acade mic excellence. Perhaps another entity should be working on the academic side and the board should focus on exam and licensing, just as it is with law school or even with real estate. 6. Burdensome micromanagement of curriculum duplicating work of ACAOM. 7. The board should leave curriculum to the schools and accreditation. The acup regs are a micro -management mess in the curriculum section. The safety of the public is not at risk and many requirements in the regs are unnecessary. They drive up the cost of educa tion 8. If ACAOM is the accreditor, why not let them oversee the quality of education delivered. CAB wants any little change in a syllabus to be reported. Even ACAOM does not require this. 9. I wish the CAB had been in a position to assist the schools with attaining WASC accreditation, although this may be/have been out of the purview of the CAB 10. Not an effective communication with medical profession yet. 11. Allow regional and national higher ed accreditating bodies police the education, not the board. ACAOM and regional accreditors are in that business and have farmoreledge, skill and resources. Curriculum Standards: Board Purpose 1. complete lack of Education efforts regarding licensees. The Board's philosophy seems to be \"with enforcement comes compliance.\" T here are NO significant or effective efforts in education for better compliance being taken by the Board 2. education standards needs significant upgrade to properly train entrants to provide safe and effective therapy to the public 3. They do not support educational institutions. Instead they create artificial obstacles to further their own agenda 4. Rules far exceed public health and safety needs. Many appear to exist for anticompetitive reasons that may violate federal antitrust law. 5. Would like to see board enforcing or taking a more close look at schools that were red flagged 6. Requiring more education does not equate to consumer protection. It only serves the schools & increases student debt. Reference Materials 1. It did put out a booklet for consumers in the past, available to acupuncturists to give out to their patients and prospective patients; but we are unable to get this any longer. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 37 Weaknesses Education External Stakeholder Comments Reference Materials (continued) 2. The CEU listings that are on the website need to be organized so that they can be sorted according to number of CEUs offered, date class given, etc. Also this information needs to be kept up to date. One of my colleagues recently called several providers listed and the classes were no longer being offered. 3. Poor PDF data base on CEU providers. Consider organizing it by date and not by provider number. Also have it updated. I called 3 places that were not offering classes listed. Maybe have a log in for the provider to update informati on. Board Member Comments Communication/Collaboration with Stakeholders 1. Communication and collaboration amongst various parties involved in the education system: ACAOM and BPPE which is not as coordinated as it used to be. 2. Lack of early communication with partners on big ticket issues when decisions needs to be made. The Board is unable to move forward without all of the information. Continuing Education Oversight 1. Lot of CE providers not necessary, there should be an eval uation of providers. 2. The Board needs better oversight of continuing education unit (CEU) providers, the number is over 1,500 which is too many. There needs to be oversight and \"cleanup\" and develop a selection process to make sure we have quality CEU prov iders 3. Evaluate and increase the fees for the continuing education providers. 4. Continuing Education Fee Structure 5. Evaluate enforcement fees or fee structure for continuing education providers who do not seem to be enforced. 6. Auditing Continuing Education providers. The Board knows that certain providers are not being honest regarding the content they are teaching. Random audits should be implemented within Enforcement unit and allocated in the Board's budget. 7. Additional Enfor cement staff who specifically focuses on continuing education issues, review provider fees, and conduct audits. The area of continuing education providers is large and needs a dedicated staff member. 8. Increased opportunity to purpose continuing education issues. Greater collaboration between enforcement and education regarding continuing education. 9. For consumer protection, continuing education providers should be regulated. Implement standards on who can be continuing education providers. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 38 Weaknesses Education Board Member Comments Curriculum Standards 1. Outdated educational standards since inception, specifically the curriculum standard. Curriculum needs to be evaluated and updated. The standard should be creating specific requirements in such a way that it either is adhered to or violated. Formerly the schools can adhere to the standards, however, the current student to teacher ratio presents a challenge. 2. Education should be developed in such a way that it decreases fraud and unethical cases. For e xample, what is required for students to know in order for poor judgment and actions decrease? Or how to run a business. These concepts or the concept of ethics should be taught and reinforced throughout the student's schooling not exclusively during the f inal quarter of their last year. The information is available; however, should be reinforced or engrained through yearly or incremental levels throughout the student's schooling. 3. Curriculum reviewed by Board staff without any fee to the school. The fee previously in place was taken out because adhere to new law. The board should consider a fair and reasonable free for the Board's efforts in reviewing curriculum. Curriculum Standards: Authority 1. Constant volatitlity because legislature has given strict direction in the scope of our authority regarding the education sphere. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Board's Accessibility /Authority 1. Limited datab ase through Access 2. Improve enforcement of schools. There are no consequences for violations. The Board should deny, where applicable, instead of placing schools on probation or continuing approvals. 3. There has been a history of overreach of authority while at the same time not providing the appropriate authority Board Performance 1. Historically staffing has not had the education background or specific understanding of subject matter. Communication/Collaboration with Stakeholders 1. not receiving communication or collaboration from ACAOM and BPPE 2. Failure to use department resources such as BPPE and other agencies that accredit programs.

The Board's continuing education oversight. There is a lack of consequences for violations by the Continuing Education providers. There is a perception that there is a large amount of fraud because the standards and consequences are lax. Recruitment 1. not enough staff to do CE audits, outdated CE forms 2. Historically there has been a lack continuity both interns of leadership, staffing and process. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 40 Strengths Legislation and Regulation External Stakeholder Comments Achievements 1. they perform extinct right judgement with the corresponding stands or laws to deal with different cases. 2. I am grateful for the fact that in CA acupuncturists are regarded as primary health care providers. I also appreciate that there are restrictions on the ability for healthcare professionals in other fields (i.e., chiropractic, PT, etc) to practice acupuncture. Overall, I feel the integrity of our practice is protected. 3. If the Board was instrumental in getting acupuncture included in Covered California, then that was great. Board Meeting Agendas 1. Many agendas include a list of pending legislation that might affect stakeholders 2. I say the CAB is effective, but I feel it is only JUST effective. The CAB has continued to offer clear guidance on upcoming legis lation without imposing opinions. Development 1. I am glad there are more regulations in place today than years ago. 2. Changing for the better 3. After many years, the Board finally agrees to take a look at weak educational regulations 4. Keeps up with the laws Board Member Comments Board Performance 1. Great staff completed backlog. 2. The Board is active and support and implement bills adopted by legislature. 3. Proud that the Board passed many (around a dozen) regulations in the last four years. Huge accolades to staff, board, and specifically the Policy Coordinator. 4. Sunset Review report well completed compared to previous one. Communication with Stakeholders 1. Increased line of communication and collaboration because level of trust and respected increased. For example, legislative relationships dramatically improve and far more useful. 2. The new leadership has worked well with the legislation and continues to b uild the relationship. Consumer Protection 1. The Board things forward and helps the industry establish new standard to protect the public. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 41 Strengths Legislation and Regulation Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Process 1. Good resources and research for regulatory language, helpful list of regulations/bills for Board to monitor 2. At the staff level the Boards has qualified staff to complete the legislative process. New leadership has facilitated a much better understanding of this process. 3. Much better relationship between Board leadership and staff has been very helpful \\.\" 4. Actively making changes Productivity 1. Runs smoothly for a 1-person unit. 2. Having 1 long term permanent Policy Coordinator in the unit creates consistency. 3. Because there is a person hired to do this job it has become a strength. Prior to that the Board' record of promulgating regulations was not what it should be. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 42 Weaknesses Legislation and Regulation External Stakeholder Comments Board Mission 1. No clear direction or mission and vision. The Board must help the profession as much as it helps the consumers. All the statutes, regulations, policies and procedures are skewed towards only one side (consumer). 2. Outside lobbies continue to chip away at this Board and undermine it's mission, in my opinion. 3. The CAB has been horribly neutral and sometimes, as a practitioner, I wish they were a bit more opinionated. But most of the time I really do appreciate their neutrality. Communication /Collaboration 1. I wish the Board provided more updates on upcoming legislation/regulation. I know it is a small board and everyone already has immense amounts of work, just wish this were one place that could be automated and communication could be increased. Even somethin g as simple as \"Hey, go to the Board website and check out the Legislative section, there's new info to review\" would be immensely helpful 2. Poor, because I don't feel informed about the board's actions or results. I'm informed about board meetings (few of which I can attend) but the results of decisions or actions are not communicated. 3. Poor coordination with ACAOM and BPPE. Dry Needling 1. The regulation for direct line of sight needling was excessive and consumed much of our time and effort as educators. 2. Fighting dry needling & other modalities doing acupuncture is very poor. 3. We do not need other professions being able to give acupuncture and or dry needling and get paid more from insurance...keeping other professions out of our medicine. keeping other profe ssion from giving Chinese herbal medicine. adding more legislatives that make it more expensive for acupuncturist to practice, as acupuncturist make less than all other health care professions and school is as expensive as medical school. 4. Protect our scope esp against dry needling by PTs and for manual therapy instead of asian massage 5. Need some legislation regarding dry needling performed by A.T.C.'s (Certified Athletic Trainers). Proactiveness/Performance 1. Stop spending tax dollars for no reason. 2. Some regulations are to harsh 3. Anticompetitive and possibly illegal antitrust violations. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 43 Weaknesses Legislation and Regulation External Stakeholder Comments Proactiveness/Performance (continued) 4. Not strong board . Com pare us with chiropractic board 5. Under the last executive officer, got involved in things they shouldn't have 6. As shown by the recent implementation of SB1249, the Board cannot develop and implement regulations in a timely manner despite years of preparation. On top of this the regulations that are now in place threaten many schools that were successfully educating students both inside and outside of California. 7. I do think though, that there are many things that need to be addressed especially as the acupuncture profession grows, gains popularity and becomes more respectable in the healthcare arena. It will not suffice for MDs etc. to have a reason to not look to us as peers because our legislative and regulatory system is lacking. 8. There needs to be more lobbying and progressive movement on behalf of the members to strengthen the acupuncture profession. For example, I have to send patients to other states (i.e., Florida) for point injection of herbs when needed, i.e, cancer. Injection of herbs in China is a regular protocol for more severe diseases , and the board has not looked into growing and strengthening aspects of our profession where we can benefit patients' health further. 9. CAB spends time and energy on ridiculous rules, like making people list their license number on materials (as if we are p lumbers) and not on advocating for clarity in scope, or promoting the safety of Oriental medicine. The CAB's poor performance in both board and staff has resulted in several poor reports via the Sunset Review. This puts CAB's very existence at risk, which puts our profession at risk. The CMB (who will take over regulation of LAcs if CAB is dissolved) will prejudiciously restrict the practice of Chinese medicine, to the detriment of the public. Again, the opposite of CAB's stated objective. 10. Too many new laws and regulations 11. status quo 12. They are an outdated organization that serves no purpose except to hinder progress. 13. After many years, the Board finally agrees to take a look at weak educational regulations Scope of Practice 1. Our scope of practice is very vague and needs to be defined. That being said we should be practicing this medicine to the fullest extent like it is in other countries. We should be allowed to use other modalities, but no one lobbies for us. 2. Legislation includes licensed complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers but needs to include the verbiage for Licensed Acupuncturist / Acupuncture [example: excused medical services at my child's school excludes Acupuncture but include Chirop ractic, Dentistry and Optometry for medical treatments in terms of excused absences. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 44 Weaknesses Legislation and Regulation External Stakeholder Comments Scope of Practice (continued) 3. poor at clearly communicating the acupuncture scope of practice so most acupuncturists do not know how they are legally allowed to practice. Calls to the board often are answered with \"that is a gray area\" or consult an attorney (who also does not know) Stakeholder Input 1. Most CAB board meetings skip over 90% of the listed pending legislation. There is no written opinion issued on any of the listed items, there is often no written summary listed. Public opinion is not sought explicitly and often opportunities are missed because the Board Members have there eye on on e item but none of the others are mentioned. I've been to 2 meetings in 2017 where a board member said something to the effect of \"\"only one of these is important and I want to discuss that\"\" leaving all the other items off the table. 2. Lack of channels for practitioners to voice their opinions on important issues that critically impact the practioners in the CA Board Member Comments Outdated Regulations 1. Regulations need to be updated, they have been there since the 1970's. National Exam 1. The board receives heavy legislative influence and pressure to adopt the national exam. Relationship with Legislature 1. Continue improve the communication with legislature to le ad to inform them of the Board's accomplishments. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Ambiguity 1. The need to clean -up licensing loopholes in regulations. 2. Regular review of regulations to remove loopholes and/or ambiguity. 3. vagueness in the law Board Members 1. Acupuncture Board members are often of very divergent opinions. Board members often do not understand the process, and frequently change. These problems create a lack of relevance and effectiveness of the Boards legislative agenda's November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 45 Weaknesses Legislation and Regulation Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Communication/Collaboration 1. Collaborate with business and professional committees to build constructive and proactive relationships. 2. Open communication channels. 3. Lack of openness t o provide assistance to other units. 4. This Policy Coordinator could brush up [redacted] customer service skills but poses little harm to the Board. Staff T echnical T raining 1. Improve staff training on regulations, especially with new department process. Sunset Review 1. Sunset Review background paper deficiencies. Timeliness 1. Timeline for regulations to become effective, lack of staff for the unit 2. Needs to be more proactive with the tasks that have deadlines. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 46 Strengths Outreach External Stakeholder Comments Board Meetings 1. Meetings are streamed live on the web 2. solicits public comment and insures access to meetings Email Subscription /Online Communication 1. Good electronic communication. 2. they may have fixed the email thread, after being down for years. We tried multiple times to get back on the email list and finally got it done when were were connected to a live person. 3. I do appreciate the emails sent out regarding meetings, etc.. 4. Facebook 5. Great website 6. I get all notifications 7. becoming better with these emails and information 8. I don't notice outreach except in the emails for board meetings that I opted -in for. 9. I am on the board's email list for regular meetings, so thank you. 10. The board is trying to respond to all events effectively. Reference/Educational Materials 1. The recent brochure is well designed and informative 2. To spread out the scientific research about the effectiveness of acupuncture to the public on the web Miscell aneous 1. Expose students to serve in some outreach community clinics Board Member Comments Information Pamphlet 1. The education pamphlet the Bo ard is currently working on. Stakeholder Input 1. The Board posts invite notices for stakeholders to attend sessions. 2. The Board benefits from engaged stakeholder population. Open discussion and interaction that helps the Board decide on issues in an informed manner. 3. The Board openly invites stakeholders to board meetings and webcasts. 4. The Board conducts stakeholder meetings to obtain their feedback. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 47 Strengths Outreach Board Member Comments Website 1. The Board has a website available. 2. The Board updates and adds information and resources online. 3. Board online/email subscriptions which is a method for the Board to ensure direct communication and engagement with stakeholders. 4. Internet outreach, specifically the forms provided to licensees and associations. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Efforts 1. Much better than in the past, but we could do more. 2. This is an area where the Board has made significant strides. 3. Emailing to subscribers and updating the website has increased Outreach to Stakeholders 1. Key examples are outreach to major stakeholders of ACAOM, NCCAOM, and CCAOM. 2. Also there has been stakeholder focus type workshops. 3. Finally the completion of sited visits at all of the Boards approved training programs facilitated much better understanding , compliance and buy in from the schools that offer acupuncture training programs 4. Alerts and letters to licensees about new regulations, there have been more meetings with stakeholders Transparency 1. Transparency. Specifically, the posting of materials, board meeting information and notifications through alerts and announcements which has improved during the past four years. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 48 Weaknesses Outreach External Stakeholder Comments Acupuncture Awareness 1. Why isn't the board educating us providers and the public about: H.R.2839 -Acupuncture for Heroes and Seniors Act of 2017. https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th -congress/house - bill/2839. Rep Judy Chu has been trying for years to get traction in this regard with no attempts to raise awareness by the board that I am aware of. 2. We need to be in hospitals and medical clinics and hired as employees with benefits in parity with primary care health professionals with our many thousands of hours of clinical experience. Often we are marginalized as other \"non evidenced based\" pseudo -science. 3. Having acupuncture considered mainstream & covered by all insurances 4. there is still the perception that acupuncture is not real medicine, that herbal medicine is dangerous and to stay away from and if it was real insurance would take a bigger part in paying for it. 5. Only a small fraction of Americans are aware of let alone using acupuncture. Outreach and education should be of primary concern and priority. 6. Need advertise for acupuncture and natural herbal effectiveness, nutri tion. Consumer/Public 1. What IS the Board doing to educate the public about the effectiveness of acupuncture? I don't see where they do. 2. I am unaware of any public education efforts in this regard (2) 3. Education of consumers and patients are weak 4. I also feel our board needs to better provide outreach into under served communities of color and varied socio -economic status. 5. The public have little idea what to expect or what their rights are. 6. I do not think I have ever seen anything go out to the public about ac upuncture: its benefits, licensing requirements, or approved schools. 7. I don't notice outreach except in the emails for board meetings that I opted -in for. I do not notice public consumer outreach. 8. I think much of the promotion of the profession is done by private practitioners, not to mention, I don't think I have ever been on the receiving end of outreach by the Board. What about a public health campaign? ive never seen such a thing... Licensees 1. Not being proactive in educating acupuncturists. 2. It is not well known the outreach to Chinese or Korean who had the license. Need to be more announcement to understanding and participate. 3. There are very few updates on what the board is doing. NCCAOM does a much better job in providing monthly email updates to lic ensed practitioenrs. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 49 Weaknesses Outreach External Stakeholder Comments Outreach 1. I have no idea. The Board hasn't communicated this. I went to the website and even searched \"outreach\" and found nothing 2. Perhaps, zero outreach, I should say. Whatever it is adopting now is not working. 3. It seems it is up to the individual to connect with the board 4. What outreach? (3) 5. I don't have a clue what the Board is doing! How are they communicating their Outreach? 6. They haven't warned PTs that they are breaking the law if they do acupuncture in CA. Miscellaneous 1. phone conference technology very poor from offsite locations 2. The CAB can play a bigger role in the dry needle concerns. 3. None that I have seen. And didn't they stop publishing their booklets? 4. Need more budget or faculties to assist their work. 5. It would be good to have the meeting televised or online Performance 1. They are internal and self serving only 2. I don't care if board does a bad job here. We don't need to rely on it to educate our patients or the p ublic. I think you should stick to enforcement. 3. incompetence. 4. Board lacks the necessary expertise to properly serve as a source of educational information. Better qualified practitioners need to be recruited to serve on the board. Stakeholders 1. How many p eople actually attend meetings? Does the board have a presence at acupuncture conferences/symposiums? 2. Not connected with nursing homes and many state and county hospitals 3. Social network sysyem 4. Although overall things are improving, there could be more of an effort made to educate mainstream medical facilities about the many benefits of integrating acupuncture into mainstream medicine. 5. Secondly, (and maybe this falls under a different sub topic) health insurance companies should be more educated on the efficacy and cost efficiency of Chinese medicine in areas of health beyond pain management in order to broaden coverage to include more health specialties like oncology and fertility. In addition, it would be helpful if there were more acupuncture research studies being done to support the previous comments. 6. Voices from the education fields are not taken well. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 50 Weaknesses Outreach Board Member Comments Board Presence 1. Represent at the national and state level organizations, thus making the Board's presence more official. Through this, breaking the intimidation and allowing stakeholders to trust the Board. 2. The Board's communication with the external environment. Thus, c an communicate the amount of great work the Board has been doing the last couple of years. The great work we been doing these last years. For example, creating informational accomplishment posts. 3. Utilize social media like Facebook, LinkedIn in such a way to educate stakeholders on what the Board is doing. 4. Conducting a stakeholder meeting in Los Angeles regarding curriculum standards. Electronic Communication 1. This area is not a strong suit, in fact outreach has been poor. The Board needs to enhance the informational pamphlet then provide to the education committee for revision. Ultimately an electronic format of the informational pamphlet should be provided to practitioners so that they can print and disseminate to all patients. 2. The Board needs to imp rove electronic communication. 3. Upgrade email lists of practitioners. Ask for email list subscriptions during board meetings. The Board needs an official announcement to encourage schools to collect emails from its staff and students. Outreach to Decrease Cases 1. Needs to be developed with the purpose of decreasing fraud and unethical cases. For example, what is required for licensees to know in order to decrease poor judgment and actions. 2. Educate the public about the Board structure and process to help reduce unnecessary complaints. 3. Reduce complaints through reaching out to organizations including those that are Chinese, Korean, and Japanese to obtain emails and provide educational information. Scope of Practice 1. Reaching out to stakeholders including consumers on the scope of practice of an Acupuncturist to inform them what can be legally provided. This outreach can include communication with organizations and the dissemination of an educational pamphlet. Or, if the Board disseminates a clean, simple, non -organizational based email regarding scope of practice, and encourage for it to be copied and sent to mass emails subscription lists. Hardcopy Informational Materials 1. Disseminating hard copy of informational ma terials. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 51 Weaknesses Outreach Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Board Presence/Outreach 1. There's outreach? Not that I have seen. 2. The limited exposure the Board has for Outreach is during a few Board meetings a year where the public is of limited number in attendance most time. This area could be incorporated into the Board's agenda in the future to give the Acupuncture some positive exposure. 3. There are no outreach efforts other then Public Board Meetings. When I think of \"outreach\" I thin k of events with a table, handing out information. 4. Outreach does NOT exist. 5. I have no idea what the board does. 6. Historically this has been relatively no existent. 7. Lack of outreach. 8. Failure to understand s take holders concerns and input. Communication 1. The Board needs to communication more effectively with students regarding licensure requirements. Laws & Regulations Interpretations 1. Lack of resources for consumers and licensees on lay persons interpretations of the Board's laws and regulations. Recruitment 1. There is a large demand for this area to bring more awareness to the Acupuncture profession but there is no dedicated staff on Board. 2. Not any dedicated staff person for outreach and no quarterly newsletter 3. We don't have enough staff to assign someone the task of outreach. Trend Analysis 1. The need for greater trend analysis to address upcoming issues. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 52 Strengths Board Administration External Stakeholder Comments Board Meetings 1. Publish the minutes of the meetings and announces the dates of the meetings. Development 1. current administration doing much better job than the previous one. 2. The promotion of Ben Bodea as director demonstrated strong internal development and capacity building. Ben is a good listener and very objective and appears to foster that in staff and board also. 3. Getting much better; in the past did not provide proper oversight and meetings were a trainwreck 4. As long as the legislature let's the CAB do it's job, the CAB does well. 5. It seems to be better now. Before, th e leadership of the board was poor. The board itself was also dominated by zealots who wanted acupuncturists to be mini -western doctors and by acupuncturists who thought that because they were nominated to the board, they were suddenly smarter than those o f us who have been involved for 30+ years. Performance 1. the board is very skilled at protecting its own interests. 2. This is the boards strength, in fact it appears they are overly focused on it 3. The Staff are extremely capable and do a wonderful job. Board Member Comments Board Members 1. Board members and staff are prepared and engaged. Board Performance 1. The Board staff is doing good. 2. The Board staff is doing good job and care regardless of the lack of resources. 3. Staff is responsive. 4. Staff are prepared and engaged. 5. The staff is really well trained and qualified and work hard for the Board. 6. The new EO is really engaged the style and leadership to inspire and encourage staff to participate and work. Creating good team dynamic and communicat ion. 7. The board current is excellent in communication. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 53 Strengths Board Administration Board Member Comments Communication with Board Members 1. The Board staff does a great job on giving Board Members timely information. 2. The Board available to answer Board Member questions. 3. Board Members and staff participate in team -building activities while consulting with legal. 4. The Executive officer and staff has been friendly and professional to Board Members in such a way that makes Board Members feel as part of the team. Executive Officer Performance 1. The Executive Officer has stepped up to the plate. Worked at all levels of board and understands every duty with such thoroughness and sympathy and takes public interest and staff in mind. The EO really did a lot to bring efficiency and create an environment that creates better collaboration and morale. The administration has gone so much smoothly since the EO has taken home at the Board. 2. The Executive Officer has a unique talent, true leadership skills. Sought de velopment through additional training outside training. Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Communication with Board Members 1. Effective communication from the Board Executive Officer to board leadership, Board President and Vice President. Leadership 1. in the past I would rate this area as poor. 2. I like our new EO. There is still some toxicity left over from the prior EO. She had a habit of down talking staff members to other staff members. Wreaked havoc on confidence of several staff membe rs, myself included. 1. Good and fair management with clear policies and rules, management knows a lot about all of the functions of the Board, Board has productive meetings and members have an interest in education for the licensees/consumers and public prot ection 2. Recent change in headship has turbo charged the refinement of Board process in all units. This is currently very effective. 3. The Board staff is valued. 4. The Board supports and encourages staff training. Recruitment 1. As of a few weeks ago, the Board finally is fully staffed with 13 personnel after 18 months of transitioning between management. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 54 Weaknesses Board Administration External Stakeholder Comments Accessibility 1. Whenever call or try reach the board is busy in desk person. If the leadership is well, the service will be better to customer. 2. Not able to reach anyone very directly without great effort. Too few staff or some other issue is hindering this. It used to be much better. Board Meetings 1. failure to post meeting minutes on website 2. The minute publishing is too behind. 3. at the meetings I have attended, there have been board members who obviously were unprepared and not knowledgeable regarding the procedure, regula tions, and issues. On some occasions, a member gave the impression that [redacted] thought it was a joke.\" 4. Sometimes I do not think certain members of the Board do not understand acupuncture, education, or accreditation. 5. Even the board decision making is by voting of the board members, sometimes someone may unite to vote for some decision making. It might not be correct. Board Mission 1. they need to focus more on safety and less on market saturation. market saturation ha s nothing to do with patient safety. Leadership 1. I have already gave my opinion about the leadership. It is ineffective, incompetent, and intolerant and much inertia bound in their actions. 2. The Board lacks leadership due to limitations of expertise in the field as well as limitations due to restricted in depth discourse and discussions. Performance 1. Can only say I have never heard anything good about the Board. 2. Too much bureaucracy 3. Slow path 4. inconformity 5. Arbitrary, capricious, petty, vindictive and probab ly illegal. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 55 Weaknesses Board Administration External Stakeholder Comments Staff Performance 1. The Board staff are meant to be an extension of the Board, not independently functioning entities. They often appear to be making arbitrary decisions without the consultation of the board, where the only people who actually know and understand Chinese Medicine are located. The Board has insufficient oversight of their staff. 2. Lack of staff training 3. The Board may feel amongst themselves that the Board is effective at this goal, but as a student learning the profession, I can't say that I am aware of how the Board actually works. I feel there is a lot lost in translation. I feel very removed from the Board and the more intricate workings. Maybe there is a w ay to reach our or involve students in this? Staffing 1. long-standing vacancies 2. They may need more man power? Board Member Comments Board Member Team Building 1. Better understanding on how to build comradery among Board Members without the fear of violating the Bagley Keen Act. Board Member Training 1. The Board Members want to do a good job, but do not know how to and hardly do the work. There needs to be Board Member education and training to help develop various skills. 2. The Board members need to be better equipped to be better judges, not break laws, rate cases that come in front of them, discern which cases are worse than others, objectively make decisions. The Board Members play the role of a judge when considering criminal and unethical cases. There needs to be sound, reasonable and objective decis ions, but Board Members do not know how to play their roles and responsibilities in such scenario. 3. There needs to be Board Member training similarly to the Leadership Academy provided to Board executives and management . The Board Member Orientation Traini ng (BMOT) is a good start. The Board Members need important information engrained. For example, the Bagley Keen Act. 4. The Board Members need education specifically regarding Board Member duties, responsibilities, and understanding of the board's scope and authority. Also regarding the Bagley Keen Act. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 56 Weaknesses Board Administration Board Members Comments Board Member Training (continued) 5. The Board Members are not prepared for making decisions on cases. For example, there has been harsh decision on a few cases. There should be more analytical thinking before making decisions because it ultimately impacts people's lives. Perhaps a mock session and discussing a case. 6. The Board members need development on how the procedure on how to propose or vacate a point. BreEZe 1. BreEZe is an opportunity , but has been long time in the works. The Board has been amongst the last programs to have system implemented. The goal of BreEZ e is to check status of a license of practitioner. Recruitment 1. There is a lack of management to help manage employees. 2. The Board is short staffed who are spread thin. Staff Training 1. The Board needs staff trainings to help them understand their rules and roles better Board Executive Officer and Staff Comments Board Member Training 1. Board Members lack training on the board's role in enforcement. 2. The need to provide Board Members with tools on effective governance. Communication with Board Members 1. The Board Executive Officer improvement of overall communication with all Board Members. Internal Communication and Morale 1. Favoritism for a particular staff member in this unit has caused for questionable decisions that should have included more input from other staff members. In addition, because of favoritism, office protocols have been unequally enforced. 2. And then, there is also an \"unofficial Assistant Manager\" who seems to have been favored for a very flexible attendance policy: i.e., multiple \"business -related\" walks, flexible working hours with unregistered absences...while the rest of the employees mus t adhere to a stricter attendance policy. This definitely creates a negative morale in the office. November 2017 \u00b7 Acupuncture Board \u00b7 Environmental Scan \u00b7 57 Weaknesses Board Administration Board Members Comments Internal Communication and Morale (continued) 3. The Examination unit is finally caught up with th e basic responsibilities of overseeing the whole California Acupuncture Licensing Examination with the new hired Full time. However, there was a recent important internal process change transpires between the management, the \"un -official Assistant manager\" and the new hire that excluded the Examination Coordinator who had overseen the operation of this unit for the past 4 -5 years. I think this style of communication can erode into the unit's morale. When an employee feels excluded from a major decision -maki ng process, when the deciding factor has a potential threat to the Acupuncture profession, this employee will feel resentful from the mistrust that transpired without [redacted] input. This could affect her work dedication to the unit in a sustainable way. Meanwhile, the Education unit is finding the opportunity to tackle the Licensee audit which fell behind 2 years due to staff shortage. 4. Invest in more staff. Recruitment of Manager 1. The Board is experience a lack of managers. 2. No manager to monitor staff (2) 3. Administration at the analyst level is 85% invisible Resource Management 1. outdated software 2. lack of budget 3. Fees may not be supporting the budget and functions of the Board as well anymore Staff Performance 1. This unit consists of 1 full time and 3 -part time staffs to perform and support the whole Board. A small weakness rests in 1 -part time staff who is not very consistent with [redacted] attendance record, and also shy from deadline driven projects. This can create a stressful office frenzy during Board's critical mission of Board meeting preparations and/or impending Sunset Reports preparations. 2. Lack of consistency. Deadlines not met, which means other staff members have to pick up the slack. 3. The need for g reater staff buy -in. 4. The need to increase professionalism. 5. Recently the former leadership not only ignored obvious problems but created extreme workload without proper staffing. 6. The reason is that the Board failed to address obvious problems and often j ust doing the minimum.

Do not allow dry needling and keep physical therapists out of acupuncture. We aren't allowed to give physical therapy any longer. Also, do not allow M.D.s to do acupuncture unless they have gone throug h the same routes as a licensed acupuncturist. That means a traditional oriental medicine school for 3 -4 years, not a weekend course. 9. Acupuncture is for cab licensure. Not for md bio medicine. 10.

The GS -12 pay grade is generally held by white -collar employees in mid -level positions. The Army has since without substantiative information lowered the position to a GS-8 position whic h calls us \"Acupuncture Technicians\" and pays far less. With the over priced education L.Ac.'s receive this was previously a very good way to get our loans paid off (10 year public service forgiveness) and a good salary.

DATE 1 I have not pursued the mentorship program that I know is available to staff. I plan to look into it to see if it is a worthwhile pursuit. It has taken a while to build my confidence up to even believe there may be a job out there more suited to my abilities. I do like the job I have right now but would love a job that was more research and numbers based. 9/19/2017 9:28 AM 2 It seems that growth is provided for certain staff and others it is not. 9/19/2017 9:02 AM 3 I had an interest in participating in the Enforcement Academy offered by the SOLID Department but was turned down as it was not directly related to my current job position. However, I disagreed because I am working with policies and regulations on a daily basis, I like to understand more about the enforcement process. Also, if it interests me, I would like to pursue my career in the enforcement area. 9/15/2017 2:29 PM 4 I agree with this.

DATE 1 My current boss is more willing to allow staff to do some of the heavy lifting, such as reports that need to be done. The prior EO kept things close to the vest and tried to do everything alone or with minimal help. 9/19/2017 9:28 AM 2 For a few promotional job interviews that I went on, I was given limited time off for preparations for them. For example: the exact time and driving mileages between destinations had to be reported, but extra time to be available on site prior to the interviews were not considered. I need more time to mentally prepare and calm my interview jittery, so I would just claim sick hours when I need to go on interview. In addition, there is that unspoken anxiety of not letting on that I am looking for advancement as that means if there is an opportunity for advancement in the office, I will be passed over since to prevent staff rotation if one gets promoted. 9/15/2017 2:29 PM 3 I feel I should have more training when I started but wasn't given the opportunity or the chance to prove myself worthy that I can perform my job excellent. 9/13/2017 8:03 AM 4 This organization is not dedicated to individual professional development for all staff. I believe that there are some that are favored to grow and develop, and some that do not get any opportunity. 9/12/2017 12:29 PM 5 On a personal level, I believe that this organization is sympathetic to my professional development.

Instead, these tasks get re-assigned to other staffs, hence putting undue burden on to other's already full schedules. As we had our former EO removed, we all seemed to adapt to the change which was difficlut. 9/12/2017 12:41 PM Having to adapt to a new style of Supervision is a challenge. The EO can be a micromanager when it comes to reporting our time, a style nobody has been used to. Many have received numerous emails, and what proper protocol is from the EO, however there is the one person in the office who doesn't follow the protocol, and it's seems he's let off the hook because of relationship with EO. Others have family or illnesses that they deal with, and to get extra pressure from the EO really breaks down the moral of the office, and makes employees feel as though they do not want to work here because of how employee is left to feel \"picked on\". I agree for the most part, however, not all employees quickly adapt. 9/11/2017 10:08 AM Plus or minus 9/8/2017 11:25 AM 15 / 38 0 1 3 4 Acupuncture Board Employee Engagement Survey Q15 Employees here always keep going when the going gets tough.

There 9/19/2017 9:18 AM are often times when I haven't been informed on updates to things that I am working on. Also the E.O. has a habit of asking me to do something and then ends up doing it himself and not saying anything, so the work gets done twice. Also he doesn't communicate exactly what he wants done on a task or changes his mind from what was first communicated. So the task gets done by me, then when he checks it, he redoes the task or there are so many changes that I end up starting over. Some in the office get assignments redirected to other staff, without even asking staff if they can handle the additional workload. I feel that the staff person who's jobs are being redirected should step it up, or Supervisor should require more from the person. Pretty soon this staff person will not have any duties left if duties keep being distributed to other staff. There is another staff person who seems to know everything, about all that the EO is dealing with. I feel that this person is involved in way too much, when it's not in their job description and really none of their business to know so much. 9/12/2017 12:41 PM 21 / 38 Acupuncture Board Employee Engagement Survey Q21 Communication between leaders and employees is good in my organization.

I should be able to make decisions with my years of experience in my field, but I don't often get to. Ideas can be presented but most of the time, it went through so many filters that the decision just got applied without everyone on board.

Sometimes we are told \"good job\" by the E.O. Other times things should be recognized about an accomplishment of someone to the whole staff and it's not. Unfortunately, this means these strong work performers sometime get more assignments that belong to the weaker staffs who often missed their priorities.

For example, 70% of external stakeholders rated the Board 's overall Licensing effectiveness as Very Effective or Effective . Based on the response rate, we can be 95% confident between 61% and 79% of external stakeholders would rate the Board ' Licensing effectiveness the same way.11 To help improve data integrity, the online survey did not provide a neutral option when asking about overall effectiveness. Instead, stakeholders completing the survey chose between a positive choice (excellent or good) and a negative choice (poor or very poor). This allows th e Board to better understand whether stakeholders have a positive or negative view of the Board in various areas.
