AYURVEDA What Is Ayurveda \"Ayurveda\" (ayurveda) means \"knowledge of life\" or \"art of living\". It is a Sanskrit term, where \"ajus\" means life and \"veda\" knowledge, wisdom. As the \"life\" is synonymous with \"health\", Ayurveda is the knowledge about health. Ayurveda is the world's oldest system of medical and philosophical, descended from ancient India, before five thousand years. Ayurveda is a medical and metaphysical vital knowledge about healing, the mother of all healing arts and at the same time the philosophy of the art of living. Its essence is aware of the human aspiration to full balance of body, mind and spirit. Ayurveda teaches us how to live maintaining the natural balance. It helps us to understand each other, but also the environment in which we live. It is therefore a system of philosophy dealing with the nature, purpose and meaning of human life. In the Vedic knowledge of the purpose of life is self-knowledge or self-fulfillment, ie. The realization of the divine consciousness and expression of the divine in everyday life. Ayurvedic medicine is based on the methods of natural healing, uses herbal medicine, body treatments aimed at cleansing the body of toxins as physical and mental regeneration of the body, thus ensuring a return to full health. Inherent in the processes of health is the use of properly formulated diet, taking into account body type (Prakriti) as well as currently occurring disorders (Vikriti). The whole process of health also includes appropriately selected physical exercise, practice yoga and pranayama (breathing exercises), as well as work on more subtle levels - mind and emotions. Many scholars believe that it is the oldest existing treatment systems. Ayurveda is a science so very old, though perversely determined \"medicine of the future\", as it were rediscovered and practiced with high efficiency by the inhabitants of the western countries. Ayurveda not only refers to the plane of the medical, but applies to all levels of human activity. Eastern medicine, including Hindu, unlike Western medicine recognizes the man holistically and affects every aspect of human life, focusing on the prevention of illness, and when it will happen removing its source, rather than its symptoms, and maintaining balance at every level of existence. According to the Ayurvedic definition of health, full health is not based solely on the lack of clear symptoms of disease, but a condition of absolute well-being in its very essence. Ayurveda teaches us how to live, to take advantage of our inner strength and to develop a fully man's (material) and the spiritual (energy) potency. The ultimate goal of our life is to attain enlightenment, or the fulfillment of the soul, our energy potential. Ayurvedic philosophy lays importance on our spiritual growth and awareness. It integrates a variety of science in the name of human help in the realization of his highest potential (the fulfillment of his soul).

Upledger Method CST is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a physiological body system called the craniosacral system - comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. Using a soft touch generally no greater than 5 grams, or about the weight of a nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the functioning of the central nervous system.

And it flows upward through the chakras, communicating individual insight and a conscious sense of universal interconnectedness. HOT STONE MASSAGE Balance Your Chi Hot stone massage is a specialty massage where I am using smooth, heated stones as an extension of my hands, or by placing them on the body. The heat can be both deeply relaxing and help warm up tight muscles so I can work more deeply, more quickly.

Reflexology is generally relaxing and may be an effective way to alleviate stress. The theory behind reflexology is that these areas correspond to organs and systems of the body. Proponents believe that pressure applied to these areas affects the organs and benefits the person's health. KATIBASTI An Ancient Science This specialized therapy relieves and nourishes the lower back using herbal oils or ghee. After a gentle Ayurvedic oil therapy on the lower back, specially prepared warm herbal oil is poured over the lumbar- sacral area and retained inside a pool made out of dough. The hot medicated oils helps melt lower spine rigidity and strengthen your bone tissue by removing toxic. NETRABASTI SESSION Natural Healing Ayurvedic Netra Basti nourishing ghee eye bath therapy is used for a wide variety of eye ailments.

KARNA PURANA Ayurvedic Ear Therapy Oil is a procedure performed within the ear, effectively decreasing the tension in the jaw and neck, cleans the ears of the residual wax, reduces excess Vata, improves blood circulation in the head. Systematically used to improve hearing. NASYA TREATMENT TO DITOXIFY THE HEAD An Ancient Science of Ayurveda Nasya is one of the 5 panchakarma (Ayurvedic detoxification therapies) techniques. It is the application of herbal substances into the nose. The nose is the gateway into the head, the sinuses, and deeper into the lungs. The most common Nasya treatment includes the application of Ghee or Oil, sometimes with additional powdered herbs. When Nasya is performed correctly it enhances mental and sensory acuity, promotes mental clarity and emotional happiness, clears the nose and sinuses of obstruction, promotes cleansing and flow of lymphatic fluid, bestows a clear voice, promotes lightness of the body, soothes dryness in the nose, and eliminates the symptoms of disease. PADABHYANGA Natural Healing though Ayurveda Padabhyanga is Ayurvedic foot massage (Pada=foot and Abhyanga=massage) which is soothing , revitalizing, calming and balancing various disturbances of the autonomic nervous system. It is basically explained as a daily ritual especially before retiring at night. Ayurveda says that five marmas ( vital areas) out of 107 marmas are located in each foot. The feet are very important part in our body as it contains many nerve endings. Padabhyanga releases negative energy from these marmas. So padabhyanga is central to our health and wellbeing. Foot massage holds a sacred place in Ayurveda and Indian culture as touching the feet shows deep respect for elders. Sesame oil is most commonly used for foot massage. Sesame oil is a powerful antioxidant, is easily absorbed and is very nourishing for the skin. Depending on the condition of the person medicated oil or medicated ghee can also be used. IONIC FOOT DETOX How dose it work? The IonCleanse by AMD's proprietary and patented technology results in only biocompatible electrical frequencies entering the water. Biocompatible frequencies elicit a relaxation response in the body. Concurrently, the electrical frequencies create an ionic field that cleanses and purifies the body through the healing power of ions. The IonCleanse process ionizes the water, as H20 is split into OH- and H+ ions. These ions attract and neutralize oppositely charged toxins. After the process the user feels invigorated, refreshed, and relaxed. CUPPING An Ancient Science Through suction, the skin is drawn into the cup by creating a vacuum in the cup placed on the skin over the targeted area. The vacuum can be created either by the heating and subsequent cooling of the air in the cup, or via a mechanical pump.The cup is usually left in place for somewhere between five and fifteen minutes. It is believed by some to help treat pain, deep scar tissues in the muscles and connective tissue, muscle knots, and swelling; however, the efficacy of this is unproven. MYOFASCIAL THERAPY Service Subtitle Myofascial (my-o-FASH-e-ul) release is a manual therapy technique often used in massage. The technique focuses on pain believed to arise from myofascial tissues \u2014 the tough membranes that wrap, connect and support your muscles. Theoretically, myofascial pain differs from other types of pain because it originates in \"trigger points,\" which are related to stiff, anchored areas within the myofascial tissue. The pain that a trigger point causes is often difficult to localize, though. During myofascial release therapy, the therapist locates myofascial areas that feel stiff and fixed instead of elastic and movable under light manual pressure. These areas, though not always near what feels like the source of pain, are thought to restrict muscle and joint movements, which contributes to widespread muscle pain. The focused manual pressure and stretching used in myofascial release therapy loosen up restricted movement, leading indirectly to reduced pa TRADITIONAL AYURVEDIC HERBS Balance Your Dosha Ayurvedic herbs are a key component of ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. In general, I use ayurvedic herbs to cleanse the body, boost defense against disease, and keep the mind, body, and spirit in balance. Other healing approaches and techniques (including massage, yoga, and specialized diets) are also central to ayurvedic medicine. Along with ayurvedic herbs, I frequently use certain therapeutic oils and spices to treat imbalance and promote well-being.

With my Intuitive Counseling treatment, your body and mind will feel free and clear of all worries and stressors that life places upon us.

THAI MEDICAL MASSAGE Natural Healing 2,500 years ago a dynamic bodywork therapy based upon yoga and Ayurveda practices, appeared in the temples of Thailand. This therapeutic art was directly rooted in the Indian healing traditions of Ayurvedic medicine. The father founder of Thai Yoga Massage, Jivaka Kumarbhaccha was a renowned doctor and yogi, he treated the Buddha, among others. After the Buddha's death, the earliest Buddhist monks travelled to Southeast Asia and were accompanied by Ayurvedic doctors. These doctors practiced a healing art, that would later evolve into traditional Thai Massage. In this unique healing system of Thai Yoga Massage, also called Nuad Boran, the practitioner guides the client through a series of yoga postures, while palming and thumbing along the body's energy ('Sen') lines and pressure points. Together these actions result in a comprehensive full body treatment that relieves muscular tension, improves circulation, boosts the immune system and balances the body energetically. Thai Yoga Massage is performed on a mat on the floor; both client and practitioner are dressed in comfortable clothing allowing ease of movement and flexibility. SHIRODHARA Balance Your Body, Mind & Spirit Shirodhara (shiro-dar-a) is a unique, blissful therapy that balances and stabilizes the mind. To receive shirodhara, the client lies down upon a massage table with their eyes covered. Next, specially prepared warm herbal oil is poured in a thin steady stream directly onto the forehead and sixth chakra. Shirodhara purifies the mind, alleviates anxiety, reduces headaches, and expands awareness. Shirodhara can be administered on its own or as part of a panchakarma detoxification regime. ADVANCE SKIN CARE THERAPY Healing Therapies MICROCURRENT FASCIAL Cellular Rejuvenation Fascial The microcurrent facial is a therapeutic treatment that delivers safe, painless, low-level electrical impulses to strategic locations under the skin to firm and tone the facial muscles on both an immediate and long-term basis. The technology simultaneously repairs collagen in the dermis (the deepest layer of the skin), while gently erasing signs of aging in the epidermis (the top layer of skin). As we age, our electrical impulses slow down causing aging and sagging facial skin. Microcurrent works in harmony with the natural bio-electrical currents naturally found in our bodies to help speed up the cellular regenerative process resulting in firmer, healthier, more youthful looking skin. RELAXATION TRAINING Balance Your Chi Relaxation Training is a healing technique based on the principle of free and uninterrupted energy flow and helps activate the natural healing processes in each patient's body as well as to restore their physical and emotional well-being. As a certified Holistic Medicine Practitioner, I help patients reduce their stress and anxiety, among other ailments. RADIO-FREQUENCY FACIAL Modern Science Radiofrequency (RF) energy treatment is technology for non-surgical tightening of the early signs of loose or sagging skin; ideal for those people who either don't want, or don't believe they are old enough to have a surgical procedure. Pure RF energy alone (such as the Accent, Pelleve, Thermage and Tripollar devices) is primarily used to treat skin laxity by facial tightening, and is best suited to patients with mild to moderate sagging of facial tissues, usually those in their mid 30s to 50s, with any skin colour. It is commonly used to treat the forehead, under the eyes, cheeks, mid-face, jaw line, and neck. Based on current RF technologies, most people should see at least a mild improvement in their skin tightness, with minimal risks and downtime compared to surgery. Prices for radiofrequency facial tightening treatment depend on the area(s) treated and the device used. MICRODERMABRASION Intensive Skin Rejuvenation Microdermabrasion treatments use a minimally abrasive instrument to gently sand your skin, removing the thicker, uneven outer layer. This type of skin rejuvenation is used to treat light scarring, discoloration, sun damage, and stretch marks. Microdermabrasion can: Improve age spots and black heads. Improve hyperpigmentation (patches of darkened skin). Exfoliate your skin, resulting in a refreshed appearance. Lessen the appearance of stretch marks. Reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Reduce or eliminate enlarged pores. Treat acne and the scars left by acne. Microdermabrasion helps to thicken your collagen, which results in a younger looking complexion. Collagen is a protein in your skin that's abundant when you're a child and makes skin appear taut and smooth. Collagen production declines as we age, resulting in looser, uneven skin. ANTI-AGE FACIAL Preventive Skincare An anti-aging facial will have all the steps of a basic facial, but with ingredients that are targeted to aging or \"mature\" skin, which is usually age 40 and up. But you can have anti-aging facials even when you're in your late twenties or early thirties, because the skin is already showing signs of maturity. Why do we need an anti-aging facial? As we age, our skin gets thinner and dryer. It loses collagen, which gives it a thick, plump appearance, and elastin, which makes it snap back quickly. The time it takes for healthy young cells to migrate to the topmost layer slow down, which makes skin duller looking. And our faces are more exposed to the elements, and get lines and creases from all the facial expressions we make. LIGHT THERAPY TREATMENT Advance Skin Care Science Light Therapy provides the same light therapy technology with the use of LED lights, to effectively remove and kill acne and acne causing bacteria on your skin, with a fraction of the cost. Is ergonomically designed to ensure you get a safe, even level, non-invasive light therapy treatment. Using a combination of blue and red LED lights, Blue Light kills acne by penetrating deep into the skin, right into the source of where acne bacteria builds up. At the same time, the red LED lights reduce the inflammation of the skin, increasing the ability of the skin to heal at a faster rate. KARNA PURANA Natural Ayurvedic Healing Oil is a procedure performed within the ear, effectively decreasing the tension in the jaw and neck, cleans the ears of the residual wax, reduces excess Vata, improves blood circulation in the head. Systematically used to improve hearing.
