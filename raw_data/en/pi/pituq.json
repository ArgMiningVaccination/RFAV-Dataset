This is a review for traditional chinese medicine near Piedmont, CA: \"I recently started working with Brooke McClelland at Harborside Wellness Center on Embarcadero and I can't recommend her highly enough! Brooke is warm, professional, thorough, and committed to offering her clients excellent treatment. I initially booked an appointment with Brooke to work on ongoing chronic pain, but now she's my go-to resource for supporting my physical, emotional, and mental well-being. She is very knowledgeable about Traditional Chinese Medicine and uses a range of modalities in her practice - acupuncture, cupping, and herbal remedies being my favorite. Brooke's treatments are deeply relaxing, and I experience a positive impact to my health not only during our sessions, but for several days following. I am excited to continue working with her for many seasons "}
