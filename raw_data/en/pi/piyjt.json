Being a critical hormone, it regulates a wide range of vital bodily functions. Therefore, the body requires a large amount of testosterone to maintain a healthy body and neurological function. The heart is the hardest working muscle in the body, pumping approximately two ounces every day for a lifetime. To keep this small but efficient muscle working, one must understand the importance of heart health. Unfortunately this lack of understanding causes millions of Americans to suffer from heart disease. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) \"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites.(2)\" Among these ethnicities, African Americans have the highest death rate. Why is it that African Americans are at the top of this list? Perhaps it is because of the social inequality experienced on the socioeconomic scale. Socioeconomic status can heavily influence the optimal health of the heart in an individual; resulting in cardiac injury. Socioeconomic status is comprised of income, housing, education, employment, and social position.

This book helps people find simple ways to minimize stress and conflict while bringing out the This source covers many solutions to help relieve stress. For example, something as simple as breathing correctly can help alleviate some stress. Many people breathe with only a small portion of their lungs, resulting in short, small breaths. By breathing through the abdomens, the stress on one's shoulders and back will be reduced. Exposing oneself to nature can also alleviate stress. A study was conducted at Stanford University with two different groups. One group was placed in a forestry area and the other on a busy street. Brain scans were later taken of the participants, revealing that the nature group displayed less negative thoughts while those on the busy street exhibited more negative thoughts, proving that nature helps lessen the effects of stress as depression and anxiety are primary effects of stress. Additionally, massages may soften the impact of stress on the body. During stress, cortisol levels can rise abnormally high resulting in high blood pressure, heart disease, type II diabetes, depression, or anxiety.

Immediate physiological response to any type of stressor facilitates survival of the species at its maximum. Despite of normal homeostatic regulatory mechanism, the stress responses can become maladaptive. Chronic stress, for example immobilization, exposure to noise, irradiations, psychological stress can leads to a host of adverse health consequences, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, obesity, depression and early ageing (McEwen et al, 2004). Acute stress or single exposure to stressor of minutes to hours will be not produce any ill effect as body have protective and adaptive effects managed by hormones and other physiological agents. However re-exposure has proven to be more enigmatic or difficult to reverse. Conrad et al (1999) stated that severe or prolonged exposure to stressors is harmful, brief or moderate stressors actually enhance neural function. Various behavioral studies focusing on the memory functions of the hippocampus have demonstrated that moderate stress enhances memory performance but severe stress causes adaptive plasticity and impairs memory. Prolonged stress produces interaction between local neurotransmitters and hormones leading to structural and functional damage causing suppression of neurogenesis. The main mechanism is, as hippocampus is intensity sensitive to stress and the stress hormone glucocorticoids (GCs) (Bruce et al The willow tree has been used since ancient civilizations for its ornament, erosion control, timber, and especially its bark. The story of the willow tree dates to Hippocrates, 4000 BC, when people were advised to chew on the bark of a willow tree to lessen inflammation and reduce fever. The bark of the tree contains a compound called salicylic acid, which is a common ingredient in aspirin and is known for a multitude of medicinal effects ranging from something as simple as a pain-reliever to disease prevention. This paper focuses on the history of the willow tree, its anatomy, and its medicinal properties in relation to disease prevention. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice.

(16) Plants have been used as botanical medications for years before history was even recorded. A prime example is the Chinese Rhubarb, which was also known as Rheum officinale. Rhubarb is one of the most widely used herbs in Chinese medicine. The Chinese rhubarb originated and is native to the mountains and plateaus of China and Tibet. The rhubarb is a hardy species which can be found as weeds in people's gardens and on the side of the road as well.
