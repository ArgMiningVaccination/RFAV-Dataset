Description Discover how Dr. Paul Thomas was punished for pursuing the truth for his patients regarding vaccines. On December 3, 2020, the Oregon Medical Board issued an emergency order to suspend the license of renowned physician Paul Thomas, MD. The ostensible reason was that Dr. Thomas posed a threat to public health by failing to vaccinate his pediatric patients according to the CDC's schedule. However, the order came just days after Thomas published a peer-reviewed study indicating that his unvaccinated patients were the healthiest children in his practice. The medical board ignored this data despite having requested Thomas to produce peer-reviewed evidence to support his alternative approach. \"Dr. Paul\" started out practicing medicine the way he was trained to, which meant vaccinating according to the CDC's routine childhood vaccine schedule. But then he went on a journey of awakening, becoming what he calls \"vaccine risk aware,\" and arrived at a place where no longer in good conscience could he continue \"business as usual\" with this one-size-fits-all approach. He left a private group practice to open his own clinic with the foundational principles of individualized care and respect for the right to informed consent. He wrote the Vaccine-Friendly Plan with Jennifer Margulis, PhD, to help parents navigate the decision-making process. Then the accusations from the medical board started coming. The War on Informed Consent exposes how the medical board suspended Dr. Thomas's license on false pretexts, illuminating how the true reason for the order was that, by practicing informed consent, he posed a threat to public vaccine policy, which is itself the true threat to public health.

The War on Informed Consent is an extraordinary and riveting dissection of Dr. Paul Thomas's medical board lynching. We at CHD are very proud to have it in our collection.\" \u2014ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., author of The Real Anthony Fauci; founder and chairman of the board, Children's Health Defense; and founder, Waterkeeper Alliance \"Dr. Thomas is one of those rare courageous people who dare to stand up to the establishment when they see strong evidence that the establishment's policies are dangerous, even when it might cost them their career. This book seamlessly weaves together Dr. Thomas's remarkable life story with much valuable information about the risk/benefit ratio for vaccines. A must-read for parents who face expanding government mandates that steadily erode our personal freedom of medical choice.\" \u2014STEPHANIE SENEFF, PhD, author of Toxic Legacy \"Doctor Paul Thomas is one of the few remaining caring and brave pediatricians who not only listens to the parents' well founded concerns but also respects their wishes and more importantly, their rights. Instead of being praised, Dr. Thomas has been punished by the medical community, in this case the Oregon Medical Board, which seeks to silence all those who dare oppose the industry in which they operate as paid servants. Jeremy Hammond is one of the few courageous journalists who swims against this current of unparalleled corruption and, in his excellent book, The War on Informed Consent: The Persecution of Dr. Paul Thomas by the Oregon Medical Board, Mr. Hammond exposes this Kafkaesque trial for all those who still have the freedom to think and decide for themselves.\" \u2014ROB SCHNEIDER, actor \"This book is a must-read for any parent who wants to know what they are up against when making educated decisions in the best interest of their child's health or looking for a pediatric provider.\" \u2014TETYANA OBUKHANYCH, PhD, immunologist, immune science educator at Building Bridges in Children's Health, and author of Vaccine Illusion \"In The War on Informed Consent, Jeremy Hammond systematically deconstructs numerous lies and ploys promoted by the allopathic establishment, showing how regulatory agencies and legislators have been captured, science has been corrupted, and children are being harmed. If you've ever wondered how a highly respected pediatrician such as Paul Thomas could be falsely portrayed as a villain, read this book. A compelling, well-documented expos\u00e9 of the vaccine industry's subversive influence on the practice of medicine!\" \u2014NEIL Z. MILLER, medical researcher and author of Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies \"If you leave yourself a lifeline, then in time, when the going gets really rough, you will reach back and take it. Eventually, painfully, you will come to the realization that that lifeline is as illusory as 'Safe and Effective.' Paul Thomas left himself no lifeline. He not only challenged the corporate medical business model in his day-to-day practice by daring to provide parents with informed consent and choice, but he dared to perform and publish his own vaccine safety science. Delivering on a peer-reviewed vaxxed versus unvaxxed study that unequivocally highlighted the adverse health consequences of vaccination, the system in rage and panic demanded the head of this 'turbulent priest.' Thomas was excommunicated. And the health freedom community\u2014 massive and growing\u2014provided with a true hero. The lifeline is a shackle after all.\" \u2014DR. ANDREW WAKEFIELD, writer and director of Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe and writer, director, and producer of 1986: The Act "}
