When children come down with a cold or the flu, you want to be ready with remedies. Otherwise, you may end up at the doctor's office with a prescription for an antibiotic that might not be needed. Instead, make your own homeopathic kit and have these six remedies on hand at all times. Below are the six remedies and the indications for which they are used. They can be taken in the 6, 12, or 30 potency every hour for acute symptoms, and then reduced to three times a day as symptoms subside. If symptoms do not improve in two days, move to another remedy. 6 homeopathic remedies for kids colds and flu: 1. Aconite This remedy is indicated if onset of illness is sudden.
