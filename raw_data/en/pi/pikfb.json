Might we suggest storing them in the fridge, then pairing with a stacked cheese plate, and perhaps a glass of actual ros\u00e9? Off-the-charts refreshment. Key Ingredients: - Strawberry extract: a rich source of Vitamin C and folic acid, helps protect skin from free radicals while also softening the skin - Resveratrol: an antioxidant found in grapes, helps protect skin and calm inflammation - Hyaluronic acid: hydrates skin to help improve elasticity How to Use Step 1: Unfold the mask and pop it onto your face (wiggle around until you get the best fit possible). Step 2: Leave on for 10 minutes, or longer if you want. Step 3: Remove the mask and massage any excess serum into skin. No need to rinse, just let all that goodness absorb right in. "}
