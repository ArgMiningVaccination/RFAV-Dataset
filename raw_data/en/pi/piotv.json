This paper builds upon previous research by analyzing the arguments proffered on anti-vaccination websites, determining theextent of misinformation present, and examining discourses used to support vaccine objections. Argu-ments around the themes of safety and effectiveness, alternative medicine, civil liberties, conspiracytheories, and morality were found on the majority of websites analyzed; misinformation was also preva-lent. The most commonly proposed method of combating this misinformation is through better education,although this has proven ineffective. Education does not consider the discourses supporting vaccinerejection, such as those involving alternative explanatory models of health, interpretations of parentalresponsibility, and distrust of expertise. Anti-vaccination protestors make postmodern arguments thatreject biomedical and scientic \"facts\" in favour of their own interpretations. Pro-vaccination advocateswho focus on correcting misinformation reduce the controversy to merely an \"educational\" problem;rather, these postmodern discourses must be acknowledged in order to begin a dialogue. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction With morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable dis- eases [VPDs] having reached record lows [1], vaccines are one of the most successful tools for biomedical science and public health.Yet paradoxically, the effectiveness of vaccination has led to the re-emergence of anti-vaccination sentiments. Vaccines may be seenas unnecessary or dangerous because incidence rates of VPDs indeveloped countries have plummeted. Vaccine \"reactions\" - nega-tive health events following vaccination, attributed to the vaccine- then appear to be more common than the diseases themselves[2]. In this way, vaccines can be considered victims of their own success. The media plays a large role in disseminating and sensation- alizing vaccine objections. Such objections are part of what hasbeen called the \"anti-vaccination movement\", which has had ademonstrable impact on vaccination policies, and individual andcommunity health [3]. A common sequence to vaccination scares involves scientic debate about potential vaccine risks, which com-munication technology transmits via a rhetoric of doubt; parentsincorporate this with personal experiences and spread their viewsto their social groups [4]. These social groups exert considerable pressure on vaccination decisions by creating a \"local vaccinationculture\" [5]. With the prominence of the Internet in today's world, Correspondence address: 110 Parkwood ,kataa@mcmaster.ca .the attitudes, beliefs, and experiences of that local culture can quickly become global. Internet usage statistics show approximately 74% of Americans and 72% of Canadians are online [6]. An estimated 75-80% of users search for health information online [7]. Of these users, 70% say the information they encounter online influences their treatment deci-sions [8]. In 2006, 16% of users searched online for information on immunizations or vaccinations [9]. While online research is more convenient and accessible than reading medical literature or vis-iting health practitioners, too great a reliance on Internet-basedinformation can be problematic. Over half (52%) of users believe\"almost all\" or \"most\" information on health websites is credible[8]; yet the availability of inaccurate and deceptive information online has labelled the Internet a \"modern Pandora's box\" [10] . The nature of the Internet allows any and all opinions to spreadwidely and instantaneously. Individuals and groups gain exposureonline without being ltered or reviewed - and anti-vaccinationadvocates have taken advantage of this fact. Anti-vaccination mes-sages are more common on the Internet than in other forms ofmedia, increasing the likelihood that vaccination decisions may bebased on misleading information [11] . Indeed, parents who exempt children from vaccination are more likely to have obtained infor-mation from the Internet than parents who have their childrenvaccinated; they are also more likely to have used certain anti-vaccination websites [12] . This demonstrates the importance of understanding what messages are presented online and why theymay be accepted. The body of research examining online anti-vaccinationism is not large, nor has there been a recent update [11,13-18] . Only 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior research also acknowledgedthe need to understand discourses underlying anti-vaccinationarguments [19,20] , but did not elaborate upon them. This analy- sis aims to address these issues by answering two main questions.First, what information is proffered on anti-vaccination websites,and what is its accuracy? Second, what discourses make these vac-cine objections appealing? 2. Methods 2.1. Data collection Web searches were conducted on May 21, 2009 using the terms \"vaccine\", \"vaccination\", and \"immunization OR immunisa-tion\" input into Google.com (the American version of the search engine) and Google.ca (the Canadian version). Google was chosen as it is the most popular search engine, accounting for 73% of allInternet searches [21] . Results were classied as anti-vaccination and included for content analysis if they opposed childhood vac-cination for any reason, without meeting any of the followingexclusion criteria: (1) listserv or newsgroup pages; (2) pages solely containing brief notices about other website content; (3) newsresults, medical journals or library sites; (4) video results; (5)book previews; (6) non-English sites; (7) sites exclusively aboutadult immunization; (8) sites exclusively about veterinary vacci-nation and (9) inactive links. Criteria (see Tables 1 and 2 ) were applied to the anti-vaccination websites and coded as presentor absent. Criteria were adapted from previous online anti-vaccination studies [11,13,14,17,18] , as well as created by the author. Online health information seekers examine the rst 10 search results 97.2% of the time [22] ; therefore, only the rst 10 results retrieved per term were examined. Of 30 total Google.com results, 5 of 21 immunization sites (24%) were classied as anti-vaccination.Of 30 total Google.ca results, 2 of 16 immunization sites (13%) were classied as anti-vaccination. To amass additional websites for amore meaningful study, the Canadian searches were extended to50 results per term. Of 150 total results, 5 of 86 immunization sites(6%) were classied as anti-vaccination (two were duplicates ofAmerican results). Combining the American and Canadian results,8 anti-vaccination websites were subjected to content analysis.Appendix A lists the sites analyzed.A.

Results 3.1. Proportion of anti-vaccination websites The proportions of pro- and anti-vaccination sites found per search term are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Overall, American searches returned more anti-vaccination results (24%) than Cana-dian searches (6%), indicating American parents are more likelyto encounter anti-vaccination sites via Google than are Cana-dian parents. Neither search engine returned any anti-vaccinationresults for \"immunization OR immunisation\"; this was expectedbased on research that found anti-vaccination groups avoid usingthe term \"immunization\" as they tend not to believe that vac-cines confer immunity [16] . Although prior studies returned more search results [11] , this does not necessarily mean the number of anti-vaccination websites has decreased, but rather that theirsearch rankings may have shifted. Nevertheless, the proportion ofsites retrieved for some search terms is notable - 71% of resultsfrom the Google.com \"vaccination\" search were classied as anti- vaccination.3.2. Content and themes Fig. 2 illustrates the percentage of analyzed sites with the listed themes present. Individual content criteria are quantied in Table 1 . Individual design criteria are quantied in Table 2 . 3.2.1. Safety and effectiveness \"Vaccines are biological poisons, harmful to health, and a contributing factor in childhood illness. \"(http://www. vaclib.org/sites/debate/about.html ) Safety themes were present on all anti-vaccination websites analyzed. Every site claimed vaccines are poisonous and cause idio-pathic illnesses. Sites stressed that vaccines contain substancespoisonous to humans, including anti-freeze, ether, formaldehyde,mercury, and nanobacteria. Pertinent information was not elabo-rated upon - for instance, that the amount of potentially harmfulsubstances in vaccines is not enough to produce toxic effects inhumans, or that ether does not refer to the anaesthetic but toa chemical compound. Illnesses attributed to vaccines included: Fig. 1. Proportion of pro- and anti-vaccination websites returned per search term from American and Canadian Google searches.1712 A. Kata / Vaccine 28 (2010) 1709-1716 Fig. 2. Percentage of anti-vaccination websites analyzed with content and design attributes present. AIDS, asthma, autism, cancers, diabetes, bromyalgia, leukemia, lupus, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and many more. Studiesshowing no link between vaccines and illnesses such as autism [23] were ignored. Questioning whether vaccines actually conferred immunity was also common (on 88% of sites). This included propositions thatvaccination weakens the immune system, or that immunity is inef-fective because vaccinated individuals still contract diseases. Manywebsites (88%) pointed to decreases in disease levels occurringbefore mass immunizations; credit was given only to improve-ments in sanitation, nutrition, and poverty levels. Some websites(38%) suggested \"hot lots\" of vaccines were associated with moreinjuries; one site was selling a list of suspicious lot numbers for $25. Half the websites asserted that VPDs are trivial. One website described smallpox as \"harmless under proper treatment [ ...] And not considered deadly with the use of homeopathy [ ...] And it cer- tainly didn't appear to be that infectious, if infectious at all\" [24] . Another site maintained that infections such as measles improveda child's health, pronouncing, \"the the cure\" [25] . Serious complications of VPDs were not acknowledged - for example, that in developed countries, 1 in 1000children with measles develop encephalitis and 1-2 in 1000 die[26] . 3.2.2. Alternative medicine \"Just because you give somebody a vaccine, and perhaps get an antibody reaction, doesn't mean a thing. The only true anti-bodies, of course, are those you get naturally. \"(http://www. whale.to/vaccines/antibody.html ) Many anti-vaccination websites promoted alternative medicine. Most (88%) endorsed treatments such as herbal-ism, homeopathy, chiropractics, naturopathy, and acupunctureas superior to vaccination. This was linked to the idea of moving\"back to nature\" (on 88% of sites), where natural methods ofdisease prevention were preferable - this included breastfeeding,eating whole foods, and allowing children to experience illnessesnaturally. Critiques and suspicions of biomedicine were present on75% of sites. Most common were arguments against Louis Pasteur'sgerm theory - websites contended that diseases resulted from imbalanced bodily conditions and lifestyle choices rather thanfrom microorganisms. Some staged ad hominem attacks against Pasteur, claiming he plagiarized his theory. Anti-vaccination websites tended to reject scientic, clinical, and epidemiological studies demonstrating the safety and efcacyof vaccines. Pro-vaccination studies were criticized as unreliable,conducted by those with vested interests in vaccination. Onewebsite commented, \"Today's 'science' seems to be much lessscrupulous earlier times\" [27] . 3.2.3. Civil liberties \"No one has the moral or ethical right to compel parents to vaccinate their children against the parents' wishes - not thedoctors, not the schools, not the government at any level. \" (http://www.vaccinationnews.com/Scandals/2008/Feb 2608/ Scandal87.htm ) The most common civil liberties criterion present was that of parental rights (on 75% of websites), which were seen as beinginfringed upon by not letting parents choose how to care for theirchildren. This included describing stories of parents who had theirchildren taken away by social services after learning they hadnot been immunized. Accusations of totalitarianism were madeby 63% of websites. This included warnings that citizens werebeing prepared for draconian measures in the event of a pandemic.Monitoring was mentioned on 25% of sites, with complaints thatimmunization records were used to harass parents who did notvaccinate. 3.2.4. Conspiracy theories/search for truth \"M.D.s [sic] invented the term sudden infant death syn- drome to explain away the 'coincidence' that babies dieabout the same time they receive vaccines. \"(http://www. vaccination.co.uk/Information/Questions/tabid/56/ItemId/4/Default.aspx ) The conspiracy theory theme was present on every website ana- lyzed. Most sites (75%) made accusations of a cover-up, whereregulatory bodies purportedly have information about vaccinesA. Kata / Vaccine 28 (2010) 1709-1716 1713 they are hiding from the public. Equally as common (75%) were sug- gestions that vaccination is motivated solely by a quest for prot.Allegations of collusion were present on 63% of websites, wherepharmaceutical companies and physicians were accused of bene-ting from vaccine reactions as harmful side effects keep them inbusiness. Similarly, 50% of websites were suspicious that govern-ments protect vaccine manufacturers and doctors from possibleharms caused by vaccines. One site quoted that, \"Asking the CDC tolook into vaccine safety is like asking the fox to guard the chickencoop\" [28] . Half the websites analyzed applauded doctors who spoke out against vaccines. Often cited was the study by Wakeeld et al. [29] - considered the origin of the modern vaccine controversy - whichsuggested a link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella[MMR] vaccine. Andrew Wakeeld was portrayed as a martyr,enduring \"character assassination and professional shunning\" [30] . Not mentioned was that the study's ndings were discredited andretracted by the other authors, that Wakeeld faces charges of pro-fessional misconduct, and that he is accused of having falsied hisdata [31] . As for pro-vaccination doctors, 25% of sites suggested they are too afraid to speak out, are in denial that they could beharming children, or are ignorant as to the true nature of vaccines. Unusual theories were propounded by 38% of sites, includ- ing that vaccines contain birth control to sterilize populations orgenetic information to create new pandemics. Some websites (50%)claimed to possess privileged knowledge - for example, using mas-sive amounts of Vitamin C to prevent anthrax or crib death. Theychastised the medical establishment for ignoring such wisdom.The biomedical community was also criticized using anti-sciencerhetoric (on 38% of sites). Sources of knowledge such as personalintuition were promoted, while biomedical information was por-trayed as erroneous; parents were urged to not to allow biomedicalfear-mongering to overshadow their own instincts. The notion of\"informed choice\" was promoted by 38% of websites. Sites insistedthey were not against parents choosing to vaccinate their children,so long as their decision was based upon proper information fromboth sides of the debate. However, the information they providedtended to be one-sided. 3.2.5. Morality, religion, and ideology \"Immunization [ ...] necessitates the belief that it is acceptable to sacrice a few for the good of the majority. \"(http://vran. org/legacy/docs/VRAN-Immunization-Fact-Sheet-v6.pdf ) The theme of morality, religion, and ideology was the least common content theme. Only 25% of websites argued against vac-cination based on religious tenets - for example, being created inGod's image means receiving God's perfect immune system. Onlyone website rejected the utilitarian basis for vaccination, arguingthat vaccinating to protect society was not justiable. Mentioningimmoral acts was most common (on 38% of sites). This includedassociating vaccines with morally dubious actions, such as: virusesbeing cultured in the tissue of aborted fetuses; animals being tor-tured in the process of vaccine manufacturing; and experimentingon children in developing countries when testing vaccines. 3.2.6. Misinformation and falsehoods \"Attenuated vaccine viruses are infectious, therefore they infect the recipients [sic] cells ... [and] have the potential to be transmitted ... through generations. \"(http://www. vaccination.co.uk/Information/Questions/tabid/56/ItemId/4/Default.aspx ) Misinformation and falsehoods were not quantied by previ- ous studies of anti-vaccination websites, but this analysis foundmisinformation to be widespread. Vaccine studies were often mis-represented (on 88% of websites). This included drawing falseconclusions from research, using sources untruthfully, and describ- ing data very selectively. For example, statistics were quoteddemonstrating that the majority of people contracting VPDs werethose who had been vaccinated, implying that vaccination is inef-fective. Further statistics, such as the high rates of unvaccinatedindividuals who contract VPDs, were not included for comparison.Misleading statements were made, such as, \"Sweden banned thepertussis vaccine in 1979, and yet Sweden now has the second low-est infant mortality rate in the world\" [28] . The implication is that vaccination is unnecessary. Not claried was that Sweden merelyswitched from whole cell pertussis vaccines to the acellular form[32] . Many websites (88%) made claims unsupported by evidence, including that: smallpox is not contagious (but rather spread bybedbugs); autism is caused by \"stealth viruses\"; and polio is causedby sugary foods (as the disease was more prevalent in summer, andthus linked to increased ice-cream consumption). One site ques-tioned whether rabies was a psychosomatic manifestation ratherthan a viral disease, and recommended against vaccinations whenbitten by wild animals. The only website without any evidence of misinformation was the \"Vaccine controversy\" Wikipedia page. In some situationsWikipedia's accuracy may be suspect, for any user can modifypages at will; however, in this case its open nature appears tohave acted as a form of peer-review, keeping the page current,unbiased, and properly referenced. There appears to be no inter-nal self-criticism within the anti-vaccination community [13] ; this was demonstrated by most of the analyzed websites, where ques-tionable statements contrary to established medical opinions wentunchallenged. In comparison, because both opponents and propo-nents of vaccination had access to the Wikipedia page, it was themost credible and balanced of all the websites examined. 3.2.7. Emotive appeals \"Parents and doctors must choose responsibility to living children over avoiding guilt about children who have died. \" (http://www.vaccinationnews.com/Scandals/2003/Jan 31/Feb 07/Scandal54.htm ) Personal testimonies were the most common emotive appeals used (on 88% of sites). The majority were narratives from parentswho felt their children were damaged by vaccines. Half of web-sites included the notion of \"us versus them\", where concernedparents and vaccine objectors were portrayed as battling physi-cians, governments, corporations, or the scientic establishment.Pleas were made by 50% of websites for parents to be responsibleand make decisions in the best interests of their children - avoidingvaccination was portrayed as the best way to do so. 3.2.8. Content aspects \"Reporting ALL SIDES Of The Vaccination Controversy!! \"(http:// www.vaccinationnews.com/ ) The websites analyzed included information on legal vaccine exemptions (on 50% of sites), reporting adverse reactions (25%),and nding attorneys specializing in vaccine injuries (25%). Onesite offered online \"classes\" about vaccine dangers. status, labelling themselves as non-prot orpublic education groups. One-quarter labelled themselves as non-partisan sources of information presenting both sides of the debate,but while 100% contained links to other anti-vaccination websites,only 50% contained links to pro-vaccination sites. One site prefacedpro-vaccination links with, \"Samples [sic] sites of how Vaccines aremade to sound Necessary and Okay\" [33] .1714 A. Kata / Vaccine 28 (2010) 1709-1716 4. Discussion The websites examined demonstrated the use of numerous anti- vaccination themes. Of particular interest in this analysis was theuse of misinformation, which had not been previously quantied.Every website save one contained arguments against vaccinationthat could be considered disingenuous. A proponent of vaccina-tion would likely wish to counter with the \"correct\" information;indeed, the most commonly proposed intervention to combat vac-cine misinformation is education. Using a vaccination metaphor,one suggestion has been to \"immunize\" parents against anti-vaccination arguments through proactive vaccine promotion [16] . While acknowledging falsehoods is important, the assumptionsbehind educational methods must be examined. Assuming additional information will influence vaccination decisions reduces the issue to one in which two sides are sepa-rated only by a gap in information [34] . Educational campaigns may portray those in opposition as ill-informed, overly emotional, irra-tional, or anti-rational [35] , further antagonizing those contesting vaccination. Attempts to provide the \"correct\" information havenot been effective, demonstrated by both research [36] and anti- vaccination advocates suing challengers for libel [37] . Historical evidence also illustrates that education has been unsuccessful. Vac-cination protests emerged alongside modern vaccinology in the18th century [38-46] , and have changed little over time [47] . His- torical protest methods included emotional appeals emphasizingparental devotion, denouncing germ theory, accusing medical pro-fessions of duplicity, and alternative analyses of data to portrayvaccination as ineffective. Common themes included worries oversafety, encroachments on individual rights, distrust of scienticauthority, advocating \"natural healing\", promoting sanitary reform,disbelief in theories of contagion, and alleging monetary motiva-tion as the driving force behind immunization. These themes andmethods all persist today, observable on each website analyzed,despite the increased medical and scientic knowledge availableto counter such claims. That these protests have endured over time indicates the pres- ence of broader social and political tensions [41,48] . Historically, the debates centred mostly on civil rights and government dis-trust in relation to compulsory vaccination. While such argumentsare still made, they are less common today than other themes,with the current focus broadening to critiques of medicine, sci-ence, and authority. The present debate occurs in the context ofpostmodern society, which is especially conducive to such protests.This is because the characteristics of postmodernism include con-cerns about values, prioritizing risk over benet, and promotingthe well-informed patient [49] . These characteristics correspond to the three main themes of discourse extracted from the web-sites analyzed: belief in alternative models of health, promotion ofparental autonomy and responsibility, and suspicions of expertise.These discourses help create a framework in which vaccine deci-sions are made - understanding this framework can illuminate whyanti-vaccination ideals may be embraced. 4.1. Alternative models of health Vaccination may be rejected based on different \"explanatory models\" of health and disease [50] . A biomechanical view of the body, where symptoms are caused at the molecular level, maynot be as appealing as recognizing physical and spiritual aspectsof health and well-being [51] . For instance, a common metaphor describing the immune system involves schooling, where immunecells \"learn\"' to identify in favour of \"private schooling\" - tutoringtheir child's immune system through diet, exercise, and healthylifestyles. Rather than \"resisting\" vaccination, these parents instead develop a more positive view of health through rejecting thebiomedical metaphor of battling invaders. This was demonstratedby websites advocating terrain theory, proposing that disease iscaused by improper physiological balance within the body ratherthan by germs; this allows for not only a greater sense of controlover health, but also more holistic acknowledgement. However, not all who refuse vaccination do so because they desire spiritual and physical integration. Some are suspicious ofbiomedicine, and actively resist its global dominance over othermedical systems. Adhering to alternative models of health can bean indication of protest against pervasive medicalization [4]. This was demonstrated by numerous websites criticizing biomedicineas dogmatic, authoritarian, and untrustworthy. Postmodern thought has changed the medical system. Evidence- based decision-making has rened opinions into separate com-ponents: opinions = evidence + values [49] . While pro-vaccination advocates may feel they have evidence supporting their opinion,objectors' values cannot be discounted for they help determine ifan opinion is worth holding. For some, opposing vaccination may beless about vaccines themselves than about embracing health expla-nations more compatible with their concerns, whether holism orresistance to hegemonic practises. 4.2. Parental autonomy and responsibility Many websites stressed the importance of parents educating themselves about vaccination options. This entreaty is designed toencourage parental autonomy, urging them to take charge of theirchildren's health rather than turning it over to others. This exem-plies the paradigm of shared decision-making, where patients areactive partners in making healthcare decisions rather than passiverecipients of advice from doctors [53] . Today's healthcare rhetoric gives legitimacy to informed choice, encouraging people to be crit-ical consumers responsible for their own health [35] . Consumers strive to be knowledgeable and empowered - it is only logical forthis critical view to extend to vaccination. Some websites portrayedthis process of education as more important than the eventual vac-cination decision, for through acquiring knowledge parents become\"free thinkers\" and achieve personal responsibility. While vaccination may be promoted as having societal as well as individual benets, the notion of responsibility relates primar-ily to one's own child. Parents may reject epidemiological andpopulation-level risk arguments for vaccinations, for such statisticsdo not take into account specic experiences, ideologies, and healthhistories. Many mothers consider their child's immune system tobe unique and therefore not appropriate for the recommendedvaccination schedule [54] . These objectors likely take their respon- sibilities as parents seriously, but interpret risks and benets froma more personalized point of view. Indeed, many websites hadtestimonials from parents focusing on possible vaccine risks overbenets from disease prevention; for them, the risks associatedwith a concrete action (i.e. vaccination) seem more salient thanthe risks associated with an abstract disease threat. This contra-dicts the common portrayal of vaccine exemptors willingly puttingtheir children in danger. 4.3. Trust and expertise Accusations of conspiracies were present on every anti- vaccination websites analyzed. Given this lack of trust, providingmore \"education\" will be ineffective. The fact that some vaccinecriticism comes from within the scientic community - Wakeeld'sMMR paper [29] , for instance - reinforces public distrust of scien- tic support. Vaccine anxieties may not result from objections toparticular policies or institutions, but from the debate's back-and-A. Kata / Vaccine 28 (2010) 1709-1716 1715 forth antagonism that likely contributes to suspicions of \"expert systems\" [55] . The postmodern perspective questions the legitimacy of science and authority. Traditional controversy dynamics, with \"audiences\"needing to be \"educated\" by \"experts\", no longer apply [56] . Con- dence in the power of expertise has sharply decreased; appeals toexperts are often considered manipulative. Despite this, makingdecisions without citing expertise often makes groups vulnera-ble. This was demonstrated on numerous analyzed websites -anti-vaccination advocates criticized pro-vaccination studies forbeing faulty or having conflicting interests, yet anti-vaccinationstudies (to which the same criticisms could be applied) wereaccepted unquestioningly. Despite censuring scientic knowledge,anti-vaccination groups appealed to science to bolster their case. The notion of expertise is not static, but continually re- established [56] . Yet this reestablishment can fail, and expert knowledge may be treated as part of the problem. Redening exper-tise is seen within the vaccination debate, where objectors opposemedical \"experts\" attempting to sway them; instead, linking tothe notion of parental autonomy, parents make themselves theauthority on what care their children need. In postmodern soci-ety, the Internet as the dominant medium has \"blown away thedoors and walls of the locked library\" [49] . With the large num- ber of self-styled experts online, even the most respected vaccineauthority's advice becomes just another opinion [57] . Everybody can be considered an expert to some extent [58] . Therefore, appeal- ing to scientic and medical authorities is not as convincing as itonce was. 5. Conclusion This analysis detailed the many arguments proffered on anti- vaccination websites. On such sites, misinformation was pervasive.While this may be considered the principle obstacle to vaccination,providing better education has not been effective. Many \"hard-core activists\" are not persuadable [15] , no matter the amount of information provided. For this reason, more consideration mustbe given to the social discourses underlying anti-vaccinationism -reasons for refusing vaccines may involve alternative understand-ings of health, different perspectives of parental responsibility, orquestioning the legitimacy of traditional authorities. These dis-courses exemplify postmodern tensions in society, making theanti-vaccination issue one of signicant complexity. This analysis was limited by the transient nature of the Internet, where websites addresses and search rankings constantly change.Furthermore, the Internet is borderless; while this study ana-lyzed only the original websites retrieved, hyperlinks can instantlyaccess other sites, including those very influential within the anti-vaccination community that were not retrieved by the originalGoogle searches. A possible explanation for this is that neutralsearch terms were used - queries such as \"vaccine injuries\" or\"vaccines and autism\" would likely retrieve higher proportions ofanti-vaccination results. These results are therefore not exhaustive,but do exemplify the template of themes commonly broached byvaccine objectors. Indeed, they echo the fears currently being raisedregarding the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine [59] . Postmodernism does not accept one source of \"truth\" - a philos- ophy adopted by the anti-vaccination movement. Vaccine objectorsreject the \"facts\" presented to persuade them towards vaccination;for the anti-vaccination movement, \"mis\"information is simplytheir version of information. The Internet acts as a postmodernPandora's box, releasing arguments that are not easily dismissible.Misinformation and falsehoods should not be condoned, yet eachside of the debate labelling the other as \"wrong\" - as has been thestatus quo - is ineffectual. Combating vaccine misinformation witheducation is necessary, but not sufcient [35] . Greater of the discourses underlying anti-vaccinationism is needed inorder to understand the ideologies that support such beliefs. Thiswould be a fruitful avenue for future social science research, forit is through better understanding that a more relevant and lessaccusatory dialogue on the topic can then begin.
