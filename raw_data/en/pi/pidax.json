But for many of us, a season of celebration can catch up with us. If you find yourself feeling heavy, bloated, or low energy come January, you're not alone! The good news is that you don't have to resort to a crash diet to get back on track. Your body is resilient and knows exactly how to rebound, as long as you give it the support it needs. Here are our favorite, easy ways to recover and detoxify naturally. Just remember the mantra: \"Fluids, Fiber, Phytonutrients!\" In this video featuring The Morrison Center Nutritionists, you'll learn Stephanie and Robin's tips and tricks to feeling lighter, energized and motivated throughout the new year. - NO. 1 FLUIDS - Proper hydration is key! Drinking plenty of purified water is essential to helping your body flush out toxins. TIP 1: Begin your day with warm lemon water and sip it throughout the morning. Warm lemon water alkalizes your body, supports your digestive system, and may even help curbs sugar cravings throughout the day. If you can, add a knob of fresh ginger root or turmeric root for extra flavor and anti-inflammatory benefits. TIP 2: Consider carrying around a reusable (preferably glass) water bottle throughout the day so you can refill as needed. If plain water doesn't appeal to you, try adding citrus or fresh herbs to naturally flavor your water and help meet your fluid goals. Flavored sparkling water such as La Croix or Spindrift are great options too. TIP 3: Green Juice is another nutritious tool to add to your arsenal. This is a great way to stay hydrated while also supplying your body with alkalizing nutrients. Opt for a green juice lower in fruit and higher in dark leafy greens to keep the sugar content low. TIP 4: We can't forget about tea. Herbal tea is a great way to supply your body with fluids while also nourishing your system. TIP 5: Bone broth is another beverage to consider adding into your daily rotation. It is a rich natural source of [collagen](https://www.dailybenefit.com/products/daily-collagen), which is known to help soothe the digestive system. If you don't have time to make your own, look for a high-quality brand like Bonafide Provisions or Kettle & Fire. - NO.2 FIBER - Fiber keeps your digestion on track, helps keep you fuller longer, and helps ward off sugar cravings. TIP 1: Make sure you are getting plenty of fiber-rich foods in each of your meals, like leafy greens, crunchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and low-sugar fruit like organic berries, apples, and pears. TIP 2: A great breakfast would be a smoothie made with our [Daily Benefit Fiber](https://www.dailybenefit.com/products/daily-benefit-natural-rice-fiber-supplement-1) and blended with high-fiber fruits and veggies, like our [Green Beauty Smoothie](https://www.dailybenefit.com/blogs/daily-health/daily-benefit-green-beauty-smoothie). - NO.3 PHYTONUTRIENTS - Also known as antioxidants, these nutrients are found in plants and help the body combat any stress. TIP 1: A few of our favorite phytonutrient-rich foods are dark leafy greens (like kale, swiss chard, spinach, collard greens) and red, orange and yellow vegetables (like carrots, peppers, sweet potatoes, squash, citrus fruits, and berries). TIP 2: We recommend including a few servings of these vegetables throughout the day in order to flood the body with alkalizing nutrients. This could look something like a smoothie or shake for breakfast, green juice or herbal tea in the morning, a vegetable-packed soup or salad for lunch and sauteed vegetables with high-quality protein for dinner. - OUR FAVORITE SHAKE AND SMOOTHIE SUPPLEMENTS - | | DAILY BENEFIT REGULAR DETOX SHAKE | | METAGENICS ULTRA GI REPLENISH | | DAILY BENEFIT GLUTAMINE PLUS | | DAILY BENEFIT FIBER - MIX IT UP - Shakes and smoothies can help us check off the Fluid, Fiber and Phytonutrient boxes in one go!
