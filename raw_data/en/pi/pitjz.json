No one loves candles, incense, and room sprays like Febreze or Glade more than I did \u2014 until the day they started giving me mind-numbing headaches. Commercial products are made with artificial scents that are full of chemicals. These toxins are well-known to cause issues like headaches, particularly in people who have sinus issues, severe allergies, or sensitivities to chemicals. When I switched to diy room freshener options, the problem quickly passed. Making a nontoxic room spray is simple. You only need a few ingredients and your favorite essential oils for scent. Plus, it's the perfect alternative to chemical-laden sprays and eco-harming candles sold in stores. In this article, I will show you how to make a room spray with essential oils and explain the benefits or safety concerns with using each. I even provide alternatives to suit everyone's preferences.

Not only do chemicals in commercial sprays cause headaches, there are a number of other reasons to make a nontoxic room freshener instead of buying an option from the store. Even if you don't suffer from strong-scent-causing headaches, you may want to make diy room freshener because: - You want to create a toxin-free home for your kids and pets - You can create a blend personalized with your favorite scents - Homemade sprays make excellent gifts for any occasion - The project is easy and fast to complete - Making multiple scents for various purposes takes moments - Homemade options cost much less and are 100% natural - Febreze, candles, and wax cubes are expensive, toxic, and hardly ever smell like they scent they claim. Long-term exposure even causes health hazards. How to Make Room Spray with Essential Oils Essential oils room sprays involve using a few drops with water and an ingredient to emulsify the oil in a glass spray bottle. Remember, oil and water don't mix. It's crucial that you mix the emulsifier with the essential oil before adding the water. Amber or blue glass bottles are also highly recommended with essential oils, and my recipe uses 2-oz bottles. Ingredients: - 6-18 drops of essential oil ( [lavender essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TSTZQEY/?tag=pyc03-21)is my Directions: Start by adding 6-18 drops of your favorite essential oils in a 2-oz [glass spray bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MBWBF7M/?tag=pyc03-21). Layer the salt on the bottom of the bottle and shake to mix. I like to use sea salt as my emulsifying agent to combine oil and water, but you can use Himalayan or Epsom salt. A small funnel helps get the salt into the bottle without making a mess. Then, fill the bottle the rest of the way with [distilled water](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087HH4VSM/?tag=pyc03-21). Tap water may contain chlorine and other chemicals that may alter the scent. Screw the top into place and shake thoroughly. Add a label onto the bottle and shake it before each use for the best results. Dilution: The amount of essential oils you add depends on how strong you want the dilution. Everyone is different. You may want a weaker dilution if using the spray around children, the elderly, or pets. Use this dilution key to determine how much oil you need in a 2-ounce bottle: - 1% - 6 drops - 2% - 12 drops - 3% - 18 drops I suggest using a small amount of essential oils at first. You can always add more later if you prefer a stronger scent.

I prefer to use [Himalayan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076DSRB6B/?tag=pyc03-21), [sea salt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QW1G8MW/?tag=pyc03-21), or unscented [Epsom salt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N7DQHA/?tag=pyc03-21) because they have no competing scent. Salt is also safe if you have children or pets and much easier to clean if you spill. Other natural emulsifiers you can use to blend oil and water include: - Alcohol: Neutral spirits help distribute the essential oil into the water and preserve the room spray. Use non-scented alcohol like high-proof vodka or grain alcohol, such as Everclear. Never use rubbing alcohol. - [Vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PUOQHDA/?tag=pyc03-21): White vinegar is excellent at neutralizing alkaline odors around your home. Spraying about a tablespoon in a fine mist can remove tiny odor-causing molecules from the air. - [Witch hazel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GCQ04C/?tag=pyc03-21): Witch hazel is an unscented alternative I adore that helps the smell of your spray last much longer. Substitute witch hazel in equal parts to the water no matter what size bottle you use. - [Baking soda](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753YZ3FS/?tag=pyc03-21): Switch out the sea salt for a tablespoon of baking soda if you prefer a Febreze alternative for fabric. Baking soda helps pull odors from curtains, bedding, pillows, the couch, or any other fabric. The Best Essential Oils for Room Freshener [Rocky Mountain Oils](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J2EQOS2/?tag=pyc03-21) is my go-to company. I purchase pure jojoba and essential oils from RMO, and I love that they use recyclable packaging. [pelisplus.serieslista.com](https://pelisplus.serieslista.com/) The best part about diy room freshener is how many blends and scents you can use. Lavender is my go-to because it's safe for most ages, but you can create any scent you enjoy. Keep in mind each oil comes with safety concerns. Use the following key of popular essential oils to get started: - [Lavender](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G9SSHSW/?tag=pyc03-21): Gentle for all ages and pets, lavender is a go-to for relaxation, anxiety relief, and peaceful sleep. According to a 2019 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31780012/), lavender increases the melatonin levels responsible for happiness and sleep in adults. - [Eucalyptus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1856R7/?tag=pyc03-21): A natural insect repellent, eucalyptus stimulates you when you feel sluggish or are sick. May not be safe for pets or young children. - [Grapefruit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079JB6ZKP/?tag=pyc03-21): Grapefruit is a citrus, orange-like scent. Use it to suppress your appetite and promote weight loss, balance your mood, or lower stress. Safe around children in small amounts, but unsafe for pets. - [Lemon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QR6SS6O/?tag=pyc03-21)& [Lime](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZ5YRHK/?tag=pyc03-21): Citrus oils like lemon and lime are great for room sprays because the scent is mood lifting and fresh. They are safe for all ages, but not for all pets. - [Orange](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076PP2MTF/?tag=pyc03-21): Any type of orange essential oil is mood-lifting and reduces stress. In a room spray, orange offers long-term storage because [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30109970/)show it prevents fungi and bacteria growth. Orange oil is safe over 6-months of age, but is unsafe for all pets. - [Bergamot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y25G64Y/?tag=pyc03-21): Another type of citrus oil, bergamot offers soothing aromatherapy benefits. A 2015 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824404/)shows bergamot oil reduces anxiety and fatigue. Another 2013 [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23531112/)links it to help with depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. Safe for kids over 6-months and pets. - [Peppermint](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV15BPW/?tag=pyc03-21): The refreshing, awakening scent is great for sprucing up the bathroom or waking up your senses. It purifies the air and helps you focus. [Peppermint](/the-benefits-of-peppermint-tea-for-acne-what-you-need-to-know/)even helps headaches, the cold or flu, and sinus problems. Peppermint isn't recommended for kids under 8-years-old or pets. The Best Summer Essential Oils Room Spray Recipes Photo by [Damon Hall](https://unsplash.com/@damodigital?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/blend?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) Your room spray can take on nearly any essential oil combination that smells great to you, or you can use one of my favorite summer blends to get started. Clear Mind - 4 drops of lemon - 3 drops of grapefruit - 2 drops of rosemary - 2 drops of peppermint Focus on Work Blend - 5 drops of peppermint - 7-8 drops of rosemary Cool Down - 5 drops of lavender - 5 drops of peppermint - 3 drops of eucalyptus Good Night Sun - 5 drops of patchouli - 4 drops of lavender - 2 drops of vetiver Summer Fling - 4 drops of orange - 4 drops of lemon - 4 drops of grapefruit - 4 drops of lime Heart of Gold - 4 drops of bergamot - 4 drops of lemon - 4 drops of wild orange - 4 drops of grapefruit Mojito Chill - 5 drops of lime - 5 drops of peppermint - 3 drops of spearmint Tranquility - 3 drops of lavender - 2 drops of sweet orange - 1 drop of chamomile Stink-be-Gone - 5 drops of cinnamon - 4 drops of tea tree - 2 drops of clove Final Thoughts Photo by [Taylor Simpson](https://unsplash.com/@taylorgsimpson?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/summer-room?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) Remember, never try to make room spray without an emulsifier. Water and oil won't mix together otherwise. The result would separate and potentially cause a slew of problems if you're not careful. What is your favorite blend? Do you have multiple sprays for different rooms or purposes? I like to keep a peppermint spray in the bathroom and use lavender throughout the rest of my house, which is entirely safe for my dogs.
