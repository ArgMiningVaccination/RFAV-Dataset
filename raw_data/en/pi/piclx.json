[My name is Lisa Desrosiers and I would be honored to be your guide on your healing journey. I am a Certified Reiki Master Practitioner, a Certified Energy Medicine Practitioner through the Four Winds Society, and a Mesa Carrier in the Peruvian Q'ero Shamanic lineage. I'm also a Licensed Acupuncturist, Certified Professional Life Coach, and have spent years studying and practicing yoga & sound healing. I tap into the power and wisdom of my Shamanic, Reiki and Chinese Medicine lineages in all of my healing sessions.] My energy healing sessions support your healing journey without using acupuncture needles. Sessions may be hands-on or hands-off, in person or distant, and can include reiki, energy healing, shamanic healing, sound healing with tuning forks/acutonics, acupressure and transformational life coaching conversations. Each session is highly personalized to support you on all levels of your being - body, mind, emotions, spirit and soul. Personalized Energy Healing Sessions Each session is unique and provides you what is needed in that moment. Sessions may include a variety of healing tools or focused work with one modality, depending on what is most useful to shift the energy. With energy healing I do not specifically treat your illness, injury or disease but work on energy imbalances that might be related to your health, mood, happiness, relationships or life balance. Throughout the process I use transformational coaching to help you understand and integrate the energetic shifts into your daily life Shamanic Healing Shamanic healing works at the spiritual and energetic level to clear physical, mental, emotional or soul/spirit issues. A sacred healing space is created for you to step out of ordinary time and access new ways of understanding and healing using guided imagery or journeys. The core healing process is an illumination which clears and balances your chakras and energy field. Other healing tools include breathwork, soul retrieval, shamanic journey, cord cutting, rewriting soul contracts, mythic life mapping, destiny tracking & manifestation, and connection with power animals & spirit guides. Shamanic healing can clear deep blocks that prevent you from healing and growing and also help you to create a new map and vision for your life. The shamanic healing practices I offer are from the Peruvian Andean Q'ero Shamanic path. I am an initiated mesa carrier in this lineage since 2005 and certified through the Four Winds Society as an Energy Medicine Practitioner. This is a nature based path of personal healing & empowerment, based on living in balance & reciprocity (ayni) with yourself, others, nature and universal energies. My energy medicine techniques combine ancient shamanic wisdom traditions, modern neuroscience, psychology and trauma informed practices to meet the needs of healing in modern life. Reiki Reiki is a Japanese healing method that is based on the Asian concept of ki or life energy, which is the non-physical energy that animates all living things. Reiki is a gentle but powerful energy healing technique that can be offered hands on, hands off, in person or over distance to balance, improve and enhance your own vital life force energy. Reiki can be helpful for physical issues, to reduce pain and inflammation, release stress and anxiety, calm the nervous system and promote natural healing. Reiki can also support your personal and spiritual development. I am a Certified Usui & Holy Fire Reiki Master Practitioner and Certified Animal Reiki Practitioner through the International Center for Reiki Training. Holy Fire Reiki provides purification, healing, empowerment and guidance to help you connect with your authentic self. Acutonics Sound Healing with Tuning Forks Acutonics is a gentle healing modality using sound and vibration applied to acupoints on the body, or above the body. Sound healing promotes harmony, balance and well being. The frequencies of the tuning forks can balance the nervous system and shift patterns in the subtle energy body. Sound waves can access the meridian and chakra systems to break up physical, emotional and energetic tension. Tuning forks can also relax muscle tension, reduce pain, regulate breathing patterns, relieve stress patterns, support sound sleep, and regulate the flow of energy in the body, Acupressure Acupressure is the gentle stimulation of acupuncture points using light touch or pressure. Similar to acupuncture but without needles, acupressure can address a wide range of physical and emotional needs. When combined with energy healing, acupressure supports the release and movement of energy flow in the body.

[Each healing session is unique. A session begins by talking about the issue you want to work on, and discussing how it affects you and your life. Then you will lie down for the healing (if in person - sessions can also be done virtually via video or phone). Sessions may be very interactive at times and also very quiet. They may include breath-work, dialogue, guided visualization, somatic release and a variety of healing techniques. Some people feel a lot of sensation during a session while others may feel very little sensation except calm and peacefulness. At the end of each session, you will likely feel very relaxed and balanced. After the session we'll talk about your experience and how to move forward, and you'll receive feedback or homework to help integrate. This work is recommended for people who want to engage fully in their healing journey, and are willing to spend some time and attention on their inner world.](https://davissquareacupuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/little_eagle.jpg) How Does It Work? Energy work addresses imbalances in the energy field around the body. All life experiences affect your energy field and energy body. Early life events, traumas, belief systems, and genetic imprints can be stored in the energy body and can lead to health issues, stress, negative self-talk, limiting beliefs, challenging relationship and life patterns. Some traumas are so big that they get suppressed into the unconscious field. This dense energy affects the flow of the 'qi' or energy in the field and can lead to imbalances on the physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual levels. These imprints can also get triggered and leave you feeling as if you are stuck repeating old patterns but cannot step out of them. Energy work clears dense energy from the chakras and the energy field, and can clear imprints at the energetic level to allow you to step out of fear, limiting belief systems, or old trauma stories. Your energy body is also repaired or 'illuminated' so that you do not continue to repeat or attract similar patterns. Energy work can assist you in accessing deeper parts of yourself - the gifts, talents, and resources that have been hidden from view - to help you experience more inner peace, strength and vitality.

Energy Work Testimonials Healing My Relationship With My Father \"After a number of years and countless hours of therapy dealing with my 'daddy issues' I was ready to forge a new relationship with my dad but something was always stopping me... I could not get over an invisible hurdle. I was not able to verbalize what the block was, I knew in my head- logically- all the steps that I needed to take to make this happen, but I was not able to contact my dad. Lisa created a very welcoming environment which was safe and warm. We started with a brief history of my issues and then focused our attention on the feelings I had surrounding my dad. Lisa asked me to visualize a number of things while she worked around me. After this, I actually felt lighter in my step, less burdened. Today, I have not only made contact with my dad, but am actively building a new relationship with him. I truly believe that Lisa's energy work brought my head and my spirit to the same place- so they could work together toward my goal. Lisa removed the invisible hurdle so I could have a clear path to my dad. I have trusted Lisa to do energy work on other issues in my life with the same result, a melding of the mind and spirit. I am still uncertain about how it all works... but I can tell you that it has changed my life for the better.\" Stepping Into Motherhood \"After years of infertility treatment, I went to Lisa for energy work at the recommendation of a dear friend as I was at a crossroads of treatment and adoption. While I did not know exactly what I wanted or needed out of the session when I arrived (or even what the session entailed), it became very clear to me after the session began that I had been holding negative energy surrounding my treatment that significantly weighed on me and limited my ability to move on. The energy session was transformational for me in that it provided a vehicle for me to release my negative energy and helped to foster positive energy regarding our new journey. It allowed me to come to terms with the past and become excited about the future. The session was incredibly powerful and dynamic itself, and the energy shift following the session was profound. After releasing the negative energy, I felt completely at peace with our path and able to let go of all of the hard feelings surrounding my prior treatment. My husband could not believe the palpable change in my outlook and my positive and happy disposition. I believe that my energy work with Lisa helped to open the door to bring our daughter into our lives as we were matched with a birth mother shortly thereafter. I will be forever grateful to Lisa and will continue to work with her during any other challenging times in my life.\" Reconnecting With Myself \"Working with Lisa is both relaxing and profound. Her skill and care facilitates the healing process, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Over just a few sessions, I experienced a reconnection with aspects of myself that have helped me feel more whole, healthy and revitalized. The supportive atmosphere she creates has helped me to not just experience healing during a session, but to continue to integrate healthy new patterns into my daily life. The burden and stress of old emotional baggage are lifted and I'm living a happier, healthier life as a result.\" Profound Change \"It took several days to process what happened in the session. I felt as if I had a major break through - the kind that a few years of therapy may provide \u2014 it was that intense. I felt lighter, and resolved - as if some large burden I had been carrying for a long time had been lifted. While I can't pinpoint a specific incident or episode from my past that I felt was finally resolved, I can say I was ready to move forward in my life and into the new roles that were in store for me. I felt complete again. As weeks passed, I noticed changes in my thinking. I reacted differently to situations - things that would make me hesitate to confront or that I feared to handle suddenly became smooth interactions. I felt I had a new perspective on my self and my dealings with others. I had a new confidence and perspective. Months later this perspective and confidence remains. What I had experienced wasn't the relaxing or healing of a massage or other body therapy, I had a full-on life changing event. The healing experience with Lisa has shown me that with the right guidance, we as individuals have so much potential for healing, resolving, and evolving ourselves. What Lisa does is an almost lost healing art. As our society became more \"modern\" and externally gratifying, we forgot how to go inside ourselves. We abandoned the paths of self discovery. Fortunately, healers like Lisa are being called back to the path of the Shaman. Hopefully, with their guidance we can be shown the way back to our true selves, and as a result be able to heal ourselves, our communities and our world.\" Illuminating Deep Issues \"Lisa has a holistic view to healing and sees all aspects of a person's life as being relevant to the healing process. She is a compassionate practitioner and ensures her clients feel cared for and understood. In each of the three energy work sessions I've had, I experienced a noticeable shift in an area of my life where I felt stuck. The sessions illuminated deep issues that had been hard to articulate through other types of therapies. Guided imagery had been a common thread in all three sessions and was the key to understanding and visualizing my feelings. After each session I felt different about the issue I was struggling with and those shifts in feelings still remain with me today. I will continue to have energy work done whenever I feel stuck, as it has proven to be the most immediate and effective method I've found.\" Please reach out for more information or to schedule your healing session!
