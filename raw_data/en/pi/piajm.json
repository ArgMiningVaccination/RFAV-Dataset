I will guide you through different energy healing techniques such as Reiki, chakra healing, crystals, Eden energy medicine, qigong, and yoga. Accept everything with an open and positive mind because we all know that the mind is a powerful thing. It's undeniable that even with all the scientific achievements the human race has achieved, we still can't fully understand how the mind works. I have been studying the power of healing crystals and gems for over 10 years now. In my research and trial and error, I also explored other energy balancing techniques. Each of these practices has it's boundaries and limitations to where I found that employing a mix of techniques worked best for me. I now write guest blog posts and conduct energy healing sessions from my home for friends, family, and a select few paying clients. In my audiobook, Energy Healing at Home, I will teach you everything I know about different energy medicine practices.

My deepest wish is for you to be healed mentally, physically, spiritually, or whatever way you perceive is necessary. I hope you find something that works for you and your situation, whatever that may be. You will be amazed at how instantly energy healing can help you!
