Researchers in Denmark announced the successful completion of an \"innovative\" trial assessing effects of influenza vaccine dosages on hospitalizations using only routinely collected data. The results of the open-label, randomized DANFLU-1 trial were presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress. \"It's estimated that 1 billion people worldwide are infected by influenza yearly,\" Tor Biering-S\u00f8rensen, MD, PhD, MPH, professor of translational cardiology and pragmatic randomized studies in the department of biomedical sciences at Copenhagen University, Denmark, said during a press conference. \"Influenza infection can cause cardiovascular events, and we know that the risk of cardiovascular events increases in the days after a positive influenza test. Furthermore, these increased risks can be decreased by influenza vaccination.\" In 2022, the vaccine program in Denmark is only offering the standard-dose vaccine, according to the presentation. Biering-S\u00f8rensen added that several types of influenza vaccine exist, such as higher doses, and that these high-dose vaccines, although proved to significantly reduce risk for infection, may not be as widely implemented due to a lack of trial data evaluating them for reducing risk for death and hospitalization. Therefore, researchers conducted the DANFLU-1 trial, and invited 34,000 individuals to participate. The trial was integrated into the Danish national vaccine program, only requiring one study visit for vaccination. Follow-up was completed using national health care registries through May 2022. A total of 12,477 participants were enrolled to receive standard or high-dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome of the DANFLU-1 trial was trial feasibility, in terms of whether it was possible to conduct a trial integrating the Danish vaccination program and complete follow-up only using registry data. To this, Biering-S\u00f8rensen confirmed that the DANFLU-1 trial was successfully designed and executed, with 99.97% complete follow-up data. The hypotheses-generating outcome of interest was incidence of influenza or pneumonia hospitalization, hospitalization for cardiorespiratory disease and all-cause mortality among individuals who received the high-dose influenza vaccine compared with standard dose. Biering-S\u00f8rensen said the trial was not powered to definitively assess the effect of vaccine dose on these outcomes. After a representative volume element analysis, researchers observed 64.4% lower cumulative incidence of influenza or pneumonia hospitalization (95% CI, 24.4-84.6), no difference in hospitalization for cardiorespiratory disease (12.1%; 95% CI, -15.5 to 33.3) and a 48.9% lower incidence of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 11.5-71.3) among those who received the high-dose vaccine compared with standard-dose vaccine. \"The DANFLU-1 trial was an innovative trial of influenza vaccines integrated into routine clinical practice where we randomized almost 12,500 participants. It relied only on routinely collected health care data,\" Biering-S\u00f8rensen said during the press conference. \"It provided us with a hint of benefit in morbidity and mortality with the high-dose [influenza] vaccine compared with the standard dose. A future large-scale trial could show whether high-dose influenza vaccines should be offered routinely and might reduce "}
