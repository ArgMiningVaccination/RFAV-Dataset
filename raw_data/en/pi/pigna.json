Integrative Oncology is an evolving evidence based specialty that uses complementary therapies in concert with medical treatment to enhance its efficacy, improve symptom control, alleviate patient distress and reduce suffering. (Source: Dr. Matt Mumber , Harbin Clinic) According to the Society for Integrative Oncology: Integrative Medicine is a seamless use of interventions that benefit cancer patients. Integrative Oncology is Whole Person -Centered Care offered across the cancer continuum. Integrative Oncology Emphasizes: Patient participation in maximizing health Shared decision making -relationship centered approach Therapeutic Power of doctor patient relationship itself An individual 's innate healing capacity Quality of life Why Integrative Oncology? Numbers of people diagnosed with cancer is increasing Source: ACS Cancer Facts and Figures, 2014 Treatments are costly 1/3 of the most common cancers are preventable through healthy diet, physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight Source: http://www.aicr.org/research/research_science_policy_report.html More cancer survivors/emphasis on long term quality of life Patients often don't tell MD of CAM use What is \"CAM\"? \"The term complementary medicine refers to a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered to be part of conventional medicine.

Mao, Lorenzo Cohen JNatlCancerInstMonograph 2014Status of Evidence for CAM and Cancer: Symptom management . A substantial amount of scientific evidence suggests that some complementary health approaches may help to manage some symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatment. For other complementary approaches, the evidence is more limited. Disease treatment . At present, there is no convincing evidence that any complementary health approach alone is effective in curing cancer or causing it to go into remission . Cancer prevention . A 2012 study indicated that taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement may slightly reduce the risk of cancer in older men. No other complementary health approach has been shown to be helpful in preventing cancer .

A demonstrably favorable risk/benefit profile is essential for the use of complementary therapies, as it is for any form of medicine. The advantages of a rigid, evidence -based approach based on reductionism, however, do not translate easily into the holistic approach required for complex health issues. A rational, balanced, patient -centered approach using all available data is strongly recommended to address patients' concerns.\" Source: Deng GE, et al Integrative Integr Oncol. 2007 Spring;5(2):65 -84.Society for Integrative Oncology: Practice Guidelines ONS Position on CAM Key Points of ONS Position Look at your beliefs about use of CAM and an integrative approach \u2014how does this affect patient care Assess patient's interest in an integrative approach: provide evidence - based info and resources, and guidance on choosing qualified practitioners Be aware of and consistently use the terminology applied to CAM and integrative care. Educate yourself about Integrative Cancer Care at least to the extent appropriate for your scope of practice Be aware of therapies that can potentially interfere with outcomes of conventional ca treatment Document your patients' use of and responses to Integrative Cancer Care Seek proper training and credentials if you will practice any integrative therapies.

Integrative Oncology Navigation is a patient -centered, whole person healthcare service delivery model. Integrative Navigators reduce barriers to cancer care and provide education, guidance, and support to patients and their caregivers across the cancer continuum. Additionally, Integrative Navigators provide education and support in the responsible selection and use of appropriate, evidence -based complementary therapies alongside conventional medical treatment. -IION DefinitionPutting Our Model Into Practice Hospital Setting Community Setting Hospital Navigation Program 15 % Improvement in Treatment Compliance Rates (Howard University Cancer Center internal Hospital QI Review) Hospital Adopted Program as Permanent Service Independent Evaluation of Hospital Navigation 37 patients surveyed by CUP 73% reported using navigation services 86% rated navigator \"very effective \" Program highly regarded by clinical staff Findings showed that Integrative Care... -Is most likely to be used post -treatment -Resource use impacted by hospital climate Source: Chatman, M. and Green, R. \"Addressing the Unique Psychosocial Barriers to Breast Cancer Treatment Experienced by African -American Women through Integrative Navigation\".
