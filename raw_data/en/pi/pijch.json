Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution FEDERA L CRIM INAL LAW During FY 2004, the Division rem ained ardent and vigilant in enforcing federal crim inal civil rights protections. Our determ ined efforts pr oduced extraordinary results. We filed 96 new criminal civil rights prosecutions in conjuncti on with US Attorney's Office in FY 2004 -- m ore than in any year in the Divisi on's history. Our efforts span th e full breadth of the Division's jurisdiction. In color of law m atters, we filed 46 cases - just 3 fewer than the all-tim e high. With respect to hum an trafficking offenses, the D ivision, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, filed 29 cases in FY 2004 charging 59 defenda nts. This effort co mpares dram atically with the 5 defendants charged in 3 cases during FY 2000. In addition, we prosecuted 20 instan ces of bias crim e, including 9 instances of cross burning, and several cases challenging post-9/11 backlash bias crim es. Color of Law Prosecutions All of us appreciate and resp ect the d ifficult ta sk perf ormed daily with professionalism by law enforcem ent officers around the county to keep us free from harm. It is m y firm conviction that the vas t majority of police of ficers and other state agents are comm itted to prov iding the best, constitutional service possible. In light of the inherent dange rs in their job, particularly in light of their new role on the front line in the war on terro r, they well des erve our deep gratitude. At the sam e time, it is of the utm ost importan ce that officers obey the very laws that they enforce. The public m ust have the trust that no one, includ ing a law enforcem ent offi cer, is above the law. Thus, failing to ho ld officers to account for th eir condu ct, and allowin g that trus t to be underm ined, woul d make the job substantially m ore difficult. As I noted, this past year we have ha d substantial success prosecuting color-of-law violations. While these cases are am ong the m ost difficult crim inal prosecutions, our conviction rate in law enforcem ent cases increased from 69% in 2003 to 77 % in fiscal year FY 2004. I want to h ighlight thre e exam ples f or the Comm ittee: In U.S. v. Carson, six police officers ganged-up to attack th e victim of a traffic dispute with an off-duty police officer. They pulled over th e victim as he was driving hom e from work, pulled him from his car, and beat him severely. They then wrote false police reports to cover up their assau lt; indeed, som e of the officers fabricat ed evidence to trum p up false crim inal charges against the victim . One officer pl eaded guilty; four of the rem aining five officers were convicted at tria l. In United States v. Hampton, a police officer with the Carlis le, Arkansas Police Departm ent used his law enforcem ent authority to coerce young m en in his custody to perform homosexual acts. On nu merous occasions, the d efendant arrested ind ividuals for m inor infraction s and threa tened them with in carce ration if they ref used his sexua l dem ands. We secured guilty p leas to two felony civil rights counts and obtained a sentence of 212 m onths in prison. In United States v. Simmons, the defendant used his status as a police officer to sexually assault a helpless teenage victim . After pulling over the victim and her boyfriend for a traffic 3 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution offense, the defendant placed the v ictim in his patrol car and o ffered to drive her hom e. Instead he took her to a secluded area wh ere he repeatedly raped her. Our involvem ent and investigation followed an unsuccessful state prosecution. Just ea rlier this m onth, a fede ral jury convicted the defendant, specifically finding that he had committ ed aggravated sexual abuse and caused bodily injury to the victim . While the tr aditional m odel of color -of-law enf orcem ent relates to law enf orcem ent off icers and prison guards, it m erits m ention that our authority applies to a nyone acting under color of law. This can include other state agents such as orderlies in nursing hom es and m ental facilities, others involved in the crim inal justice process, and any othe r state em ployee or agent who willfully deprives an in dividual of his federally protected rig hts on accou nt of color, relig ion, sex, handic ap, familial s tatus or na tional or igin. For exam ple, in United States v. Anderson , we co nvicted an in ternationally renowned cadaver dog handler for repeatedly planting false evidence at law enforcem ent search scenes. Our investigation, which included local, state and federal law enfo rcement agencies from Florida to California and from Wisconsin to Louisiana, revealed that the defendant had planted hum an bones, a flesh-covered toe, and her own blood at various crim e scenes she had been asked to search. The FBI laboratory was in strum ental in developing inculp atory forensic evidence. The defendant pleaded guilty to federal charges of fa lsifying facts and obstruction of justice, and was sentenced to 21 m onths incarceration. As you know, the Division has jurisdiction to in vestigate the conditions of confine ment at state ins titutions inc luding nursing h omes, juvenile f acilities, and m ental health institutions. Our investigations of such facilities frequently turn up shocki ng accounts of abuse, including conduct that is rightly considered crim inal. For exam ple, in United States v. Brew er and Bratcher , two developm ental technicians pleaded g uilty to conspiring to ph ysically abu se a profoundly mentally impaired individual who lived at th e facility. The ab use culm inated when the victim was whipped with an electrical cord nearly 30 times, leaving num erous welts and abrasions on his back, side and buttocks. Exam ples such as this, which in volve the d eliberate inf liction of cruelty upon those least able to defend them selves , rightly shock the conscience. Although in the past the Crim inal Section has considered referrals from the Special Litigation Section, I believe that we can do even better. As such, I im plemented a referral procedure last year to en sure that instan ces of potential c riminal institu tiona l abuse are giv en a by the Crim Bias Motiv s Our bias-m otivated crimes prosecutions con cern som e of the most disturbing, and to be blunt, disgusting cases. For exam ple, in United S tates v. Derifie ld, we convicted two avowed white suprem acists of a racially m otivated attack on four teenagers, includ ing a 14-year old girl, who was held at knifepoint by one of the defendants. In United States v. Garner, et al., six defendants were sentenced to im prisonm ent for 12 to 46 m onths for conspiring to burn a five- foot tall cross in the driveway of a hom e occupied by a wh ite wom an in Georgia whose daughter was dating an African-Am erican m an. And in Ap ril of last year we secured civil rights convictions against five white suprem acists in United States v. Heldenband . The defendants, 4 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution angered that the vic tim was with a white wom an, stabbed a black m an in a Springfield, Missouri restau rant. Equally disturbing are arsons di rected against houses of wors hip. Last year, a Mem ber of this Subcom mittee asked us to consid er this area with particu lar ca re - an d we have embraced the challenge. We strengthen ed our relationship with the Bu reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm s, which investigates these crim es. We have m et, and continue to m eet, on several occasions w ith th e Bureau to ensure that neither they, nor we, have reason to believe that a new trend has developed. During 2004 we prosecuted 3 church burning cases, and thus far during F Y 2005 we have filed 5 such prosecutions. Howeve r, we have found no national pattern or trend that sugg ests an increase in the rate o f this terrib le offense. Of particular im portance are our successes in addressing incidents of violence and threats against Arabs, South Asians and Muslim s, so called \"back lash\" crim es following from the Septem ber 11th terrorist attacks. Since 2001, th e Departm ent has investigated m ore than 630 \"backlash\" incidents, which have resulted in near ly 150 state and local prosecutions (m any with federal as sistance), and the federal p rosecution of 27 defendants in 22 cases. For example, this year, we pursued two separate bias -motivated crim es at the Is lamic Center of El Paso, Texas. In United States v. Bjarnason , the Defendant was convicted of e-m ailing a threat to burn down the mosque if Am erican hos tages he ld in Iraq were n ot released within 72 hours. Using a provision of the USA PATRIOT Act, federal agents were able to identify Bjarnason as the sender before the 7 2-hour peri od had expired. Bjarnaso n pleaded gu ilty to federal charges and was sentenced to 18 m onths imprisonm ent. In the recent case of United States v. Nunez-Flores , we charged the Defendant with th rowing a \"Molotov Cocktail\" at the same Islam ic Center of El Paso Mosque. Another example is the case of United States v. Middleman . There, the defendant pleaded guilty to sen ding a th reatening in terstate e- mail to Dr. Jam es Zogby, Presid ent of the Arab- American In stitute. The defendant is curren tly awaiting senten cing. As sh ould be obvious, we take these cases very seriously. In fact, this is the second case of a threat against Dr. Z ogby. In 2002, in United Sta tes v. Rolnik , the defendant pleaded guilty to leaving a threatening telephone message on Dr. Zogby's voice-m ail. Similarly, in United States v. Ehrgott , we prosecuted a defendant who pleaded g uilty to send ing a th reatening inters tate e-m ail communicatio n to the Washington, D.C. office of the Council on Am erican-Islam ic Relations. Arab, Muslim and Sikh Am ericans are just that - they are Americans. Some died saving lives in the W orld Trade Center. Salm an Ha mdani, for exam ple, was am ong t he heros of Septem ber 11th. He was a New York City police cadet and ambulance driver. His rem ains were found near the North T ower of the World Trad e Center with his m edical bag beside him . He died doing everything he could to rescue victim s of that at tack. We must remember, as Presiden t Bush has said, that \"those who feel like they can intim idate our fellow citi zens to take out their anger don' t represent the best of Am erica, they represent the worst of hum ankind, and they should be asham ed of t hat kind of behavior.\" Trafficking in Persons 5 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution We have been equally successful continuing our efforts to fight hum an trafficking. I reported to the Comm ittee last y ear on th e Division's outstanding efforts on th is front. This year has seen no let-up. As of March 1, 2005, the Division had open 203 trafficking investigations, a substantial increase over the 66 open in January 2001. Of these, 130 were opened during fiscal year 2004, and an additional 52 were opened during fiscal y ear 2005. The Division, in conjunction with the United States Attorneys ' Offices, charged a reco rd 59 defendants in 29 cases with trafficking offenses during fiscal year 2004, as com pared to 5 defendants in 3 cases in fiscal year 2000. One of our most recen t cases is United States v. Garcia, where a farm labor contractor and several m embers of her fam ily were charged with conspiring to recruit young undocum ented Mexicans from the Arizona border a nd transporting them to New York with false prom ises of good wages. They transported th eir victim s to Albion, New York, where they were f orced to work in the fields for little or no pay. On Dece mber 2, 2004, defendant Maria Garcia pleaded guilty to f orced labo r charges; h er son, Elias Botello, p leaded guilty to co nspiring to c ommit forced labor; and her husband and a second son en tered guilty pleas to harboring aliens. The m ajority of our trafficking cases, however, involve som e form of sexual abuse. For exam ple, in United States v. Carreto , seven defen dants are currently facing charges in a sex trafficking conspiracy. The de fendants allegedly organized and operated a trafficking ring that smuggled nine Mexican wom en into the United S tates illegally and forced them into prostitution in Queens and Brooklyn, New York. One de fendant has already pleaded guilty. Last year, in United States v. Rojas we obtained trafficking convict ions in Atlanta, G eorgia agains t the Rojas broth ers. These traffickers smuggled wom en from Mexico into the United States and th en forced th em into comm ercial sexu al activity. In United States v. Arlan and Linda Kaufman , we charged a husband and wife in the State of Kansas who, under the guise of operating a reside ntial treatment center for m entally impaired adults, held the residents in servitude, forcing th em to engage in nudity and sexually explicit acts for the defendants' entertainm ent and profit. Trial in that case is pending. A judge powerfully captured the truly horrific nature of sex tr afficking during a defendant's sentencing hearing in one of our cases. Shaking his head in disgust at the defendant, the judge stated: \"he' s the worst th at I've ever s een in th is court. It was worse than bad. It was almost like raping children. This gentlem an took advantag e ... knew they were vulnerable, knew they couldn' t cry out. Publicly hum iliatin g them . Stripping them in public and throwing th em in a canal. \" The fight against hum an trafficking is supporte d at the highest levels of the Adm inistration. This past July the Departm ent hosted the first national conference on hum an trafficking. Both Presiden t Bush and the Attorney Ge neral attended and addressed the pa rticipan ts. 6 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution At the conference, President Bush stated, \"Hum an trafficking is one of th e worst offenses against human dignity. Our nation is determ ined to fight that crim e abroad and at hom e.\" The Presiden t provided enco uragem ent to the conference attendees: You' ve got a tough job, but it' s a necessary job. Y ou're hunting down the traffickers, you' re serv ing justice by putting them behind bars, you' re liberating captives, a nd you' re helping them recover from years of abuse and traum a. The lives of tens of thousands of innocent wom en and children depend on your compassion, they depend upon your determ ination, and they depend upon your daily efforts to rescue them from m isery and servitude. You are in a fight agains t evil, and th e Am erican people are grateful for your dedication and service. The Division is proud of its success prosecu ting hum an trafficking cas es, but we recognize that this is only a start. Much of our focu s in the area of human trafficking since the July 2004 conference has been shifting from the reactive p rosecution of hum an traffi ckers to pro activ ely attacking the problem and seeking out hum an tra fficking where it hides. Success in doing so stands on the twin pillars of (1) successful state-f ederal taskf orce partnerships, and (2) a victim - centered app roach to enforcem ent. As to the first, during 2004 the Division helped to establish 19 hum an traffi cking task forces in major urban areas around the country incl uding Phoenix, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Tampa, Newark, Houston, Northern Virg inia, New York, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Miam i, Orlando, the State of Connecticut, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, San Francisco, District of Colum bia, San Antonio, and El Paso . Additional task forces will b e created this year in Nassau County, New York and elsewhere. These task forces br ing together Federal, state, local, and non- governm ental actors to com bat tr afficking and provide com prehensive assistance to victim s. In many instances, the inve stiga tive tea m in these c ases is led b y local law e nforcem ent. Local law enforcem ent, m ore than we, knows where vict ims of these unconscionable crim es are being hidden. Local law enforcem ent, in turn, works closely with prosecutors from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney's Office. In addi tion, non-governm ental organizations, w hich are often grantees of the Departm ent of Health a nd Hum an Services and the Justice Departm ent's Office for Victim s of Crim e, are i mmediately con tacted in ord er to ensu re that v ictims rece ive prom pt restorative care. Additionally, public service a nnouncem ents have been issued in Spanish, Russian, Polish, Chinese, an d Korean to inform victim s of thei r rights. We are extrem ely grateful to o ur colleagues in this fight at all levels. In addi tion, the Division has also conducted a series of training program s for local law enforcem ent ag encies and non-governm ental organizations in Tampa, Orlando, El Paso, Houston, Connecticut , Las Vegas, Albuquerque, St. Louis and San Francisco. All the trainings were extrem ely we ll received. We are also in the process of developing a m odel curriculum for the victim -centered approach to id entifying and rescuing trafficking victim s and investigating and pr osecu ting th eir traffick ers and abusers. 7 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution States are increasingly recogni zing that trafficking is not ju st a federal problem . Texas, Washington, Minnesota, Missouri, and Florida already have state trafficking laws. The Division has worked with states to find ways to a ddress hum an trafficking, including publishing for consideratio n a m odel state an ti-trafficking s tatute. Our prosecutors at the D epartm ent of Justice have an im pressive r ecord of convictions on trafficking charges. Convictions, however, can not alone h eal the pain s and em otional scars inflicted on these victim s. How does a girl that has been repeatedly forced to engage in commercial sex acts - repeated ly rap ed - fully re cover? As we have m ade clear time and tim e and again, these victim s need our help. They ne ed our protection. True rescue m eans providing victim s with the assistan ce they need to rebu ild and recap ture their liv es. For this reason, the Justice Departm ent requires that each of our prosecutors and inve stigators use a victim -centered approach. The needs o f the victim must take high prior ity. We work - and will con tinue to wor k - with servic e prov iders to ensu re tha t the v ictims of trafficking are kept safe. Immediately after we uncover a trafficking crim e, Departm ent of Justice victim -witness coord inators help place the victim s in a shelter. We work with th e Bureau of Citizenship and Imm igration Services to obtain Continued P resence and \"T-Visas\" f or these v ictims. A \"T- Visa\" perm its victim s of severe forms of trafficking to live and work legally in the United States for three years while their cases are investigated and prosecuted. We likewise work with the Departm ent of Health and Hum an Services to help victim s obtain additional services for these vi ctims - m edical care, screening for STDs, a nd em ergency food and shelter. We help place the victim s with NGOs , funded in part by the federal governm ent. Our charge, given to us by the Presiden t, is to he lp these vic tims begin to reb uild th eir liv es and tha t is exactly w hat we shall continue to do. In shor t, it is the stated policy of the Departm ent of Justice that individuals who have been subjected to a severe form of trafficking truly are victims in every s ense of the word. I am proud to say that the Civil Rights Divi sion's record of victim protection has been unflagging and robust. Since 2001, the Civ il Rights Division has helped over 680 trafficking victim s from 46 countries obtain ref ugee-type be nefits under the Traffick ing Victims Protection Act. In that sam e time period, the Division has helped over 500 victim s extend their stay in the U.S. to assist law enforcem ent, through con tinued presence or a T-Visa certification. Despite our successes, we know that we have much m ore wor k to do. The fight against human trafficking rem ains am ong the Departm ent's chief priorities. PROTEC TING VOTING RIGH TS Of particular im portance during 2004 was the Di vision's responsibility to enforce certain federal voting rights statutes. Let me be absolu tely clear : no civil righ t is m ore im portan t to President Bush, to Attorney General Gonzales, or to me, than the f ull and f air enjoym ent of the right to vote. The ballot is the essential building block of our dem ocracy, and it m ust be protected. 8 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution It merits noting at the outset th at ours is a Federal system of Governm ent. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitu tion p rovides th at \"[t]he Ti mes, Places and Manner of holding Ele ctions for Senators an d Representatives shall be prescrib ed in each State by th e Legislature th ereof.\" However, recognizing the national importance of such elections, it continues, \"but the Congress may at any tim e by Law m ake or alter such Regula tions . . . . \" Thus, except for where Congress has expressly decided otherwise, prim ary respons ibility for the m ethod and m anner of elections, and for defining and protecting the elective fr anchise lies with the several states. Congress has, in a num ber of distinct areas, de termined that a federal schem e should overlay the states' election responsibili ties. The first of these cam e in 1965 when Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act. This statute, which follo wed the startling and tr ansform ing events of \"Bloody Sunday\" - the beating of p eaceful m archers on th e Edm und Pettus bridg e in Selm a, Alabam a - perhaps m ore than any other m odern-d ay law has changed Amer ica for the bette r. Subsequently, Congress has enac ted several additional federal voting laws, including the 1970, 1975 and 1982 am endments to the V oting Rights Ac t, the Uniform ed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act of 1986, the National Voter Re gistration Act of 1993 (\"Motor Voter\" or \"NVRA\"), a nd the Help Am erica Vote Act of 2002 (\"HAVA\"). The Civil Rights Division enforces the civil provisions of these laws, while the Public Inte grity Section of the crim inal m isconduct and anti-fraud prohibitions of these laws. Nothing so acutely focuses attention on voting ri ghts as a national election. Such an election requires early and substantial planning on the part of the Division to ensure that it properly carries ou t its m andate to enforce th e several s tatutes entrusted to it. Accordingly, starting in April 2004, I m et with my voting rights leadersh ip team to establish broad goals for the Division's effort. The Division's subsequent efforts, set in m otion at that time, fall generally in to three categories: monitoring, tran sparency, and legal accountability. Election Monitoring U nder the Voting Rights Act Robust m onitoring of elections is among the mo st effective m eans of ensuring that voting rights are respected. Monitoring ha s two prim ary and salutary eff ects. First, th e pres ence of federal m onitors serves as a deterrent to wr ongdoing in a jurisdiction; second, m onitors serve a reporting function, bringing to the Division's attention inform ation that perm its us to determ ine whether further legal action is necessary, and providing the facts necessary to take it. Accordingly, this past year the Civil Right s Division m ounted the m ost extensive election- monitoring program in its history. The Division generally em ploys two type s of individual to watch an election. First, the Voting Rights Act provides for the appointm ent of federal voting observers by order of a federal court pursuant to Section 3(a), or, with regard to political subdivisions covered under Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, upon the certification by the Attorney General, 9 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution pursuant to Section 61. In addition, Section 8 of the Voting Rights Act provides for the appointm ent of federal observers within political subdivisions certified by the Attorney General or by order of a federal court pursuant to Section 3 of the Voting Rights A ct. Second, in addition to th e statutorily approve d monitoring, it has becom e common practice for the Departm ent of Justice to send Departm ent personnel to m onitor elec tions in other political subdivisions where concerns about elections have been expressed. Early in 2004 we identified electi on monitoring as a chief priorit y. At that point, we notified the Office of Personnel Managem ent that we woul d request a num ber of monitors greatly in excess of prior election years' totals. Given the anticipated scope of the 2004 m onito r and observer program , identifying sufficient personnel to deploy was a challenge. Trad itionally, the Civil Rights Division has deployed Voting Section staff along with a lim ited num ber of federal prosecutors ex perienced in election monitoring. This year, the determ ination was m ade not to employ federal prosecutors as election monitors actually at polling places. Rather, we recruited non -prosecu tor atto rneys an d staff widely throughout the Division. All m onitors rece ived su ivil righ ts laws, including, for the first tim e ever, those laws designed to protect the rights of voters wi th disabilities. The Division likewise worked with OPM to ensure quality training of OPM election observers. Election m onitoring in 2004 began with th e early prim ary elections and proceeded throughout the year. Prior to the gene ral election, the Departm ent sent 802 monitors and observers to 75 elections in 20 states, as com pared with 340 monitors and observers deployed to 21 elections in 11 states pre-election during 2000. On Election Day itself, we de ployed an additional 1,073 m onitors and observers to watch elections in 87 elections in 25 states, as com pared with 363 monitors and observers in 20 elections in 10 states on election day in 2000. In short, by way of comparison, during all of calendar year 2000, the Division sent 743 monitors and observers to 46 elections in 13 st ates. During all of cal endar year 2004, including elections that were held afte r November 2, we deployed a tota l of 1,996 federal personnel to observe 163 elections in 29 st ates, our m ost extensive m onitoring effort ever. 1 A total of 148 counties and parishes in 9 states have been ce rtified by th e Attorney Ge neral pursuant to Section 6: Alabam a (22 counties), Arizona (3), Georgia (29), Louisiana (12), Mississippi (50), New York (3), North Carolina (1), South Carolina (11) a nd Texas (17). A total of 11 political subdiv isions in 11 st ates are curren tly ce rtified by federal cour t order: California (3), Illinois (1), Indian a (1), Louisian a (1), M ichigan (1), Ne w Jersey (1 ), New Mexico (3), New York (2), Pennsylvania (1), South Dakota (1), and W ashington (1). 10 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R.

Accordingly, we m ade it a point to be subs tantially m ore public in our election protection work than the Division has been in prior election years. One area in which this w as particu larly signif icant was the m anner in tion monitors are allocated. Traditionally, the Divi sion has assigned m onitors based on internal non- public criteria. This past year was different. In April, I d irected th e Voting Section to prepare a written explanation of the m ethod by which we have assigned m onito rs to jurisdictions, identifying clearly the criteria upon whic h monitoring decisions would be m ade. On May 4, 2004, Division leadership m et with representatives of m any civil rights and voting-related organizations. During that m eetin g, I presen ted in deta il the Division's plans for preparing for the general election. This include d a lengthy explanation of the process by which we would select jurisdictions to be m onitored. Moreover, we distributed guidance on how to request m onitoring for a jurisd iction, along with the inform ation necessary to substan tiate such requests. In addition to m eeting with the Division, leading civil rights groups' leaders were also invited to make a presentation at the Attorney General's Ba llot Access and Voting Integrity Symposium in July 2004. This Sym posium was designed to train Department of Justice personnel on the work both of the Civil Ri ghts Division and the Crim inal Division. Ultim ately, with regard to elec tion monitoring, th e Voting Section identified 14 ju risdictions in nine states that were operating under federa l court orders or decree s, all of which we re monitored. Moreover, the Voting Section identifie d 58 additional jurisdicti ons as appropriate for monitoring, often through our vigorous affir mative outreach to m inority advocates, and all were monitored. In addition, we receiv ed written requ ests from civil rights an d election organizations that we send personnel to an additional 15 juri sdictions. Most of th e referred jurisdictions satisfied the protocol and were assigned m onitors or observers. Law Enforcement & Lo cal Account ability As I noted, it is not sufficient only that elect ions be m onitored; federal laws also m ust be enforced. Therefore, the final prong to the Di vision's election protec tion efforts was a robust litigation an d enforcem ent effort. Ballot Access: Voting R ights Act Section 203, the National Voter Registration Act and Uniformed & Overseas Voters. First, du ring 2004, the Division enjo yed trem endous success enforcing th ose statutes that relate principally to access to the vo ter reg istratio n and ballo ting processes . During 2004, we established record levels of protection for m inority language voters under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 203 provides that all \"e lection m aterials and inform ation\" available in English must also be available in the applicable m inority language for 12 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution those who need it. This includes ballots, instruct ions and other m aterials. Often, jurisdictions even provide bilingual pollworkers to assist voters. The statute is designed to ensure that citizens not only have the opportunity to vote, but also to ensure that they cast an infor med and knowing vote. In 2004, the Civil Rights Division has filed and su ccessfully resolved as m any Section 203 cases as it h ad filed in th e previous 8 years com bined. These cases have had substantial im pact. In Harris County (Houston) TX, for exam ple, the Division entered into a Mem orandum of Understanding with the county to ad dress th e language needs of citizen s of Vietnam ese background. Com plaints were also filed in Sa n Diego to address language needs of Latino and Filip ino voters; and in S uffolk County, NY; Yakim a County, W A; and Ventura Coun ty, CA to address language needs of Latino voters. Other cases involved minority language voters in Passaic County, New Jersey, and Cibola, So ccoro and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico. Together, the Division's work la st year affected more m inority language voters than all previous Section 203 cases com bined. Under the National Voter Registration Act, better known as \"Motor Voter,\" the Division filed lawsuits against Pulaski County, Arkansas and against the State of New York; resolved two investigations; and opened three new NVRA investigations. The Arkansas suit challenged the C ounty's im proper voter registration and election rolls maintenance for federal elections. The re sulting consent decree required the county to implement far reaching policy and process chan ges, including restor ing improperly rem oved voters ; removing the nam es of deceased, departed, or inelig ible voters; and providin g electronic \"polling place lookup\" s. The New York suit invo lves in adequ ate prov ision of voter regist ration opportunities at offices located at s tate in stitutions of higher edu cation s erving disabled students. This case is still ongoing. With so m any servicem en and servicewom en oversees, th e Division's work under the Unifor med and Citizen Overseas Absentee Voting Act (UOC AVA) was s imilarly critical in 2004. During the prim ary elections, the Division f iled suit against the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania for failing to give overseas voters a m eaningful opport unity to participate in the election by m ailing absentee ballots too late. The Division obta ined settle ment agreem ents securing the rights of such voters under UOCAVA. Election Official Accountability - The Help America Vote Act Also, the Division was active in enforci ng the Help Am erica Vote Act of 2002. During 2004, we filed the Division 's first lawsuits to enfor ce HAVA, against San Benito County, CA and W estchester County, NY. Both suits were over the counties' lack of com pliance with HAVA because poll officials failed to pos t the required voter information. San Benito County also failed to have a system for provision al voters to f ind out whether their ballots were accepted an d counted. Consent agreem ents have been reached in both cases. 13 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution The Departm ent also participated in several la wsuits that concerned, in part, the scope of HAVA. Among its m any provisions, HAVA requires that st ate and local election officials perm it any individu al, whose nam e does not ap pear on th e official reg istration list f or a polling place o r whose elig ibility is o therwise questio ned, to cas t a provisional ballot if the individual declares that he \"is a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which [he] desires to vote....\" Congress, however, did not define the word \"jurisdiction\" for purposes of HAVA. Some states defined jurisdiction to m ean a voting preci nct, thus requiring a voter to go to his precinct to cast a provision al ballo t to be counted. This pres erves these s tates' trad itional precinct-based voting system . These states all directed election officials to help voters find the precinct in w hich they were supposed to vote, so they could cast their provisional ballot. Other states, however, opted to depart from the traditional precinct based sy stem, defining jurisdiction to m ean counties, or even larger geographic subdivisions. As a result, persons in thes e states could cast a provisional ballot that would be counted in any polling place within that larger ge ographic subdivision, and did not have to go to their voting precinct. Plaintif fs challeng ed sev eral states' d etermination s precinct-based voting ju risdiction sys tem. At the request of Attorney General of the S tate of Mich igan, we pro vided views on this m atter to the court. The United States does not view HAV A as prohibiting precinct- based voting. Because Congress did not define the term jurisdiction, but ra ther left its definition to each state, state law could requ ire a voter to be regis tered in a par ticular po lling place \"jurisd iction\" as a requirem ent of voter eligibility. This matter, it should be noted, was only one of num erous legal issues raised in those cases; we appropriately tailored the brief to address only this narrow federal issue regarding HAVA. The final court of review in each case to consider this issue agreed with the Departm ent's view,2 although the Sixth Circuit disagreed on the issue of who m ay file a lawsuit on this issue in the first p lace.3 3 HAVA, expressly d elegates to the A ttorn ey General authority to en force the statute in federal court. Separately, HAVA requires States to create state-level adm inistrative processes for entertain ing priv ate HAVA comp laints. The degree to which st atutes that do not provide a private right of action within their ow n four co rners m ay be enforced through Section 1983 has narrowed in recen t years. Most recen tly, in Gonzaga v. Doe (2002), the C ourt held that before a statute m ay be enforced by a private individual through Sect ion 1983, Congress m ust have (i) unam biguously m anifested its intent to create an indivi dual right, and (ii) not intended for that right to be enforced exclusively through one or more specific m eans other than Section 1983. Moreover, where Congress has entrusted a statut e to the Departm ent's exclusive charge, the Departm ent will defend vigorously Congress' enforcem ent schem e. The United States argued that these congressi onally created, dis tinct, and separate enforcem ent schem es strongly suggest that Congress did not intend for private individuals to bring HAVA-derived actions in federal court pursuant to Se ction 1983. Rather, these provisions strongly suggest that Congress intended to avoid prolonged el ection litigation, and intended rather to promote a uniform national standard enforced in cou rt by th e Attorney General alon e. 14 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution Matters actually resolved thr ough litigation are but the tip of the Division's voting rights efforts. Rather, the Division's Voting Secti on has a strong technical assistance program, which activ ely pro motes com pliance with federal voting laws, and resolves m any m atters well before they reach the judicial action s tage. Under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, for exam ple, we have devoted substantial resources to pre-election outreach, compliance an d technical assistan t. After the resu lts of the 2000 census were annou nced in 200 2, we wrote to each jurisdiction covered by Section 203 to apprais e it of its oblig ations. Moreo ver, we pers onally con tacted by pho ne each of the newly covered jurisdictions. This m assive outreach effort prom oted substantial awareness of a previously unknown obligation. As part of the continuing initiative to encourage v oluntary compliance by covered jurisdictions, I m ailed letters on August 31, 2004 to m ore than 400 Section 203 and 4(f)(4) covered jurisdictions rem inding them again of th eir obligations to provide Spanish and other minority language assistance, and offering gui dance on how to achieve com pliance. We conducted a sim ilarly extensive outreach an d educational cam paign with regard to the provisions of HAVA, pa rticularly those that took effect on January 1, 2004. We wrote each chief state election official re garding HAVA's requirem ents. Then, when HAVA took effect, we widely publicized its newly e ffective provisions. Also dur ing 2003 and 2004, Division personnel handled num erous inquiries, responding inform ally to m any requests from states and organizations. Those responses are posted on our web site. Next, in early 2004, we sent inform al advisories to six states raising speci fic concerns over their ability to com ply with HAVA in tim e for their first elections for federa l office in 2004. After the first round of federal prim ary elections in F ebruary and March 2004, we wrote to 3 states raising com pliance concerns noted by m onitors. Finally, we conducted a detail ed state-by-state analysis of com pliance with HAVA's statewide voter regis tration database requirem ents. This analysis has resulted in contac t with severa l states rega rding this issue and on-site visits to 3 states. The legislative history supports this view. Indeed, Congress debated whether to include an express private right of action in HAVA, and declined to do so. Senator Dodd, a HAVA sponsor and Senate conferee, recognized th at HAVA wa s not priv ately enforceable, when he said: While I would have preferred that we extend [a] private right of action..., the House sim ply would not entertain such an enforcem ent provision. Nor would they accep t federal ju dicial review of any adverse decisi on by a State adm inistrative body. 148 Cong. Rec. S10488-02, S10512 (Oct. 16, 2002). 15 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution As of January 2004, HAVA's requirem ents for pr ovisional voting, identification for first- time voters who registered by m ail, voter inform ation postings, and statew ide voter registration databas es (for those few states that d id not apply for a waiver until J anuary 2006), went into effect and were required to be im plem ented fo r the 2004 Presidential E lection. As of January 2006, all state voting system s must meet the fe deral voting system s standards of Section 301 includ ing pe rmitting voters to co rrect voting erro rs and ver ify their votes ; meeting disa bility and alternative language accessibili ty requirem ents; and providing for a m anual audit capacity. The Division sent warning le tters or inform al advisories early in 2004 to six states (Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Massachuset ts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island) raising specific con cerns regard ing whether they woul d be in com pliance with all of HAVA's new requirem ents (i.e., provisional vo ting, voter iden tification and voter inform ation postings) by the time of their first federal elections in 2004. After the first round of federal prim ary elections in early 2004, the Division sent warning letters to three states (Califor nia, Mississippi and Texas) to raise specific HAVA co mpliance issues regardin g provisional voting, vo ter identification and voter information postings that ou r observers and m onitors had not ed in their early elections. These le tters and f ollow-up contac ts with the s tates spurr ed them to take addition al actions to bring about full HAVA com pliance. We also offe red states technica l assistance with respect to th e requirem ents of the NVRA and also UOCAVA. We twice wrote each chief stat e election of ficial regard ing these obligations. With regard to UOCAVA we worked closely with the Departm ent of Defense to ensure that ballots were distributed tim ely to troops serving in the field, and again I wrote jointly w ith the Pentagon to rem ind States of their obligations. Finally, we wrote to the ch ief election official of the severa l Section 5 states affected by the 2004 hurricanes, nam ely Florida, Alabam a, Missi ssippi, Louisiana, and Georgia. W e reminded these s tates of their obligation to su bmit any emergency voting related changes necessitated by the hurrican es, such as changes in polling loca tions, to the Attorney General. W e also offered to provide expedited review and consideration. Election Da y Activities The Division's efforts throughout 2004 culm inated in Election Day. As we approached that deadlin e, ou r efforts and their intensity increased. Complaint Gathering a nd Review Three weeks prior to Ele ction Day, we initiate d a com prehensive daily review of national media sources and election-related news servic es. Our attorn eys com bed the In terne t and newspapers to identify on a daily basis all reported possible voti ng rights violations. The Voting Section opened inquiries into doz ens of potential im proprieties base d on this data. In addition, we also gathered allegations of potential problems from nationa l civil righ ts and voting rights groups. The vast m ajority of these matters were reso lved alm ost immediately. For exam ple, in response to intim idation concerns, w e worked out protocols with sheriffs in Duval and Broward 16 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution Counties, Florida to m inimize a visib le police pr esence at or n ear polling p laces. We also m et with political party/cam paign leaders in both cam ps to discuss the appropriate circum stances for challenging voters. Challenges ther eafter were few and far between. We also looked into fears of possible racial unrest in Arizona, resulting in part from the presence of Proposition 200 on the ballot. As a result of our inquiries, election officials coordinated w ith law enforcem ent to develop contingency plans to respond to any Election Day arm ed inti midation. We also m onitored, inte r alia, allegations of im proper fel on purges, allegations of law enforcem ent intim idation of voters, unequal di stribution of voting lo cations and m achines, improper ef forts to d isrupt or in timidate legiti mate poll watching activities, im proper dem ands for identification, im proper voter challenges, and im proper m aintenance of voting rolls. As might be expected, m any of these reports turned out to be less than reported, the result of rum or and suspic ion. But, wherever allegations bore f ruit we f ully a nd dilig ently investigated . Many allegations were referred to the Public Integrity Section of the Crim inal Division. For instance, we noted m edia reports that a voter registration firm operating in Nevada and other locations was accused of destroy ing voter regis trations. Such activ ity, if true, im plicates th e public integ rity criminal laws, and a r eferral to the Crim inal Division is app ropria te, which, under the D epartm ent's longstandin g practice, then takes the lea d. This follows as Crim inal prosecutions proceed un der m uch tighter ev identiary and burd en rules. That said, once the Crim inal Division has com pleted its work, civil ri ghts actions m ay follow. While m ost of these inquiries were resolved pr e-election, som e raised allegations of serious civil righ ts violations that requ ired ad dition al investigation. I have direct ed the Voting Section to follow up f ully on a ll election-related investigatio ns. Administrative Preparations On Election Day itself, the Divi sion stood ready. W e had increased from fewer than five to fifty the number of dedicated phone lines ready to handle electi on com plaints. We had also developed a web-based com plaint system . And, we im plemented new m ethods of record keeping m aking certain that com plaints were re corded accu rately and responded to prom ptly and properly. On Election Day, the Voting Section received 1,088 calls on its expanded phone system and 134 e-m ail com plaints o n its specially created co mplaint form placed on its website. Each of these con tacts was entered on the new autom ated da tabase created to track com plaints. Many of these calls asked questions m ore ap propria tely referred to loc al elect ion o fficials, such as where a polling place was located; and in these circum stances, referrals were m ade. Approxim ately 600 calls and e-m ails were referred to attorneys, who spoke directly with the com plainant. Approxim ately 130 were designated for furthe r follow-up. A significant num ber of these complaints were subsequently resolved ove r the phone by Section st aff and/or follow-up investigations by attorney staff on Election Day. Many of these re solutions resulted in state and local of ficials taking s teps to ensur e the com plaining par ty was perm itted to vote. A few exa mples of m atters resolv ed quickly by telephone include: 17 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution An 18-year old in Louisiana told that she could not vote for P resident - we resolved the m atter with e lection of ficials; Poll workers in Illinois using racially derogatory language tow ards voters of m iddle- easte rn desc ent - we res olved the m atter with e lection of ficials; Reports of difficultie s properly d istributing and s egrega ting p rovision al ballots - we advised election officials as to the ap plicable requirem ents of HAVA; and, Reports th at individu als in line a t the tim e polls closed would not be perm itted to vote - we confirm ed with local officials that ev eryon e in line at that tim e would be perm itted to vote; Twelve investigations, opened as a result of election-day com plaints, rem ain pending. In addition, during the pre-election period, the Section received com plaints in sixteen jurisdictions where Section 203 investigations were ongoing at th e tim e of the el ection. These investigations remain open. Investigations of an addition al six pre-e lection com plaints r emain open, as do atters referred to the Crim inal Divisi on's Public Integrity Se ction for investigation. Election Monitoring P rogram Performance On Election Day, our m onitors a nd observers perfor med superlatively. As I noted, last year's monitoring effort was the Di vision's largest ever. In short, during 2004, the Civil Rights Divi sion mounted its most extensive election protection ef fort in its history, and accom plishe d much of whi ch to be proud. Looking forward, the com ing year should see a focus on m ore tr aditional votin g rights m atters. We recently assem bled a team of attorneys to look at Secti on 2 m atters. We have already filed one lawsuit under Section 2 this year agai nst Noxubee County, Mississippi, and we are considering the potential for investigation in about half a dozen other jurisdictions. In response to the Suprem e Court's decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft , we have updated our analytic al fram ework for Section 5 analysis of redistricting plans, having vigorously litigated the Georgia case on rem and before the case was dism issed prior to trial. And, with respect to HAVA, we are now looking forward to assisting States in the run-up to January 1, 2006, when the bala nce of its requirem ents take effect. By several accounts, the last twelve months have been m arked with unprecedented access to the ballot. T o wit, the Election Assi stance Commission in its February 2005 \" Report to Congress on Election Reform Progress in 2004 \" stated: 1.5 million people cast provision al ballo ts. Over 1 m illion provision al votes were counted (6 8%). 17 states used provisional ballots for the first tim e. 18 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution Since 2000, at least 25% of voter s have used new voting equipm ent, with another 30% to be using new equipm ent by 2006. At least nine states had developed and used a statewide voter registra tion database to help incre ase ac cess to th e polls. Likewise, as stated in the CalTech/MIT Voting T echnology P roject's February 2005 report entitled, \" Residual Votes in the 2004 Election\": \"17 m illion more people voted in 20 04 than vo ted in 2000, a 14% incre ase - a pproxim ately 1 m illion of those c an be a ttributed to reform s in voting m achines and administrative p ractices. Of the 37 states that reported total turnout in 2004, the residual vote rate was 1.1% in 2004, a redu ction from the 1.9% in 2000 - residual votes were those not counted because of m istakes, overvotes, o r undervotes - this equals a recovery of 1 millio n lost votes. Florida and Georgia saw the biggest decreases in the residu al vote rate from 2000 to 2004 at 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively Taking the Am erican electoral sy stem as a whole, th e emerging evidence is that the election of 2004 was run m uch better than the election of 2000.\" HOUSING A ND CIVIL ENFORCEM ENT The Civil Rights laws he lp to guarantee the ability of every Am erican to succeed. Obtaining education, employm ent, housing, access to public accomm odations, and th e financial m arkets are funda mental stepping -stones to personal and pro fessional su ccess -- and they m ust be provided without illeg al discrim ination based on race, na tional origin, and other p rohibited factors. Indeed, as P residen t Bus h recen tly noted: At the start of this new century, we will con tinue to te ach ha bits of respec t to e ach genera tion. W e will c ontinue to e nforce laws against racial discrim ination in education and housing and public accomm odations. W e'll continue working to spread hope and opportunity to African Am ericans with no inheritance but their character -- by giving them greater access to capital and education, and the chance to own and build a nd dream for the future. In this way, African Am ericans can pass on a better life and a better nation to their children and their gr andchildren, and that' s what we want in America. 19 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution The work of our housing and civil enforcem ent section squarely advances this m ission. Fair Housing President Bush has spoken of the need to create an \"Ownership Society, \" an Am erica in which all citizens m ay find the added m easure of comfort and security th at com es from owning their own hom e. A necessary step in that pr ocess is m aking sure that all Am ericans m ay buy, sell, or enjoy the hom e of their choice without f ear of illegal discrim ination. The Divisio n is charg ed with non-discrim inatory access to housing, public accomm odations, and credit. We have worked hard to meet th is weighty responsibility . During CY 2004 alone, the Housing Section filed 43 lawsuits, in cluding 24 pattern or practice cases, an 85 percent increase over CY 2003, a nd an enforcem ent rate that is 9 percent higher than the average number of filings over the previous 7 y ears. Thus far, in FY 2005, we already filed 17 suits, a p ace that p romises to m ake this an outs tanding year. The facts of these cases rem ind us that unf ortunately racism persists today. In one case, we filed a lawsuit against the owners and m anage rs of the Foster Apartm ents, in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, alleging discrim ination against African-Am ericans who were seeking housing. Specifically, the defendants told black prospect ive applicants th at they had no apartm ents availab le for rent while at the sam e time telling white app licants tha t apartments were available. And just last month, in a case with disturbingly sim ilar allegations, we filed a suit alleg ing tha t an apar tment com plex in Boaz, Alabam a discrim inated against African -Americans by, am ong other things, f alsely tellin g them that no apartm ents were av ailable Likewise, in May 2004, the court entered a Consent Decree in the United States v. Habersham Properties Inc., et al. , resolving our alleg ations of a pattern o r of race discrim ination against African-Am erican prospec tive renters at the Crescent Court ap artment complex in Decatur, Georgia. This case cam e to our attention based on a com plaint from an African-American woman who was told that no apar tments were availab le when she went to the complex in person, but was inform ed of availabi lities when she called back on the telephone. W e confirm ed the discrim ination through the Divisi on's testing program . During the testing, the renta l agen t consistently allowed white te sters to inspect av ailable apartm ents and gav e them the opportunity to rent, while falsely telling black testers that there we re no apartm ents available for inspection or for rent. The consent decree in this case requires the de fendants to: adopt non- discrim inatory policies and procedures; provide training for employees on the requirem ents of the Fair Housing Act; subm it to compliance testi ng, and m aintain records and subm it reports to the Division. The defendants paid a total of $180,000 in dam ages: $170,000 in dam ages for aggrieved persons (including the African-A merican wom an who brought the case to our attention) and a $10,000 civil penalty. Discrim ination is not limited to the basis of race . Consider, for exam ple, the facts of a case we took to trial: United States v. Veal. We alleged a pattern or pr actice of discrim ination by the defendant landlords, who system atically sought se xual favors from female tenants. One of the victim s was 19 years old and living in her car with her two children when she m oved into the top 20 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution floor of a duplex owned by the defen dants. On two separate occasions, o ne defendant cam e to her house, let him self in unannounced, and forced her to have sex with him on her bed. After these incidences, she us ed the m edicine she was rece iving to trea t her sic kle ce ll dise ase to try to kill h erself. Another vic tim was homeless and liv ing in he r car, separ ated from her children, when she rented a hom e from the Veal' s. After resisting sev eral inci dents where a defendant fondled her and refused to st op, the victim considered comm itting suicide to escape the harassm ent. In this case we secured a jury award of $1.1 m illion, the la rgest FHA award in the Division's history. Fair Lending Our lawsuits have not only defended the right s of Am ericans to obt ain rental housing, but also to pu rchase houses. While a len der m ay legitim ately con sider a b road range of factors in considering whether to m ake a loan, race ha s no place in determ ining creditworth iness. \"Redlining \" is the term employed to describ e a lender's ref usal to lend in certain areas based on the race of the area's residents. This is a shortsighted and offensive practice based on stereotypes, and it m ust end. During 2004 the Division filed and resolved two m ajor redlining cases under the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\"). Our lawsuit against Old Kent Bank alleged that the bank redlined the predom inantly Af rican-Am erican City of Detr oit by failing to provide either sm all business or reside ntial lend ing servic es within city lim its. Pursuant to the May 2004 settlem ent agreem ent, the bank's successor will open three new branch offices, spend $200,000 for consum er education p rogram s, and provide $3 million in Bank- subsidized loans to th e redlined areas. Our second case in this area was against Firs t American Bank. We alleged that the bank redlined the predom inantly African Am erican and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Chicago and Kankakee metropolitan areas by failing to provide residential, sm all business, or consum er lending services. This case resulted from the first redlining referral ever to the Departm ent by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to the Ju ly 2004 consen t order, F irst Am erican Bank will open four new branch offices, spend $700,000 on out reach and consum er education program s, and provide $5 million in Bank-subs idized loans to qualif ied residen ts of the red lined areas. This was the first tim e the Division h as ever filed two such cases in th e sam e year. These lawsuits rep resented f irsts in ano ther area a s well; they wer e the Division 's first two s uits f iled under the Fair Housing Act and ECOA that ch allenged redlining not only for residential mortgage loans but also sm all business loans. As President Bush has observed repeatedly, sm all businesse s are the engin e that d rives the gre at American econom y. We will r emain vigilant in ensuring that Am ericans have equal access to the capital m arkets th at allow sm all businesses to grow and prosper. Public Accommodations & Equal Land Use Last year also saw the Division successfu lly bring a lawsuit ag ainst Cr acker Barre l restaurants that alleged a pattern or practice of racial discrim ination in a public accommodation, 21 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution in violation of Title II of th e Civil Rights Act of 1964. Follo wing an extensive inv estigation, the Division uncovered evidence that Cracker Barrel employees inten tiona lly provided poor or no service to A frican-Am erican customers, segreg ated seating in their stores, and ignored complaints of such discrim inatory activity. In May 2004, we resolved the m atter through a consent decree that requ ired the company to im plem ent com prehensiv e reforms of its polic ies, training and investigations of discrim ination complaints. The Section is now working closely with the Au ditor to ensu re full com plianc e. The Housing and Civil Enf orcem ent Section is charged add itionally with f ighting re ligious discrim ination in a variety of contexts. This past year we were again active in defending and enforcing the Religious Land Use and Institut ionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, whi ch Congress passed in 2000 . During 2004, we opene d nine inv estigations, and successfu lly resolved three investigations where the jurisdic tion opted to com ply with the law without the need for form al action by the Division. Of partic ular note, this January the Division dism issed its com plain t in United States v. Maui Planning C ommission, our first contested RLUIPA m atter, after the Co unty agreed to issue to th e religious comm unity a previous ly denied construction perm it. The Division also secured two signifi cant appellate v ictories, cem enting RLUIPA's constitutionality In Midrash Sephardi v. Town of Surfside , the Eleventh Circuit agreed with us first th at RLUIPA constitu tes a valid ex ercise of Congressional au thority, and second that the statute w as violated where relig ious assem blies are barred absolutely from a district wher e fratern al lodges such as Masonic te mples are pe rmitted to lo cate. In Sts. Constantine and Helen v. New Berlin , the Seventh Circuit on February 1, 2005, held that a Wisconsin city violated RLUIPA by im posing unreasonable procedural requirem ents on a Greek Orthodox congregation seeking to build a church. The Civil Rights Divi sion briefed and argued the cas e as amicus. DISCR IMINATION Com bating em ploym ent discrim ination ranks among the Division's m ost longstanding obligations. As the Comm ittee knows, Title V II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employm ent discrim ination on the basis of race, co lor, relig ion, sex or national o rigin. The vast majority of em ploym ent discrim ination allegations are rais ed agains t priv ate em ployers, and are processed and/or prosecuted by the Equal Em ployment Oppor tunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). The Civil Rights Division has responsibitity for only a sm all, but vitally important aspect of Title VII enforcem ent: We have responsibility for a llegations raised agains t those em ployers who should set the standard for co mpliance - public employers. During 2004, we achieved record levels of enforcem ent in that area. Section 706 - Individual Allegation s of Employment Discrimination The bulk of the Division's work involves indi vidual claim s of disc rimination asserted under Section 706 of Title VII. Such alleg ations are fi rst filed with and invest igated by the E EOC. If the EEOC determ ines th at a su it may lie, the m atter is referred to the Div ision for enforcem ent. During FY 2004, we initiated investigations on 33 charges of individual discrim ination, and filed eight lawsuits under \u00a7 706, the m ost filed since 2000, and just 3 s hort of a record-setting year. 22 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution These inclu ded several extrem ely significant actions: We sued, for instance, the Pattonv ille-Bridget on Fire Protection Dist rict, alleg ing tha t it subjected its only black f irefighter to egregious racial harassment at work. During the tim e he was em ployed, he was the target of repeated, offe nsive racial slurs, which culm inated in June 2002 when his car was vandalized with the word \"n--- -r\" scratched on its driv er's door. Trial has been set for the summ er of 2005. In United States v. City of Baltimore , we alleged severe and perv asive sex ual harassment of a female carpenter. Specifically, we alleged that she had been subjected to acts of indecent exposure by a harassing supervisor, who prom inently displayed pornograp hy in the workplace, simulated se xual ac ts while telling th e female car penter that he wanted to perform those acts on her, and encouraged sexually offensive behavior and unwanted touching by her coworkers. The Division successfully obtained a com prehensive consent order. We sim ilarly filed suit against the District of Colum bia Fire Departm ent, challenging a policy which allegedly required new fe male em ergenc y medical tech nician s to undergo a pregnancy test, and which required them either to resign or undergo an abortion in the event that they \"failed\" that test. Section 707 - Pattern or Practice Cases In addition to filing individual claim s, the Division is also char ged with independent author ity to investigate o n its own and to challenge patterns or practices of e mploym ent discrim ination. This pattern or pr actice jurisdiction is the heart of the Division's practice. Such suits are extrem ely com plex, tim e consum ing, and re source-intensive. As a result, historically, the Division has m anaged only one per year. This past year, however, we prevailed in a m ajor pattern or practice trial and we filed f our addition al lawsu its, the m ost filed in any given year since at least the m id-1990s. In United States v. Delaware State P olice , we filed suit again st the Delaware State Police alleg ing that the State Po lice was eng aged in a \"pattern or p ractice\" of discrim ination against African Americ ans in v iolation of Title VII. Specifically, we alleg ed tha t a qualif ications test used by the State Police had a discrim inatory di sparate im pact against African Am ericans, was not \"job related and consistent w ith business necessity\" and, therefor e, violated T itle VII. The case was bif urcated into liab ility and dam ages proceedings. In August 2003, the court held a trial to d etermine liability. At trial, th e Departm ent subm itted th e nam es of 97 Af rican-Am ericans who f ailed the test tained law enforcem ent certi fication and em ploym ent elsewhere - includ ing the United S tates Secret Service and police agen cies in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. On March 22, 2004, the court issu ed a decisio n agreeing with our pos ition and concluding that the S tate Police had set the cut score for the challeng ed ex amination the State Po lice's use of the 23 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution exam ination violated Title VII. We are cu rrently in negotiations with the State to atte mpt to resolve liability issues without h aving to reso rt to further con tested litigation. In United States v. Erie (Pa) Police Department , we have alleged that the police departm ent was engaged in a pattern or practice of discrim ination against wom en in violation of Section 707 of Title VII, by using a p hysica l agility tes t for en try-level police of ficers that resu lted in disparate impact on wom en. This s uit is presently in trial. In United States v. Gallup, New Mexico , we alleg ed that the C ity engaged in a pattern or practice of employm ent discrim ination in hiring in all departm ents against Am erican Indians based on race. After neg otiations, we reached a settlem ent and the Court entered a co nsent decree. The City has ag reed to: (1) train em ployees engaged in hiring and recruitm ent; (2) implement policy ch anges; (3) p ay up to $300,000 in m onetary relief; and (4) accep t 27 priority hires in various City departm ents with rem edial seniority. In United States v. Los A ngeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority , we alleged that the MT A has engaged in a pattern or prac tice of religious discrim ination by failing to reasonably accommodate em ployees and applican ts who are u nable to co mply with MTA's requirem ent that they be availabl e to work weekends, on any shift, at any location. The lawsuit, also filed un der \u00a7 706 of Title VII, alleges that the MTA failed to accommodate a former MTA employee because of his Jewish faith by failing to reasonab ly accomm odate his re ligious practice of observing the Sabbath and subsequen tly discharging him from employm ent. Finally, we took steps to pr otect Sikhs and Muslim s in United States v. Ne w York Metropo litan Transit Au thority . We alleg ed tha t the New York MTA has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrim ination in em ploym ent on the basis of religion in violation of Title VII by: (1) selec tively enforcing the MTA's unif orm policies regarding head coverings toward Muslim and Sikh bus an d train operators; and, (2 ) failing o r refusing to reasonably accommodate the relig ious beliefs and practices of Muslim and Sikh bus and train operators. Uniformed Service -members Emp loyment Rights and Restoration Act In addition to its trad itional obligatio ns under Title VII, the Division recen tly took responsibility for enforcing the Uniform ed Service-m embers Em ploym ent Rights and Restoration Act (\"USERRA\"). USERRA prohibits an em ployer from denying any benefit of employm ent on the basis of an individual's m embership, application for m embership, perform ance of service, applic ation f or serv ice, o r obliga tion for service in the uniformed services. USERRA matte rs are referred to the Civil Right s Division by the Depart ment of Labor or by the ind ividual who alleg es the d iscrim ination. In each m atter referred to the Division , we can either pursue the case on behalf of the alleged vi ctim or issue a \"righ t to sue\" le tter much like the EEOC does in em ployment cases. Since Oc tober of 2004, the Division has received approxim ately 60 referrals. So far, we have initiated 16 inve stigati ons and authorized one lawsuit. 24 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution Needless to say, in light of the elevated num ber of reservists and National Guard m embers leaving civilian life to answer th eir country's call, it is im perative that we be ready to m eet this challenge. This afterno on, I will b e attend ing at training sess ion for Divis ion attorney s being held at the Justice Departm ent to better acquaint our attorney s with the s tatute. Discrimination against Immigrants In many areas of the country and in m any occu pations, new and recent immigrants m ake up a significan t portion of the labor force. These individuals often face discrim ination because th ey look or sound \"foreign.\" When wo rk-authorized immigrants, naturaliz ed U.S. citizens, or native- born U.S. citizens encounter workplace discrim ination linked to their \"for eign\" appearance, our Office of Special Counsel for Imm igration-Rela ted Unfair Employm ent Practices (known as \"OSC\") step s in. OSC enforces the anti-d iscrimination provision of the Immigration Refor m and Control Act of 1986 (\"IRCA\"). OSC protects lawful workers from discrim ination linked to their citizensh ip status or national origin. Such discrim ination often arises in the review proces s mandated by IRCA, which requires em ployers to verify the em ploym ent eligib ility of each new hire. When e mployers ask individuals who are perceived as \"foreign\" for more documents than are required for this process, or reject valid docum ents, they m ay be engaging in docum ent abuse. While em ployers may restrict the citiz enship sta tus of new hires if perm itted un der law, r egulation or go vernm ent contract, OSC also addresses cases where worker s are wrongfully den ied em ploym ent because of their citiz enship sta tus. For exam ple, in Taye v. Crystal Car e Center , we reached a p re-suit settlem ent agreem ent resolving a com plaint brought to our attention by a work authorized refugee from Liberia who was legally authorized to work. It turned out that his em ployer's e ligibility ve rification procedures were discrim inatory because th e company failed to accep t unrestricted S ocial Security cards and driver' s licenses f rom non- citizens for employm ent eligibility verif ication purposes, bu t accep ted such docum ents from citizens. Since the beginn ing of 2004, we have resolved m ore than 250 charges alleging imm igration-related unfair em ploym ent practices. OSC also continues its successful program of telephone interventions, allowing em ployers and workers to contact OSC i mmediately as ques tions about discrim ination arise. Since early 2004, we have resolved over 260 employer and wo rker requests for immediate assistance through our telephone intervention pr ogram . We also m aintain nati onal toll-free telephone lines, for both workers and em ployers, fielding over 19 ,000 calls since the beginning of fiscal year 2004. We also distribu ted approxim ately 206,000 individu al pieces of edu cation al materials in FY 2004, about 30 percent of which were in Spanish. In addition to resolv ing com plaints, we have been reach ing o ut actively to em ployers and community organizations so that the requirem ents of the law are clearly e xplained. We operate a grant program, through which the Civil Rights Division and its grant ees have conducted 822 outreach presentations in fi scal years 2004 and 2005. Just last m onth we announced the availability of funds and explained the appli cation process f or our next round of grants. 25 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution DISABILITY RIGH TS AN D THE NEW FREEDO M INITIATIV E I had the privilege this past August of hosting a cerem ony at the Departm ent of Justice to commem orate the 14th anniversary of the signing of the ADA. The Division m arked the event with the s igning of the 1 00th settlem ent agreem ent reached un der Project Civic Access. As you know, through Project Civic Access the Division work s with municipalities to bring all of their public sp aces, facilitie s, and services into com pliance with f ederal law. These agr eements quite litera lly ope n civic lif e up to par ticipation by i ndividuals with all sorts of disabilities. The gathering featured the rem arks of several loca l officials as we ll as ind ividuals with d isabilitie s from around the nation who have been helped by Project Civic Access. Nowhere was the beneficial effect of this pr ogram more evide nt than in th e comm ents of Ross Palm er, a 9 year old from Santa Fe, New Me xico, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Asked what the changes m ade under the Project m eant to him , he said quite sim ply: I want to say that the Am ericans with Disabilities Act allowed m e to get p laces, gave m e more to do. I will be ab le to go places and get around the neighborhood a lot easier and saf er. Thanks. That is the s imple truth of our work in the d isability area. Without s imple m odifications such as curb cu ts, many Am ericans with disabilities ar e quite literally prisoners in their own hom es. The New Freedom Initia tive ch anges that. Furthering th is goa l, during 20 04 we succe ssfully concluded 39 Project Civic Access Agreem ents, th e most of any year since the Project began. Disability Rights Litigation The Division has continued to pursue aggressive ly com plaints of disability discrim ination. During FY 2004, the Disability Rights Secti on resolved 353 such allegations through a combination of for mal and inform al means, including contested litigation, settlem ent agreem ents, and m ediation. These have reso lved com plaints involving su ch facets of everyday life as car rental agencies, gr ocery and convenience stores, mote ls, and child care centers. Separately, the Housing and Civil Enforcem ent Section handled approxim ately a dozen cases to enforce th e FHA' s accessibility requirem ents, includ ing eight new cases. In addition, at the end of the year, the Section was conducting pre-suit negotiations in four cases. We entered into nine consen t decrees in 2 004 involvin g FHA's accessibility requirem ents. Courts also entered six of these consent decrees during 2 004 and the three o ther consent decrees were awaiting Court approval at the end of the fiscal year. Of particular interest, the Di vision resolved two of the larg est design and construction cases ever filed. In United States v. Deer Run Management Co., Inc. , we filed and resolved a design and construction suit under the FHA and the new constr uction requirem ents of the Am ericans with Disabilities Act. The consent decree, entered Novem ber 24, 2004, covers over 4,000 ground units and affects 34 apartm ent com plexes in 6 states. The agreem ent also provides for a $1.2 26 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution million fund to com pensate ind ividuals who were injured by the inaccess ible housing, and for a $30,000 civil penalty to the United States. Separately, we also f iled and resolv ed a suit ag ainst the Hous ing Authority of Baltim ore City. This was the Division's first case ever brought against a public housing authority to enforce HUD's Reh abilitation Act regulations . If approved by the court, it would require extensive program and policy changes, the provision of more than 800 heightened-accessible units, 2,000 new housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities, and $1,039,000 in dam ages. This suit is par ticularly sign ificant in light of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in Three Rivers Independent Living Center v. Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, which the Court concludes that private plaintiffs may not sue to enforce HUD's FHA guidelines. Of m ajor significance, th is past y ear the Depa rtment's position prevai led before the S uprem e Court in Tennessee v. Lane . The Suprem e Court ruled that private individuals m ay maintain a suit for m oney dam ages against the S tates in ca ses brought to enforce acce ss to courts under Title II of the ADA. Since that decision, the Departm ent has defended the constitu tionality of Title II in 12 lawsuits in areas such as education, public transportation, li censing, prisons, and the provision of community-based services. Voluntary Compliance & Tec hnical Assistance Programs We have continued to devote substantial reso urces to prom oting voluntary com pliance with the ADA. Our success in doing so is reflected in the significantly high number of m atters resolved. The Division continues to operate an extrem ely prom ising m ediation program , which during 2004 successfully resolved 74 percen t of th e matters referred to it\u2014this pro cess brings more relief to m ore indiv iduals fas ter and w ith les s rancor than traditional litigation. We also continue to work hard to provide compliance and te chnical ass istance to business owners and individuals with di sabilities alike. During 2004, our com pliance assistance website, www.ada.go v, registered nearly 30 m illion hits, the m ost ever in a single year, ranking it am ong the m ost used Departm ent websites. Our ADA I nformation Hotline provided service to m ore than 100,000 callers, including 48,000 who were personally assist ed by specialists. We hosted, during 2004, four ADA Business Conn ection m eetings in Houston, Seattle, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. The ADA Business Connection was launched in January 2002 to help im plement the P resident's New Freedom Initia tive. These meetings bring tog ether leaders of national b usiness and disabili ty organizations to discuss ho w accessib ility can m ake business sense. The more than 5 0 million A mericans with disab ilities have $175 billion to pu rchase the services and products offered by accessible busine ss. This represents m ore purchasing power than the sought after teenage market. Accessibility and business profit can go hand-in-hand. The Division also published Guidance to assi st with com pliance. Of these, two m erit particular mention. First, early in 2004, as part of our preparation for the prim ary and general elections, w e published a 33-page ADA Checklis t for Polling Places , which walks loc al officials through th e process of improving accessib ility at polling p laces. (And, as I mentioned earlier, 27 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution this year our election m onitors were trained in acc essibility la ws as well a s more traditional voting rights protections). A second docum ent that m erits m ention was a guide to m aking em ergency services access ible, An ADA Gui de for Local Governments: Ma king Community Emergency Preparedness and Response Progra ms Accessib le to Peop le. When Florida was struc k repeatedly by hurricanes last fall, we received reports of individuals with disabilities being turned away from emergency shelters. Fortunately, local officials and emergency response groups resolved these difficulties promptly with out the need for the Division's intervention. Nevertheless, these anecdotes unders cored the need for activity in th is area. We published a total of 9 technical assistance docum ents during 2004, in addition to providing Spanish language translations of 12 such docum ents on the new Spanish section of the www.ada.gov website. Additionally, the Division is now in the pr ocess of working to capture its success on the ADA voluntary com pliance front in the Housing a nd Civil Enforcem ent Section, which enforces the disability provisions of the Fair Housing Act. We are presently developing a Fair Housing Forum to bring together the Division' s legal expe rts with housing providers , architects, builders, and disability rights advocates. It is our hope that by fostering discussion of respective needs and concerns we can establish a dialogue betwee n these im portant constituencies, and at the same time improve understanding of, and com pliance with, this im portant civil rights statute. ADA Rulemaking In addition, this year we initiated the process to update the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. On Septem ber 30, 2004, we published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulem aking (ANPRM) to begin the process of revising the ent's re gulations implem enting the ADA. The Departm ent must revise its ADA Standards for Accessible Design to adopt requirem ents consistent with the revised ADA Ac cessibility Guidelines published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Com pliance Board (A ccess Board) on July 23, 2004. The revised guidelines, which would apply to the design, construction, and alteration of a ny private or public facility subject to the A DA, are the result of ten years of collaborative efforts between the federal governm ent, disability groups, the design and construction industry, stat e and local governm ent entities, and building code organizations.4 The public comm ent period for the advanced notice is open until May 31, 2005. EQUA L EDUCATION AL OPPORT UNIT IES Last year, we continued our im portant work ens uring th e availab ility of equal educational opportunities are available on a non-discrim inatory basis. 4 The ADA requires t he Justice De partm ent to publish re gulations t hat incl ude accessi bility standa rds tha t are consistent with the gui delines publishe d by the Acce ss Board. The Access Board's revise d guidelines a re now effect ive as rulemaking guidelines for the Department of Justice an d the Depa rtment of Tran sportation, but they have no legal effect on the public un til these Departments issue final rules ad opting them as enforceab le ADA Standa rds. 28 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution The m ainstay of the Education al Opportunitie s Section 's wor k rem ains a substantia l docket of open desegregation matters, som e of which are many decades old. The m ajority of these cas es have been in activ e for ye ars. Yet, e ach repr esents an as-of -yet unfilled m andate to root out the vestiges of de jure segregation to the extent practicable, and to return control of constitutionally compliant public school system s to responsible local officials. We accordingly take these cases very seriously. To ensure that districts com ply with their ob ligations, the Division now actively initiates case reviews to monitor issues su ch as student assignm ent, faculty assignm ent and hiring, transpo rtation polic ies, e xtracu rricula r activities, the availability of equ itable facilities, and the distribution of resources. This past y ear, we in itiated th e larg est num ber of case reviews in any given year, 44. In a number of these (17), we id entified a need for furthe r relief. All told, the Division in FY 2004 obtained add itional relief in 23 cases th rough a combination of litig ation, consent decrees, and out of court settlem ents. Of the Division's active desegr egation matters, th e most visible this p ast year was th e new consent order secured in United States v. Chicago Board of Education , which addressed the school district's failure to com ply wi th an earlier agreem ent. The com prehensive decree addressed a variety of subjects in the third largest school district in the country, which enrolls over 440,000 students in 600 schools. Among the areas addressed are student and faculty assignm ent, and rem edial educational program s and funding. As a result of this agreem ent - and our vigorous enforcem ent of it - m inority students were given the choice to transfer to better perform ing schools. One student who took advantage of this opti on told the Chicago Tribune the difference it m ade in his life. At his old school, he said, \"kids walk up to you and say, `W hat's up? Give m e your m oney,' \" at his new school th ey say, \"Hi, Terrance. How are you doing? \" The consent decree also addresses th e district's failure to approp riately fund certain m ajority- minority schools, and to provide appropriate services to English Language Learners. Another notable lawsuit we brought last year involved Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, New York. We alleged that schoo l officials were deliberately indifferent to the repeated and system atic harassm ent of Asian students. Seve ral Asian students had b een violently assaulted and abused by fellow students shouting anti-Asian racial slurs. Some exam ples of the harassm ent included Asian students who were subj ected to daily verbal and physical harassm ent in the hallw ays, stairwells and classroom s of the schools. Other stude nts regularly threw food, cans and even m etal combination locks at Asian st udents in the school cafeteria. We were able to resolve the lawsuit through a consent decree, which was approved by the court. This was the Division's first ever harassm ent cas e filed under Title IV - and the firs t Title IV cas e filed sin ce 1990. Our work in Hearn v. Muskogee School District also drew national attention. There we helped Nashala Hearn, a young Muslim girl, who wa s denied the right to w ear a religious headscarf - a \"hijab\" - to class. Rather th an embrace the op portunity to educate children regarding other cultures and religions, school officials expres sed concern that children would fear the hijab, and thus suspended Nashala until she rem oved it. We negotiated a consent decree that pe rmitted Nashala to wear the h ijab and the dis trict's polic y with respe ct to the dress code as it relates to possi ble discrim ination on the basis of religion. After we prevailed, 29 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R.

LIMITED ENGLISH PROF ICIENCY While I m entioned e arlier the Div ision's effort s for those who are lim ited-English proficient in the areas of voting and edu cation, language access is equall y important in other areas. As you m ay know, on June 16, 2002, the Depart ment of Just ice published in the Federal Register an LEP Guidance Docum ent for recipients of federal financial as sistan ce. Executiv e Order 13166 requires that all fede ral funding agencies use the Departm ent's docum ent as a m odel in drafting and publishing guidance docum ents for their recipients, following approval by the Departm ent. To date, seventeen agencies have published approved docum ents. The Guidance explains that while m ost indivi duals living in the United S tates read, w rite, speak and understand E nglish, there are m any individuals, however, for whom English is not their prim ary language. Based on th e 2000 cens us, over 26 m illion individuals sp eak Spanish and alm ost 7 m illion individuals sp eak an Asian or Pacific Island language at hom e. For these individuals, language assistance is essential. Language for LEP individuals can be a barrier to accessing important benefits or services, unde rstanding and exercising important rig hts, complying with applica ble respon sibilitie s, or understanding other inform ation provided by Federally funded program s and activities. In certai n circum stances, failure to ensure that LEP persons can effectively p articipat e in or benefit from Federally assisted program s and activities may violate the prohibition under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VI regulations against national origin discrim ination. This adm inistra tion is co mmitted to roving th e acces sibility of these p rogram s and activitie s to eligib le LEP persons, a goal th at reinforces its equally important comm itment to prom oting program s and activities designed to he lp individuals learn English. As part of Presiden t Bush's Fir stgov En Espa\u00f1ol initia tive, the Civil Rights Divisi on has established a Spanish language site. During a tw o week peri od, nearly 5 percent of visits to our w ebsite homepage were to our Spanish language hom epage - a very significant percentage. As we go forward, our focus in this area h as turned to train ing federal g rant recipients so they will be ab le to provid e language assistance for ind ividuals who need access services. This year, the Departm ent held the first ever federal LEP Conference, and unveiled three major resources in conjunction with that conf erence. Individuals from all over the country discussed the im portance of, and innovative strate gies to ensure, language access. Almost 200 representatives from recipient organizations, federal government agencies, various community groups, and the fields of interpretation and tr anslation attended. Pane lists throughout the day made presentations about their innovative program s and practices, m any of which were featured in the resource docum ent issued that day. A vide otape of the event is bein g edited so that the inform ation can be distributed beyond the participants. During the conference, we released an im portant LEP resource docum ent entitled \"Ex ecutiv e Order 13166 Lim ited English Proficiency Resource Docum ent: Tips and Tool s from the Field.\" 30 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution This document provides lessons from the experi ences of law enforcem ent, 911 centers, dom estic violence pro viders, cou rts, and DOJ com pone nts on m eaningful access. Although geared to these en tities, the gene ral section of the docum ent contains useful tips and tools f or an y entity trying to pro vide langu age acces s. We developed the docu ment over many m onths of research to gather useful practices from throughout the coun try. It is now available on the LEP website, www.lep.go v. SPECIAL LITIGA Many of the Division's statutes focus on protec ting the m ost vulnerable in society. This is certainly the case with the Divi sion's enforcem ent responsibili ties under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRI PA\"). CRIPA authorizes the A ttorney General to investigate patterns or practices of violations of the federally protected rights of i ndividuals in state-owned or -operated institutions. These include nursing hom es, mental h ealth f acilities, and ju venile corre ction al facilities. The Division 's invest igations and prosecutions continue to uncover manifest abuse and appalling conditions, a nd to successfully arrive at solutions. FY2004 saw substantial successe s protecting the rights of in stitutional residents. We authorized 14 new CRIPA investigations, and entered in to 15 CRIPA agreem ents, the most agreem ents ever in a single year. We released 11 findings letters, and, we rem ained active in ongoing CRIPA m atters and cases involving over 164 facilities in 34 States, as well as the Commonwe alths of Puerto Rico a nd the Northern Marian a Islands, and the Territories of Gua m and the Virgin Islands. We are continuing investigations of 56 f acilities, and are m onitor ing the implementation of consent decrees, settlem ent agreem ents, mem oranda of understanding, and court orders involving 105 facili ties. Last year, these inves tigations included 121 tours of facilities to evalua te con ditions and monitor compliance. I want to highlight three cases f or the Comm ittee. We filed and resolved a com plaint in United States v. Louisiana regarding the Ha mmond and Pinecres t Develop mental Centers. The consent order entered in that case resolved an investigation into the conditions of confinem ent at the two f acilities. That investig ation revealed that staff m embers at one of the facilities had been arrested for abuse, including kicking a resident, dragging him to his room , placing a blanket over his head, and hitting him. At the other facil ity, staff m embers had left residents alone for sufficiently long periods of tim e that when the re sidents were eventually found they were soiled with drool, vom it, or urine. This m atter has also been referred to our Crim inal Section for review . The Divisio n also filed a com plaint and a consent decree in United States v. Breathitt County, Kentucky (E.D. Ky.), resolving an in vestigation of the Nim Hens on Geriatric Center. The Division's investigation suggested unconstitutional conditions including the use of inappropriate medications for an elderly population , unnecessary medical in terven tions such as feeding tubes, and residents with untreated bedsores. The consent decree contains remedial m easures addressing these and all of the Division's other findings of unconstitutional conditions at Nim Henson. 31 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution Third, on Septem ber 15, 2004, the Division filed in federal court a com prehensive agreem ent with the State of Arizona to rem edy egregious conditions at three Arizona juvenile justice facilities. As identified in the Division's findi ngs letter, these conditions included three juvenile suicides by hanging at one of the schools in a si ngle year. In one suic ide, staff lacked the appropriate tool to cut the noose from a victim 's neck and also did not have oxygen in the tank they brought to help resuscitate him . The Division also found that staff sexually and physically abused youth. Additiona lly, last y ear I reported that the Division had just filed a conteste d lawsuit ag ainst the State of Mississipp i over the conditions of co nfinem ent at se veral of the state's juvenile confinem ent facilities. Our findings letters d etails acts, which should not take place in juvenile facilities. We found that staff engaging in hogtying of juveniles, binding their hands together and their feet together an d then bind ing all four extrem ities to gether. We found that staff at the facilities p laced suic idal girls n aked into a \"da rk room \" with only a hole in the floor for a toilet for extended periods of tim e. We found that children who becam e ill durin g physical exercis e were m ade to eat their vom it. And, we found de ficiencies in m ental health and m edical care, juvenile justice m anagem ent, and regular and speci al education services. This litigation, referred to us by Congressm an Benny Thom pson, m arked th e first tim e in m any years that the Division filed a contested lawsuit seeking to rem edy such unconstitutional conditions. Our suit is active, and we are working to r esolve the matte r. We have now filed a second cont ested lawsuit in this context. In June of 2004, we filed suit against Terrell County, Georgia over conditions of confine ment at its jail, after we found that the jail routinely and syste mically depr ived in mates of constitu tional r ights. We identif ied considerable evidence in support of these allegations, in cluding a lack of m ental health care for inmates with clea r sym ptoms of mental illn ess, s uch as a de tainee who was lef t unsup ervised despite being on \"suicide watch\" and who hanged himself wi th his jail-i ssued sheet in August 2003. As you can see, this work is am ong the Division's m ost important, and truly changes the lives of thos e it affects. We w ill con tinue these efforts during 2005. SPECIAL LITIGATION: PROMO TING CONSTITU TIONAL LAW ENFORCEM ENT In addition to CRIPA, our Specia l Litigation Section is charg ed with im plem enting Section 14141 of the 1994 Violent Crim e and Law Enfor cement Act. Section 14141 authorizes the Division to investigate patterns or practices of violations of federally protected rights by law enforcem ent officers. Since 2001, th e Division h as successfully resolved 14 such m atters, as compared with only 4 resolved over the prior 4 years. Our ef forts continue, as the Division presently has 12 ongoing investigations, 4 of which were newly opened during 2004. When I appeared before the Comm ittee las t year I explained the new approach we have crafted to su ch cases. Rather than adopting a purely litigatio n-driven enf orcem ent model, our experience dem onstrates that a cooperative m odel produces much better and faster results. Accordingly, rather than husband findings of potentia l violations for use in court, we work hard to keep target agencies infor med of our findings and progress, so that th ey can begin to develop 32 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution and im plement ef fective solution s. Local police agencies are fully the D ivision 's partner in developing constitutional norm s for policing. By including them in the process, local agencies are m ore likely to \"buy in\" to the solu tion, m aking lasting change m ore likely. An exa mple of our success last year in our police m isconduct civil investigation program is the execution of a settlem ent agreem ent and a c onsent decree with Prince George's County, Maryland and the Prince George's County Police Departm ent requiring major reform s regard ing the use of force and us e of canines. These agreem ents resolved an investigation that had been ongoing for 5 years. While these investigations were ongoing, the Police Departm ent paid nearly ten m illion d ollars in po lice m isconduct settlem ents, court judg ments, and jury verdicts from fiscal year 2001 through 2003. I am also pleased to report that both the Fr aternal Order of Police and involved community groups welcom ed this am icable resolution. We also con tinued to enforce ex isting agreem ents. In an Detro it Police Departm ent's compliance efforts, we provided the city last summer detailed o n-site technical ass istance from our police p ractices exp erts at no co st. Subsequ ently, in the face of non-com pliance with tw o consent decrees by the Detroit Police Departm ent, we filed a pleading with the Co urt. During 2004 we also continued our comm itment to provide technical assistance to law enforcem ent agencies under investigation. We provided the Bakersfield, California P olice Departm ent with a detailed 20-page techni cal ass istance letter providing recommendations regarding, in ter alia , the use of force and investigation of allegations of misconduct. We also agreed to provide ongoing techni cal assistance regarding uses of force and use of force investigations to the police de partm ent in Portland, Maine as part of the resolution of the investigation of that departm ent and m ade our po lice p ractices expert available to the departm ent for that purpose. The Division is carefully m onitoring the Ci ncinnati Police Departm ent's com pliance with the Mem orandum of Understanding we ne gotiated with the City in April 2002. This Agreem ent has at tim es followed an occasionally bumpy road. Nevertheless, we are hopeful and confident that the Cincinnati Police Departm ent will continue to correct its p rior deficien cies, and that the community will con tinue to deve lop a grea ter ap preciation f or the ove rwhelm ingly f ine m en and wom en serving in that D epartm ent. We are also activ ely eng aged with other federal offices and th e polic e communities in identifying and understanding em erging issues in polic ing. One such issue is the use of so-called \"less -than-lethal\" force, such as the taser dev ice. It is im portant that such equipm ent be understood and used pro perly. It is equally im portant that police officers have access to a rang e of force options, rather than face the binary cho ice of fists or firea rms. According ly, this spring we will be a ssisting th e Off ice of Justic e Progra ms in hosting a conf erence on less -than-lethal uses of force. As I noted earlier, I have particular re spect for the difficult task perform ed by Police Departm ents around the country each and every da y. To the extent that the Division can both assist further their m ission and promote Consti tutional policing, we are perform ing a valuable task. 33 Assistan t Attorney Gen eral R. Alex ander Aco sta House Judiciary Commi ttee Ove rsight Hearing Civil Rig hts Division, Department of Justice Subcommittee o n the Constitution CONCL USION In closing, I hope m y statem ent today m akes clea r the scope and breadth of what falls within the jurisdiction of civil rights protection. I hope too that m y statem ent reflects the outstanding work of the m en and wom en of the Division. These accom plishm ents should also, however, remind us of a larger truth. I recently attended a special p review of a Hi story Channel docum entary entitled \"Voices of Civil Rights,\" hosted by the Sm ithsonian Museum of American History. This program recorded the oral histories of those who experienced firs t hand the Civil Rights st ruggles of the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these stories were challenging. They recorded from all perspectives the anger of those days. One story, however, particularly struck m e. It was the s tory of an African Am erican wom an who had been a nurse in a segreg ated hospital - separate floors, two races, no m ixing. On the day the hospital desegregated, she wa s sent to the f ormerly white f loor to tr eat, f or the f irst tim e, a white wom an, who had undergone surgery that very m orning. As she approached, the patient's husband st epped forward. \"Don't you lay a finger on m y wife,\" he said. Loyal to her profession, the nurse began to tend the patient. At this, the husband reacted vio lently. \"Get your n----r fingers off m y wife,\" he yelled. He picked up the n urse, carried her from the room, and hurled her down the hallway. Then, he unplugged his wife from the m edical equipm ent, placed her in a wheelch air, and took her hom e. A week later, the nurse w as on duty when the m an return ed to the hospital. She feared a continued confrontation. Rather, in a defeated voice, he said sim ply: \"I had no right to lay m y hands on you. If I had not done what I did, I would still have a wife to care for m y children.\" It is d ifficult to im agine such blind ly self-destructive behavior today. It would also, however, be na\u00efve to believe that in a m ere 40 years - a single generation - the impul ses that drove it have disappeared entirely from our society. While raci sm may not take all of the sam e stark for ms as it once d id, and while th e tools to f ight it m ust adapt, it nevertheless persists. Our ef forts this past y ear stand testa ment to that fact, and to the efforts of those committed to improving Am erica for all Am ericans. Thank you, and I look forward to an swering a ny questions th at members of the Comm ittee may have. 34 "}
