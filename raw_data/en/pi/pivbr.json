In addition, much of our research is performed in collaboration with customers. T o further enhancethese types of collaboration and to increase the successof technology transfer, a NIST-wide effort centeredin the Polymers Division, the NIST CombinatorialMethods Center (NCMC), was formally establishedin January 2002. The Center provides a portal fordemonstrating our cutting edge combinatorial materials research effort. Examples of recent NCMC research efforts include new methods for rapidly quantifyingover a range of conditions, the mechanical propertiesof thin films, adhesion and failure mechanisms, andcrystallization kinetics. As part of our ongoing assessment of current andfuture needs, the Polymers Division, and NIST as a whole, have identified nanotechnologyand health care as two criticalareas for investment. Whilenanotechnology is not an industry per se, the technology it represents is at theheart of many growing industries. Key to enablingthe practical applications of nanotechnology will bethe ability to reliably manufacture nanoscale structures.Due to the ever-pressing drive of Moore's Law, the semiconductor electronics industry is at the forefront of this technology. As size scales shrink,the associated tolerances also shrink. Electronics arerapidly approaching the point at which sub-100 nmstructures are needed. Control of the photolithographicprocess at this size-scale is painfully exquisite withdimensional tolerances on the order of the size ofthe polymer molecules. Headed by a recent winner ofthe Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) and in collaboration with key industrial partners, our Electronics MaterialsGroup is developing experimental methods needed tocharacterize chemical transport and materials sciencephenomena over nanometer length scales. Anotherproject supporting the semiconductor electronicsindustry has developed a solvent porosimetry techniqueusing x-ray reflectivity to calculate the pore-sizedistribution in \"low-k\" nanoporous materials being developed for the next generation of integrated circuits.The advent of controlled polymerization, advancedelectronics, biomimeticmaterials, nanostructuredsystems, and a range of othernew avenues for polymeric materials has raised the bar for measurements and standards research. This report of the 2002 activitiesand accomplishments describes many of the projectsdesigned by the scientists in the Polymers Divisionat NIST to creatively meet this ongoing challenge.As usual, our research encompasses a range of topicsand only a selection can be presented in this summary,and we are also able to discuss only a fraction of the many interactions with complementary teams throughout NIST , with our industrial partners, andwith the larger scientific community. I encourage youto consult our website at www.nist.gov/polymers for more information. As the \"everyman\" polymers, polyolefins haveseen a resurgence of interest and importance with the development of new catalystswith more precise molecularcontrol. The PolymersDivision is pioneering measurements of absolute molecular mass distributionof these polymers through the laser vaporization andionization methods of mass spectrometry. A mainstayof analysis for organic molecules and biologicalmacromolecules, mass spectrometry is particularly challenging for some common polymers such as polyethylene because of their simple molecularstructure. Nevertheless, this year we have producedintact gas phase polyethylene single chains with oversix times greater mass than previously reported byany researchers. This is one example of how thePolymers Division provides critical measurementmethods, standards, and fundamental concepts toenable polymer-based technologies. 2 Another class of nanostructured materialsis the broad range ofnanocomposites that havepotential uses rangingfrom materials for wirelesscommunication, to gasbarrier materials, to structural composites. Despite their intriguing potential, there remain several fundamental problems in reaching practical success. One such problem is the dispersionand alignment within the polymer matrix of nanoparticlesand nanotubes. In Division projects, work has begun torelate online optical measurements of carbon nanotubecomposites and dielectric measurements of nanoclaycomposites with a full suite of characterizations bytransmission electron microscopy, x-ray scattering,and small-angle neutron scattering measurements. The goal is to provide predictive measurement tools to relate processing parameters to the microstructureof nanocomposite materials. Our recent success indeveloping broadband dielectric metrology extendinginto the GHz region complements this work by allowingsimilar quantification in composites formed withferroelectric ceramics. For over 70 years, NIST has had a successful collaboration with theAmerican Dental Association(ADA). T oday, our effortsin dental materials arefocused on determininghow monomer structure, composition, and initiator affect the ultimate dentalcomposite properties. At the same time, we are vigorously extending this work, more broadly, to address critical issues at the interface of materials science withbiology. We are using our expertise in combinatorialmethods for rapid quantification of cell interactionswith synthetic biomaterials. Complementing this work,we are developing in vitro tests for cell infiltration, mechanical properties, and inflammatory response ofpolymer scaffolds for tissue engineering. Successfultests of this sort would lower R&D costs by reducing the need for in vivo animal model tests. T o characterize the response of cell attachment and proliferation, we aredeveloping visualization by multimodal microscopies andoptical tomography. Currently, we have demonstrated acombination of three hybrid techniques based on opticalcoherence tomography for imaging of fluorescent markersas well as structure within tissue scaffold materials.In 2002, the Polymers Division has continued to extend its work into new areas and strengthenprojects within our core programs. From health careto manufacturing, we see many challenges for polymertechnology. The creativity of our researchers is assuringthat our research remains at the cutting edge of polymer science, and our pervasive commitment to NIST's mission guides our choices from among the manyexciting opportunities for advances in soft materialsresearch. As always, I welcome your comments on our programs. Eric J. Amis Chief, Polymers Division Executive Summary3Technical Highlights Polyolefins: Serving the Largest Market Polyolefins, primarily polyethylene and polypropylene, comprise the largest share of the U.S. market for polymers. Demand for the newer metallocene polyolefins is expected to grow 20 percent per year through 2006. The Polymers Division develops a variety of measurement tools and concepts to meet the broad needs of this diverse industry. Below, the program is broken down into four interrelated components: molecular characterization, microscopic structure, processing, and physical properties. Each component addresses the needs of different industrial segments, but together they provide a backbone for continued growth. While each component has focused on polyolefins, there is a broader applicability of the research.Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory research and services in molecular characterization provideindustry with the tools to properly ascertain molecularmass and distribution. Calibration of instruments withNational Institute of Standards and T echnology standardmaterials allows suppliers and processors to trade withconfidence. Research into next generation calibration techniques ensures that U.S. industry will maintain its competitiveness as increasingly stringent demands areplaced upon materials producers. SRMs for Molecular Characterization Figure 1: Six narrow polyethylene fractions, with the molecular mass moments obtained by absolute methods, are used for calibration of instrumentation and for research. Plotted is the differential refractive index (DRI) versus elution volume in mL.Molecular Characterization The increasing number of distinct polyolefin molecules that have entered the marketplace, and the larger number that can now be synthesized in the laboratory, drive the need for characterization techniques; in particular with respect to molecular mass and distribution.These quantities determine the processability as well asthe final properties of the material.4Mass Spectrometry of Polyethylene Polyethylene is not amenable to analysis by the usual mass spectrometric methods owing to the lackof chemical functionality to yield intact macromolecular ions. In the last year, the polyolefin mass spectrometry team produced intact, gas-phase polyethylene single chains more than six times greater in mass than previously reported by any research group.Matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionizationtime-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF- MS) and the cationization method, developed last year in the Polymers Division,were each optimized by a multidisciplinary teamof Division scientists. A palette of spectroscopictechniques was used to find the optimal conditions for the necessary conversion of polyethylene into its ionizable phosphonium salt.Microscopic Structure Figure 2: Mass spectrum of SRM 1482 obtained by the covalent cationization method. The insert shows details of the spectrum above 15,000 g/mol showing that the technique sees higher molecular mass species but not in the correct proportion. Plotted is signal intensity in arbitrary units (au) versus mass in u. The molecular mass moments determined from mass spectrometry are about two-thirds as large as those found classically. This discrepancy may be due, in part, to the highly crystalline natureof the polyethylenes examined that may reject theMALDI matrix during target preparation. In order to prevent this occurrence, a heated sample stage will be fitted to a TOF mass spectrometer allowingexperiments to be performed above the meltingtemperature of polyethylene. In addition, experimentson the covalent cationization of atactic polystyrene are being undertaken in order to rule out effects solely derived from the ionization process. Thisproject enjoys keen interest from industrial producerswho have offered to synthesize specialized materials to further the Division's work.Figure 3: Structural information regarding polymer blends under shear flow is obtained via in situ light scattering, where HH indicates horizontal incident and scattered light polarization, and VV is vertical light polarization. Influence of Monomer Structure on Polymer Blend Many commercially important polymer materials are \"alloys\" of polymers having different monomer structures.Flory-Huggins theory has provided the main theoreticalframework for describing the miscibility, phase separationand scattering properties of polymer blends, but this theorycompletely neglects the dissimilarity of monomer structure.This fundamental issue was taken up in collaborationwith the University of Chicago. A generalization of theFlory-Huggins theory, accounting for monomer structurefor high molecular weight (incompressible) blends, indicatesthat monomer structure has profound effects on blendproperties and miscibility. We discovered a new classificationscheme, featuring four distinct classes of blends.A re-analysis of earlier experimental studies fromthe Polymers Division provides strong evidence forthis new theoretical framework. Complex microscopic structures due to crystallization, phase separation, and particulate dispersion directlydetermine physical properties such as permeability, impactstrength, and toughness. The various microstructures aredeveloped during processing operations and reflect themolecular characteristics of the polyolefin such as monomerregularity and chain branching. During the past year, extensive experimental work has been carried out to understand the effect of blending andthermal history on structure development in polyolefinblends. This represents the first comprehensiveinvestigation of blends that exhibits both liquid phaseseparation and crystallization. Among many interestingfindings, we mention just two. First, an abnormally largeeffect of co-crystallization in this blend, which is notexpected if truly random copolymerization, is assumed.Second, the effect of simple shear flow on crystalsuspensions in polyolefin blends has been investigatedusing light scattering (see figure below) and microscopy.The rich complexity of structure that we observeddemonstrates the potential for directed control ofmicrostructure through thermal and shear history.Technical Highlights5Macroscopic Processing Physical Properties SRMs for Processing Virtually all polyolefins are specified by their melt flow index (MFI). NIST produces melt flow rate standards that are used for checking an ASTM method (ASTM D1238) commonly used to determine processability of polyethylenes.Figure 4: Instrumentation takes simultaneous measurements of polyethylene rheology and temperature. One primary reason for the size of the polyolefin market is that numerous processing techniques have been developed which provide the bridge between the raw polymer and the final product. Processing considerations force strong constraints upon new polymer development, for example, frequently a new polymer molecule or formulation must be processable with existing equipmentin order to succeed in the market. We frequently work closely with the polyolefin industry on well-focused topics o ensure the commercial relevance of our work. One frequent concern in the processing of polyethylene is its susceptibility to \"sharkskin melt fracture\" during extrusion. We have utilized and developed instrumentation to conduct precise measurements of the cause and location of this processing defect. Current work includes the construction of a T otal Internal Reflection CoatingInstrument, which will be able to quantitate the buildup of fluoropolymer additives, which is one strategy to eliminate sharkskin. A second critical issue in polyolefin processing is the shear induced temperature excursions which can significantly alter the viscosity and hence the processing. Previously, we have developed fluorescent-based techniques to conduct in situ measurements of polymer temperature during extrusion. Recently, we have utilized thismethodology to carry out simultaneous measurements of polyethylene rheology and temperature (see Figure 4). We find that during a standard ASTM test method, the resin temperature can increase uncontrollably by 20oC, meaning that great care must be taken in the application of the generated data. A third area concerns molecular orientation during polypropylene film production. Using fluorescent probes that can orient with the extensional flow, we make fiber optic-based sensors which determine the anisotropy of the material.Physical properties are a result of molecular structure, microstructure and processing history.Here we describe two activities intended to improve the final properties. Flammability of Polypropylene-Nanotube Composites There is much current interest in the enhancement of physical properties of polymeric materials byincorporation of nano-scale additives, such as carbon nanotubes and clay. In conjunction with the Fire Research Division, we have recently shown that carbonnanotubes can significantly reduce the heat release rate of polypropylene under controlled burning conditions. This work was carried out with multi-walled nanotubesthat were well dispersed at a 1% volume fraction, without the addition of compatiblizers or organic treatments of the nanotubes. Preliminary measurementsindicate that the fire suppression effectiveness is better than achieved for clay filler nanocomposites at much higher loadings (order 10% to 20% volume fraction),where surfactant is required for effective clay dispersal. The rapidly decreasing cost of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the advantages of these compositesfor recycling make this approach to fire suppression potentially attractive for commercial development in the future. Fire suppression in polyolefin materials,in particular , is a problem of crucial importance to society because of the widespread use of these materials and the pollution associated with existingfire retardant agents. SRMs for Orthopedic Implants Concerns about long-term durability of polyethylene hip implants have created a need for a standard material to test the properties of implant materials. In response,the first reference biomaterial, an orthopedic grade ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, UHMWPE, was issued for use in development of improved testmethods for wear and as a benchmark for development of improved materials. Properties reported are the T ensile Y oung's Modulus, Yield Strength, UltimateStrength, and Elongation to Failure. In anticipation of continuing need for reference material UHMWPE for radiation studies, NIST issues orthopedic gradeUHMWPE cubes for radiation cross-linking tests and analysis.

T eskTechnical Highlights6Micro-Confined Blends Microscale processing is an emerging technology with unique challenges and applications in polymer processing and microfluidics industries, but the physics of processing emulsions when the drop size is comparable to a sample dimension is poorly understood. We are developing predictive models as we measure the effect of confinement and flow on the distribution and morphology of one component in another. Fluid strings, which can be observed during typical polymer processing operations, develop prominence in confined systems (Figure 1). The formation andstability of strings is being understood through uniqueobservations of micro-confined polymer blends.droplets produced. Direct observation of this phenomenon in simple shear flow has not been reported thus far. Figure 1: Strings in a flowing emulsion: a larger confinement stabilized string is shown at left, and a smaller string that is stabilized by shear alone is shown at right. The scale bars represent the gap spacing between the flow cell boundaries, 36 \u00b5m and 100 \u00b5m, respectively. After stopping shear , the string at right breaks on timescales on the order of 10 s, whereas breakup of the confinement stabilized string requires timescales on the order of 1000 s. Their stability arises from the effects of shear and confinement. We are exploring the stability of bulk,unconfined strings, as we directly test a recent theorythat predicts a new regime of processing conditionswherein strings are stable. Confinement greatlypromotes the stability of strings, because the relaxation and breakup rate is suppressed several fold due to hydrodynamic interactions between the string and thewall (Figure 2). In addition, we are also making direct observations of the mechanism of breakup of bulk strings (classicalRayleigh-T omotika instability and end pinching) insimple shear flow. Direct comparisons will be madebetween our experimental data and predictions ofhydrodynamic theories on quantities such as the time taken to break up by a string and the size of the finalFigure 2: Lattice Boltzmann simulation of the breakup of a stationary string confined between parallel plates. Simulation results agree in detail with experimental observations of the string shape and breakup rate. Notice the ellipsoidal cross section of the string. Figure 3: Morphology diagram describing microstructure in confined PDMS/PIB (polydimethylsiloxane/polyisobutylene) emulsions in the parameter space of mass fraction and shear rate, for a uniform gap-width (36 \u00b5m) and a fixed viscosity ratio ( = 1). Points denote shear rates where experimental data were obtained, and smooth curves are guides to the eye drawn by the authors to demarcate regions of different microstructure. Shaded points denote experimental observation of ordered pearl-necklace chains of droplets. In confined blends, the formation of strings is facilitated by migration of drops away from the walls, which leads to enhanced concentration and coalescence Technical Highlights7of drops in the center of the flow channel. When coalescence is inhibited either by increasing the flowrate or by decreasing the total concentration of drops, interesting new arrangements of drops are discovered (Figure 3). At low drop concentration, pearl necklacestructures form (Figure 4). At higher shear rates, thedrops arrange into two layers that slide by one another.Although the drop migration effect pushes drops towardthe center plane between the confining boundaries,collisions between drops push them apart so thatseparate layers are maintained. As the drops become smaller at still higher rates due to breakup, collisions become more numerous and random, inducing random diffusive motion of thedroplets transverse to the flow. The spatial distributionof drops under such conditions results from theinterplay of this diffusive motion and migration awayfrom the walls (Figure 5). By integrating the non-linearconvective-diffusion drop-transport equation, ananalytical expression is obtained for the steady statedroplet concentration. The degree to which the drops are concentrated to the center depends on the dimensionless parameter Pe. At steady state,we derive the following Pe = Ca (a/h) (4 /(f gy fo) , where Ca is the capillary number, a is the average drop radius, h is the spacingbetween plates, is a function of viscosity ratio, f gy is the dimensionless diffusivity, y is a dimensionless position, and o is the nominal volume fraction of dispersed phase (Figure 5).Figure 5: Dispersed phase concentration as a function of dimensionless position across the gap in which the emulsion flows, shown here for Pe = 2.4. Results of theory (curve) and experiment (symbols) are in good agreement. Near the walls, the emulsion is denuded of drops, having important implications for materials properties, including the surface finish of extruded polymer materials. A recently published linearized theory (gray curve) is not nearly as accurate. () += 22 c'y411 2'y1Pe' 'y'As implied above, interfacial coalescence phenomena have a large influence overthe morphology that develops in microscale processing.Coalescence rates are measured through observationof the evolution of the drop size distribution followinga step down in shear rate. Governing dimensionlessparameters and the effect of associated materialparameters are determined. In experiments involvingweakly adsorbed surfactant, we find that, at small capillary number, the coalescence rate is limited by diffusion-limited sorption, and at high capillarynumber, when collision causes slight drop deformation,coalescence is arrested by drop interface immobilization. These measurements and observations demonstrate that a remarkable variety of phenomenaoccur in micro-confined blends. We plan to develop newtools, based in part on these phenomena, to investigateinterfacial properties. These phenomena are also relevant for micro- and nano-fabrication and for microreactors, because multiphase flow can also be used for separationand encapsulation of desired products. The developmentof such reactors requires the aid of polymer materialsscience, which will yield optimal fluids, substrates,surface treatment, and active devices.

Technical Highlights 8Pore Size Distributions in Low-k Dielectric Thin Films from X-ray Porosimetry NIST is working to provide the semiconductor industry with detailed information on the nanoscopic pore size distribution of porous thin films destined as low-k dielectric materials for the next generation of integrated circuits. The electronics industry has chosen the introduction of nanometer scale pores into interlayer dielectric films as the method of lowering the effective dielectric constant. While these modifications change the dielectric constant favorably, other important parameters such as physical strength and barrier properties will also change, often in an unfavorable way. A new method has been developed to calculate the pore size distribution from x-ray reflectivity measurements on thin films in a controlled environment of solvent vapor. The rapid and sustained advances in ultra-large-scale integrated circuit performance have been driven, to a large extent, by miniaturization of the circuitry.At these nanoscopic sizes, interlayers with extremelylow dielectric constants (low-k) are imperative to reducecross-talk and to increase processor speed. While thecandidate materials differ in their base chemistries, acommon theme emerges in the push to develop low-k dielectric materials: nano-scale porosity must be introduced in a controlled manner to further reduce thedielectric constant. T echniques are needed to accuratelyand non-invasively characterize the porosity in thesefilms while attached on a silicon substrate. Capillary porosimetry is a prime candidate to measure the pore size distribution (PSD) of thenanoporous films. Bulk materials have beencharacterized in this manner by measurement of the mass gain of the material when exposed to a controlled pressure of solvent vapor . As the pressure of the probesolvent increases, pores become filled hierarchically bysize as is described by the appropriate thermodynamicanalysis such as the Kelvin equation:that an equilibrium amount of adsorption occurs. The value of P/P o can be varied either by mixing volumes of solvent saturated and dry air at a constant temperature,or by blanketing the sample in air that has reachedsolvent saturation at a low temperature and increasingthe temperature of the thin film. Under such conditions,a standard XR scan gives accurate values of the totaldensity that is a combination of wall density and solventfilled pores. The mass uptake as a function of partialpressure is calculated from these results. As an example, the reflectivity data from the porous hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and the silica xerogelfilms are shown in Figure 1. Each of the two sampleshas several data sets plotted together to show the effectof solvent adsorption. A critical edge is clearly visible atlow q z values as the sharp drop in log(Reflectivity) from the initially flat reflectivity curve. In Figure 1, four curvesare shown for each sample, varying from the sampleexposed to dry air (left most curve) to sample in saturated toluene vapor (right most curve). There is a progression of the critical edge to higher q z as the vapor pressure increases, due to the increased electron densityof the film as the smaller pores become saturated withliquid toluene. )/ln(2 0PP ) and xerogel films under controlled partial toluene vapor pressure. At P/P o = 1, toluene will condense in all of the accessible pores or open pores by definition, so the uptake at saturation, W o, is a measure of the porosity. It should be emphasized that this porosity only reflectsthose pores that the toluene can infiltrate. There mayalso be closed pores not accessible to toluene vaporand therefore not reflected in the XR porosity.Therefore, a matrix density that is a combination ofdense wall material and inaccessible closed pores canbe calculated.where the pore radius, r, can be calculated fromthe partial solvent vapor pressure, P/P o, known thermodynamic properties of the solvent such as surface tension, , and molar volume, V m, temperature, T , and gas constant, R. X-ray reflectivity (XR) has been extensively used in the Polymers Division to measure the thickness anddensity of 1 \u00b5m nanoporous thin films. A method of x-ray porosimetry (XRP) has been developed to createa controlled solvent environment around the thin film so Technical Highlights9Figure 2 presents the adsorption/desorption data for a porous methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ) spin-on glass (SOG) film in which P/P o is varied through the substrate temperature. The solid lines are cubic splinefits through the data and accurately mimic the shape of the curves. The data points have considerably less scatter than the data in which the isothermal techniqueis employed. The hysteresis loop is very well definedwith data outside of the loop coinciding accurately.If the principle of temperature-pressure equivalency is valid, the temperature control method clearly increases the accuracy of the measurement.a special substrate, such as the piezoelectric surfaces required for both the quartz crystal microbalance and surface acoustic waves techniques. XRP canbe done on any smooth substrate, including the Siwafers used in the semiconductor industry. In many ways, XRP is similar and complimentary to optical methods such as ellipsometric porosimetry (EP).However, the EP analysis requires knowledge ofthe optical constants, for both the matrix and theadsorbate. With EP it is also necessary to invoke the additional assumption that the polarizabilities are additive. XRP does not require these additionalassumptions. Another potential advantage of XRP is the ability to quantify not only the average film density, but also the density profile normal to the film surface. X-rayreflectivity has been used to extract non-uniformdensity profiles in a series of low-k films. It may bepossible to use XRP to extract pore size distributions as a function of depth into film. T o prevent dielectric breakdown, it is desirable to have low porosity or verysmall pores near the surfaces with the majority of theporosity localized in the center of the thin film. XRP could prove to be very useful for characterizing these types of structures. \"The SANS/SXR measurements have become a key metric in our low-k dielectric materials characterization and screening process.\" Dr. Jeffrey Materials T echnology International SEMATECH \"The NIST x-ray reflectivity program is useful, perhaps even critical, to the industry.\" Dr. Abner Bello Technical Staff Member Defect and Thin Film Characterization Laboratory Applied Materials, Inc.

The pore size distribution can be calculated by use of the Kelvin equation and other thermodynamic considerations from a point-by-point differentiation,as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: PSD of MSQ SOG films by varying the substrate temperature (where AU = arbitrary units). There are several advantages of XRP over other techniques to determine pore size in ultrathin films. Some methods require that the film be deposited onTechnical Highlights 10Direct Measurement of the Reaction Front in Chemically Amplified Photoresists The continual device performance increases by the semiconductor industry has been largely driven by the fabrication of smaller structures with lithography. As feature sizes approach sub-100 nm, the photolithographic process must be controlled with tolerances of (2 to 5) nm, dimensions comparable to the molecular size of the polymer chains in the photoresist imaging material. New experimental methods are needed to measure transport and materials science phenomena over nanometer length scales to provide critically needed data for the understanding, design, and control of new lithographic materials and processes. In collaboration with IBM and the University of T exas, we directly measured the spatial evolution of a reaction front, within a photoresist, with nanometer resolution using neutron and x-ray reflectometry and a deuterium-labeled photoresist polymer. The semiconductor industry is rapidly approaching the need to fabricate sub-100 nm structures to continue performance increases in integrated circuits.Photolithography remains the enabling technology forthe fabrication of integrated circuit patterns. Althoughindustry is able to commercially produce 130 nmfeatures, lithographic materials and processes arenot fully available for the production of sub-100 nmstructures. New materials must be able to producestructures with dimensional tolerances of (2 to 5) nm, dimensions near the size of the polymer chain molecules in the imaging layer .1 and 2. The patterns are generated in the resist by exposure to UV radiation through a mask. In the exposed areas, the PAG decomposes forming an acidspecies. Upon baking, the acid diffuses and catalyzesa deprotection reaction rendering the insoluble resistsoluble in a developer. The soluble regions are thenremoved with the aqueous base developer . Controlover this process is dominated by the events in thetransitional region between exposed and unexposedareas of the photoresist. Figure 1: At left, SEM image of a lithographically fabricated structure with a nominal critical dimension of 150 nm and 300 nm pitch. At right, schematic illustration of patterning through a mask to create the structure. Current imaging layers, chemically amplified photoresists, are multi-component materials consistingof a polymer resin initially insoluble in an aqueous base developer solution, a photoacid generator (PAG), and other additives. A schematic diagram of the fabricationprocess and an example structure are shown in FiguresFigure 2: Schematic diagram of the reaction-diffusion process in chemically amplified photoresists. The transitional region between exposed and unexposed regions is particularly important for critical dimension and roughness control. The initial development of chemically amplified photoresists was a key technological breakthroughfurthering the continued use of optical photolithographyfor the fabrication of sub-micrometer features. Theimportance of chemically amplified photoresist conceptsis illustrated by the industry-wide use of these materialsin the fabrication of state-of-the-art devices today and into the foreseeable future. With the imminent need for sub-100 nm feature sizes, nanometer level controlover the spatial evolution of the deprotection reactionfront and the subsequent development steps is needed.The current level of understanding of the acid-catalyzedreaction-diffusion process is not sufficiently detailed toachieve this goal. Technical Highlights11T o meet the need for spatially detailed data, we have developed, in collaboration with the IBM T . J. WatsonResearch Center and the University of T exas at Austin,an experimental methodology to measure directly thespatial evolution of the deprotection reaction front through each processing step. By using model photoresist polymers with a deuterated protectiongroup, neutron and x-ray reflectivity (NR, XR)measurements are able to follow the compositionaland density profiles of the reaction-diffusion processin an idealized transitional region in a bilayer film stack.Neutron contrast with the reaction is possible becausethe reaction products involving the deuterated protectiongroup are volatile as illustrated in Figure 3.control over the fabrication of sub-100 nm structures.In addition, the strategy developed here is general andcan be adapted for the study of candidate photoresistmaterials being developed for future applications.

Upon development, the datashow that the developed film remained sharply definedwith a surface roughness of approximately 4 nm as well. Although the reaction front was much wider than the final interfacial width, the selectivity of thedissolution process allows for the fabrication ofwell-defined nanostructures with diffusivetransport mechanisms.

Nalamasu Bell Labs, Lucent T echnologies, Science , 297, 349, (2002)Technical Highlights 12Metrologies for Tissue Engineering Tissue engineering represents a new paradigm in medicine by seeking to regenerate missing or damaged tissue. Developing, manufacturing, and regulating tissue-engineered medical products requires proving the safety and efficacy of these complex devices. This presents a significant measurement challenge involving qualification of materials, cells, and delivery methods. Tissue engineering is a rapidly growing field that presents a host of new measurement problems for producers and regulators. Tissue engineered medicalproducts are typically hybrid devices that incorporatematerials and cells in order to regenerate damaged tissue. The safety and efficacy of both materials and cells, as well as their interactions, must be qualifiedin order for these to gain acceptance, and we aredeveloping a host of in vitro tests to assist in this process. Events at the cell-material interface determine the performance of these devices, but the complexity ofthe interactions has prevented development of a morerational approach to tissue engineering. In the Polymers Division, we are extending the established program in combinatorial methods to biomaterial interfaces. Thiswill permit rapid screening of material variables andevaluation of their effects on cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) to which cells adhere can initiate healing, direct cell migration, control cell cycle progression, and determine cell differentiation.The scientific community is just beginning to understandintracellular signaling networks, but it is clear thatexternal stimuli participate in the cycle of cell activity. The challenge of tissue engineering is to control cellular behavior through the rational design of materials andculturing conditions. The industry is years away frommeeting this challenge due, in part, to a void in the measurement infrastructure at the cell-biomaterial interface. Efforts within the Polymers Division to fill thisvoid fall under three general topics: developing materiallibraries, expanding imaging capabilities, and managingand analyzing data. Developing Material Libraries We are developing a three-tiered material library for investigating cell-material interactions; each tier represents an increased level of complexity. The firsttier comprises polymeric material surfaces designedto mimic bulk material interfaces currently found in industrial applications. The second tier contains material surfaces designed to mimic the ECM throughincorporation of cell-signaling molecules such aspeptides and oligosaccharides. While the first twotiers describe pseudo-two-dimensional phenomena, the third tier includes three-dimensional materials. Current industrial applications, and those of the near future, rely on relatively simple materials such aspoly(lactic acid) and poly(dimethylsiloxane). Even so,variables such as composition and processing conditionscan drastically affect physical properties. Particular properties of interest include: nanometer- and micrometer-scale topography, hydrophilicity, charge,and mechanical hasestablished methods for preparing gradient materialsurfaces encompassing this parameter space. As thesemethods are transferred to biomaterial systems, the firsttier of our library will develop. From this tier, we willidentify and develop SRMs that will assist industry indeveloping products, assessing quality control, and gaining regulatory approval. The next generation of tissue engineered medical products will incorporate cell-signaling molecules suchas peptides and oligosaccharides. These materials willbe engineered to interact with specific receptors andelicit selective cellular responses. Doing so requiresfine-tuning the stimuli offered to cells by presenting appropriate combinations of signaling molecules. The cells then receive signals capable of initiating morecomplex cascades ultimately leading to the desiredcellular response. This chain of events would emulatethat which occurs during natural tissue formation.A high-throughput approach is uniquely qualified tocharacterize this complex, multi-dimensional space ofECM cues and cellular responses. As methods forpreparing such materials are developed, the second tier of our library will emerge. From this tier , we will contribute to the general understanding of intracellularsignaling networks, groundwork necessary for thedevelopment of new tissue engineered medical products. Real tissues are inherently three-dimensional and realistic measurement tools will need to be as well. Weare currently developing three-dimensional materials and Figure 1: Cell adhesion to a polymer blend. Technical Highlights13associated measurement methods to begin a metrology system complementary to the two-dimensional systems.Similar material issues will be faced with the addedcomplication of three-dimensional architecture and itsinfluence on cellular response. Such is the scope ofthe third tier of our library. In addition, other issues related to tissue engineered medical products will be investigated with a goal of creating necessarymeasurement capabilities. The devices being developedby tissue engineering companies have multiplerequirements in order for them to be safe and effective.They have stringent mechanical requirements whichdepend on the tissue being engineered; they must allowinfiltration by the necessary cells; and the inflammatoryresponses they evoke must be minimized. T oward this end, we are developing in vitro testing protocols for these performance requirements that will be used inscreening tissue engineered medical products. Expanding Imaging Capabilities The described three-tiered material library only has value if cell response across the library can bewell characterized. A host of strategies exist forcharacterizing cell response; many fall beyond the scopeof the Polymers Division and are pursued throughexternal collaborators. On site, we have targeted visualimaging of cells through conventional microscopy,fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, andoptical coherence tomography (OCT). The OCT image below shows pores in red and tissue scaffolding in blue.prepared from a blend of two polymers. The film might consist of a composition gradient along one axis andmight be annealed (processed) under a temperaturegradient orthogonal to the composition gradient.Characterization of this film would begin by mappingprocessing conditions, i.e., composition and annealing temperature as a function of position. An array of AFM images may be taken to map the surface topography.An array of contact angles may be measured to mapthe surface energy. Finally, an array of images wouldbe collected and analyzed to measure cell response.In order to identify correlations, each of these datamaps must be in alignment. Once data maps are aligned, a rigorous statistical analysis is necessary to quantify correlations and make meaningful hypotheses of causality. Material parameters can be analyzed following traditional engineeringstatistics. Data from living organisms requires analternative strategy. Whether measuring general,morphological parameters such as cell area uponspreading or more specific parameters such as theregulation of gene expression, the cell response willfall within a distribution defined by the cell line. Unlikemeasured material parameters, variations from the mean may not be random, so reducing data to a mean and standard deviation can result in a loss ofcritical information. The very nature of the combinatorial methodology will require that image acquisition be well documentedand unbiased in order to correlate cell response tomaterial properties. We envision a streamlined processwhere cells are seeded onto a material, incubated,fixed, and stained following an established experimental protocol. An array of images would be collected and the entire surface mapped. Images would then be reducedto quantitative measures of cell response. Managing and Analyzing Data The task of accurately overlaying data maps presents a significant challenge. For example, a thin film could beFigure 2: OCT image of a tissue engineering scaffold. As such, images of cells are collected, analyzed, and reported in a manner that maintains the fullestdescription of a population distribution. Furthermore,when investigating the cell response to a variety of material scaffolds, evaluations are based on a statistical comparison between correspondingcell populations.

Technical Highlights 14 NIST Combinatorial Methods Center The NIST Combinatorial Methods Center (NCMC) was formally established in January 2002 to provide information and expertise on combinatorial methods to a wide range of industrial, academic and government institutions interested in acquiring combinatorial and high-throughput capabilities suited for materials research. The NCMC functions through two complimentary efforts. 1) A research program geared towards the development of techniques and instrumentation for the fabrication and analysis of novel combinatorial libraries. This research centers on novel gradient combi methods, where the NCMC has recognized expertise. 2) An outreach program designed to gauge industrial needs in combi research and effectively disseminate data, instrumentation design, best practices and protocols, and other information relevant to combi techniques. Combinatorial techniques offer a highly parallel, automated, and often miniaturized route for experimentation that allows hundreds or thousand ofspecimens to be fabricated and analyzed in a rapid andefficient fashion. Such techniques provide opportunitiesto significantly boost productivity, increase the scopeof parameter-space exploration, and enhance theunderstanding of complex systems in a variety of scientific and technological disciplines. Indeed, in recent years the unmitigated success of combinatorial andhigh-throughput methods in the pharmaceutical industryand the genomics effort has spurred researchers in thematerials science and chemical industries to reconsidertheir reliance on traditional \"one-at-a-time\" experimentalapproaches to product and knowledge discovery.However, several challenges impede the successful adaptation of combinatorial methods in these arenas. For example, pharmaceutical combi models, which emphasizeproduct discovery, often do not provide insight into thestructure/property/processing relationships that arecentral to materials research. In addition, techniques andinstrumentation explicitly suited to the high-throughputfabrication and analysis of combinatorial libraries ofinterest to materials scientists need to be developed.Moreover , many institutions interested in acquiring combinatorial methods require information on how to incorporate such strategies into their research program. In response to these technical and educational needs, the NIST Combinatorial Methods Center(NCMC) was formally established in January 2002.A NIST-wide effort centered in the Polymers Division,the NCMC includes contributions from throughoutMSEL and several other laboratories including Buildingand Fire Research, Physics, and Chemical Science and T echnology Laboratories. The NCMC's mission is twofold. As a research program focused upon thecreation of novel specimen libraries and instrumentation,the NCMC advances the state-of-the-art in combinatorialmethods geared towards materials research and discovery.A complimentary effort is an outreach program, whichserves to disseminate NCMC research products, instrument design, best protocols and practices, andother information relevant to the combi method. Thisorganization also provides an effective means by whichindustrial needs are gauged. NCMC combinatorial methods research is rooted in the so-called gradient approach. The core of gradientcombi is the gradient specimen. These samplescontinuously vary in one property (e.g., film thickness)along a spatial coordinate over a prescribed range.By arranging two such gradients (e.g., thickness andtemperature) in an orthogonal manner, a gradient libraryis created that exhibits every possible combination ofproperties within the scope of the constituent gradient specimens. Gradient libraries are particularly useful to materials scientists because they offer a convenient andthorough way in which to map parameter space. Inaddition, gradient libraries are especially amenable toexamination via microscopy and microanalysis, whichfacilitates the illumination of structure-propertyrelationships. Finally, as opposed to many robotics-orienteddiscrete approaches, gradient techniques can offer acost-effective way of performing combinatorial studies, making them attractive to a wider range of institutions. This year, several new techniques were added to the NCMC repertoire. New instrumentation for generating gradients in ultraviolet-radiation (UV) exposure was central to this effort. Here, a UV slit-source is accelerated across a planarspecimen. When this source is held in close proximity (< 5 mm) to the sample, UV-generated ozone can chemically modify self-assembled monolayer (SAM) treated samplesurfaces resulting in a gradient in surface energy and/or chemical functionality. Depending upon the SAM employed, such surface energy gradients can span 70\u00b0 in water contactangle. Larger source/sample distances are effective in producing gradients in light-induced crosslinking, polymerization, and degradation. Since the degree ofUV exposure is controlled through stage motion, this instrument is particularly versatile. Gradient profile, depth and steepness are easily tuned for a wide rangeof applications. In another new technique, gradients in the height of topographic surface features are created. Here, topographic gratings are lithographically etched Figure 1: Scheme 1 \u2014 Gradient combinatorial library.As they are the basic unit of gradientlibraries, many NCMC research efforts concentrate upon thedevelopment of novel gradient specimens and processes, withpolymer science being a focus in recent years. Methods for producinggradients in film thickness, composition and temperatureformed the basis of NCMC studies.Technical silsesquioxane \"spin-on\" oxides created via flow-coating. The resulting patterns, with heights ranging from (30 to 150) nm, provide a combi strategy for examining topography-mediated templating of film properties, making them useful for the development of thin-film optoelectronic devices and MEMS. NCMC research also generates new techniques and instrumentation for the high-throughput measurement of materials properties. This year, efforts concentrated on combinatorial methods for evaluating mechanical properties and adhesion. Gradient film libraries mounted on deformable copper grids enable combinatorial examination of polymer failure mechanisms. In another technique,libraries prepared on rubbery polydimethylsiloxane supports allow high-throughput modulus measurements. Recently completed instrumentation facilitates sophisticated combinatorial measurements of adhesion via the Johnson- Kendall-Roberts (JKR) approach using micro-lens arrays. In addition, methods for performing combinatorial tests of interfacial fracture were developed in conjunction with a modeling effort that guides interpretation of experimental data. Due to these and previous research efforts (some of which are detailed in this report), the NCMC has established a widely-recognized expertise in gradient combinatorial materials science. This impact is demonstrated by the success of the NCMC outreach program, described below. NCMC Outreach The foundation of NCMC outreach is a membership program that invites industrial, academic, and governmentinstitutions to participate in a consortium designed to facilitate the advancement of combinatorial materials research. This program serves as a conduit through which NCMC research products are disseminated and industrial needs are gauged. Since the NCMC emphasizes relationships and collaboration that do not involve proprietary information, Center/member and member/member communication is maximized. However, collaborations that address specific industrialproblems are established when necessary. The NCMC has currently attracted 11 members (see table below), in part due to an extensive dissemination and recruiting effort that culminated in the inaugural NCMC conference held in San Diego, CA in January 2002. Members are served through several routes. Foremost among these is a series of tri-annual members' meetingsthat showcase NCMC technical advances and protocols, distribute information on research conducted at NIST and elsewhere of relevance to combinatorial methods, and provide a forum in which current issues and needs in combinatorial and high-throughput research are discussed. The first NCMC members meeting, held on April 26, 2002, was attended by over 20 representatives from 8 industrial institutions. Entitled, \"Library Design and Calibration: What you need to know and do before you look for hits , \" this meeting involved a variety of activities. T echnical presentations detailed the design of combinatorial experiments using the gradient technique and methods for calibrating gradient libraries. The importance of theseprocesses in combinatorial research was demonstrated through a case study that illustrated how calibration and design principles work in an actual research program. An NCMC staff-led discussion focused on combinatorial strategies for multicomponent formulations research and management of the massive amounts of data combinatorial studies necessarily produce. Laboratory demonstrations designed to provide practical first-hand knowledge about NCMC instrumentation and gradient techniques focusedupon flow coating, composition and surface energy gradients, automated hot-stage optical microscopy, adhesion measurement instrumentation, infrared-imaging, and combinatorial mechanical testing. The second NCMC meeting, \"Adhesion and Mechanical Properties, \" is slated for October 2002. This year has also seen numerous visits to NCMC facilities by member parties. For example, both Rhodia and the Air Force Research Laboratory sent staff to work alongside NCMC scientists on combinatorial projects. This type of interaction is especially useful to institutions that are new to combinatorial research and its effective implementation. The new NCMC website ( http://www.nist.gov/combi ) provides information on the center and its activities, research publications from the NCMC and selected sources in thepublic domain, instrument schematics and specifications, and automation and analysis software. Additional resources, including browsable combinatorial data libraries, are also in development. \"Combinatorial methods offer the possibility of accelerating industrial materials research.

Technical Highlights1617Advanced Manufacturing Methods An increasingly competitive manufacturing environment drives the search for new materials and processing techniques to make them. In most cases,materials processing steps determine the microstructureand performance of the material while manufacturingcosts determine price. Industry needs measurementmethods, standards, and data that will help monitor ,control, and improve processing methods. These toolsare also needed to help understand materials processingand to develop new processing methods and materials with enhanced properties. This is as true for highly developed, well-established industries as it is forrapidly growing or emerging industries. It is also truefor all types of materials, processes, and products.The industrial competitiveness of the United Statesdepends on U.S. manufacturers' ability to use themeasurement tools to develop and advance theirmanufacturing methods. In many cases, the neededtools are generic and their impact would be greatly enhanced if they became industry wide standards. Therefore, MSEL is working to develop measurementmethods and standards to enable industry to achievethese goals. This work is often being conducted inclose collaboration with industry through consortia andstandards organizations. The close working relationshipdeveloped with industry through these organizations notonly ensures the relevance of the research projects, butalso promotes an efficient and timely transfer of researchinformation to industry for implementation. Since different materials and industries frequently have similar measurements needs, and most industrial products havemultiple materials components, this program covers theprocessing of ceramics, metals, and polymers. Research in the Ceramics Division focuses on development of test methods for the assessment ofcontact damage and wear, development of test methodsand predictive models for evaluation of mechanicalproperties at elevated temperatures, and development of models for prediction of coating properties and performance. One project focuses on low temperatureco-fired ceramics (LTCC), a manufacturing methodbeing developed largely for portable wireless modulesbecause it promises to allow for a reduction in the sizeand cost of modules used in high-frequency applicationswhile improving performance. Because dimensionaltolerances are critical in this process, accuratemeasurements and predictive models of dimensional changes during sintering are necessary for the commercialization of LTCC modules. Measurementmethods and predictive models for the overall shrinkageand the local variations in sintering near vias andinterconnects are being developed.Projects in the Metallurgy Division cover several processing and measurement methods. The performance of metallic components in products isstrongly dependent on processing conditions thatdetermine microstructural features, such as grain sizeand shape, texture, the distribution of crystalline phases, macro- and microsegregation, and defect structure and distribution. Expertise is applied from a wide range ofdisciplines, including thermodynamics, electrochemistry,fluid mechanics, diffusion, x-ray, and thermal analysis, to develop measurement methods and understand the influence of processing steps for industries as diverse asautomotive, aerospace, coatings, and microelectronics.Rapidly growing and emerging industries such asbiotechnology and nanotechnology are dependent upon the development of new advanced manufacturing methods that can produce metallic components withthe desired characteristics and performance. Currentprojects focus on measurements and predictive models needed by industry to design improved processing methods, provide better process control, developimproved alloy and coating properties, and reducecosts. Important processing problems being addressedinclude melting and solidification of welds, solidification of single crystals, powder production and consolidation, and coating production by thermal spray andelectrodeposition. Polymeric materials have become ubiquitous in the modern economy because of their ease of processing. However, these materials can exhibit complex andsometimes catastrophic responses to the forces imposedduring manufacturing, thereby limiting processing ratesand the ability to predict ultimate properties. The focus of the Polymers Division is directed towards microscale processing, modeling of processing instabilities, andon-line process monitoring of polymeric materials.Our unique extrusion visualization facility combines in-line microscopy and light scattering for the study of polymer blends, extrusion instabilities, and the action ofadditives. Current applications focus on understandingand controlling the \"sharkskin instability\" in polymerextrusion and observation of the dielectric properties of polymer nanocomposites. Fluorescence techniques are developed to measure critical process parameterssuch as polymer temperature and orientation that werehitherto inaccessible. These measurements are carried out in close collaboration with interested industrial partners. Contact: Kalman MiglerProgram Overview18Control of Extrusion Instabilities Polymeric materials have become ubiquitous in the modern economy because they are comparatively easy to process. However, polymeric materials exhibit complex and sometimes catastrophic response to the forces imposed on them during manufacturing. These instabilities prevent or retard processing. In this project we seek new measurement technologies to understand and control processing instabilities. Kalman Migler The manufacturability of important classes of polymers is limited by processing instabilities. Our goal is to fully understand the well-known instability(sharkskin) via development of new measurementtechnology that can unravel the relationship betweenpolymer rheology, flow boundary conditions, and theresulting surface roughness. The output of the projectwill be to provide suppliers and users with guidelinesfor reducing this instability. This line-of-attack will then serve as a model for more complex processing operations in which flow instabilities hamper large-scale production. Our work published over the previous two years provided conclusive evidence regarding the nature ofthe flow conditions that exist during sharkskin meltfracture of polyethylene. We also provided the firstdirect evidence of how fluoropolymer additives modifythe flow boundary condition so as to eliminate sharkskin. However, the fluoropolymer additives are only effective when they efficiently migrate to the wall where they coat it, producing a thin fluoropolymer layer. There hasbeen virtually no research to understand this complexphenomenon; in fact, reasonable theoretical argumentsanticipate that the dispersed fluoropolymer dropletsshould migrate away from the wall. Understanding themechanism of fluoropolymer deposition at the wall willoptimize future additives and will provide insight into othermanufacturing operations where these effects may occur. Our approach is to conduct in situ measurements of the coating process by starting with pure polyethylene andmonitoring the sharkskin. We then mix approximately0.1% mass fraction fluoropolymer into the polyethyleneand correlate the instantaneous thickness of fluoropolymerat the wall with the state of sharkskin and the decreasingpressure required to drive the polymer through theextrusion tube. We have chosen an optical technique based on T otal Internal Reflection (TIR), which is sensitive to thepresence of a thin layer of fluoropolymer at the sapphirewall (see Figure 1). The principle is that a critical angle,, exists when light travels from a material with a high index of refraction to one with a low index of refraction(such as occurs in a swimming pool.)We take advantage of the differing indices of refraction of the three materials: sapphire, polyethylene (PE) andfluoropolymer (polymer processing additive, PPA).When the polyethylene is in intimate contact with thewall (which causes sharkskin) the critical angle for TIRis 53 o. When fluoropolymer displaces the polyethylene at the wall, the critical angle decreases. Preliminary measurements indicate that a layer sensitivity of 25 nm may be achievable and that this technique mayhave application for a variety of extrusion instabilitiessuch as the spurt phenomenon.Figure 1: Cross section of polymer extrusion tube also showing the relevant angles of the optical reflections. Figure 2: Reflectivity off the sapphire-polyethylene interface (diamonds) and off the sapphire-fluoropolymer interface (triangles). Contributors and Collaborators K. Migler; Dow Chemical, 3M Chemical Company, Dupont-Dow Elastomers, McMaster University, University of MinnesotaAdvanced Manufacturing Methods 19Process Monitoring of Polymer/Clay Nanocomposites Real-time, on-line measurements of resin materials properties are desirable not only because they preempt the need for post processing characterization but also because they can be used to monitor resin conditions, to detect problems with processing parameters, to control the process, and to predict performance of the final product. In this project, we are developing measurement techniques based on optical, dielectric, rheological, and ultrasonics techniques. NIST has filled an industry need by designing and constructing process sensors and by collaborating with industry partners in the application of new sensor technology to process monitoring. Anthony J. Bur The state of the microstructure that forms during the compounding and mixing of clay and polymer is the primary factor determining composite performance.Current practice is to analyze the processed product off- line using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray scattering to determine the extent of aggregate,intercalated, or exfoliated microstructure. In order tominimize the need for off-line measurements, we aredeveloping on-line instrumentation that will yieldreal-time microstructure information using dielectric,rheology, and light transmission measurements. On-linedata can provide a basis for developing R&D processingstrategies that compounders can use to set processparameters that yield targeted product microstructure. Our approach to determining microstructure using on-line instrumentation is to correlate real-timeobservations with TEM, x-ray, and small angleneutron scattering (SANS) observations. In the first phase of this project, real-time dielectric measurements were made using a ring-shaped ceramicdielectric cell that has interdigitated electrodes depositedon the inside surface of the ring. As resin flows throughthe ring, an electric fringing field intercepts the resin and the measured in-phase and out-of-phase currents are used to calculate the real and imaginary parts of thedielectric constant. Measurements carried out over arange of frequency from 500 Hz to 100 kHz yielddynamic information that characterize the electricalrelaxation times of the composite. Real-time dielectric measurements on polyethylene- ethyl vinyl acetate co-polymer (PE-EVA) mixed withorgano modified clays reveal a correlation between microstructure and the dispersion in dielectric data as a function of frequency. In Figure 1, the dispersion is seenin the plot of the imaginary part of the dielectric constantversus the real part. In this plot, the DC conductivity hasbeen subtracted out of the imaginary part in order toreveal the relaxation dynamics of the composite at higherThese data are providing the platform for a collaboration with Chemical ElectroPhysics Corporationto develop a new dielectric slit die sensor with capabilityto measure rheological, optical transmission, anddielectric properties in real-time. The full package ofdata from this sensor will be the basis for designating the microstructure of the compounded composite. Reference: A.J. Bur, S.C. Roth and M. McBrearty, Rev. Sci.

The broad dispersion seen in the 15A composite is due to intercalated microstructure.frequencies. Because these measurements are made in the melt at 150oC, ionic conductivity dominates the dispersion effects. This dispersion has origins inthe layered structure of the intercalated microstructure.The dielectric data in the figure are a direct result of thepresence of microstructure in the form of silicate layersof smectite clay with organic polymer occupying the space between layers. From an electrical point of view, silicate layers interspersed with polymer resin behave asa series of capacitances and resistances giving rise toelectrical relaxation dynamics having a broad distributionof relaxation times. It is our hypothesis that the shapeand magnitude of this dispersion can be correlated withthe microstructure that is revealed in TEM and x-rayobservations.Advanced Manufacturing Methods 20Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures: Phase Behavior and Processing In the search for new materials, relationships between molecular structure and material organization and properties must be established. By microscopic investigation of amphiphiles of novel molecular shape, we identify their phase behavior and explore how these materials can be aligned in the manufacture of useful devices. Steven D. Hudson and Hu Duan Self-organized organic nanostructures with controlled optoelectronic properties that facilitate ultra-high density nanopatterning represent one of thechallenges of molecular electronics. Similar materialsthat yield pores of precise size and chemical and ionic specificity represent another opportunity. T o meet these challenges, we measure phase behavior of thesematerials and properties of their phase transitions.T ransmission electron microscopy provides keyinformation about the material organization. By Fourier analysis of high-resolution lattice images, the relative phase of diffracted beams is determined,thus providing complementary information fordiffraction analyses. This capability proved useful in the investigation of novel dendrons, having a dipeptide head unit and several aliphatic tail units. These molecules assembleinto a hexagonal columnar phase at low temperatureand, depending on molecular structure, either a cubic or a weakly birefringent phase at high temperature. Whereas some head units fail to form a specialorganization, the dipeptide unit segregates by itself inthe center of the column, exhibiting a region of lowerdensity (Figure 1). Similar triply segregated structure was observed in the cubic phase at high temperature. Segregation of the head unit can be very importantand is responsible for high electronic carrier mobilityin columns comprising molecules with donor and acceptor aromatic head groups. Alignment of hexagonal columnar materials by appropriate surface treatment and/or processingprocedure has been investigated. As mentionedabove, some of the dipeptide dendrons exhibit a weakly birefringent phase at high temperature and a columnar hexagonal phase at lower temperature. At still highertemperature, the material forms an isotropic melt.Cooling slowly from the melt produces 100 \u00b5m-sized grains of the high temperature phase. Upon coolingFigure 1: High resolution TEM image of the hexagonal columnar phase of a dipeptide dendron. Inset upper left is the corresponding electron diffraction pattern, exhibiting (10), (11) and (20) reflections. Fourier analysis of the image also exhibited these reflections and determined their relative phase: - + +, whose combination results in the \"hollow\" cylinder appearance of the image. The resulting reconstructed image is inset bottom left. The influence of shear flow on the order-disorder transition of a polymeric material that exhibitsa hexagonal columnar phase was investigated.Whereas weak shear stress at temperatures slightlybelow the melting point align the microstructure,larger stresses cause melting. Upon cessation ofshear, the hexagonal phase reforms by a row-nucleationmechanism that produces macroscopic alignment of the columns along the previous shear direction. Phase transition phenomena, therefore, have asignificant influence over the alignment of thematerial. Contributors and Collaborators S.D. Hudson, H. Duan (Polymers V Western Reserve University)further, epitaxial relationship between this phase and the hexagonal columnar phase is observed.Advanced Manufacturing Methods 21Combinatorial Methods The Combinatorial Methods Program develops novel high-throughput measurement techniques andcombinatorial experimental strategies specifically gearedtowards materials research. These tools enable theindustrial and research communities to rapidly acquireand analyze physical and chemical data, thereby accelerating the pace of materials discovery and knowledge generation. By providing measurementinfrastructure, standards, and protocols, and expandingexisting capabilities relevant to combinatorial approaches,the Combinatorial Methods Program lowers barriers tothe widespread industrial implementation of this newR&D paradigm. The Combinatorial Methods Program has adopted a two-pronged strategy for meeting these goals. The first of these is an active research and development program designed to better tailor combinatorial methods for thematerials sciences and extend the state of the art incombinatorial techniques. Measurement tools andtechniques are developed to prepare and characterizecombinatorial materials libraries, often by utilizingminiaturization, parallel experimentation, and a highdegree of automation. A key concern in this effort isthe validation of these new approaches with respect to traditional \"one at a time\" experimental strategies. Accordingly, demonstrations of the applicability ofcombinatorial methods to materials research problemsprovide the scientific credibility needed to engenderwider acceptance of these techniques in the industrialand academic sectors. In addition, the successfuladoption of the combinatorial approach involves ahighly developed \"workflow\" scheme. All aspects ofcombinatorial research, from sample \"library\" designand library preparation to high-throughput assay and analysis, must be integrated through an informatics framework which enables iterative refinement ofmeasurements and experimental aims. CombinatorialMethods Program research projects give illustrationsof how these processes are implemented effectively in aresearch setting. NIST-wide research collaborations, facilitated by the Combinatorial Methods Program, have produced a widerange of new proficiencies in combinatorial techniques which are detailed in a brochure, \"Combinatorial Methods at NIST\" (NISTIR 6730), and online atwww.nist.gov/combi . Within MSEL, novel methods for combinatorial library preparation are designed toencompass variations of diverse physical and chemicalproperties, such as composition, film thickness,processing temperature, surface energy, chemicalfunctionality, UV-exposure, and topographic patterning of organic and inorganic materials ranging from polymers to nanocomposites to ceramics. In addition,new instrumentation and techniques enable thehigh-throughput measurements of adhesion, mechanicalproperties, and failure mechanisms, among others.The combinatorial effort extends to multiphase,electronic, and magnetic materials, including biomaterialsassays. On-line data analysis tools, process controlmethodology, and data archival methods are also being developed as part of the Program's informatics effort. The second aspect of the Combinatorial Methods Program is an outreach effort designed to facilitatetechnology transfer with institutions interested inacquiring combinatorial capabilities. The centerpieceof effort is (NCMC), an industry-university-governmentconsortium organized by MSEL that became operationalon January 23, 2002 via a kick-off meeting in San Diego. Although it is still in the growth stage, the impact of NCMC activities is readily apparent as 11 industrialpartners and the Air Force Research Lab have alreadyjoined the NCMC membership program. The NCMCfacilitates direct interaction between NIST staff andthese industrial partners, and provides a conduit bywhich Combinatorial Methods Program researchproducts, best practices and protocols, instrumentschematics and specifications, and other combinatorial-related information can be effectively disseminated. This outreach is mediated in large part by a series of tri-annual workshops for NCMC members. Thefirst NCMC meeting, \"Library Design and Calibration, \"was held on April 26, 2002 at NIST , and it providedinformation essential to starting a combinatorialresearch effort. The second meeting (October 2002)will concentrate on combinatorial approaches to adhesionand mechanical properties. Further information on NCMCcan be found on website at MCAT can also quantify weak surface forces that dictate interface formation. Forthese investigations, a modified geometry is used wherethe microlens array is cast on a large curvature surface, ormacrolens (Figure 1(b)). During the cooling of a laminated material (film/ substrate) system with an initial interfacial crack at a stress-free edge, a further crack extension (debonding)along the interface occurs at a critical temperature dueto the stress concentration near the crack tip. The EdgeDelamination T est (EDT) is based on this debondingmechanism using the thermal stresses generated by themismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion duringthe cooling to cause separation of the film from thesubstrate. Subsequently, the film-substrate adhesion energy can be deduced from the failure map if the internal stress-temperature relation of the film is known.We use a test film that fails (debonds) due to the stressgenerated by an over-coating polymer layer having athickness gradient. The bi-layer film is diced into asquare grid pattern to form an array of individual edgedelamination samples on the substrate (Figure 2).T o initiate debonding, the specimen is quenched intoa severe temperature gradient applied in the direction orthogonal to the thickness gradient. Simulations (not shown) predict interfacial debonding to occur inregions exceeding a critical stress that depends on thecombination of local temperature and film thickness.The red-line failure map of Figure 2 as a functionof temperature and film thickness is qualitatively inagreement with these simulations. Such a reliabilitymap can be used to quantify the critical bond energyof the thin film in the sub-micron thickness range forsemiconductor applications.

Chiang, A. Karim, E.J. Amis (Polymers Division, NIST)Polymer interfaces play a critical role in numerous technologies including adhesives, paints and coatings, and biological systems. Previous research has shown that polymer interface formation and failure is dependent upon various material, processing, and environmental parameters. T o explore this large parameter space efficiently, we have developed a combinatorial adhesion test based on the contact and separation of a microlens array. Combinatorial debonding measurement test method and concurrent simulations of dynamics of debonding at metal- semiconductor interface due to thermal expansion mismatch are developed. Alfred J. Crosby and Alamgir Karim We have developed a Multilens Contact Adhesion T est (MCAT) to meet the demands of industry for a quantitative combinatorial technique to measure the adhesive strength of polymeric interfaces. Specifically, the MCAT involves a planar array of spherical caps(Figure 1(a)) contacting and separating from acomplementary substrate. Using optical tracking ofthe contact area at each spherical cap and the measuredrelative displacement, we quantify the interfacial strengthon an absolute scale. By fabricating the planar array,complementary substrate, or both using establishedgradient processing techniques, a combinatorial map ofpolymer adhesion can be produced. This combination of the MCAT with gradient library processing facilitates high-throughput screening of the effect of polymeradhesion phenomena. Initial demonstration measurementsexplored the effect of annealing temperature and coatingthickness on the self-adhesion of thin polystyrene and Combinatorial Methods23High-Throughput Mechanical Properties of Polymer Films Thin films are increasingly being used in technological applications involving dielectric coatings, resist layers for lithography, electronic packaging, optical coatings, etc. The mechanical properties of these films is paramount for their effective utilization, but no high-throughput protocol to measure the mechanical properties of thin films has been available. We have developed a novel technique that rapidly measures the Y oung's modulus of thin film coatings from MPa to GPa. We also extend the copper grid test, a well-established method for studying crazing and fracture of glassy polymer films, to measurements in gradient thin film libraries. Christopher M. Stafford and Alamgir Karim As technology continues to move towards smaller, thinner, lighter devices, polymeric thin films are increasingly being used as protective coatings, adhesives,and functional coatings in such devices. There is a growing need for test methods that can measure the mechanical properties (modulus, viscoelasticity, plastic deformation) of thin films since these material properties play a vital role in the ultimate performance of the end product. We present here a reliable, high-throughput technique by which the elastic modulus of a thin polymer film can be measured. This technique relies upon a highly periodic strain-induced buckling instability that arises from a mismatch of the moduliof a relatively stiff polymer coating on a soft silicone sheet. The modulus-dependent buckling wavelength, typically (1 to 10) \u00b5m for 100 nm thick glassy films, is rapidly measured by conventional light scattering. This technique is ideally suited for measurements of combinatorial libraries prepared by existing methodologies developed at NIST . \"The authors have come up with a novel way to quickly measure the elastic modulus of thin film samples. I am convinced that this technique will quickly find its way to industrial application and help in the development of better materials. \" K. Krishana Sr . Scientist, Rhodia Inc.The ductile copper grid to support and deform thin polymer films, developed more than 20 years ago foruniform films, is extended to study fracture properties ofthin polymer films with gradient properties (i.e., molecularweight, tacticity, etc.). T o validate and demonstrate thisapproach, the effects of film thickness, h, on craze structure was studied by transferring thickness gradients of isotactic polystyrene prepared by flow coating onto a copper grid and applying uniaxial strain (Figure 3). The crystallizationmorphology and kinetics of isotactic polystyrene (i-PS)were mapped previously using techniques.Crazes, lead to fracture in glassy polymers, correlated to the morphology identically prepared gradient libraries to ultimatelyobtain structure- (mechanical) property relationship ina combinatorial manner.

Nucleating agents can be used to control the rate of crystallization and affect the clarity, fracture toughness, and overall modulus in the host material. Using high-throughput methods, we investigate as a function of film thickness and undercooling temperature the effectiveness of 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid as a nucleating agent for polypropylene thin films. Marlon L. Walker and Alamgir Karim The advent of new catalytic techniques have resulted in the production of a wide variety of new polypropylenes with different molecular masses, branchcontent, and potentially novel chemistries. Use of thesematerials in various applications requires comprehensiveevaluation of parameters such as crystallization rate,which directly affects the cost-effectiveness of theprocess. Nucleating agents can influence crystallizationrate and alter the parameters in processing, allowingfor better control of crystallization. A high-throughputmethod of evaluating the effects of nucleating agentson crystallization rate as a function of film thickness( h) and temperature (T) has been developed based on the gradient film technology developed in the PolymersDivision at NIST . Isotactic polypropylene films, neat and with 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid (BCA) as the nucleatingagent, were made using the NIST flow coatingtechnique. The film samples, having a gradient in h nominally between 50 nm and 150 nm, were annealedat 190 \u00baC and then directly placed on a cooling stagepossessing a temperature gradient between 100 \u00baC and140 \u00baC, orthogonal to the thickness gradient. Opticalimages were taken before annealing and at regularintervals after placement on the gradient stage, allowingthe evaluation of film behavior as a function of thicknessand undercooling temperature with respect to time. In Figure 1 is a subset of the optical data set taken using combinatorial methodologies for polypropylenewith BCA. This montage of images represents 16different ( h,T) combinations at virtually the same time. It can be seen readily that crystallite size and extentof crystallization increase with higher undercooling(lower temperatures). Figure 2 is a graph of the radialgrowth in time of the three crystallites present at thepoint in the optical subset located at a film thicknessof 140 nm \u00b1 2 nm and 125 \u00baC. Crystallite growth canbe followed as a function of time, yielding valuableinformation concerning the effectiveness of nucleatingagents in crystallization.These results help establish a high-throughput methodology for evaluating the effects of nucleatingagents in polypropylene thin films. Ongoing projects inthe Division indicate that this combinatorial method ofnucleating agent evaluation is applicable to other polymermaterials as well. Contributors and Collaborators M.L. Walker, S.A.

Combinatorial Methods25Interface of Materials with Biology New materials and devices are radically changing the medical treatment of injury and disease, yet becauseof the rapid growth of this segment of the materialsindustry, an adequate measurement infrastructure doesnot yet exist. The program on the Interface of Materialswith Biology develops measurement methods, standards,and fundamental scientific understanding at the interface between materials science and biological science. Within the health care industry, we focus on dental and medicalsectors that apply synthetic materials for replacement,restoration, and regeneration of damaged or diseasedtissue. Five major activities constitute this program: The dental industry is primarily composed of small manufacturers with very little R&D capability. Thedental materials projects, carried out in collaboration with the American Dental Association, located in the Polymers Division, fill that gap by developing improvedmaterials and techniques, patenting and licensing theseinventions, and, most importantly, providing technicalassistance to the licensees for producing and improvingtheir products. This has provided U.S. companies withproducts that successfully compete in a worldwidemarket. Our research focuses on improved understandingof the synergistic interaction of the phases of polymer-based composites and the mechanisms of adhesion to dentin and enamel. This approach will ultimately lead to materials with improved durability, toughness andadhesion to contiguous tooth structure. In this era of interdisciplinary approach to research,the Materials Reliability Division is providing an addeddimension to studying diseases and cellular function. By taking a physical/mechanical approach to howcells function, respond, and remodel, we are ableto provide insight into the progression of diseases using knowledge and skill sets typically absent in the biomedical community. We concentrate on mechanicalproperty metrology for several biological systems,including natural as well as engineered tissue andspanning a considerable size range from individualneurons and muscle cells to complete pulmonaryarteries. This necessitates the development ofunique mechanical testing platforms ranging fromelectrical and mechanical probes of individual living cells to biaxial stressing systems. We interpret our measurements by focusing on the roles of structuralelements such as cells, composition, and tissueanisotropy. This classical materials science approachto understanding properties is proving invaluable tothe biomedical community. The tissue engineering industry shows the potentialfor explosive growth in the coming years as biomedicalresearch is moving from academic science to industrial application at an increasing rate. Work in the PolymersDivision seeks to bridge the gap between knowledge generation by cell biologists and product developmentin industry. In collaboration with the Chemical Scienceand T echnology Laboratory, we are developingmeasurement methodologies and reference materialsto use in assessing interactions in complex systemsof living cells with synthetic materials. The expected outcomes of this work include methods to use reference substrates that induce specific cellularresponses and engineered DNA vectors that act asfluorescent reporters of cellular responses. Regenerating form and function to bone defects inan elderly, osteoporotic population of Americans isa daunting challenge. T o meet this challenge, thePolymers Division is collaborating with the AmericanDental Association to develop metrology methods to characterize the biocompatibility of synthetic bone grafts. Quantitative methods being developed includeassays for adhesion, viability, proliferation, anddifferentiation of bone cells, as well as opticalcoherence tomography and confocal microscopyfor measuring tissue ingrowth. The combinatorialapproach is used to rapidly identify compositionsand surface features that provide desirable propertiessuch as biocompatibility and mechanical durability. The NIST Center for Neutron Research and the NIST Biotechnology Division are engaged in the study of biomimetic films that serve as models of cellmembranes and which are of fundamental importancein understanding such key biological processes asphospholipid self-assembly, molecular recognition,and cell-protein interactions. Recent NCNR, coupled withadvances in biomimetic film fabrication at metallicinterfaces pioneered in the Biotechnology Division, afford enhanced sensitivity for probing membranes and membrane-protein complexes. New phase sensitivemeasurement techniques and model-independent dataanalysis methods have demonstrated the feasibility ofobtaining reliable depth profiles of membrane structuresin contact with biologically relevant aqueous environments,achieving subnanometer spatial resolutions. Fundamental to much of the work in this program is the recognition that surfaces and interfaces play a critical role in biological systems and, in particular, in the interactions of synthetic or designed materialswith biological systems and function. By providing theunique expertise in the NIST Materials Science andEngineering Laboratory to characterization of surfacesand interactions at interfaces in biomaterials, we willaccelerate the introduction of improved materials andhelp provide the means to assure quality control thatis critical to this industry. Contact: Eric J. AmisProgram Overview26Structure-Property Relationships in Dental Polymers Polymer based dental materials are increasingly being used in dentistry and allied biomedical fields. As part of a joint research effort supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research and also involving collaboration with the American Dental Association Health Foundation Paffenbarger Research Center, NIST is providing the dental industry and the dental profession with a comprehensive knowledge base regarding polymeric dental materials that will help elucidate the in vitro and in vivo performance of these materials. Joseph M. Antonucci This project is directed toward building fundamental understanding of how monomer structure, comonomer compositions, and initiator systems can influence the photopolymerization processand matrix formation of polymeric dental materials,e.g., composites. With composites, the influence of boththe filler and interfacial phases also must be consideredas critical factors affecting matrix formation and ultimatecomposite properties. Usually, dental matrix polymersare described simply as highly cross-linked networkswith little or no chemical structural characterization donebeyond a measurement of final vinyl conversion. Although the results of physical and mechanical property testing also have been widely reported for dental polymers,these data are more useful when correlated with theeffects of monomer structural and resin compositionalvariations on the development of cross-linked polymers.A similar but more difficult challenge exists with regardto finding generalizable structure-property correlationsin composites. In addition, this project is intended to define the currently unknown co-reactivity of structurally different co-monomers than those that are typically used in theformation of dental polymers. For lack of this type ofinformation, the reactivity and cross-linking potential ofdental methacrylate monomers are generally assumedto be equal. The use of selected model monomers isdesigned to demonstrate the influence of specificstructural features on monomer reactivity and polymerproperties. Such information should have a significant impact on the processing and development of improved materials. An examination of the polymerization of non-methacrylate vinyl monomers, such as vinyl esters andvinyl ethers, with conventional dental monomers such asBis-GMA offers a means to modify network formationand ultimately dental polymers/composites. For example,it was shown that modification of a typical Bis-GMAdental resin composite with neo-decyl vinyl esterimproved flexural strength when compared to that of the unmodified composite.Recently, we employed near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in the analysis of dental polymers and demonstratedits ability to monitor both vinyl conversion and waterabsorption. Also with NIR spectroscopy, it is relativelyeasy to determine how the filler phase of compositescan influence both vinyl conversion and water uptake ofclinically relevant size composite specimens. In contrast to conventional gravimetric water sorption studies, NIR spectroscopy allows the differentiation between freewater and water that is hydrogen-bonded either withone or with two hydrogen bonds, thereby elucidatingthe type of hydrophilicity of the polymer network. NIRspectroscopy also can be used, more effectively thanmid-IR spectroscopy, to monitor the conversion ofoxirane (epoxy) monomers during and after theirphoto-cationic polymerization (Figure 1) as well as the synthesis of hydroxylated methacrylates from epoxy monomers such as glycidyl Siloxane-epoxide / TEGDMA mixtures. Currently we are investigating several high-molecular mass-alternative resins to well as newtypes of monomers, fortheir efficacy in reducing residual vinyl unsaturation, polymerization shrinkage, stress and water uptake. Alternative initiator systems are also under investigationin an effort to enhance photopolymerization efficiencyand improve the quality of polymer matrix formation.The results of these studies should extend well beyondthe dental materials venue to include a significantnumber of other applications that rely on the rapidformation of cross-linked polymeric networks as ameans of achieving materials with optimal properties.

The main cellsresponsible for these responses are the macrophage,which coat the device and attempt to consume it.Macrophage response is mediated through solublesignaling molecules called cytokines, and we are adapting real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques to help predict cellular response (Figure 3).Characterization and Modeling of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds Polymeric scaffolds form the basis for a wide range of potential therapies being developed by the tissue engineering industry. In the Polymers Division, we are developing a measurement infrastructure to meet the needs of this growing field by providing reference materials and test methods for measuring structure, mechanical properties, rates of cell infiltration and adhesion, and immune responses. Newell Washburn and Francis Wang The tissue engineering industry is faced with a broad range of complex measurement issues. The devices these companies are producing have strict requirementson mechanical performance, ability to guide tissuedevelopment, and the inflammatory responses provokedby the implants. We are developing a measurementinfrastructure to meet these needs. Of particularimportance is the development of meaningful in vitro tests for assessing these parameters. Such tests wouldgreatly reduce research and development costs wherescreening products in animal tests represents asignificant expenditure. Porous polymeric scaffolds are the basis for many of the therapies currently under development.A representative scaffold, produced in our labs, isshown in Figure 1. The device is made of abiocompatible polyester and has a continuousnetwork of pores with characteristic diameter on the order of 100 \u00b5m.The mechanical performance of the scaffold is also greatly influenced by the microstructure. The bulkmodulus may be reduced by two orders of magnitudeover that of the solid polymer, which may limit their usein load-bearing applications. A sample stress-straincurve is shown in Figure 2 and the nonlinear responseis attributed to failures occurring in different structuralelements. The elements leading to such failures needto be controlled during device processing, and we are developing sensitive mechanical tests to be complemented by three-dimensional structural characterization in orderto prepare guidelines for quality control. Figure 1: Porous polymer scaffold for tissue engineering applications. This porous network is designed to allow cells to infiltrate and permeate the scaffold to initiate tissuedevelopment. The rate at which this process occurs isa crucial factor in determining the performance of thedevice. We are developing transmigration assays tomeasure this using a collagen gel as a model extracellularmatrix. Scaffolds are embedded in a gel and removedafter several days. The rate of cell migration from the gel to the scaffold is assessed using fluorescence microscopy and correlated with structural featuresof the scaffold surface.Figure 2: Stress-strain curve for tissue engineering scaffold.Interface of Materials with Biology 28Metrology for Tissue Engineering The tissue engineering industry is developing new materials and devices that promise to radically change the medical treatment of injury and disease. In order to do so, an adequate measurement infrastructure is necessary to bridge the gap between cell biologists, materials scientists, product engineers, and regulatory agencies. T o meet this need, we are developing a library of reference materials, high-throughput techniques for screening material libraries, and an informatics approach for data analysis and interpretation. Scott Kennedy and Newell Washburn The Polymers Division seeks to extend high throughput materials characterization into the realm of biomaterials and tissue engineering. Considering the vast parameterspace facing the tissue engineering industry, extendingNIST expertise into this arena follows naturally. The efforthas evolved into developing three interwoven toolsets:material library preparation, high-throughput screening,and statistical treatment of population distributions. The library of materials available for investigating cell-biomaterial interactions continues to expand. Atpresent, the library encompasses the following material parameter space: surface energy, crystallinity, roughness, topological patterns, compliance, degradability, and alimited range of chemical patterns. Gradient samplepreparation facilitates exploring these discreetparameters; Figure 1 illustrates the power of thegradient methodology applied to crystallinity.underscore the framework established for streamlining the process of screening cell-material interactions. A fully automated, multi-channel image acquisitionsystem is operational and capable of z-stack compilingfor auto-focusing or extended depth of field imaging. A versatile image analysis software package withintegrated macros reduces image files to data files. A versatile graphing and analytical software packagewith integrated macros performs rigorous statistical analysis and facilitates data visualization. At present, image files are reduced to data files that document general cellular information such as area, perimeter , roundness, and asymmetry. As more sophisticated cell-staining protocols are added to the existing arsenal, data files will include more specificinformation describing cell populations. The power of the streamlined process manifests itself in that information from thousands of adherent cells can be documented in a reasonable amount of time.Thus, screening cell-biomaterial interactions can now be based on a rigorous statistical comparison of large, unbiased populations. The significance of this effort was evident at a recent Gordon Conference where this work generated interest amongst industrial and academicrepresentatives alike. Figure 2 illustrates a working standard by which cell populations could be qualitatively and quantitatively compared. Figure 1: AFM images taken across a PLA film annealed under a temperature gradient (top), and fluorescence microscopy images of cells fixed and stained 72 hours after uniform seeding (bottom).Figure 2: Population distributions from a PCL control (red) and structurally similar sugar containing polyesters (black). All distributions were smoothed using a kernel density estimator and represent a sampling of approximately 1000 cells. Quantitative comparisons result from a two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test against the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same distribution. This work has attracted interest from potential customers as the expanding library of gradient materialsmay help to identify and develop benchmark SRMs.T oward this end, strategies are being fleshed out forpreparing orthogonal gradients and decorating surfaceswith functional groups. An automated peptide synthesizeris also being integrated into this effort. Initial progress in library preparation exposed image acquisition and analysis as bottlenecks in thehigh-throughput approach. The following highlightsContributors and Collaborators S. Kennedy, N.

At the same time, there has been a revolution in recent years in new materials used in allaspects of microelectronics fabrication. Since 1994, the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) has worked closelywith the U.S. semiconductor , component, packaging,and assembly industries. These efforts led to thedevelopment of an interdivisional MSEL programcommitted to addressing industry's most pressing materials measurement and standards issues central to the development and utilization of advanced materialsand material processes. The vision that accompaniesthis program \u2014 to be a key resource within the FederalGovernment for materials metrology development forcommercial microelectronics manufacturing \u2014 istargeted through the following objectives: Develop and deliver standard measurements and data; Develop and apply in situ measurements on materials and material assemblies having micrometer- andsubmicrometer-scale dimensions; Quantify and document the divergence of materialproperties from their bulk values as dimensions are reduced and interfaces contribute strongly to properties; Develop models of small, complex structures tosubstitute for , or provide guidance for , experimentalmeasurement techniques; and Develop fundamental understanding of materialsneeded in future micro- and opto-electronics andmagnetic data storage. With these objectives in mind, the program presently consists of projects led by the Metallurgy, Polymers,Materials Reliability, and Ceramics Divisions that examine and inform industry on key materials-related issues. These projects are conducted in concert with partnersfrom industrial consortia, individual companies, academia,and other government agencies. The program isstrongly coupled with other microelectronics programswithin government and industry, including the NationalSemiconductor Metrology Program (NSMP) at NIST .Materials metrology needs are also identified through industry groups and roadmaps including the InternationalT echnology Roadmap for Roadmap,the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI)Roadmap, the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association (OIDA) roadmaps, and the National [Magnetic Data] Storage Industry Consortium (NSIC). Although there is increasing integration within various branches of microelectronics and optoelectronics,the field can be considered to consist of three mainareas. The first, microelectronics, includes needsranging from integrated circuit fabrication to componentpackaging to final assembly. MSEL programs addressmaterials metrology needs in each of these areas, including, for example, lithographic polymers and electrodeposition of interconnects, electrical, mechanical,and physical property measurement of dielectrics(interlevel, packaging, and wireless applications), andpackaging and assembly processes (lead-free solders,solder interconnect design, thermal stress analysis, andco-fired ceramics). The second major area is optoelectronics, which includes work that often crosses over into electronic andwireless applications. Projects currently address residual stress measurement in optoelectronic films, and wide bandgap semiconductors. Cross-laboratory collaborationswith EEEL figure prominently in this work. The third area is magnetic data storage, where the market potential is already large and growing and thetechnical challenges extreme. NSIC plans to demonstratea recording density of 40 times today's level by 2006.T o reach these goals, new materials are needed that havesmaller grain structures, can be produced as thin films, and can be deposited uniformly and economically. New lubricants are needed to prevent wear as the spacingbetween the disk and head becomes smaller than themean free path of air molecules. MSEL is working withthe magnetic recording industry to develop measurementtools, modeling software, and magnetic standards to helpachieve these goals. MSEL works in close collaborationwith the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory,the Physics Laboratory, the Information T echnology Laboratory, and the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory as partners in this effort. Contact: Eric K. LinProgram Overview30Characterization of Porous Low-k Dielectric Constant Thin Films NIST is working to provide the semiconductor industry with unique on-wafer measurements of the physical and structural properties of porous thin films important to their use as low-k dielectric materials. The methodology utilizing several complementary experimental techniques to measure the average pore and matrix morphology has been expanded to include pore size distributions. New methods have been developed to measure closed pore content and matrix morphology in films having complex structures with any morphological type. Barry J. Bauer and Wen-li Wu The next generation of integrated circuits will require feature sizes that demand new low-k interlayer dielectric materials. T o address problems with powerconsumption, signal propagation delays, and crosstalkbetween interconnects, dielectric constants will haveto reach unprecedented values. One avenue to low-kdielectric materials is the introduction of nanometerscale pores into a solid film to lower its effectivedielectric constant. While these modifications changethe dielectric constant favorably, other importantparameters such as physical strength and barrierproperties will also change, often in an unfavorableway. Characterization of the pore structure is crucial torapid development of new dielectric materials, and newmeasurement methods are necessary. The small sample volume of 1 \u00b5m films and the need to characterize the films on silicon wafers narrowsthe number of available measurement methods. Wehave been providing standard characterization using acombination of small angle neutron scattering (SANS),high-resolution x-ray reflectivity (HRXR), and ionscattering techniques. These measurements areperformed directly on films supported on siliconsubstrates so that processing effects can be investigated.New methods are required, however , to provide moredetailed information necessary to complete the productdevelopment. During the past year, we have continued our efforts on characterization of current industrially-relevant materials through International SEMATECH,and by new collaborations with Dow Chemical and IBM.More significantly, we have perfected new techniquesfor more thorough and accurate film characterization. International SEMATECH, a consortium of microelectronics companies, provided more than20 separate samples for characterization by NIST .The structural information provided by NIST is placedinto a master database that includes data from a varietyof sources, detailing both the structural and materialproperties needed to evaluate candidate materials.Member companies make extensive use of the data toguide the development of low-k dielectric materials for integration into future devices. Finally, we have evaluated and perfected new measurement methods to more thoroughly andaccurately characterize pore and matrix morphology.Capillary porosimetry has been applied to HRXRmeasurements to determine pore size distributions,rather than simple averages. By the use of a carrier gasand control of vapor pressure through thermal methods,the accuracy and speed of the measurements havegreatly improved. Based on these findings, an automatedmeasurement system has been designed and is underconstruction with the ultimate goal of providing ameasurement technique that can be transferred to thematerials suppliers and chip manufacturers. Figure 1: Representative mass gain and pore size distribution calculated from HRXR porosimetry measurements (AU = arbitrary units). New techniques have been developed that measure SANS from films that have been infused by mixtures ofnormal toluene and toluene in which hydrogens have been replaced by deuterium. The match point measures where the neutron contrast matches that of the wall material. By filling the open pores with contrast match fluids, SANS reveals the closed pore content and size. The relative open and closed pore content is becoming increasingly important to low-k applications. Contributors and Collaborators B.J. Bauer , H.J. Lee, R.C. Hedden, C.L. Soles, H. Wang, D.

Glinka (NIST Center for Materials for Micro- and Optoelectronics31Dielectric Metrology for Polymer Composite Films in the Microwave Range Novel dielectric hybrid materials based on organic resins and ferroelectric ceramics with high dielectric constants have been identified by the industry as key dielectrics for advancing miniaturization and functional performance of microwave electronics. The objective of this project is the development of broadband dielectric metrology for such materials and fundamental understanding of the high frequency relaxation mechanism in relation to structural and molecular attributes. Jan Obrzut We have developed an accurate broadband measurement technique that enables dielectric measurements at microwave frequencies of up to severalGHz. The broadband test methods currently in useby the industry are based upon a lumped elementapproximation and are limited to frequencies below afew hundred megahertz. Our new technique is based onthe observation and theoretical analysis of fundamentalmode propagation at high frequencies in thin filmdielectrics terminating a coaxial air-filled transmissionline. The 3D vector plot of the electric field of the firstfundamental mode, simulated inside a high-k specimen,is shown in Figure 1.The new broadband methodology enables measurements at frequencies of 100 MHz to 10 GHzwith the precision required by new electronic technologies.In partnership with the Institute for Interconnecting andPackaging Electronic Circuits, IPC, we initiated a standardtest method development and chair the IPC-D37-d test method subcommittee for Embedded Passive Devices. We guided the design of the test protocol and madearrangements with co-sponsoring member companiesfor round robin evaluation. Our capability to measure the dielectric relaxation times in the sub-nanosecond regime and the relaxationstrength for wide range of dielectric permittivity valuesis used to quantify dispersion, alignment, and structurein hybrid materials. Using the broadband study, we demonstrated that the composites of organic polymer resins filled with ferroelectric ceramics exhibit adominant intrinsic high-frequency relaxation behavior.Such dielectric properties were beneficial in eliminatingthe electromagnetic noise in processors and logicdevices. We have confirmed that the fastest dielectricrelaxation process is controlled by the dipolar dynamicsof the polymer matrix while the dielectric loss arisesfrom the difference in coupling between the relaxedand unrelaxed dipoles. Our new numerical models can quantitatively correlate the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity on thevolume fraction of the ceramic filler. We have developed constrained regularization algorithms to obtain a continuous distribution functionof relaxation times. The method is able to resolvemultiple relaxation processes without any a priori assumptions about their character. It may be generalizedto different types of fundamental relaxation processes and not restricted to a superposition of Debye-like functions. This approach will help judge the identitybetween microscopic and macroscopic relaxationbehavior of polymer composite systems. It also allowsus to link broadband dielectric spectroscopy with othertechniques such as time domain spectroscopy, photoncorrelation and NMR. Contributors and Noda and J. (Shipley); R.

The arrows indicate the direction and strength of the electric field E. In contrast to the assumption of the lumped element model, the field in the specimen section is not uniform.At a resonant frequency of about 8.2 GHz, the magnitudeof the electric field, E, shows two maxima localized nearthe edge of the specimen, while the minimum magnitudeof field E extends along the specimen diameter. Thecorresponding plot of the magnetic field, H, is parallel tothe propagation direction. Both E and H fields appear todecay rapidly at the boundary between the high-k dielectricand air. The results of numerical simulations confirmour earlier experimental analysis that, at microwavefrequencies, the film specimen becomes a transmissionline with propagation direction along the film diameterrather than its thickness. Materials for Micro- and Optoelectronics32Polymer Photoresists for Next-Generation Lithography Photolithography, the process used to fabricate integrated circuits, is the key enabler and driver for the microelectronics industry. As lithographic feature sizes decrease to the sub-100 nm length scale, significant challenges arise because both the image resolution and the thickness of the imaging layer approach the macromolecular dimensions characteristic of the polymers used in the photoresist film. Unique high-spatial resolution measurements are developed to reveal limits on materials and processes that challenge the development of photoresists for next-generation sub-100 nm lithography. Eric K. Lin Photolithography is the driving technology used by the microelectronics industry to fabricate integrated circuits with ever decreasing sizes. In this process, a designed pattern is transferred to the silicon substrate by altering the solubility of areas of a polymeric photoresist thin film through an acid catalyzed deprotection reaction after exposure to radiation through a mask. T o fabricatesmaller features, next-generation photolithography will be processed with wavelengths of light requiring photoresist films less than 100 nm thick and dimensional control to within 2 nm. Material and transport issues arise when fabricating structures over these length scales. T o date, the materials and processes needed to fabricate sub-100 nm features have not been selected. T o advance this key fabrication technology, we work closely with industrial collaborators to develop and apply high-spatial resolution and chemically specific measurements to understand changes in material properties, interfacial behavior, and process kinetics at nanometer scales and to provide high-quality data needed in advanced modeling programs. Over the past year, we have applied and enhanced unique measurement methods and computer simulation tools to provide new insight and detail into the complexphysico-chemical processes used in advanced chemically- amplified photoresists. These methods include x-ray and neutron reflectivity (XR, NR), small angle neutron and x-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), incoherent elastic neutron scattering (IENS), near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), combinatorial methods, x-ray standing waves with fluorescence (XSW), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atomic force microscopy (AFM). Inparticular , XR and NR studies with specially designed model materials were used to profile the reaction front with nanometer resolution (see Highlights), NEXAFS measurements have been extended to depth profile the chemical composition of the top 5 nm of a polymer film surface, SAXS measurements have been performed in transmission on patterned structures to complementearlier SANS studies, and AFM techniques have been adapted to begin study of the mechanical properties ofinterfacial polymer layers and structures. Figure 1: NEXAFS carbon-edge spectra from the bulk and surface of a model photoresist before (blue /black) and after exposure and bake (green /red). A delay time of 5 min was imposed after exposure and before a bake. The reaction is incomplete only at the surface (peak signature at arrows) corresponding to surface base (yellow) contamination as illustrated. Our experimental and theoretical methods have been used to understand important technical problems in thedevelopment of next-generation materials. These topicsinclude: the spatial evolution of the reaction-diffusionprocess as a function of temperature and time; the domainsize and distribution of photoacid generator moleculeswithin photoresist photoresist in thin films; thesegregation and distribution of small moleculecontaminants, solvents, and moisture in ultrathin polymerlayers; investigation of the anti-reflective coating-photoresistinterface for material sources of compromised line-profilecontrol; development contributions to the measuredline-edge roughness; and the structural characterizationof critical dimensions and line-edge roughness inlithographically-fabricated patterned structures.

Equally important, engineering design depends on accurate property data for the materials that are used. The MSEL Materials Property Measurement Program works toward solutions to measurementproblems, on scales ranging from the macro to thenano, in four of the Laboratory's Divisions (Ceramics,Materials Reliability, Metallurgy, and Polymers). Thescope of its activities goes from the development andinnovative use of state-of-the-art measurement systems, to leadership in the development of standardized test procedures and traceability protocols, to thedevelopment and certification of Standard ReferenceMaterials (SRMs). A wide range of materials is beingstudied, including polymers, ceramics, metals, andthin films (whose physical and mechanical propertiesdiffer widely from the handbook values for their bulkproperties). Projects are directed to innovative new measurement techniques. These include: Measurement of the elastic, electric, magnetic, and thermal properties of thin films and nanostructures(Materials Reliability Division); Alternative strength test methods for ceramics,including cylindrical flexure strength and diametralcompression (Ceramics Division); and Coupling micromechanical test methods with failure behavior of full-scale polymer composites through the use of microstructure-based object-oriented finiteelement analysis (Polymer Division in collaborationwith the Automotive Composites Consortium). The MSEL Materials Property Measurement Program is also contributing to the development of testmethod standards through committee leadership roles in standards development organizations such as ASTMand ISO. In many cases, industry also depends onmeasurements that can be traced to NIST StandardReference Materials (SRMs). This program generatesthe following SRMs for several quite different types of measurements. Charpy impact machine verification (Materials Reliability Division); Hardness standardization of metallic materials(Metallurgy Division); Hardness standardization and fracture toughness ofceramic materials (Ceramics Division); and Supporting the Materials Property Measurements Program is a modeling and simulation effort to connect microstructure with properties. The Object-OrientedFinite-Element (OOF) software developed at NIST isbeing used widely in diverse communities for materialmicrostructural design and property analysis at themicrostructural level. In addition to the activities above, the Materials Reliability, Metallurgy, Ceramics, and Polymers Divisionsprovide assistance to various government agencies on homeland security and infrastructural issues. Projects include assessing the performance of structural steelsas part of the NIST World T rade Center Investigation,advising the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) onmetallurgical issues involving a refurbishment of FolsomDam, advising the Department of the Interior on thestructural integrity of the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial,advising the U.S. Customs Service on materialsspecifications for ceramics, and advising the Architect of the Capitol on repair procedures for cracks in the outer skin of the Capitol Dome. Contact: Gale HolmesProgram Overview34Characterization and Modeling of Failure in Fiber Composites Failure prediction is critical to the use of fiber- reinforced composites in many applications. Multi- fiber composites are being used to conduct fundamental studies into the nucleation of failure in fibrous composites. During this research period, we have prepared our first sets of model 3-D E-glass fiber arrays. Research on these arrays showed that matrix cracks induce more damage to the surrounding matrix resin. Below 50 \u00b5m, fiber-fiber interactions, as quantified by the interfacial shear strength, were found to depend on the inter-fiber spacing. Gale A. Holmes and Charles C. Han During this research year, the first sets of 3-D E-glass fiber arrays were prepared and analyzed (see Figure 1) using sized and un-sized fibers preparedby our industrial collaborators. 3-D arrays are necessaryto provide failure behavior information about fullyconstrained fibers.Damage in these specimens will also be monitored by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Images of themulti-fiber specimens can be found in the \"Multi-modalImaging Using Optical Coherence T omography\" projectsummary. At a fiber spacing of 11 \u00b5m, the breaks in adjacent fibers are not random. Random fiber breaks between fibers occurs when the inter-fiber distance is at least45 \u00b5m (see Figure 3). Figure 1: 3-D Multi-fiber array of sized fibers. The three out of focus fibers are on a plane approximately 70 \u00b5m below the in-focus fibers. Analytical results indicate that matrix cracks induce more damage to the surrounding matrix resin (see Figure 2), with the intensity of the damage beingdependent on the inter-fiber spacing. Initial finite elementresults (not shown) suggest that the most intenseinteraction between the shear bands (see 2001 MSELAnnual Report) emanating from the matrix crack shownin Figure 2 and adjacent fibers occurs at a distance ofapproximately 15 \u00b5m. Figure 2: Pair of sized (a) and un-sized (b) fibers spaced 2 fiber diameters apart. These representative images indicate that matrix cracks induce more damage to the surrounding matrix resin of adjacent fibers.Figure 3: Effect of inter-fiber spacing on randomness of fiber breaks. Note intensity of birefringence pattern between fibers. The interfacial shear strength exhibited by the individual fibers (sized and un-sized) in an array was found to depend, up to 50 \u00b5m, on the inter-fiber spacing. The interfacial shear strength above this valuewas constant (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Interfacial shear strength vs. inter-fiber distance. T wo journal papers are being prepared detailing the results of this research and several supportingpublications have been prepared and submitted. Resultsrelated to the multi-fiber arrays have also been presentedat several conferences (e.g., SAMPE 2002 andANTEC 2002). Contributors and Collaborators G.A. Holmes, C.K. Moon, W .G. McDonough, C.C.

Thus, measurement methods for the characterization of materials structure are a cornerstone of this field. MSEL supports a wide array of techniquesand instrumentation for materials measurements.Facilities include optical and electron microscopy, opticaland electron scattering and diffraction, and major x-rayfacilities at the National Synchrotron Light Source(NSLS) at Brookhaven Laboratory, and at the AdvancedPhoton Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Synchrotron radiation sources provide intense beams of x-rays enabling leading-edge research in a broad range of scientific disciplines. Materials characterizationusing x-rays from synchrotron sources forms a majorpart of the Materials Structure CharacterizationProgram. This includes the development and operationof experimental stations at the NSLS and at the APS.At the NSLS, NIST operates a soft x-ray stationin partnership with Dow and Brookhaven NationalLaboratory. At the APS, NIST is a partner with the University of Illinois at Urbana /Champaign, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and UOP , in collaborationcalled UNICAT . At both facilities, scientists, andresearchers from industry, universities, and governmentlaboratories, perform state-of-the-art measurements ona wide range of advanced materials. Studies currentlyunderway include: ceramic coatings; defect structuresarising during deformation of metals, ceramics, andpolymers; defect structures in semiconductors andsingle-crystal proteins; and atomic-scale and molecular- scale structures at surfaces and interfaces in polymeric, catalytic, and metal/semiconductor systems. Ceramic powders are precursors for over 80% of ceramic manufacturing. As a result, a major focus inthe Ceramics Division is the accurate and reliablemeasurement of the physical and chemical propertiesof ceramic powders, including sub-micrometer andnanometer sized powders. These measurements arecritical to ensuring processes and products of high quality, minimal defects, and consequent economic benefits. Another area of concern to ceramicmanufacturing is powder dispersion in a fluid vehiclefor shape forming and other uses. The chemical andphysical characteristics of powders dispersed in liquidsare evaluated to understand the influence of surfacecharge, dissolution, precipitation, adsorption, and otherphysicochemical processes on the dispersion behavior .In addition to these activities, standard referencematerials for use as primary calibration standards and national/international standards for particle size andsize distribution, pore volume, and particle dispersionmeasurements are being developed in collaboration withindustrial partners, measurement laboratories, andacademic institutions in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The NIST effort in materials characterization has a strong emphasis on electron microscopy, which iscapable of revealing microstructures within modernnanoscale materials and atomic-resolution imaging andcompositional mapping of complex crystal phases withnovel electronic properties. The MSEL microscopyfacility consists of two high-resolution transmissionelectron microscopes (TEM) and a high-resolution,field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) capable of resolving features down to 1.5 nm. Novel experimental techniques using these instruments havebeen developed to study multilayer and nanometer-scalematerials. Through this MSEL Program, measurement methods, data, and standard reference materials(SRMs) needed by the U.S. polymers industry, researchlaboratories, and other federal agencies are provided tocharacterize the rheological and mechanical properties of polymers and to improve polymer processibility. In response to critical industry needs for in-situ measurement methodologies, a substantial effort isunderway to develop optical, dielectric, and ultrasonicprobes for characterizing polymer processing. Improvedmethods for determining molecular mass distributionof polymers are developed because of the dramatic effectit has on processibility and properties. Mechanicalproperties and performance are significantly affectedby the solid-state structure formed during processing. Importantly, unlike many other common engineering materials, polymers exhibit mechanical properties withtime dependent viscoelastic behaviors. As a result,techniques are being developed that measure the solid-state structure and rheological behavior of polymericmaterials. Recent program activities exploit advancesin mass spectrometry using matrix assisted laserdesorption ionization (MALDI) to develop a primarytool for the determination of the molecular masses of synthetic polymers, with particular emphasis on commercially important polyolefins. The polymerindustry and standards organizations assist in theidentification of current needs for SRMs, and based onthese needs, research on characterization methods andmeasurements is conducted leading to the certificationof SRMs. Contact: Chad R. SnyderProgram Overview36Polymer Standards Reference Materials, RM, and Standard Reference Materials, SRM, are produced to address needs of the producers, processors, and users of synthetic polymers for calibration of instruments, assessment of laboratory proficiency, test method development, and materials improvement. Research supports development of standard test methods for characterizing the molecular structure and use properties of polymers that are needed to optimize synthesis of polymers and improve their performance. Bruno Fanconi and Charles Guttman NIST supplies the only polyethylene molecular mass standards for calibration of size exclusion chromatographs, the principal instrument usedby industry to characterize the molecular massdistribution of polymers. This year, we will certifya replacement for SRM 1483, a polyethylene massstandard whose supply will soon be exhausted.Research is conducted in mass spectrometry ofsynthetic polymers to provide industry with bettermethods to measure molecular mass distribution. Previous work on polystyrene resulted in the first polymer molecular mass standard produced withthe complete mass spectrum, measured by massspectrometry, as ancillary data. Based on the successof that work, a collaborative effort was initiated amongstandards laboratories in Europe, the U.S. and Japanto establish a standard protocol for measurementof the mass distribution of polystyrene by massspectrometry. The draft standard method is under final review by the participating organizations. Arrangements have been made to submit the methodto standards developing organizations for acceptanceas a standard method. Three SRMs were produced in the past year that assist polymer producers and processors in makingreliable measurements of the rheological propertiesof polymers. T wo of the SRMs are melt flow ratestandards that are employed to calibrate instruments used to assess the processibility of polymer resins. The NIST melt flow rate standards are referencedin the ASTM standard test method that is widely used to characterize the processibility of polymers.The third SRM, a poly(dimethylsiloxane) fluid,is intended primarily for use in calibration andperformance evaluation of instruments used todetermine the viscosity and first normal stress difference in steady shear, or to determine the dynamic mechanical storage and loss moduli andshift factors through time-temperature superposition.This SRM also serves the needs of instrumentmanufacturers and testing laboratories as asecondary standard for calibrating viscometers. In recognition of the increasing role of synthetic polymers in medical applications, we supply referencematerials for test method development, benchmarking properties, and materials improvement. In response to recommendations of a NIST/Industry workshop onreference materials and data needs for medical use ofpolymers, an activity was initiated to measure materialproperties of acrylic polymers used in intraocular lensesfor generation of reference database and referencematerials. In collaboration with vendors of intraocularlens (IOL) materials, testing laboratories, the NationalInstitutes of Health, and LSU Medical school, data acquisition has commenced on a series of IOL polymers for the purpose of building a reference material databaseand supply of reference IOL biomaterials to aid researchand development of improved materials.

Leigh (Statistical Engineering Division, NIST)Materials Structure Characterization37Polyolefin Mass Spectrometry The mass distribution of a polymer is critical to how they are processed and their resultant properties. Mass spectrometry, MS, is exploited to characterize molecular architecture of saturated hydrocarbon polymers that is difficult, or impossible, to measure by other methods. The work focused on polyolefins, the dominant type of commercial polymer, that exhibit a plethora of molecular architectures owing to advances in synthesis. William E. Wallace Polyethylene and polypropylene dominate the synthetic polymer commercial market. Their dominance has been spurred on by new developments in metallocene catalysts that provide an unprecedented level of synthetic control. A polymer's molecular mass and molecular-mass distribution are critical in determining its performance properties. Mass spectrometry is currently the most promising method for obtaining accurate molecular massand absolute molecular mass distributions. Molecular mass determination by mass spectrometry requires the formation of intact macromolecular ions in the gas phase. This is typically accomplished by the gas-phase association of metal cations (Na+, K+, Cu+, Ag+) with polar or polarizable functional groups on the polymer. Polymers that lack such functional groups (like polyethylene and polypropylene) have not been amenable to mass spectrometric characterization and cannot be analyzed for molecular mass distribution using existing techniques of metal cationization. In the previous year a new method was introduced for the mass spectrometry of saturated polyolefins whereby an organic cation is covalently bonded to the vinyl end-group of the polymer to produce the necessary ionization for the creation of intact gas-phase macromolecules by desorption ionization (MALDI). This year the \"covalent cationization\" methodology was further optimized to produce mass spectra for higher molecular mass materials than hadbeen achieved previously by our group and more than six times greater than found in the literature. (See T echnical Highlight in this report for more details). The Polymers Division has also researched the use of organometallic cationization as a way to create intact gas-phase macromolecular ions of fully saturated materials. Our goal in the past year was to develop the methodology for ionization of saturated hydrocarbon inside the mass spectrometer with minimalfragmentation. We selected the 5-cyclopentadienyl cobalt ion (CpCo\u00b7+) because, unlike the reactive bare transition metal ions, it has been shown to react with short-chain linear alkanes (2 < n < 6) exclusively by dehydrogenation with no evidence of C-C bond cleavage.T o test the feasibility of the CpCo\u00b7+ ion as a charging agent, we conducted reactivity studieswith three medium chain length n-alkanes usingFourier-transform ion cyclotron massspectrometry. We report that the CpCo \u00b7+ ion reacts predominantly by double dehydrogenation of all three alkanes with no C-C bond cleavage observed. The figure below compares mass spectra for ionization of n-octacosane (C-28) by the existingbare (laser mass spectrometry, FTMS).The reaction of C-28 with Co + produces the charged hydrocarbon (adduct) as well as extensive fragmentation. In contrast, the CpCo\u00b7+ ion reaction with C-28 yields the charged hydrocarbon with minimal fragmentation. Our goal for FY03 is to extend the organometallic cationization measurements to low-mass polyolefins. Contributors and Collaborators B.J. Bauer, W .R. Blair, H.C.M. Byrd, B.M. Fanconi, C.M.

By combining magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, the physician diagnoses more effectively than using either technique alone. This same approach is taken in our program on multi-modal imaging of materials. The goal of this work is to gain new insight into material systems by simultaneously imaging structure, function, and dynamics. Multi-modal imaging is anticipated to have the earliest and most direct impact on Division efforts in tissue engineering and composite mechanics. Joy Dunkers and Marcus Cicerone The multi-modal imaging effort is built around a technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT). In short, OCT is a non-invasive, non-contact,highly-sensitive structural technique for three-dimensionalimaging of highly scattering materials using interferometry.Our first generation OCT performed structural imagingonly with an axial (z) resolution of 20 \u00b5m. This past year has been spent implementing the second generationOCT (Figure 1) which not only possesses two typesof functional imaging but also boasts vast improvementsin imaging speed, resolution, and instrument stability. We have increased the data acquisition speed by 50X and the modulator accuracy by 6X by implementing apiezoelectric based fiber modulator.sensitivity inherent in an optical coherence measurement and uses a confocal optical configuration to significantlyimprove the axial resolution over standard OCT . We obtainlateral and axial of 0.5 \u00b5m and 1.0 \u00b5m. Confocal fluorescence microscopy has proven to be a powerful technique for understanding structure-function relationships, especially in the biological fields. The C-FL consists of an air-cooled argon ion laser, optical filters for excitation and emission wavelengthselection, and a photo-multiplier tube detector (Figure 1).In our instrument, fluorescence is collected from a spotwithin the sample that coincides with the near infraredfocal spot. The two types of information are obtainedsimultaneously. If the sample contains fluorescentmarkers that signify particular function, this techniqueyields functional information that is in registration with the structural information from C-OCT . PS-OCT allows us to obtain a quantitative, spatially resolved map of birefringence. Because local structuralstrain or macromolecular orientation can lead to opticalbirefringence, we can quantify these properties. Circularlypolarized light is used in the sample arm to make theresults independent of sample orientation. Detection ofbirefringence is accomplished by monitoring the vertical(s) and horizontal (p) components of the light returningfrom the sample. PS-OCT images (230 \u00b5m wide and 500 \u00b5m high) from a glass fiber and epoxy dogbone (Figure 2) showintact fibers. Birefringence, and therefore residual stress,would manifest itself as an extinction of either polarization.These images show that virtually no residual stressexists with this large fiber spacing, as expected.

This workis being done in collaboration with the University ofPennsylvania. Composite samples prepared at varyingdegrees of dispersion have been investigated usingsmall-angle neurton scattering (SANS), and the shape of the scattering curve as a function of scattered wave vector has been used to extract a quantitative measureof the SWNT dispersion and diameter. T ransmissionelectron microscopy (TEM) has been used to confirmthe extent of dispersion. In the near future, we willmeasure the dielectric spectrum of these polymernano-composites and evaluate in-line dielectricspectroscopy as a tool for quantifying nanotubedispersion in situ during processing. Figure 1: Optical data for a PB/MWNT dispersion (3.5 x 10-3 mass fraction MWNT, T = 40 oC) at a shear rate of 50.0 s-1. Orientation of the tubes along the vorticity direction is evident in the micrograph, in the anisotropy of the hh and vv patterns, and, to a lesser extent, in the orientation of the intensity lobes in the hv and vh patterns. The flow direction is horizontal and the vorticity direction is vertical. The micrograph is 200 \u00b5m wide. Contributors and Collaborators H. Wang, J. Obrzut, D.L. VanderHart, S.D. Hudson, H. Kim, S. Lin-Gibson Characterization Inorganic fillers are frequently used to enhance polymer properties. New attributes may be achieved with exotic nanoparticles, provided that the underlying science is well developed. Both multi- and single-wall carbon nanotubes offer the promise of novel polymer nanocomposites, with potential applications in conducting plastics, reinforced plastics, flame retarding plastics, and novel optical materials. Issues of critical importance are dispersion and alignment, and how these influence bulk physical properties. Erik K. Hobbie, Jack F . Douglas, and Charles C. Han Nanocomposite materials engineered from polymers and carbon nanotubes offer the promise of polymer composites with greatly enhanced electrical, thermal, optical, and structural properties. For example, measurements performed at NIST have recently demonstrated significantly-enhanced flame retardationin polypropylene and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites at loadings of only 1% nanotubes by mass. As inorganic filler in a polymer matrix, the anisotropy of carbon nanotubes makes them structurally unique in that the tube diameter can be the same order of magnitude as the radius of gyration of the polymer , yet the aspect ratio of the tubes can be exceptionally large and the tubes themselves can exhibit extreme mechanical strength. In addition to the resolution of fundamentalissues concerning the fractionation, functionalization, and dispersion of multi- and single-walled carbon nanotubes in a wide array of organic solvents and polymer matrices, efficient bulk processing of nanotube- polymer composites will depend on both a detailed understanding of the response of polymer-nanotube melts to simple steady shear flow and a convenient but quantitative measure of tube dispersion. Investigations involving multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT's) have focused on developing an optical metrology for in situ observations of MWNT's dispersed in polymer melts under simple shear flow. These measurements employ polarized light scattering and optical microscopy to quantify the structural anisotropy of sheared nanotube melts, as shown in Figure 1. The requirement is that the melt be sufficiently dilute or the sample sufficiently thin for optical measurements to be used. We have mapped outthe orientation of the tubes as a function of Deborah number in the suspending medium and observed orientation of the tubes along both the flow direction and the vorticity direction. W e anticipate that these measurements will have applications in the injection molding of conducting plastic parts, for example.40Characterization and Modeling of the Interfaces and Interphases of Polyolefin Blends Process modeling may facilitate design of optimal conditions for processing polymer blends, provided that the complex structure and behavior of these materials are treated adequately. Techniques and methodologies are developed to define and characterize rheological, morphological, and interfacial properties of multiphase polymer blends as a function of processing parameters, such as composition, shear stress, and crystalline structure. Constitutive relationships are formulated for process modeling needs. Charles C. Han, Howard Wang, and Frederick R. Phelan, Jr. During the past year, extensive experimental work has been carried out to understand the effect of blending and thermal history on structure developmentin polyethylene-hexene/polyethylene-butene (PEH/PEB)blends employing both real and reciprocal space techniques.This work represents the first comprehensive investigationof polymer blends that exhibit both liquid phase separationand crystallization. Using phase-contrast optical microscopy, both crystal super-structure growth and phase-separationkinetics were measured in blends of various compositionsat various temperatures. Measurements of crystal-growthkinetics show that blends and pure PEH exhibit similargrowth regimes. Phase-separation in the blends is veryslow, effects dominate thedomain coarsening. Atomic surface can befibrous, spherulitic, or dendritic depending on bothcomposition depth. T ransmission electronmicroscopy reveals bulk semi-crystalline morphologyin more detail. For example, blending with PEB swellsthe inter-lamellae spacing, implying the inclusion ofnon-crystallizable chains within the lamellar stacks.In another example, when a critical blend is allowed tophase separate for an extended period before furtherlowering the temperature for crystallization, distinctlamellar crystals form within the co-existing PEH-richand PEB-rich domains, leading to a morphologycharacterized by hierarchical length scales. Simultaneous small and wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements on crystal growth have been carriedout at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)at Brookhaven National Labs (BNL). Isothermalcrystallization of blends, which follow either a 1-stepquench from a homogeneous melt or a 2-step quenchto an intermediate temperature for phase separationfollowed by a quench to a lower temperature, hasbeen studied extensively.The effect of simple shear flow on crystallites in suspension in polyolefin blends has been investigated using light scattering and microscopy. T o account forboth the structural anisotropy and the flow-inducedorientation, polarized light scattering is employed, withthe polarizer and analyzer set at horizontal (H) and vertical (V) orientations (parallel or perpendicular to the flow direction, respectively). It is found that crystallitesorient along the vorticity direction at low shear rate,whereas at high shear rate, crystal super-structures melt, and the morphology becomes a mixture of large crystallites oriented along the vorticity direction andthin lamellae sheets aligned with the flow direction.After cessation of shear , the crystals aggregate toform necklace structures and hundred-micron sized balls. Simulations of isolated droplets at super-critical capillary numbers in steady, homogeneous shear flowhave also been carried out using a Lattice Boltzmann scheme. The goal is to understand drop breakup mechanisms and develop models for this that can beapplied to complex flows, such as injection molding.It has been observed that a super-critical droplet firstdeforms into an elongated liquid thread with \"dumbbell\" type ends. Sub-critical \"child\" drops pinch off the ends of the thread in a continual process until the depletedoriginal is itself below critical. Results for Ca o = 0.45 (where Ca c = 0.4) are shown in Figure 1, where the final configuration of the new droplet family is observed. There are four drops, all stable, below the criticalCapillary number. There is evidence of a distribution insizes. The initial child drops that are formed are largerthan subsequent ones. Figure 1: The final state for case 1. There are four drops all below critical. The initial \"child\" drops that are formed are larger than the subsequent ones. Contributors and Collaborators K.
