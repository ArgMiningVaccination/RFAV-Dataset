The facility feels like a high-end doctor's office (albeit one with Asian-inflected decor), patients fill out familiar medical history forms, and the office even takes Oxford health insurance. It's traditional in another sense, too, as co-owners Anne Mok and Peggy Regis practice holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine. With certification from the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine, they employ such modalities as acupuncture, cupping, moxibution (a form of heat therapy), tui na (a form of body-work therapy), and herbal medicine to treat everything from musculoskeletal problems and stress to circulatory disorders, infertility, gastrointestinal difficulties, aging skin, smoking cessation, and weight loss. During an initial appointment, clients give their medical history, then Mok or Regis inspects the client's tongue and takes his or her pulse on various places on each wrist in order to make a diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan. The prescribed therapies are then performed to remove whatever stagnation in the body is causing the ailment, and to allow the body's energy to flow better. Massage, aromatherapy, and reflexology are offered for those looking for a more spa-like experience, and Cornerstone also sells a selective line of candles, creams, and teas. "}
