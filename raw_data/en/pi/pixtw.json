The Partnership f or a Healthy C ommunity f ormed an ad h oc committee creating a collaborative team to facilitate the community h ealth need s asse ssment. T his c f rom: Carle Eureka Hospital , Bradley University, Heart of I llinois United W ay, Heartland Health Services, Hopedale Medical C omplex, OSF Saint Francis Medical C enter, Peor ia City/County H ealth Department, Tazewell C ounty Health Department, UnityPoint Health - Central IL, including Methodist Medical Center of Illinois, Pekin Memorial Hospital and Proctor Hospital (hereafter referred to as UnityPoint) and Woodford C ounty Health Department. They conducted the Tri-C ounty community health needs assessment to highlight the health needs and well-b eing of residents in the Tri-C ounty region. Several themes are prevalent in the collaborative community health needs assessment - the dem ographic composition of the Tri-C ounty region, the predictors for and prevalence of diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 4 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022study can be used for strategic decision- making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by PFHC stakeholders, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. This study includes a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publicly available sources as well as private sources of data. Additionally, primary data were collected for the general population and the at- risk or economically disadvantaged population. Areas of investigation included perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to medical care, dental care, prescription medications and mental -health counseling. Additionally, demographic characteristics of respondents were utilized to provide insights into why certain segments of the population responded differently. Ultimately, the identification and prioritization of the most significant health needs in the Tri- County region were identified. Consideration was given to health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issue (i.e., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issue in terms of its relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method, three significant health needs were identified and determined to have equal priority: Healthy Eating /Active Living - defined as healthy eating and active living, access to food and food insecurity Mental Health - defined as depression, anxiety, and suicide Obesity - defined as overweight and obese I. INTRODUCTION Background The Partnership for a Healthy Community (PFHC) is a community -driven effort to improve health and wellness in the Central Illinois Tri- County region. Multiple organizations, sectors, and the public participate in population health planning to identify and prioritize health needs and quality of life issues, map and leverage community resources, and form effective partnerships to implement health improvement strategies in Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford Counties. Using actionable data to identify health needs and priorities, including those related to health disparities, health inequities, and the social determinants of health, members of the PFHC develop subsequent Community Health Improvement Plans. This collaborative effort allows members of the PFHC to share resources, to align strategies to address health needs and to work as partners in improving community health. The current structure of the PFHC, as shown in Figure 1, creates the organizational capacity for multiple stakeholders as well as fostering partnerships to address key strategic health priorities. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 5 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022Figure 1 - Partnership for a Healthy Community - Organization Chart All members of the PFHC ad hoc Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) collaborative team used the collaborative CHNA to prepare Community eeds Assessment Reports. OSF and UnityPoint used the CHNA to prepare and adopt a joint CHNA Report in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section \u00a7501(r) and the final regulations published on December 31, 2014 to implement \u00a7501(r). These requirements are imposed on \u00a7501(c)(3) tax-e xempt hospitals. Additionally, Hopedale Medical C omplex and C arle Eureka Hospital used the CHNA to support the specific populations they serve. Illinois law requires certified l ocal health departments to conduct a CHNA and to complete a community health plan. Peoria City/County H ealth Departm ent, Tazewell C ounty Health Department, and Woodford County Health Department used the CHNA to satisfy the requirements imposed on health departments under 77 Ill. Adm. C ode 600 to prepare an IPLAN. In addition, other PFHC stakeholders used the CHNA to support health identification and improvement planning strategies. The collaborative CHNA takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interests of the community, including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health-n eeds assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the comm unity, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, create a plan, and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. The fundamental ar eas of the CHNA are illustrated in Figure 2.

Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment The collaborative CHNA has been designed to provide necessary information to the PFHC, which includes hospitals, local health departments, clinics and com munity agencies, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as a platform that allows healthcare organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high-p riority c hallenges. By working together, hospitals, clinics, community agencies and health departments will use t his C HNA to improve the quality of health in the Tri-C ounty region. When feasible, data are assessed CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 7 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022longitudinally to identify trends and patterns by comparing with results from the 2019 CHNA and benchmarked with State of Illinois averages. Community Feedback from Previous Assessments The 2019 CHNA and implementation plan were made widely available to the community to allow for feedback. Specifically, the hospital s posted both a full version and a summary version of the 2019 CHNA on their website. In order to encourage written feedback, the hospital s specifically included a section labeled Share Your Feedback and provided instructions regarding how individuals from the community could provide comments to the CHNA. While no written feedback was received by individuals from the community via the available mechanism for the CHNA or implementation plan, verbal feedback was provided by key stakeholders from community -service organizations and incorporated as part of the collaborative process. Community Health Needs Assessment Report Approval OSF, UnityPoint, and Carle Eureka Hospital used the collaborative CHNA to prepare their 2022 CHNA Reports and to adopt implementation strategies to address the significant health needs identified. The Peoria City/County Health Department, Tazewell County Health Department and the Woodford County Health Department used the collaborative CHNA to adopt community health plans to meet IPLAN requirements for local health department certification by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). The Partnership for a Healthy Community is not required to perform a community health needs assessment; however, they are collaborating with the above organizations and using the collaborative CHNA in order to better serve the health needs of the Tri -County region. Hopedale Medical Complex has already completed its community health needs assessment; however, they are collaborating with the above organizations and using the collaborative CHNA in order to better serve the health needs of the Tri-County region. OSF, UnityPoint, Carle Eureka Hospital, Hopedale Medical Complex, the Peoria City/County Health Department, the Tazewell County Health Department the Woodford County Health Department and the Partnership for a Healthy Community are the primary organizations responsible for conducting the CHNA. Implementation strategies will be developed in coordination with other community social service agencies and organizations to address the significant health needs identified. This C HNA Report was approved by the OSF Board of Directors o n July 25, 2022, the P FHC Board on July 28, 2022, and the UnityPoint Board of Directors on August 25, 2022. 2019 C HNA H ealth Needs and I mplementation Plans The 201 9 CHNA f or the Tri -County region identified four significant health need s. These included Healthy Eating/Active Living ( defined as h ealthy eat ing and ac tive living, a nd t heir im pact on obesity, access to food, and f ood inse curity ); Can cer (defined as i ncidence of b reast, l ung and c olorectal c a nd c ancer screenings); ( as d epression, anx iety an d su icide ); and S ubstanc e Use (defined as use of il legal and ab use of legal d rugs, alcohol, a nd to bacco/vaping p roducts) . Specific ac tions w ere taken to ad dress these needs. Detailed discussions o f goals, s trategies to im prove these health need s, and impact can be seen in A PPENDIX 2: A CTIVITIES R ELATED TO 2 019 CHNA P RIORITIZED N EEDS . Note CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 8 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022that numerous challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic had significant impact on these activities. Social Determinants of Health This CHNA incorporates important factors associated with Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). SDOH are important environmental factors, such as where people are born, live, work and play, that affect people's well- being, physical and mental health, and quality of life. According to research conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2030 has identified five SDOH that should be included in assessing community health (Figure 3). Figure 3 Healthy People 2030, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Retrieved January 15, 2022, from https://health.gov/healthypeople/objecti ves-and-data/social -determinants -health Assessment of SDOH is included in the CHNA, as social determinants help contribute to health inequities and disparities. Simply creating interventions without incorporating SDOH will have limited impact on improving community health for people living in underserved or at- risk areas. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 9 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 II. METHODS To complete the compreh ensive community health needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, a study was completed to examine perceptions of the commu nity health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and access to healthcare. Secondary Data Collection Existing secondary statistical data were first used to develop an overall assessment of heal th-related issues in the community. Within each section of the report, there are definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter, there is a section on key takeaways. Based on several retreats, a separate team of health professionals used COMPdata Informatics (affiliated with Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA)) to identify six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, diabetes and infections. In order to define each disease category, modified definitions developed by Sg2 were used. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health -care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health -care leaders with extensive strategic, operatio nal, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Primary Data Collection In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health -needs assessments in the U.S. were assessed to identif y common themes and approaches to collecting community health -needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, a new survey in 2021 was designed for use with both the general population and the at- risk community. To ensure that all critical ar eas were being addressed, the entire collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several fact- finding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups from the Healthcare Collaborative (based at the University of Illinois College of Medicine - Peoria) were used to collect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 10 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. Accessibility to healthcare - to assess the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental -healthcare, as well as access to prescription medication. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to areas such as anxiety anddepression. Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. Social determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may haveon the above- mentioned areas. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. A copy of the final survey is included in APPENDIX 4 : SURVEY . Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the Tri- County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we multiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at- risk population. The poverty rate for Tri -County is 14.2% in Peoria County, 7.6% in Tazewell County and 6.2% in Woodford County. The populations used for the calculation were 176,297, 130,509 and 38,323, respectively, yielding total residents living in poverty in the three counties at 25,034, 9,919 and 2,376, respectively. A normal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution was assumed given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq)/(E2 (N -1) + z2 pq) where: n = the required sample size N = the population size z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) pq = population proportions (set at .05) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/ - .05) CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 11 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 For the total Tri- County area, the minimum sample size for aggregated analyses (combination of at- risk and general populations) was 1,149. The data collection effort for this CHNA yield ed a total of 1,649 usable responses. This exceeded the threshold of the desired 95% confidence interval. To provide a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population for the Tri- County region, the general population was combined with a po rtion of the at- risk population. To represent the at- risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at-risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that th e demography of the county -specific samples were aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a total usable sample of 1,286 respondents for analyzing the aggregate population. Sample characteristics can be seen in APPENDIX 4 : SURVEY . Data Collection Survey data were collected in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Note that versions of both the online survey and paper survey were translated into Spanish. To specifically target the at- risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens. Since the at- risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effor t, this became a stratified sample, as other groups were not specifically targeted based on their socio- economic status. Note that use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias from convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was collected. Specifically, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at the hospital, assuming that patients receiving care represent an unbiased rep resentation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pertaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the community sample and the control sample were compared using t- tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show that the community sample did not exhibit any significance patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sam ple, they are identified in the social -determinants sections of the analyses within each chapter. Data Integrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision -making. Therefore, several tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for cod ing accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were correct. This was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 12 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022Analytic Techniques To ensure statistical validity, several different analytic techniques were used. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' ratings of various health concerns. Additionally, appropriate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, Pearson correlations, X2 tests and tetrachoric correlations were used when appropriate, given characteristics of the specific data being analyzed. Regional Analyses Given the size and diversity of the Tri- County area, 13 regions were identified to provide more detailed analyses. Based on zip codes, there were six regions identified in Peoria County, four regions identified in Tazewell County and three regions identified in Woodford County. Specific regional descriptions and complete results of regional analyses can be seen in APPENDIX 3 : REGIONAL ANALYSES CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 13 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 CHAPTER 1 OUTLINE 1.1 Population 1.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution 1.3 Household/Family 1.4 Economic Information 1.5 Education 1.6 Internet Accessibility 1.7 Key Takeaways from Chapter 1 CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS 1.1 Population Importance of the measure: Population data characterize individuals residing in Peoria County, Tazewell County, and Woodford County. Population data provide an overview of population growth trends and build a foundation for additional analysis of data. Pop ulation Growth Data from the last census indicate the population of Peoria County has decreased between 2017 and 2021. During the same time period, the populations of Tazewell County and Woodford County also decreased, respectively (Figure 4). Figure 4 Source: 2017CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 14 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 20221.2 Age, Gender and Race Distribution Importance of the measure: Population data broken down by age, gender, and race groups provide a foundation to analyze the issues and trends that impact demographic factors including economic growth and the distribution of healthcare services. Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health -care infrastructure and service delivery systems. Age Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate the percentage of individuals in the Tri- County region in each age group. Peoria County had an increase in the elderly population (residents aged 65+ years) of 15% between 2015 and 2019. Tazewell County had an increase of 16% and Woodford County had an increase of 9% between 201 5 and 2019.

Data from 2019 shows that the White population is 69.9%, Black population is 17.6%, and Latino (LatinX) population is 4.1% (Figure 11). Data from 2019 show that both Tazewell and Woodford Counties are largely homogeneous. Data from 2019 suggest that White ethnicity comprises 94% of the population in Tazewell County and 95.3% of the population in Woodford County (Figure 10 and Figure 11). However, the non- White population is inc reasing in Tazewell County (5.8% 6%) and Woodford from 2017 to 2019, respectively.

Because median income is not significantly imp acted by unusually high or low -income values, it is considered a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to lack sufficient income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, h ealth, education and employment conditions. Economic Climate Economic climate is a measure of a community's financial resources and resiliency. Key risk influencers include income, cost of living and opportunity. For Tri- County, 20% of the population is at elevated risk for economic climate. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 35% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Median Income Level For 2019, the median household income in Peoria and Tazewell Counties were lower than the State of Illinois (Figure 17). However, Woodford County had median household incomes above the State of Illinois median.

Below is the poverty rate for all individuals across the Tri- County area for 2019. In Peoria County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty was 19.7%, which is higher than the State of Illinois individual poverty rate of 11.4%. In Tazewell County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty 7.6%, which is significantly lower than the State of Illinois poverty rate of 11.4%. In Woodford County, the percentage of individuals living in poverty is 6.2%, which is also significantly lower than the State of Illinois poverty rate of 11.4% (Figure 19). Figure 19 Source: US Census 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics1, \"The better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income.\" Research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful one is in school, the better one's health will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. Accordingly, years of education is strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. 1 NCES 2005 Peoria County Tazewell County Woodford County State 7.6% 6.2%11.4%Individual Poverty Rate Tri-County 2019 CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 24 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 High School Graduation Rates Students who entered 9th grade in 2021 in Peoria County school districts, except Peoria HS, Manual Academy, Limestone Community HS, Il Valley Central HS, Illini Bluffs HS and Farmington HS reported high school graduation rates that were comparable to the State average of 86% (Figure 20).

Therefore, accessibility to healthcare must address both the associated financial costs and the supply and demand of medical services. Choice of Medical Care Survey respondents were asked to select the type of health -care facility used when sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent- care facility, health department, no medical treatment and other. The most common response for source of medical care was clinic/doctor's office, chosen by 67% of survey respondents. This was followed by urgent care (20%), not seeking medical attention (11%), the emergency department (2%) and the health department (0%) (Figure 24). CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 29 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 24 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Clinic/doctor's office use decreased by 8% compared to 2019, while use of urgent care increased by 5%, While emergency department use remained the same, those choosing not to seek care increased by 2%. Social Determinants Related to Choice of Medical Care Several factors show significant relationships with an individual's choice of medical care. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Clinic/Doctor's Office tends to be used more often by women, older people, White people, those with higher income and people from Tazewell County. Clinic/Doctor's office tends to be used less often by Black people, people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment and people from Peoria County. Urgent Care tends to be used more by younger people and Black people. Urgent care tends to be used less by White people. Emergency Department tends to be used more often by Black people, less educated people, those with lower incomes, Peoria County residents and people with an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment.

Insurance Coverage According to survey data, 69% of the residents are covered by commercial/employer insurance, followed by Medica id (15%) and Medicare (13%). Only 3% of respondents indicated they did not have any health insurance (Figure 25). CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 31 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 25 Source: CHNA Survey Data from the survey show that for the 3% individuals who do not have insurance, the most prevalent reason was cost (Figure 26).

Private insurance is used less by Woodford County residents. No Insurance tends to reported more often by those with lower income. Access to Care In the CHNA survey, respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed care but were not able to get it?\" Access to four types of care were assessed: medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling. Survey results show that 10% of the population did not have access to medical care when needed; 12% of the population did not have access to prescription medication when needed; 19% of the population did not have access to dental care when needed; and 20% of the population did not have access to counseling when needed (Figure 27).

Access to dental care tends to be rated lower for residents who live in the Bartonville/Limestone region and the North Tazewell County region. Access to counseling tends to be rated lower for residents who live in South Tazewell County region. Reasons for No Access - Medical Care Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get medical care when needed were asked a follow -up question. The leading cause of the inability to gain access to medical care was too long to wait for an appointment (55), could not afford co -pay (41) and no insurance (37) (Figure 28). Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 34 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 28 Source: CHNA Survey Reasons for No Access - Prescription Medication Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get prescription medication when needed were asked a follow -up question.

Transportation Network Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care . Key risk influencers include access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility, for the Tri- County region, 14% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network . This is higher to the State of Illinois average of 6% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.2 Wellness Importance of the measure: Preventative health -care measures, including getting a flu shot, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and undertaking screenings for diseases are essential to combating morbidity and 58 52 51 39 31 28 23 22 17Causes of Inability to Access Counseling Tri-County 2022 Wait Too Long Could Not Afford Co-Pay Could Not Find No Trust Embarrassment No Insurance Counselor Refused Insurance Discrimination Transportation CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 37 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 mortality while reducing health -care costs. The overall health of a community is impacted by preventative measures including immunizations and vaccinations. Frequency of Flu Shots Figure 32 shows that the percentage of people who have had a flu shot in the past year increased for Peoria County (40.9%) for 2015- 2019 compared to 30.7% for 2010 -2014. Tazewell County had an increase from 2014 (35%) to 2015- 2019 (41.2%). Woodford County experienced a minimal decrease from 2014 (37%) to 2015- 2019 (36.1%). During the same timeframe, the State of Illinois realized a decrease of flu immunizations. Note that data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Cancer Screening Early detection of cancer may greatly improve the probability of successful treatment. In the case of colorectal cancer, early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent cancer. Specifically, four types of cancer screening were measured: breast, cervical, prostate and colorectal. Results from the CHNA survey show that 70% of women had a breast screening in the past five years and 72% of women had a cervical screening. For men, 35% had a prostate screening in the past five years. For women and men over the age of 50, 63% had a colorectal screening in the last five years (Figure 35). CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 40 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 35 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Cancer screening were similar from 2019 to 2022. Specifically, in 2019, 72% of women had a breast screening in the past five years compared to 70% in 2022. For men, in 2019 36% reported they had a prostate screening in the past five years compared to 35% in 2022. For women and men over the age of 50, 61% had a colorectal screening in the last five years in 2019, compared to 63% in 2022. Note this was the first year that cervical screening was measured, so there is no comparison to 2019. Social Determinants Related to Cancer Screenings Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with cancer screening. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Breast screening tends to be more likely for older women, White women, those with a higher level of education, those with higher income and those from Tazewell County. Breast cancer screening tends to be lower for those in an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment and those from Peoria County.

Healthy Eating A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase physical, mental and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Two -thirds (67%) of residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 5% (Figure 38). CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 44 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 38 Source: CHNA Survey Those individuals who indicated they do not eat any fruits or vegetables were asked a follow up question.

Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and education. For the Tri- County region, 16% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy . This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.3 Understanding Food Insecurity Importance of the measure: It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. Prevalence of Hunger Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" The vast majority of respondents indicated they do not go hungry (97%); however, 3% indicate they go hungry between 1 and 5 days per week (Figure 41). 26%44% 24% 6%Follow Your Restricted Diet Tri-County 2022 Never Sometimes Usually Always CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 47 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 41 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 In 2022 results show a slight decrease in those who report going hungry.

Figure 42 Source: CHNA Survey Food Landscape Food landscape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access health, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordability and literacy. For the Tri- County region, 22% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape . This i s lower than the State of Illinois average of 25%. (SocialScape \u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). 2.4 Physical Environment Importance of the measure: According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly em itted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relationship between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised h ealth has been well documented. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, asthma and other adverse pulmonary effects. The APPM for the Tri- County region (11.5) , which is the same as the State average (Figure 43). 93% 3% Grocery Store Fast food Food pantry Farm/garden Food delivery Convenience store Gas station CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 49 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 43 Source: County Health Rankings 2021 2.5 Health Status Importance of the measure: Self-perceptions of health can provide important insights to help manage population health. Not only do self -perceptions provide benchmarks regarding health status, but they can also provide insights into how accurately people perceive their own health. Mental Health The survey asked respondents to indicate specific issues, such as depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 42% indicated they did not feel depressed in the last 30 days (Figure 44) and 48% indicated they did not feel anxious or stressed (Figure 45). 11.9 12.1 11.9 11.5Air Pollution -Particulate Matter Tri-County 2020 Peoria County Tazewell County Woodford County State of Illinois CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 50 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 44 Source: CHNA Survey Figure 45 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results of the 2022 CHNA show a 12% increase in the number of people experiencing depression, compared to 2019.

In this way, health -care organizations can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. CHNA survey data show 89% of respondents do not smoke (Figure 50) and 96% of respondents do not vape (Figure 51). 2022 None 1 to 4 times per day 5 to 8 times per day 9 to 12 times per day More than 12 times per day CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 57 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 51 Source: CHNA Survey Comparison to 2019 CHNA Results improved for the percentage of people who smoke, where 87% of people did not smoke in 2019 and 89% do not smoke in 2022. Social Determinants Related to Smoking or Vaping Multiple characteristics show significant relationships with smoking or vaping.

Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youth, leading to increased usage of controlled substances in adult years. Accordingly, the substance abuse values and behaviors of high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Youth Substance Abuse Data from the 2020 Illinois Youth Survey measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs - mainly marijuana) among adolescents. Peoria County is at or below State averages in all categories among 8th graders. Tazewell County is above State averages in all categories among 8th graders. Woodford County is at state averages in all categories among 8th graders except for one category which it is slightly higher: illicit (Figure 52). Figure 52 Source: University of Illinois Center for Prevention Research and Development Among 12th graders, Peoria County is at or below State averages in all categories except marijuana and illicit. Tazewell County is at or below State averages in all categories except inhalants and marijuana among 12th graders. Woodford County is at or below State averages in all categories among 12th graders (Figure 53).

Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within the Tri- County region . The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Il linois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998 -2000 exceeded $3.4 billion, ranking Illino is 6th in the nation for obesity -attributed medical costs. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity -related illnesses contribute to work er absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year. In Peoria County, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight has increased slightly over the years from 2010- 2014 to 2015- 2019. Tazewell County has seen a decrease in the number of people diagnosed with being overweight and obese going from 66.1% to 64.8% in 2019. Woodford County has also seen a decrease in 2010 -2014 from 69.4% to 64.8% in 2015- 2019. Note specifically that the percentage of obese and over weight people has increased from 63.7% to 65.7% for the State of Illinois. Data have not been updated by the Illinois Department of Public Health. However, note in the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was their most prevalentl y diagnosed health condition.

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. 4.1 Self -Identified Health Conditions Survey respondents were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight (33%) was significantly higher than any other health conditions (Figure 62). This percentage is significantly lower than secondary sources. Specifically, BRFSS data indicate that roughly two -thirds of the population is overweight or obese. Most other self -identified morbidities reflected existing sources of secondary data accurately (e.g., diabetes 9%). CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 67 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 62 Source: CHNA Survey 4.2 Healthy Babies Importance of the measure: Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and children. Screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important asp ects of healthy babies. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. Low Birth Weight Rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Peoria County increased from 2016 (9%) to 2020 (10.0%). The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Tazewell County decreased from 2016 (7%) to 2020 (6.0%). The percentage of babies born with low birth weight in Woodford County has remained stable (6.0%) between 2016 and 2020 (Figure 63). 33% 20% 15% 9%8%7%4% 3%1%Health Conditions Tri-County Overweight Allergy Asthma/COPD Diabetes Heart Memory Cancer Stroke CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 68 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 63 Source: County Health Rankings 4.3 Cardiovascular Disease Importance of the measure: Cardiovascular disease is defined as all diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic (also known as coronary) heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis. Coronary Atheroscle rosis Coronary Atherosclerosis, sometimes -called hardening of the arteries, can slowly narrow and harden the arteries throughout the body. When atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart, it is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death for Americans. Most of these deaths are from heart attacks caused by sudden blood clots in the heart's arteries. The number of cases of coronary atherosclerosis complication at Tri- County area hospitals has greatly fluctuated b etween 2018 and 2020 (Figure 64). Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admissions and do not reflect out- patient treatments and procedures.

Note that hospital -level data only show hospital admis sions and do not reflect outpatient treatments and procedures. Figure 69 Source: COMPdata Informatics 2021 4.4 Respiratory Importance of the measure: Disease of the respiratory system includes acute upper respiratory infections such as influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, emphysema and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). These conditions are characterized by breathlessness, wheezing, ch ronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections and chest tightness. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully controlled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not have access to adequate medical care are likely to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency room and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. Asthma The percentage of residents that have asthma in the Tri- County area has decreased in Tazewell and Woodford and increased in Peoria County between 2010 -2014 and 2015- 2019. State averages have decreased from 13.8% to 8.2% (Figure 70).

Woodford County reports significantly higher rates of prostate cancer than the State of Illinois. Figure 72 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health - Cancer in Illinois 4.6 Diabetes Importance of the measure: Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and amputations and is a leading contributor to strokes and heart attacks. It is estimated that 90 -95% of individuals with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult- onset diabetes). Only 5 -10% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes (previously known as juvenile diabetes). Inpatient cases of Type II diabetes from the Tri- County increased between 2018 (608) and 2019 (661) with a dramatic drop in 2020 (579 ) (Figure 73).

These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma- inducing issues. Unintentional injuries can occur, in part, from violent crimes. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 79 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022Suicide The number of suicides in the Tri- County region indicate higher incidence than State of Illinois averages for 2020 (Figure 78). Note that IDPH data for Woodford County is not reported, as IDPH does not report the number of suicides in a county if 11 or less. Figure 78 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Violent Crimes Violent crimes are defined as offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Violent crime is represented as an annual rate per 100,000 people. The number of violent crimes remained consistent between 2016 and 2020 (Figure 79).

To accomplish this, community perceptions of health issues, unhealthy behaviors and issues related to well -being were first considered. Key takeaways from each chapter were then used to identify important health -related issues in the community. Next, a comprehensive inventory of community resources was completed; and finally, the most significant health needs in the community are prioritized. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude in the community; (2) severity in the community; (3) potential for impact to the community. 5.1 Perceptions of Health Issues The CHNA survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health issues in the community. Respondents had a choice of 11 different options. The health issue that rated highest was mental health (23%), followed by obesity/overweight (16%) and viruses (12%) (Figure 80). These three factors were significantly higher than other categories based on t- tests between sample means. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases. For example, mental health is a significant issue in the Tri- County area. Also, obesity is an important concern and the survey respondents accurately identified these as important health issues. However, some perceptions were inaccurate. For example, while heart disease is a leading cause of mortality, it is ranked relatively low. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 83 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022Figure 80 Source: CHNA Survey 5.2 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 10 choices. The three unhealthy behaviors that rated highest were drug abuse (illegal) at 30%, drug abuse (legal) at 15% and anger/violence at 14% (Figure 81).

The issues impacting well- being that rated highest was healthy food choices (16%) and access to healthcare (16%) (Figure 82). Figure 82 Source: CHNA Survey 5.4 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter -by-chapter summary of key takeaways is used to provide a foundation for identification of the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways include magnitude in the community, strategic importance to the community, existing community resources and potential for impact and trends and future forecasts. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Four factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the demographic analyses: Population decreased Population over age 65 increased Single female head-o f-house-h ousehold represents a significant percentage of the population Graduation rates are concerning in almost all of the Tri-C ounty high schools P revention Behaviors (Chapter 2) - Seven factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on prevention behaviors: 1%2%5%7%8%9%11%12%13%16%16%Perceptions of Issues that Impact Well Being Tri-County 2022 Healthy Food Choices Access to Healthcare Safer Neighborhoods Less Hatred Less Violence Job Opportunities Affordable Clean Housing Less Poverty Available Child Care Public Transportation Better School AttendanceCHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 85 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Decreased utilization of doctors/clinics Access to counseling decreased Prostate screening is relatively low Exercise and healthy eating behaviors Health literacy Depression and stress/anxiety COVID -19 issues Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Two factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on symptoms and predictors: Substance abuse Overweight and obesity Morbidity and Mortality (Chapter 4) - Four factors were identified as the most important areas of impact from the chapter on morbidity/mortality behaviors: Cancer rates Suicide rates Cancer, heart disease and COVID -19 are the leading causes of mortality Sexually transmitted infections (in Peoria County) Potential Health -Related Needs Considered for Prioritization Before the prioritization of significant community health -related needs was performed, results were aggregated into potential categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the potential areas considered are: 1)Access to care 2)Cancer 3)Healthy eating and active living (including access to food) 4)Mental health (including anxiety and depression) 5)Obesity 6)Substance use 5.5 Community Resources After summarizing potential categories for prioritization in the Community Health Needs Assessment, the PFHC CHNA steering committee reduced a list of 15 potential health needs to 6 potential health using the PEARL approach from the Hanlon Method. A comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 6 health -related areas were being addressed. A resource matrix can be seen in APPENDIX 5 : CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS relating to the 6 health -related issues. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 86 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022There are numerous forms of resources in the community. They are categorized as recreational facilities, county health departments, community agencies and area hospitals/clinics. A detailed list of community resources and descriptions appears in APPENDIX 6 : RESOURCE MATRIX . 5.6 Significant Needs Identified and Prioritized In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue); (2) severity of the issues in terms of their relationship with morbidities and mortalities; (3) potential impact through collaboration. Using a modified version of the Hanlon Method (as seen in APPENDIX 8 : PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY ), and supplementary information on health needs (as seen in APPENDIX 8 : PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY ), a group comprised of diverse representation from the community identified three significant health needs and considered them equal priorities: Healthy Eating / Active Living - defined as healthy eating and active living , access to food and food insecurity Mental Health - defined as depression, anxiety and suicide Obesity - defined as overweight and obese HEALTHY EATING / ACTIVE LIVING HEALTHY EATING . A healthy lifestyle, comprised of a proper diet, has been shown to increase ph ysical, mental, and emotional well -being. Consequently, nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Two -thirds (67%) of Tri -County residents report no consumption or low consumption (1 -2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables per day. Note that the percentage of Tri- County residents who consume five or more servings per day is only 5%. According to survey results, for those respondents who do not consume fruits and vegetables, the leading causes are eating fruits and vegetables is not important; and dislike of fruits and vegetables. Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be rated lower for residents who live in the Peoria/West Peoria region. ACTIVE LIVING . A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase physical, mental, and emotional well -being. Consequently, regular physical activity is critical to preventative care. Note that 28% of respondents in the Tri- County region indicated that they do not exercise at all, and 32% of residents exercise only 1 -2 times per week. Note the Healthy People 2030 target for adults that do not exercise is 21.2%. According to survey results, for those respondents that do not exercise, th e leading causes for not exercising too tired, no time and dislike for exercise. Frequency of exercise tends to be rated lower for residents who live in the Eastern Woodford County region. ACCESS TO FOOD A ND FOOD INSECURITY . It is essential that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. In the Tri- County CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 87 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022region, approximately 3% of residents go hungry at least 1 -2 times per week. Prevalence of Hunger tends to be rated higher for residents who live in the Peoria/West Peoria region and residents who live in the Eastern Woodford County region. Mental Health Mental health was rated as the most important health issue in the community (23%). According to the CHNA survey, 41% o f respondents talked to someone about their mental health in the last 30 year . D EPRESSION AND ANXIETY . The CHNA survey asked respondents to indicate prevalence of specific issues, namely depression and stress/anxiety. Of respondents, 58% indicated they felt depressed in the last 30 days and 52% indicated they felt anxious or stressed. Results from the 2022 CHNA show a 12% increase in the number of people experiencing depression, compared to 2019. Similarly, results from the 2022 CHNA show a 12% increase in the number of people experiencing stress / anxiety, compared to 2019. Respondents were also asked if they spoke with anyone about their mental health in the last 30 days. Of respondents 41% indicated that they spoke to someone, the most common response was to a counselor (43%). In regard to self -assessment of overall mental health, 16% of respondents stated they have poor overall mental health. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that mental health was the most important health issue (23%). Depression tends to be rated higher by women, younger people, and those with lower income. Additionally, depression tends to be rated higher for residents who live in the Peoria/West Peoria region and Northern, Southern and Eastern Tazewell County. In general, depression is rated lower for residents who live in Woodford County. Anxiety tends to be rated higher by women, Black people, and younger people, Additionally, anxiety tends to be rated higher for residents who live in the Northern Peoria/Peoria Heights region. S UICIDE . The number of suicides Pe oria and Ta zewell Counties indicate higher incidences than State of Illinois averages for 2020. Note that IDPH data for Woodford County is not reported, as IDPH does not report the number of suicides in a county if 11 or less. Obesity Nearly two -thirds of Tri -County residents are overweight or obese. In the Tri- County region, the number of people diagnosed with obesity and being overweight is near State averages in all counties, ranging from 64.6% to 64.8%. Overweight and obesity rates in Illinois have increased from 63.7% in 2009 to 65.7% in 2019. Moreover, survey responden ts were asked to self -identify any health conditions. Note that being overweight was significantly higher than any other health conditions. In the 2022 CHNA survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was the second most important health issue and was rated as the most prevalently diagnosed health condition. Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within the Tri-County. The U.S. Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest- growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure and asthma. Adverse CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 88 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems due to weakened joints and lower bone density. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation. Obesity impacts educational performance as well; studies suggest school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher than that of non- obese children. With adults, obesity has far -reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity - related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates. A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed workdays by obese employees than non- obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per year.

CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 131 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 APPENDIX 8: PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY 5-Step Prioritization of Community Health Issues Step 1 . Review Data for Potential Health Issues Step 2 . Briefly Discuss Relationships Among Issues Step 3 . Apply \"PEARL\" Test from Hanlon Method2 Screen out health problems based on the following feasibility factors: Propriety - Is a program for the health problem appropriate? Economics - Does it make economic sense to address the problem? Acceptability - Will a community accept the program? Is it wanted? Resources - Is funding available for a program? Legality - Do current laws allow program activities to be implemented? Step 4 . Use Voting Technique to Narrow Potential Issues Prioritize Issues. Use a weighted -scale approach (1 -5 scale) to rate remaining issues based on: 1. Magnitude - size of the issue in the community. Considerations include, but are not limited to: - Percentage of general population impacted - Prevalence of issue in low -income communities - Trends and future forecasts 2. Severity - importance of issue in terms of relationships with morbidities, comorbidities and mortality. Considerations include, but are not limited to: - Does an issue lead to serious diseases/death - Urgency of issue to improve population health 3. Potential for impact through collaboration - can management of the issue make a difference in the community? Considerations include, but are not limited to: - Availability and efficacy of solutions - Feasibility of success 2 \"Guide to Prioritization Techniques.\" National Connection for Local Public Health (NACCHO) CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 132 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 APPENDIX 9: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PRIORITIZATION - Access To Care National Target Data Healthy People 2030 aims to reduce the portion of individuals who cannot get medical care when needed to 3.3%.

Neighborhood and Built Environment According to the County Health Rankings, Air Pollution - Particulate Matter (APPM) is the average daily density of f ine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a county. Fine particulate matter is defined as particles of air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases are emitted from power plants, manufacturing facilities and automobiles. The relationship between elevated air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter and ozone, and compromised health has been well docume nted. Negative consequences of ambient air pollution include decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and other adverse pulmonary effects. The APPM for the Tri- County region (11.5) is slightly higher than the State average of 11.5 .

The most cited reasons for not eating fruits and vegetables were \"not important\" and \"I don't like\". Note that this only represents a small sample of the survey population and is displayed in frequencies rather than percentages. A healthy lifestyle, comprised of regular physical activity, has been shown to increase p hysical, mental, and emotional well -being. Specifically, 28% of respondents indicated that they do not exercise at all, while the majority (60%) of resident's exercise 1 -5 times per week (Figure 3).

East Region scored below the tri- county area for exercise Focus Group Data Challenges to staying health across all counties included: Unhealthy eating/lack of health literacy around eating/lack of access to healthy food Lack of providers for preventative care Other challenges included: Lack of healthcare for women with a particular emphasis on having more female providers (Woodford), lack of dental providers (Tazewell), lack of exercise (Peoria) or safe spaces to ride bikes (Tazewell). Challenges to accessing healthcare included: Lack of transportation Lack of insurance/fear of cost Long wait times to see PCP and longer wait times for specialist care Other challenges included a lack of diverse providers and providers who listen (Peoria), a lack of interpreters and who speak the same dialect (Peoria and Tazewell), and prejudice in the healthcare systems (Peoria and Tazewell). Social Determinants of Health Data Education Access and Quality Students who entered 9th grade in 2021 in Peoria County school districts, except Peoria HS, Manual Academy, Limestone Community HS, Il Valley Central HS, Illini Bluffs HS and Farmington HS reported high school graduation rates that were comparable to the State average of 86%. Students who entered 9th grade in 2021 in Tazewell County school districts, except East Peoria and Delavan HS reported high school graduation rates that were comparable to the State average of 86%. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 149 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Students who entered 9th grade in 2021 in Woodford County school districts, except Eureka HS, Low Point- Washburn JR SR HS and Roanoke -Benson HS reported high school graduation rates that were comparable to the State average of 86%. Economic Stability Assessing food insecurity is an essential measure to ensure that everyone has access to food and drink necessary for living healthy lives. Food insecurity exists when people don't have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. Respondents were asked, \"How many days a week do you or your family members go hungry?\" Most respondents indicated they do not go hungry (97%); however, 3% indicate they go hungry between 1 and 5 days per week . Neighborhood and Built Environment Food landscape is a measure of the conditions that affect the ability of residents to access health, affordable nutrition. Key risk influencers include accessibility, affordability, and literacy. For the TriCounty region, 22% of the population is at elevated risk for food landscape. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 25% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) . Tri- County Regions of Concern Frequency of exercise Tends to be rated higher for men, those with higher education, those with higher income and people from an unstable (e.g., homeless) housing environment. Rated lower for residents who live in the Eastern Woodford County region. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 150 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Consumption of fruits and vegetables Tends to be more likely for older people, those with a higher level of education and those with higher income. Consumption of fruits and vegetables tends to be less likely for Black people, and lower for residents who live in the Peoria/West Peoria region. MENTAL HEALTH National Target Data Healthy People 2030 aims to increase the proportion of adults with serious mental illness get the treatment they need from 64.1% to 68.8% (2018). Healthy People 2030 aims to increase the proportion of children with mental health problems who get treatment from 73.3% to 82.4% (2018). Healthy People 2030 aims to reduce the suicide rate from 13.9 to 12.8 suicide per 100,000 population (2019). Community Status Assessment Data The CHNA survey asked respondents to self -assess their overall mental health status which is displayed in Figure 1. \"Good\" mental health status fell over 73% between 2016 and 2022 from 72% down to 19%. In 2019, only 8% of respondents answered \"Poor\", and in 2022 that number doubled to 16%. Figure 2 examines how often respondents have felt depressed in the past 30 days. 58% stated that they felt depressed at least 1 to 2 days in the past 30 days, and 11% of respondents feeling depressed more than 5 days in the past 30 days. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 151 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Figure 3 examines the prevalence of anxiety and stress among respondents in the previous 30 days. 52% stated that they felt anxious or stressed at least 1 to 2 days in the past 30 days. 10% of individuals experienced anxiety or stress more than 5 days in the past 30 day s. Results of the 2022 CHNA show a 12% increase in the number of people experiencing depression, compared to 2019. Similarly, results of the 2022 CHNA show a 12% increase in the number of people experiencing stress / anxiety, compared to 2019.

Focus Group Data Challenges to staying mentally healthy among the tri- count y area included: stigma, unstable home environment, and lack of teacher training to recognize symptoms. Challenges associated with ac cessing mental health services among the tri- county area included: lack of knowledge or resources, lack of providers and diverse providers (people of color, multiple languages, LGBTQ+ friendly), lack of inpatient beds, lack of money, lack of insurance, and lack of transportation. Soci al Determinants of Health Data Health Care Assess and Quality (CHNA Survey Data) Peoria County has a higher rate of mental health providers per 100,000 population than the State of Illinois. Tazewell and Woodford both have lower rates than the state and national level.

Healthy People 2030 has a goal to increase the proportion of public schools with a counselor or social worker which is still in the research phase Health Literacy Health literacy is a measure of factors in the community that impact healthcare access, navigation and adherence. Key risk influencers include culture, demographics and education. For the Tri- County region, 16% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) Social and Community Context 59% of the Tri -county population identified that they have been able to talk with someone about their mental health, while 41% did not. Of those that spoke to someone about their mental health, 43% spok e to a counselor, 34% spoke to family or friends, and 23% spoke to a doctor or nurse. 251 189 29245229 Peoria Tazewell Woodford State of IL United StatesMental Health Provider Rate per 100,000 population, 2016 -2018 HCI Conduent CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 155 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Economic Stability Survey respondents who reported they were not able to get counseling when needed were asked a follow -up question. The leading causes of the inability to gain access to counseling were the wait was too long (58), inability for afford co -pay (52) and could not find counselor (51) . Neighborhood and Built Environment Another factor in accessing mental health care is transportation. Transportation network is a measure of the adequacy of the transportation network to facilitate access to care. Key risk influencers include access and proximity to resources. While survey data indicate transportation was not a leading cause of inaccessibility, for the Tri- Coun ty region, 14% of the population is at elevated risk for transportation network. This is higher to the State of Illinois average of 6% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022) Tri- County Regions of Concern Depression tends to be rated higher for residents who live in the Peoria/West Peoria region and Northern, Southern and Eastern Tazewell County. Anxiety tends to be rated higher for residents who live in the Northern Peoria/Peoria Heights region.

HP 2030 Reduce the proportion of adults with obesity to 36.0%. HP 2030 Increase the proportion of health care visits by adults with obesity that include counseling on weight loss, nutrition, or physical activity to 32.6%. HP 2030 Increase the proportion of women who had a healthy weight before pregnancy to 47.1%. Community Status Assessment Data Peoria County has seen an increase in the number of people diagnosed as overweight or obese from 2010 -2014 to 2015- 2019 from 64.4% to 64.6%. Tazewell County has seen a decrease in the number of people diagnosed with being overweight and obese from 2010 -2014 to 2015- 2019 from 66.1% to 64.8%. Woodford County has also seen a decrease from 2010 -2014 to 2015- 2019 from 69.4% to 64.8%. For the State of Illinois, the percentage of obese and overweight people has increased from 63.7% to 65.7% with all three counties being slightly below the State of Illinois. Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System In the 2022 CHNA Survey, respondents indicated that being overweight was their most prevalently diagnosed health condition. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 157 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Source: CHNA Survey Supplemental Conduent's Healthy Communities Institute (HCI) Data Peoria County : scored below other counties in Illinois for adults 20+ who are obese. Region 2, 3, 4 & 5 scored below the county for adults who are obese. Region 6 scored above the county for adults who are obese. Tazewell County: has an obese population of 29.9%. Region East, North, South & West scored above the county for adults who are obese Woodford County: scored below other counties in Illinois for adults 20+ who are obese. Region Central, East, & West scored above the county for adults who are obese. Social Determinants of Health Data Health Care Access and Quality According to a 2016 paper, various studies indicate that weight bias and discrimination in the healthcare setting can lead to negative outcomes for patients. This paper found that around 79% of people who are overweight or obese report eating more to cope with weight discrimination and around 52% of women report their weight as a barrier to receiving healthcare. Weight bias can lead to disordered eating, avoiding preventative care, gaining weight and having negative healthcare experiences. Education Access and Quality According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children aged 2 -19 years the prevalence of obesity decreased as household education level increased. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 158 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Adult s with college degrees have a lower prevalence of obesity, but this can differ by sex and race/ethnicity (CDC). Social and Community Context Involves relationships, specifically positive ones. Positive relationships at home, work, and in the community can help reduce negative health impacts on individuals. Economic Stability According to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health there are direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of obesity and obesity -related conditions. Direct costs involve outpatient and inpatient health services, lab and radiological tests and drug therapy. Indirect costs are harder to measure, but include the categories of value of lost work, insurance, and wages. The CDC estimates the annual cost of obesity in the United States (U.S.) was $147 billion in 2008. Medical costs were $1,429 higher for obese individuals compared to those with a healthy weight. The prevalence of obesity decreases in adolescents aged 2 -19 years as income level increases (CDC). Neighborhood and Built Environment National data provides evidence that greater walkability in residential neighborhoods may lead to lower child BMI and obesity. According to a study by Kaiser Permanente, barriers to walkability include lack of sidewalks, vehicles not obeying speed limits, distracted drivers, crime and lack of places to walk to. Substance Use National Target Data (Healthy People 2030): Reduce the portion of adults who used drugs in the past month to 12% . Reduce the proportion of adults who use marijuana daily or almost daily to 3.4%. Reduce the proportion of people aged 21 years and over engaged in binge drinking in the past mont h to 25.4%. Reduce the proportion of motor vehicle crash deaths that involve a drunk driver in the past year to 28.3%. Reduce the proportion of people who misused prescription drugs in the past year 3.6%. Reduce drug overdose deaths to 20.7 per 100,000. Reduce the proportion of adolescents who drank alcohol in the past month to 6.3%. Reduce the proportion of adolescents who used drugs in the past month to 5.5%. Reduce the proportion of adolescents who used marijuana in the past month to 5.8%. CHNA 2022 | Partnership for a Healthy Community 159 Collaboration for sustaining health equity 2022 Reduce the proportion of people under 21 years who engaged in binge drinking in the past month to 8.4%. Community Status Assessment Data The CHNA helped to identify the typical daily usage of several substances in the Tri- County area including alcohol, prescription medication, marijuana and illegal substances. Alcohol is consumed by 23% of respondents on a typical day, while all other substances (prescription medication, marijuana, and illegal substances) had 8% or less usage on a typical day. In the CHNA, drug abuse (illegal) at 30% and drug abuse (legal) at 15% were the two top perceived unhealthy behaviors. For this same measure, alcohol abuse was the 5th out of 10 at 10%.

Social Determinants of Health Data Health Care Access and Quality 69% of the Tri -County population used a clinic or doctor office for care. (CHNA Survey Data) 13.3% of the Tri -County population reported no access to medical care. (CHNA Survey Data) 11.6% of the Tri -County population receive Medicaid Insurance, with 20% of that population being Peoria County. (CHNA Survey Data) 2.7% of the Tri -County population reported have no insurance. (CHNA Survey Data) Survey respondents reported too long of wait for inability to access medical care and counseling services and cou ld not afford co- pay regarding access to dental care and prescriptions. (CHNA Survey Data) Health literacy For the Tri- County region, 16% of the population is at elevated risk for health literacy. This is lower than the State of Illinois average of 34% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022).

(CHNA Survey Data) Healthy People 2030 aims to decrease the proportion of adolescents and young people who are not in school or working to 10.1% from 11.2%. Social and Community Context 62.3% of the Tri -County population reported have 5 or more social interactions weekly. (CHNA Survey Data) 5.3% of the Tr- County population reported having 1 or less social interactions weekly. (CHNA Survey Data) Social support is when someone can talk to friends and family about their concerns and get help coping. Research shows that when people don't have social support, they're at increased risk for physical and mental health problems. People who have social sup port are more likely to make healthier choices and have better health outcomes, like reduced stress . (CHNA Survey Data) Healthy People 2030 has a target to increase adults who talk to friends or family about their health to 92.3% from 86.9 (2017). Economi c Stability According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, substance use costs the U.S. over $600 billion annually. Drug addiction treatment can help to reduce associated health and social costs. Elements that should be looked at includes economic wellbeing and housing stability. Neighborhood and Built Environment For Tri -County, 9% of the population is at elevated risk for digital landscape. This is the same as the State of Illinois average of 9% (SocialScape\u00ae powered by SociallyDetermined\u00ae, 2022). Survey respondents were asked if they had Internet access. Of respondents, 95% indicated they had Internet in their homes. For those who did not have Internet in their home, cost was the most frequently cited reason. Note that these data are displayed in frequencies rather than percentages given the low number of responses.
