But what exactly are they and is it really possible to use the powers of quartz crystals for healing? What is a Quartz Crystal? Allow me get a little nerdy, and I'll tell you all about it! Quartz is the second most abundant natural minerals found on Earth. Simply put, quartz is composed of silicon and oxygen atoms with a chemical formula of SiO which can present in many forms including common rocks or boulders, clusters, double terminated points, laser wands, singing crystals, single points, twin flames, generators, milky quartz, spirit quartz, geodes, record keepers, enhydros, transmitters, Dow formations, faden, phantom crystals, Isis crystals, self-healed, giant Earth Keepers, and more! Quartz is also commonly combined with other minerals such as rutilated quartz, or colored crystals such as sooo much more. Quartz is versatile + amazing! The most universally known quartz formation is a candle shaped, hexagonal, 6-sided prismatic crystalline formation with natural facets at one or both ends - aka the clear quartz crystal. Clear Quartz is the Master Healer The Sacred Geometry of a 6-sided Clear Quartz Point contributes to its ability to magnify energetic vibrations. Quartz Points are wonderful crystals to use with any type of meditation or healing energy work such as Reiki, sound healing, dream work, [aromatherapy](https://spagoddess.com/collections/gemstone-aromatherapy), flower essence therapy, and more. Clear Quartz Crystals amplify energy and thought, as well as the effect of other crystals. [Clear Quartz Crystals](https://spagoddess.com/collections/clear-quartz) are energy amplifiers. Whatever energy you bring, they will amplify whether it's clear and concise, muddled or confused, angry and disconnected, or joyful and enlightened. Consider quartz as a magnifying glass to your energy and emotions, and strive to use your crystals as healing tools with respect, intention, and mindfulness. If you are feeling negative, you can turn it around by holding the crystal in your non-dominant hand, take a few deep breaths of awareness and ask the crystal to help you release the negativity with this simple meditation: May the highest vibration of love and light connect me with my higher self to assist me now. My intention is to clear all of the negative energy and release everything that is no longer serving me. With the support of this crystal, I hold the intention of light, pure love, and protection. And so it is... The crystal will be programmed with your intention and continue to assist you. You can carry it with you or place it somewhere you will see it regularly. The more often you program the crystal with this meditation the stronger it's healing energy will be. Clear quartz has the capacity to absorb, store, release and regulate energy. It resonates with all of the chakras as well as each Zodiac sign. Quartz enhances spiritual growth, spirituality, awareness, and wisdom. It increases inspiration and creativity. It can also help with concentration, studying, and retaining what one learns.

Mantra: I am beautiful. I am bountiful. I am blissful. Trust that the right crystals will find you It may sound daunting to try and find the right crystals that you'll form a bond with. Is it even possible to be friends with a rock? Call me a crazy crystal lady, but I have a few crystal besties in my collection that I resonate more deeply with and seek specific guidance from. You'll know your crystal besties when they cross your path! Think of your crystals as energetic allies, each with their own personality, their own energetic blueprint and be open, without expectation to what they can teach you or how they can open your consciousness. [Finding the right crystal](https://spagoddess.com/collections/wild-mountain-crystals) can happen in so many ways, but rest assured that the right crystal will find you at the right time. It doesn't matter if you're choosing from a table display full of stones that you can see and hold and commune with, if you're ordering online from a trusted merchant like our sister site [Wild Mountain Crystals](https://wildmountaincrystals.com/), if someone gifts you a crystal, or if you're choosing a crystal from your collection to meditate with this morning - subtle crystalline energy works in wondrous and mysterious ways. Trust that the universe is magically delivering you exactly what you need in the perfect timing. Trust the timing of your life as they say! Don't worry! You're not going to choose the wrong one! Energetically like attracts like. Just be open and think positive thoughts. Before stepping into the shop ask the universe and your higher self to help you find the crystal that will being you the most benefit right now. Mantra: I am crystal clear on my intentions and goals. When you're choosing a crystal in person find one that sparks your interest and pick it up. Hold it in your receptive, non-dominant hand. Do you feel anything? Is there some kind of unexplained connection? Pick up a few more and see if you connect with one more than the other. Are you captivated by it's beauty? Does it give you an energy zing in your hand? Sometimes it's love at first sight -- LOL, but seriously. And other times you might leave the shop, but can't get the crystal out of your mind. The crystal might come back into your thoughts or you may have a dream about it. If this happens, I highly recommend acquiring that crystal if possible as it has the potential to be a powerful teacher and ally for you! How can I feel the energy of a crystal? That depends! It really depends on you, and it also depends on the crystal. Just like making friends, as you begin to dive into the world of crystals, you will notice that you are intuitively more attracted to certain stones than you are to others. A simple way to drop in and feel the energy of a crystal is to focus on one stone at a time. Take off any other gems or crystal jewelry -- even your engagement ring, remove that stone from your pocket, etc. All crystals, gems, rocks and minerals carry a unique vibration, or personality. It's much easier when you're starting out with crystals to clear the decks and focus on one stone, one energetic vibration at a time. Think of it like a one on one conversation vs a cocktail party. The party is fun with everyone's personality bouncing off of one another, but the one on one conversation has the potential to go a lot deeper and get much more personal. Remove any other distractions; turn off the radio, tv, cell phone, etc. You can put on some meditation music to help clear your mind, I like [Stephen Halpern](https://amzn.to/2UouRvk), specifically [Tonal Alchemy](https://amzn.to/2U9DDbG) which is the perfect high vibe combo of crystal bowls, om's and new age tones. This Meditation Will Help You Get In Tune With Your New Crystal Sit in a simple meditation with the crystal in your receptive/non-dominant hand. Close your eyes, and take several long slow deep breaths. Focus on your breathing, in and out while you begin to visualize the crystal's energy in your hand, as you inhale and exhale. Imagine that energy forming an orb, a sphere of glowing light. With each breath in and out, allow the energy to take shape and grow, feel the energy, imagine breathing in healing energy to every cell of your body, and breathe it back out sharing this healing with the Earth. This crystal came from the heart of the Earth. Feel that connection. Affirmation: I am a radiant being filled with healing + light. Allow the crystal to take you on a journey without any expectation of the outcome. Bring your focus back on the crystal, your breath or the music when you get distracted. Sit for a few minutes, or as long as you wish. Ease yourself back into \"reality\" by opening your eyes slowly, becoming aware of your surroundings, taking a few deep breaths of transition. Look at your crystal. Do you feel more connected? Are you better friends? My Favorite Books On Crystals As an obsessive researcher, I have an extensive library of crystal books that I've been collecting since the early 90's. Since not all crystal books are the same, or even that great, I've put a short list together for you of my favs. - The first ever crystal book by [Katrina Raphael](https://amzn.to/2KvjZY7)called [Crystal Enlightenment: The Transforming Properties of Crystals and Healing Stones](https://amzn.to/2OWFbo4)is quite beloved. - The most comprehensive and informative book in my library is [The Book of Stones: Who They Are And What They Teach](https://amzn.to/2Vtq9bX). This is my #1 recommendation if I could only to own one crystal book, this would be it. Definitely my all time favorite crystal book, it was co-authored by my crystal teacher Naisha Ashian and Robert Simmons. Do not opt for the \"pocket book' version, it's not the same, and not worth buying! - I also love the sweet and honest hippie vibe of Melody's books, especially [Love Is in the Earth: A Kaleidoscope of Crystals: The Reference Book Describing the Metaphysical Properties of the Mineral Kingdom](https://amzn.to/2WPuHd2) - The more recent [Crystal Muse: Everyday Rituals to Tune In to "}
