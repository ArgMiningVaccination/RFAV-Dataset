[Lanserhof Tegernsee, Germany](http://www.lanserhof.com/english/lanserhof-tegernsee.html) Located on the edge of Lake Tegernsee south of Munich, the Lanserhof Tegernsee was named the Destination Spa of the Year at the 2015 World Spa and Wellness Awards in London just a year after opening its doors in 2014. Unlike recreational and leisure resorts, guests of Lanserhof Tegernsee receive personalized health plans with the help of an on-site physician, including two medical examinations, abdominal check-ups, detox drainage procedures, detox body wrap and bath, and a urine analysis. One of the pillars of the Lans Med Concept is the belief that a person's energy comes from the digestive tract. Viewed as the 'root system of the human being,' doctors and therapists treat intestines as the key to healing the immune system.
