According to [Mexico Daily News](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/rulings-allow-2-individuals-to-possess-cocaine/), the judge imposed a string of stipulations for the pair in order to allow them to use cocaine. They include limiting their intake to 500 milligrams per day and not working, driving or operating heavy machinery while under the influence. They are also not allowed to take the drug in public, in the presence of children, or encourage others to consume it. In his ruling, judge V\u00edctor Octavio Luna Escobedo said that recreational use of cocaine has many benefits, including \"tension relief, the intensification of perceptions and the desire [to have] new personal and spiritual experiences.\" According to the [AFP](https://www.france24.com/en/20190820-mexican-court-rules-to-allow-recreational-cocaine-use) news agency, Mexico's national health regulator\u2014the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk\u2014is seeking to block the judge's order, which was handed down in May. The decision will also be reviewed by a panel of judges at a higher court. \"These cases constitute a further step towards a new drug policy that allows us to build a safer, more just and peaceful Mexico,\" MUAC added in a statement. Mexico's President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has promised radical changes in a bid to end the war on drugs in the country, which kills thousands every year. Obrador, a left-wing politician who took office in December, argued the country should [decriminalize all drugs](https://www.newsweek.com/mexico-decriminalize-drugs-negotiate-us-1421395) in order to take power away from the cartels and criminal gangs. \"The 'war on drugs' has escalated the public health problem posed by currently banned substances to a public safety crisis,\" a policy proposal in Obrador's National Development Plan for 2019-2024 read. It added that Mexico's current \"prohibitionist strategy is unsustainable.\" According to AFP, more than 250,000 people have been murdered by drug cartels in Mexico since 2006, including a record 33,755 last year.
