But many people are learning more about the benefits of holistic medicine, and they are fully [embracing this form of medicine](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Millennials-Embrace-Alternative-Medicine-32-Billion-Business) just as much as modern medical treatments. Continue reading to learn why this is the case. An Increased Focus On Preventing Illness People are focusing more on preventing disease rather than trying to cure it after it strikes, and holistic medicine offers a lot of advice and natural supplements that can assist the body in maintaining a state of health and wellness. Having an understanding of holistic healing modalities, such as herbal medicine, homeopathy, massage, yoga, meditation, supplementation, acupuncture, and nutrition can help healthcare professionals, including highly qualified nurses, teach their patients to keep their bodies strong and in balance as common practice in [public health](http://msnonline.arizona.edu/). Saving On Medical Costs By knowing how to prevent illness, patients can not only improve their quality of life, but also save money on healthcare costs. Quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and eating less meat, dairy, and processed food can all help a person's body naturally heal. Combine that with the right supplements that are taken to strengthen a person's unique constitution and there is an increased potential to save money that would otherwise be spent on visits to the doctor, prescription medications, and various treatments. Fewer Side Effects Natural medicines can have [side effects](http://www.yourhealthbase.com/alternative_medicine.html), but they typically are not nearly as harsh as the side effects that people suffer from when they take the prescription medications that are on the market. And some natural remedies do not cause any side effects at all, making them a lot safer than the conventional alternatives. In fact, some people have to take a cocktail of prescriptions just to combat the side effects caused by their primary medication that actually treats the problem they are dealing with. Nurses who have passed ADN to NP programs or RN to MSN programs are especially aware of side effects that are associated with medications, so many of them choose to move into a holistic medical practice to use their knowledge to support naturopathic doctors and help people treat themselves naturally. Working With The Body Rather Than Against It Western medicine often works against the body, rather than with it, in order to cure illness. But other options, such Ayurveda, chiropractic care, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and vitamin therapy, work with the body's own immune system to gently help it heal itself. Many people prefer this gentle yet effective approach for their health, which is yet another reason why holistic medicine is growing increasingly popular. If you are thinking about entering the medical field, whether you are planning on becoming a doctor or getting your MSN online, consider educating yourself in the benefits of holistic medicine. Many medical professionals are offering a combination of conventional and natural treatment options because their patients prefer an approach that is complementary and integrative rather than singular.
