It is thought to be a safer alternative to surgery or Botox? Proponents say facial acupuncture addresses the signs of aging and helps the skin look younger and smoother. It is often used to minimize fine lines, puffiness, breakouts, dull skin, boost collagen production and increase circulation. There are very few side effects of acupuncture.
