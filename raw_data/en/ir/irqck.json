[Complementary and alternative medicines](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market) (CAM) include remedies or treatments that are used instead of or as supplements with conventional allopathic treatments. The various types of complementary and alternative medicines include remedies based on traditional alternative medicine & botanicals, mind-healing techniques, body-healing therapies, external energy, and sensory healing. The Middle Eastern region and its cultures offer lucrative opportunities to players in the complementary and alternative medicine market, owing to a history of commonly practiced spiritual healing techniques and herbal medicine, such as Unani, for the treatment of several disorders. As a result, traditional practitioners are a vital part of disease management in the region. Traditional alternative medicines and botanicals include naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Arabic medicine. Due to the increasing burden of chronic diseases and the rising popularity of alternative medicines, several new healing centers are being launched in this space in the Middle East. For instance, in July 2021, the Lootah Group of Companies, in partnership with Kerala's Santhigiri Group, launched the Santhigiri Holistic Healthcare Centre in Dubai, which offers a range of complementary and alternative medicine varieties such as acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, and yoga. Such centers are likely to boost the market over the forecast period. The Middle East region has witnessed significant social and economic impact due to the coronavirus pandemic. The government authorities in this region are keen on promoting the use of traditional alternatives in COVID-19 treatment, however, it is imperative to cater to the conventional research standards devised for all the other drug candidates. In addition, in the recent past, WHO has also acknowledged and stated that CAM exhibits several benefits, that may assist in the effective, safe, and maximum at-home management of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, an increase in the geriatric population in the region is expected to boost the market growth in the region. According to WHO, in 2050, 80% of older people (above 60) will be living in low- and middle-income countries. Commonly, older people are increasingly choosing CAM treatments, especially acupuncture, herbal products, bloodletting, medical massage, cauterization, and religious rituals. In addition, certain disease conditions such as back pain, insomnia, Alzheimer's disease, and colds are associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine among older people. On the other hand, key challenges faced by the Middle Eastern population using complementary and alternative medicine, are the lack of well-documented data pertaining to the efficacy of CAM therapeutic interventions, lack of robust support from doctors, physicians, and professionals toward incorporation of CAM in conventional treatment options, and fewer number of CAM training programs. However various conferences are being held in the region on complementary and alternative medicine to overcome the challenges associated to CAM therapies. For instance, CAM therapies 2022 conference organized by Pulsus is scheduled on the fifth and sixth of December in Dubai, UAE. Such platforms in the region are helping to share, promote and encourage advancements in complementary & alternative medicine.
