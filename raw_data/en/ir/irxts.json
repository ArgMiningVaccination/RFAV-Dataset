While the behavioral change theories and models presented in it have been utilized by so-cial science researchers for several decades, the findings of their application, specifically to adolescents, have been systematically collected and are being reportedhere for the first time. This book also represents the first attempt to incorporate a devel-opmental perspective in the conceptual analysis of these classical theoretical constructswhen applied to various stages of adolescence. Such a perspective will enable plannersand developers of health promotion interventions to identify and address differences inbehavioral and socio-emotional capabilities between 13-year-olds and 18-year-olds, forexample, and then design programs that effectively respond to the specific needs andwants of each developmental stage. Cultural, ethnic, and gender differences are also given special consideration, as are the role of poverty and the ability of some adolescents to secure physical and emotional well-being despite circumstances of adversity. In addition, much of the information includedin this book regarding critical developmental distinctions between the preadolescentand early adolescent stages, while gleaned by clinicians through years of experienceworking with these age groups, has been compiled and is being presented here for thefirst time, with a particular focus on its implications for public health interventions. This book also breaks new ground in explaining why some health promotion interven- tions aimed at positive adolescent behavior change produce the desired results, whileothers fail. The thoroughness of the analysis extends to the diversity of geographical set-tings that provide a backdrop for the studies cited: from Africa to the United States,Canada to Jamaica, Brazil to the Netherlands, El Salvador to Japan, and India to Mexico,to name only a few. My specific desire is that the experiences of the global research com-munity presented here will find fertile ground among a variety of publics throughoutLatin America and the Caribbean. This audience would include local health promoters,PrefaceYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |PREFACE | XIIdesigners of community health promotion programs, health professionals, the academic and research community, ministries of public health and of youth affairs, those whostudy and those who create mass media trends, parents and teachers, school counselors,and all others who play a significant role in adolescents' lives. By working together across a variety of levels\u2014interpersonal, community, and policy\u2014 these groups, and their counterparts in countries across the world, hold tremendous po-tential to encourage the adoption of health-promoting lifestyles among adolescents. Oneof this book's central lessons is that the cornerstone for success in instilling lifelong healthy behaviors is early intervention, beginning in the preadolescent years, beforehealth-compromising behaviors have taken deep root. This lesson forms the underpin-ning of the Youth: Choices and Change Model created by PAHO and also being presentedfor the first time here. By following the steps proposed, developers of adolescent health programs can help young people master the developmental goals appropriate for theirage group, strengthen their ability to make conscious decisions for health, and achievetheir self-set goals for the future. Young people, particularly those in the 15-to-24 age group, figure prominently in four of the Millennium Development Goals adopted by member countries of the United Nationsin 2000. Nearly one in every three persons in Latin America and the Caribbean today isbetween 10 and 24 years of age. Therefore, actions for the empowerment of tomorrow'sgeneration\u2014such as ensuring universal education and gender equality, and improvingHIV/AIDS prevention strategies and socioeconomic opportunities for youth as they com-mence their economically productive years\u2014can play a pivotal role in the achievement ofthe umbrella goal of extreme poverty reduction by the year 2015.

YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |ACKNOWLEDGMENTS | XVAcknowledgmentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |FOREWORD | XVII \"Oh youth, youth! You don't worry about anything; you seem to possess all the treasures of the universe. . . . And perhaps the whole secret of your charm liesnot in your ability to do everything, but in your ability to think that you willdo everything.\" \u2014Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev (1818-1883) Russian author Adolescence is a time of unprecedented curiosity about life and the decoding of its inner workings. This curiosity is fueled by boundless energy and a nascentsense of independence and power as the prospects of becoming a full-fledged adult draw ever nearer. The possibilities for experimentation proliferate, opening unex-pected doors leading to previously unimagined roads. The opportunities for acceleratedsociopsychological growth and the consolidation of personal identity are counterbal-anced by the equally potent dangers adolescents face as they navigate this vast unchartedterritory called \"coming of age.\" All those who work to improve and protect the health and well-being of adolescents are, perhaps more than any other care-giving profession, faced with a series of unique chal-lenges. In the physical sense, none is more robust and uncompromised by debilitatinghealth conditions than this age group. At the same time, mental acuity is never sharpernor powers of information retention stronger. Perhaps for these very reasons, traditional adolescent health programs and policies, whether local or national in scope, have tended to be narrow in focus and curative in na-ture in addressing such behavior-related issues as HIV/AIDS, pregnancy, gang violence,and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. To the degree to which the services developedare oriented to specific problems, they have differed little from those of disease preven-tion and control programs in that they have often defined success by the absence or dis-appearance of the problem at hand. [Foreword ] Paving the Way from Adolescence to a Healthy AdulthoodBecause these programs tend to be vertical in approach, they usually do not take into ac- count the broad social context within which the problem first arose. Nor are the needs,concerns, and rights of the adolescents themselves fully recognized or incorporated intothe design of interventions. The input of family, teachers, peers, and other significantothers is often overlooked and/or underutilized, as are gender- and culture-relatedconsiderations and the changing developmental needs of young people at different ages. Latin America and the Caribbean have been at the forefront of developing policies, pro- grams, and services for adolescents in the Region of the Americas. But in these countries,as elsewhere around the world, many of these initiatives currently adhere to the tradi-tional approaches described above. Yet over the past decades, awareness has grown of theneed to move beyond a problem-oriented approach to adolescent health to a develop-mental approach based on the basic precepts of health promotion, as highlighted in thehistoric Ottawa Charter adopted by the countries of the Americas and others around theworld at the International Conference on Health Promotion on 21 November 1986. As stated in the Charter, Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to im- prove, their health. To reach a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being,an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to satisfyneeds, and to change or cope with the environment. . . . Good health is a major resourcefor social, economic, and personal development and an important dimension of quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors can all favor health or be harmful to it. The cornerstones of the health promotion strategy\u2014building healthy public policy, cre- ating supportive environments, strengthening community actions, developing personalskills, and reorienting health services\u2014are particularly relevant in addressing the chal-lenges of improving and protecting the health and well-being of adolescents in that theywiden the playing field of potential resources and indicate new variables to be consideredby program planners and designers. The central element of all successful health promotion and prevention programs is the underlying theoretical framework (DiClemente, Crosby, and Kegler 2002; Glanz, Rimer,and Lewis 2002) and determining why this particular framework is meaningful and ef-fective in addressing local challenges. There has been a growing effort to identify, de-scribe, analyze, and replicate those evidence-based intervention models which have pro-duced the most positive results in enabling adolescents to adopt and maintainhealth-promoting lifestyles and/or change health-compromising lifestyles. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |FOREWORD | XVIIIYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |FOREWORD | XIXOf particular concern is the growing body of evidence that while public health interven- tions can successfully increase young people's knowledge about the health issues most af-fecting them\u2014such as risky sexual practices and substance abuse\u2014the mere provision ofinformation is not enough to lead to positive and sustained behavior change. What ismissing are interventions that successfully motivate adolescents to use the information and services available and develop the skills necessary to become actors of their own change . Youth: Choices and Change is being produced by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as a guide to help those who work with adolescents and youth1identify the most effective theoretical frameworks for health promotion and prevention programs that aretailored to the distinct developmental goals, needs, and wants of young people at differentages and that take into account gender and cultural background considerations. In addi-tion, it provides tools that will enable program developers to design, implement, and eval-uate interventions and services that are relevant and appropriate to local conditions andcircumstances. It reviews literature containing the classical health promotion and behav-ior change theories and models most frequently utilized in health education today and in-cludes a critical analysis of their application and effectiveness. The systematic compilation of these theories and models in one source\u2014combined with a comprehensive conceptual analysis of each, as applied specifically to adolescent behav-ior and incorporating a developmental perspective\u2014make this publication a unique con-tribution to the study of adolescent health. PAHO's Child and Adolescent Health Unit, aspart of the Family and Community Health Area, is pleased to present this book with thedesire that it find resonance among a variety of audiences: policymakers, program de-signers at the local and national levels, health professionals, university professors andstudents, researchers, and all others interested in the fields of health promotion andadolescent health. 1 PAHO and the World Health Organization define adolescence as the period between 10 and 19 years of age and youth as the period between 15 and 24 years; the term \"young people\" is used to indicate both groups.[Introduction ] YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | XXI Einstein's observation was made over a half century ago, yet it still holds true today: the search for precision and \"excellence\" in the means often causes us tolose sight of the ultimate goal. The resulting confusion can claim its toll on pub- lic health initiatives, no matter how well intentioned. In the case of adolescent health,program developers must remember that while different behavior change models mightrepresent effective means to the adoption of health-promoting lifestyles, the ultimate goal is positive, sustainable behavioral change which enables young people to become actors of their own change and achieve their self-set goals. As expressed in the Ottawa Charter, health promotion is a means to increase the control people have over the determinants of theirown health by increasing self-care capacities, which are the decisions and actions indi-viduals take regarding their health. Youth: Choices and Change provides a variety of theoretical frameworks within which health professionals and others dedicated to improving the health of adolescents andyouth may design mechanisms to stimulate the development of healthy lifestyle choices.By strengthening youths' decision-making capacity and encouraging them to take advan-tage of enhanced social support systems within the community, the impetus for behav-ioral change receives both immediate and ongoing positive reinforcement. From a broad health promotion perspective, encouraging adolescents to adopt and main- tain healthy lifestyles and behaviors is crucial to reducing the burden of chronic diseasesin Latin America and the Caribbean countries, given that many of the unhealthy habitsthat later produce morbidity and mortality in adults are acquired during the period ofHealthy Choices and Changes \"Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem, in my opinion, to characterize our age.\" \u2014Albert Einstein Out of My Later Years, 1950YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | XXIIadolescence (PAHO 1998). At the same time, as we will see in Chapter One, young people in this region of the world represent a growing segment of the overall population, andtherefore their health and development will be a key element for the region's socioeco-nomic and political progress now and in the coming years (PAHO 2000a). In today's world of sophisticated targeting of young people by the fast food, tobacco, and al- cohol industries; nearly universal access to television; the glamorization of sexual experi-mentation; and peer pressure; youth are inundated with messages that both subtly and bla-tantly push health-compromising activities. The social pressure to adopt the risky lifestylesdepicted in commercial advertising is enormous. In this sense, promoting the importanceof healthy lifestyles and environments must compete with other messages that young peo- ple often find more attractive. At the same time, evidence shows that while public health in-terventions can successfully increase adolescent and youths' knowledge about health risks,this awareness is not, in and of itself, always enough to change unhealthy behaviors. This means that while young people may have access to information and may even know that certain behaviors and practices are unsafe, this is not sufficient to persuade them tochange their actions. Instead, youth must be motivated to develop the skills and assetsnecessary to prepare for the coming years of change through a sense of positive empow-erment and the personal conviction that they have the capacity to make conscious choicesabout their lives, including the desirability of moving away from negative influences andsituations as a means of self-preservation and enrichment. Youth: Choices and Change has four sections. In the first, an overview is provided of adolescent lifestyles in Latin America and the Caribbean, indicating the scope of thechallenge for health promotion programs and policymakers. The need to bridge theknowledge-behavior change gap is highlighted, followed by a discussion of the impor-tance of adopting a suitable theoretical framework as the basic foundation for achievingsuccessful and respectful interventions. The book's first section also underscores thecrucial link between the different stages of adolescent development and the use of be-havior change and health promotion theories and models specifically tailored to thesestages, including appropriate gender and cultural background considerations. In SectionOne's final chapter, the authors describe the Youth: Choices and Change Model and ex-plain why the Pan American Health Organization recommends it as an effective tool forthe design of health interventions for adolescents. The book's second section analyzes the most prominent theories and models on behav- ior change and health promotion in use with a developmental perspective, noting thatprogram developers should not only consider theories and models focusing on individ-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | XXIIIual change but also those which promote change at the interpersonal, community, and policy levels. The reader will find an extensive literature review of the applications of thedifferent theories and models when encouraging the adoption and maintenance ofhealth-promoting behaviors and the cessation of health-compromising behaviors inadolescents. Section Three underscores the importance of understanding the different developmen- tal processes through which adolescents will pass and how this progression must serve asthe context within which any given theoretical framework will be applied. The authorsnote that while many of the classical behavior change and health promotion theories andmodels described in the previous section hold great promise, they can only achieve thedesired results if program designers understand the changing needs and wants of adoles-cents at different stages of development and tailor interventions and goals accordingly.PAHO considers the preadolescent and early adolescent age groups1to be the most over- looked by adolescent health programs and emphasizes the importance of promoting theadoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors beginning with preadolescence, insteadof waiting until later, when health-compromising behaviors have already begun and may be well entrenched, thus becoming more difficult to change. In this section's closingchapters, PAHO presents a series of developmentally appropriate goals to be consideredwhen planning health promotion and prevention programs for these two age groups. The fourth and final section synthesizes the contents of the previous three sections and highlights the unique contributions of this book, particularly its emphasis on early inter-vention during the preadolescent and early adolescent years and on the incorporation ofa growth and developmental perspective in the creation of adolescent health promotionprograms. It also offers insight into the current socioeconomic challenges and advan-tages facing youth in Latin America and the Caribbean and presents a review of interna-tional commitments undertaken by the member countries of the United Nations de-signed to strengthen the health and development of young people in the Region of theAmericas. The section concludes with a series of recommendations for improving healthand development opportunities for this group over the next decade. PAHO's Child and Adolescent Health Unit presents this book in the hope that it will stim- ulate and further refine dialogue\u2014in the academic and public health communities, onnational political agendas, and beyond\u2014about the need to promote and protect the healthand well-being of young people everywhere, as today's precious resource and a solid in-vestment in tomorrow's sustained socioeconomic development. 1Preadolescence refers to girls ages 9-12 and boys ages 10-13; early adolescence refers to ages 12-14 and 13-15, respectively.[Section One] Developing Effective Health Promotion and PreventionPrograms for AdolescentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 2Introduction The first section of Youth: Choices and Change opens with an overview of the status of ado- lescent health in Latin America and the Caribbean, the principal focus of technical coop-eration activities of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The four areas ofadolescent lifestyle behavior introduced in Chapter One\u2014sexual activity; violence; alco-hol, tobacco, and drug abuse; and nutrition and physical activity\u2014will continue to bethose of interest in subsequent analyses throughout the remainder of the book. ChapterTwo will discuss why increasing access to health information and enabling adolescents to become more knowledgeable about health issues in general are oftentimes not enough toconvince them to adopt healthier behaviors and lifestyles. Chapter Three highlights theimportance of designing health promotion programs and interventions that are guidedby the appropriate health behavior theory or theories. Too often, though, health promo-tion and prevention programs are based primarily on precedent, tradition, intuition, orgeneral principles, without a full understanding of the theoretical frameworks that leadto interventions that achieve actual behavior change (Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002). Itis PAHO's hope that publication of this book will contribute to measurable improvementsin the near future of this current situation. Chapter Four identifies the multiple levels of influence found in the adolescent's world and stresses the need for behavior change interventions to incorporate both individual and en-vironmental approaches, as well as to apply multiple strategies in multiple settings and in-clude various levels of assessment (e.g., social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmen-tal, educational, ecological, administrative, policy) and of evaluation (e.g., process, impact,outcome). This chapter concludes with a guide proposed by PAHO that builds on the fac-tors that predispose , enable , and reinforce the choice of individual lifestyles and/or shape en- vironmental conditions, as found in the classical PRECEDE-PROCEED model for healthpromotion planning and evaluation, by linking these three forces to the framework of the-ories and models to be presented in Section Two of this book. The importance of listening to and understanding adolescent needs and wants \u2014and inte- grating a response to these into the intervention design\u2014is the subject of Chapter Five,whereas Chapter Six presents another crucial step that is also often overlooked, as well:assessing adolescents within their current developmental stage and tailoring interven-tions specifically for the abilities and interests of that particular age group. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | 3The basic elements presented in Chapters One through Six provide a complete frame- work within which health promoters may develop a series of interventions to enable ado-lescents to achieve and maintain healthy behaviors and lifestyles. The Youth: Choices andChange Model, developed by PAHO and presented in Chapter Seven, is an embodimentof this framework and allows designers to build programs using a step-by-step approach.Young people in the Region of the Americas represent a growing and increasingly important socioeconomic segment of the population. In Latin America and theCaribbean countries, young people between the ages of 10 and 24 make up 30% of the population, with adolescents aged 10-19 representing 20% of the population and 80% of them living in urban areas (Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe2000). Of the 155 million young people living in the Americas, the highest percentage isconcentrated in the Region's poorer countries and communities (Pan American HealthOrganization 2002b, 2000b). Many youths are indigenous and are subsequently margin-alized from mainstream culture. According to census data, there are close to a millionindigenous youths living in Bolivia (1992) and Guatemala (1994), and 2.7 million in Peru(1992) (Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe 2001). Sexual Activity Approximately one-half of all adolescents in the Region under the age of 17 are sexuallyactive. The average age of first sexual intercourse in many Latin American countries isapproximately 15-16 years for girls and 14-15 years for boys (Pan American Health Or-ganization 2002b). Adolescent boys in certain Caribbean countries initiate sexual ac-tivity as early as 10-12 years of age (Pan American Health Organization 2002b), and byage 15, 90% have had sex (Pan American Health Organization 2002c). Of the sexuallyactive, between 48% and 53% never use contraceptives, and among those who do, ap-proximately 40% do not use any protection on a regular basis (Pan American HealthOrganization 2002c). In the Dominican Republic, 44% of girls have had sex before 15[Chapter One ] Adolescent Lifestyles in Latin America and the Caribbean: The Challenges and Their ScopeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 6years of age, and 78% of this group have been pregnant (Calder\u00f3n 2002). A highrate of Peruvian women (62%) who hadinitiated sexual activity before age 15reported a coercive sexual initiation (C\u00e1-ceres et al. 2000). Data from Guatemalaindicate that although 69% of adolescentsbetween the ages of 15 and 19 reportknowledge of at least one family planningmethod, only 4% of sexually active ado-lescents report using one regularly (PanAmerican Health Organization 2002c).Surveys in the Caribbean suggest that40% of girls and 50% of boys had no ac-cess to contraceptives during their firstsexual intercourse. Around half of all new HIV infections are in individuals aged 15-24, the range dur-ing which most people start their sexuallives (Joint United Nations Programme onHIV/AIDS 1998). Youths in Brazil, Haiti,Honduras, Panama, and various English-speaking Caribbean countries are particu-larly affected by the epidemic. It is esti-mated that 4.9% of males between the agesof 15 and 24 are infected in Haiti, and 1.7% of adolescent girls and 1.4% of adolescent boys in Honduras. In Brazil, 0.7% of ado-lescent boys are estimated to be infectedbut, given the country's large populationsize, the actual number of adolescents withHIV is reason for concern because itgreatly increases the potential to spreadthe virus (United Nations Children's Fund2000). The Bahamas reports a 25% in-crease in the incidence of HIV/AIDS inadolescents from 1999 to 2000 (PanAmerican Health Organization 2002c). Program designers are confronted with an urgent but sensitive challenge. It is urgentbecause of the growing AIDS epidemic,and it is sensitive because the systems ofvalues and beliefs regarding adolescentsex vary widely from community to com-munity. The resulting situation has re-vived the traditional debate about whetherit is best to promote condom use or absti-nence in a social culture where enormousgender differences continue to prevail: a\"macho\" culture that promotes early sex-ual initiation among boys and abstinenceamong girls. The challenge is how to helpadolescents become more mindful abouttheir sexual lifestyle choices and see thevalue of avoiding early sex, even when thisage group is flooded with conflicting socialmessages and pressures (media, older andmore experienced peers) that encourageadolescents, particularly boys, to engage insexual activity. Other kinds of social messages tend to en- courage ignorance and shame when deal-ing with sexual situations, especially whentargeted to girls. For this reason, beingable to decide when to have sex and how toprotect themselves from early pregnancy,HIV, sexually transmitted infections, andsexual coercion is crucial to a girl's senseof being in control. Evidence shows that education on sexual health and/or HIVdoes not encourage increased sexual activ-ity among adolescents (World Health Or-ganization 2002a). The challenge is to gobeyond traditional sexuality educationprograms that only increase information(Eggleston et al. 2000) and instead seek toYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER ONE | 7strengthen adolescents' skills to adopt and maintain safer sex practices, eitherthrough a delay in sexual initiation or con-traceptive and/or condom use. To achievethis, interventions need to target not onlyindividual adolescents but also their par-ents and the community, by allowing ac-cess to condoms and contraceptives whenneeded and pushing for changes in socialnorms that encourage early sex. Violence In Latin America and the Caribbean coun- tries, violence surrounds adolescents, es-pecially poor, urban youths. The perva-siveness of violence is clearly recognizedas one of the most urgent threats to ado-lescent health and development through-out the Americas. The leading causes ofdeath among those ages 10-19 years areexternal and include violence and homi-cide. Twenty-nine percent of all homi-cides in the Americas occur in this agegroup. Violence in adolescence is not lim-ited to physical or sexual trauma but alsoincludes emotional and verbal abuse,threats, and other types of psychologicalabuse (Pan American Health Organization2002b, World Health Organization2002d). Sexual abuse and domestic violence have also increased their profile: in theCaribbean Adolescent Health Survey(CAHS), conducted in 2000 among youthsfrom nine English-speaking Caribbeancountries, 17% of adolescent males and15% of adolescent females reported havingbeen physically abused. Nearly one inthree of those surveyed expressed concern about the level of violence in their com-munity. To the extent that violence is seenas a socially accepted method of anger ex-pression and conflict resolution, theseyoung people said they grow up in fear ofbeing either the victim of violence or a wit-ness to it before reaching adulthood. The CAHS also found that owning or shooting a gun is viewed as a symbol ofmanhood in several countries. Seventeenpercent of males reported having been in afight where weapons were used, 20% saidthey had carried a weapon to school in thepast 30 days, 31% had carried a weapon attimes other than during school hours inthe last 30 days, and 22% admitted thatthey have belonged to a gang at one pointor another in their lives. In the same sur-vey, 39% of 13-15-year-olds reportedsometimes thinking about hurting orkilling someone, 5% reported alwaysthinking about it (Pan American HealthOrganization 2000a). Program designers are confronted with the challenge of how to address the multi-level determinants of youth violence, in-volving individual characteristics (e.g.,difficult temperament and impulsive-ness), family variables (e.g., economicstress, poor parenting, family abuse,parental substance abuse), and societalfactors (e.g., access to weapons, media vi-olence, inequitable educational and occu-pational opportunities, political violence)that contribute to this epidemic (WorldHealth Organization 2002b, Weist andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 8Cooley-Quille 2001, Webber 1997, Ollen- dick 1996). Gender violence also plays a key role in youth violence and development in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, where theculture of machismo accepts violence as away to solve conflicts as part of the socialnorm. Masculinity development is em-bedded in this culture where the tradi-tional path to becoming a man involvesbeing verbally and physically aggressive,solving conflicts through fights, and exer-cising power and control over women(Aguirre and G\u00fcell 2002). In the design ofprograms, early intervention and preven-tion are key: programs targeted to youngerchildren should be coordinated with thosedirected toward preadolescents and ado-lescents, with a view toward developingnonviolent capabilities for anger expres-sion and conflict resolution across the lifecycle, focusing on new alternative paths tomasculinity development, and address-ing gender inequities at the differentenvironmental levels (family, school,community at large). Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use The use of tobacco, alcohol, and otherdrugs poses a special threat to young peo-ple because of the short- and long-termconsequences of substance abuse. Alcoholis the most commonly used substance byadolescents in the Caribbean countries.The CAHS showed that 40% of femalesand 54% of males 12-18) drink alco-hol. Beer, spirits, and marijuana are notonly easily available but have become partof everyday life for most adolescents in Belize, where their early use is considereda rite of passage for young males (PanAmerican Health Organization/Belize2002). One in ten 16- to 18-year-olds re-ports consuming four or more drinks atone time. Because their growth and development process is far from complete, preadoles-cents should not drink alcohol. Neverthe-less, this is a frequent reality in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean. When livingunder conditions of extreme poverty, ageof initiation and likelihood of frequent consumption may be greater. Forster andcolleagues found that 25% of children be-tween ages 6 and 18 in Brazil who spent allday in the streets and slept there, drankalcohol on a regular, nearly daily basis(Forster, Tannhauser, and Barros 1996).Pechansky and Barros published the re- sults of a household survey of 950 adoles-cents between the ages of 10 and 18 in theurban area of Porto Alegre, Brazil, whichshowed a mean age of onset to be 10.1years, with no gender differences (WorldHealth Organization 2001, Pechansky andBarros 1995). In another Brazilian study,approximately 50% of young people be-tween the ages of 10 and 12 reported hav-ing used alcohol, compared to 74% ofthose between the ages of 10 and 18. Thirtypercent of those ages 10-18 had used alco-hol to the point of intoxication, and 19.3%reported heavy use (six or more timeswithin the past 30 days) (Galduroz et al.1997). Studies point to an increase indrinking in Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER ONE | 9Mexico, especially among young women (World Health Organization 2001, Carlini-Cotrim 1999, Medina-Mora 1999, Con-sejo Nacional para el Control de Estupefa-cientes (Chile) 1996, Urz\u00faa 1993). Datafrom a Costa Rican survey support theproposition that an earlier age of initiationmay predict a greater likelihood of alcoholproblems later in life (Bejarano, Carvajal,and San Lee 1996). Heavy drinking byadolescents has been positively correlatedwith adolescents' perception that theirparents were drinking too much (Pechan-sky and Barros 1995). Since the consumption of alcohol enjoys generalized cultural acceptance, settingthe goal of alcohol abstinence among ado-lescents might not be a realistic one forhealth promotion program planners. Al-cohol's relationship to harm is mediatedby two factors: per capita consumption(how much the general population drinks)and consumption patterns (Jernigan2002). Adult per capita consumption hasbeen related to liver cirrhosis. Patterns ofconsumption have been linked, amongother factors, to motor vehicle accidents,suicides, and sexual and physical violence.The challenge, therefore, for program de-signers is how to promote a delay in thestarting age for alcohol exploration, how toencourage the adoption of reasonable andresponsible drinking behaviors amongyouth, and how to reduce per capita con-sumption among young people, all thewhile taking into account this group's vul-nerability to subliminal media images andtheir desire to emulate adult role modelswho encourage drinking as a rite of pas- sage or a way to cope with problems. The challenge also requires establishing a clearer delineation of the boundaries of\"reasonable and responsible drinking\" asan accepted social norm. The definitionshould be generally agreed upon by thecommunity, should protect the populationfrom the unhealthy effects of alcohol, andshould establish social and legal limits(e.g., legal minimum age for purchase andconsumption, media advertising) and re-sponsibilities based on what would beconsidered \"unreasonable and irrespon-sible\" among the adult population. Ado-lescents need clear messages from theirparents and the community to counteractthe glamorous packaging of alcohol con-sumption by the media in an increasinglyimpersonal and globalized world. Youth are not only targeted by the alcohol industry but by the tobacco companies, aswell. Exposure of middle adolescents (ages14-17) to tobacco advertising in LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries is ex-tremely high, reaching over 90% in Ar-gentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mexico, andUruguay (The Global Youth Tobacco SurveyCollaborative Group 2002). In Uruguay,35% of students between the ages of 11 and15 reported having tried their first ciga-rette (Pan American Health Organization2002c), and 21.6% of adolescents were of-fered free cigarettes by a tobacco companybetween 1999-2001 (The Global Youth To-bacco Survey Collaborative Group 2002).In Argentina, 35% of adolescents 12 to 15YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 10years of age reported tobacco use within the last 30 days (Pan American Health Or-ganization 2002c). Argentina is the coun-try with the highest percentage in theworld of adolescents exposed to second-hand smoke in public spaces (86.7%).Ironically, 70.4% of Argentine adoles-cents think smoking should be bannedfrom public places, a percentage thatclosely corresponds to the number of non-smoking adolescents in this country (TheGlobal Youth Tobacco Survey CollaborativeGroup 2002). The overwhelming evidence of the nega- tive health consequences produced by di-rect and indirect exposure to tobaccosmoke demands a strong effort to encour-age adolescents to stay tobacco-free. Urg-ing changes in community social normsrequires a comprehensive and multifac-eted approach comprised of policy andprogram interventions that take place atschools and other places frequented byadolescents, and are reinforced by publicservice campaigns and advocacy in themedia, as well as by legislative and fiscalmeasures. Unfortunately, changing socialnorms becomes more complicated whenthere is a significant percentage of adults(e.g., parents, teachers, community lead-ers, government officials, lawmakers) whoare themselves struggling with the addic-tive effects of nicotine. These individualsmight possibly resist (or, at least, not ac-tively support) policies to ban smoking inpublic spaces, despite the findings of a re-cent study of 106,071 adolescents ages13-15 in 24 Latin American and Caribbeancountries, which revealed that 79.1% think smoking should be banned in public areas(The Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collab-orative Group 2002). The challenge of em-powering adolescents to stay free of to-bacco consumption, therefore, includespromoting their right to secure smoke-free zones in the neighborhoods wherethey live, work, and play. The use of illegal drugs among youth poses a double threat, not only through the men-tal health consequences of addiction butalso because of the increased risk forHIV/AIDS infection. It is estimated that46% of Argentine adolescent males and32% of Argentine adolescent females ac-quired the infection through the use of in-travenous drugs (Pan American HealthOrganization 2002c). Marijuana is readilyavailable in most of the countries of theAmericas, and it has been widely recog-nized in scientific literature as a gatewaydrug for the use of cocaine and other morepowerful substances (Morral, McCaffrey,and Paddock 2002, Wagner and Anthony2002). A series of surveys conductedamong high school students by the Inter-American Observatory on Drugs foundthat more than 60% of students feel it iseasy or very easy to access illicit drugs. Theamount of cannabis seized in Latin Amer-ica and the Caribbean increased from2,088,834 kg in 1996 to 3,545,643 kg in2001. The amount of cocaine and heroinseized in these countries also increasedsignificantly between 1996 and 2001(Inter-American Observatory on Drugs2002). Although marijuana is the illegalYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER ONE | 11drug most frequently consumed by adoles- cents in several of the countries, inhalantshave become the second-most used illegaldrug over the past few years. The rate ofmarijuana dependence among Brazilianadolescents has reached 6.9%, while de 1999). Nutrition and Physical Activity Another worldwide health concern\u2014obesity\u2014is also on the rise among adoles-cents in the Region of the Americas, withpreliminary findings of prevalence rang-ing from 8% to obese adolescents becomeobese adults, and the relative riskis among 10- to 15-year-old obese adoles-cents (Dietz 1998). Although the relation-ship between obesity and health conse-quences has been widely proclaimed, thefuture negative outcomes of obesity are oflittle immediate interest to Latin Ameri-can adolescents. The majority\u2014regardlessof socioeconomic status\u2014is interested, in- stead, in keeping a healthy weight and pos-itive body image in the present, by learn-ing about fat and calorie content of foodsand beverages, weight loss methods, andenergy expenditure (McArthur, Pe\u00f1a, andHolbert 2001). Anorexia nervosa amongyoung people, particularly adolescentgirls, is a growing health concern. Con-temporary research indicates that eatingdisorders and body dissatisfaction have been reported among poor, as well as af-fluent, teenagers and among black andHispanic, as well as Asian and Caucasian,teens (Steinberg 1999). Obesity, eating disorders, and the impor- tance of healthy nutrition and regularphysical activity are all topics that are notadequately addressed (if at all) either atschool or in the family setting. At the sametime, many Latin American and Caribbeancountries do not have regulations requir-ing nutritional labeling of locally producedfood, which would increase the awareness of both parents and adolescents and en- able them to make better informed choicesin the purchase, preparation, and con-sumption of food. As they progress through the adolescent years, physical activity among both girlsand boys tends to decline steadily, coin-ciding with an increase in academic and/orwork demands and a focus on other areasof interest. The increase in the prevalence of overweight among children and adoles- cents is not only related to their eatinghabits but also to their levels of physicalactivity. Data from the Youth Media Cam-paign Longitudinal Survey, conducted in2002 in the United States by the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, re- vealed that 61.5% of children aged 9-13years do not participate in any organizedphysical activity during their nonschoolhours and that 22.6% do not engage in anyfree time physical activity (U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human ServicesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 122003a). Decreases in physical activity and in the number of physical education pro-grams in schools is also an alarming trendworldwide. Schools have unique opportu-nities to provide adequate physical activityfor all young people through official com- pulsory physical education programs aswell as through school sports programs andafter-school leisure-time physical activityinitiatives (World Health Organization2004b). The Statistics Canada series of re-ports, How Healthy Are Canadians? ,ana- lyzed factors that help overweight preado-lescents to become more active. The seriesconcludes that for overweight/obese pre-adolescents, a relatively high number ofhours in physical werepredictive of becoming physically active,and overweight/obese preadolescents whowere frequent television viewers had lowodds of adopting and maintaining an activelifestyle (Statistics Canada 2003).The challenges to the successful promo- tion of healthy nutrition and adequatephysical exercise are found, as in otherareas, at multiple levels: how to introducehealthy eating habits and regular physicalactivity into family and school routines;how to encourage adolescents to adopt andmaintain adequate eating habits and phys-ical activity in a world governed by fre-quent fast food consumption, prolongedhours of television viewing, and sedentarylearning and/or job activities; and how tosupport communities to invest in environ-ments for youth that encourage healthynutritional and exercise choices, includ-ing the development of policies to increasethe nutritional value of foods targeted toadolescent consumption, as well as theiravailability and proper nutritional label-ing, and the provision of community ven-ues designed for sports and other types ofphysical activity. There is ample evidence that while public health interventions can successfully increase adolescent and youths' knowledge about health issues (Eggleston et al.2000, Cunha et al. 1998), cognitive knowledge is not enough for a sustained change in behaviors (Merson, Dayton, and O'Reilly 2000; Leyva et al. 1995). Providingfactual information about risky health behaviors and thereby enhancing knowledge maybe necessary to the extent that they can lead to subsequent behavioral modification, butthe literature suggests that the link between knowledge and behavior is only moderate, atbest (Rimal 2000). Therefore, translating knowledge about health issues into healthy be-haviors remains a challenging and difficult task in health promotion (Mandu et al. 2000;Merson, Dayton, and O'Reilly 2000). This can be especially true in the case of adoles-cents, when the immediate consequences of an unhealthy behavior are nonethelesspleasurable, and when the health threat posed by the behavior is perceived as distant andfar-removed. Such is the case for smoking, overeating, drinking, drug use, and unpro-tected sex (Kelly 2000). The information deficit model , utilized by the early tobacco prevention programs of the 1960s and 1970s, assumed that adolescents would refrain from cigarette smoking if theywere provided with adequate information demonstrating that this habit causes seriousharm to the body. Many programs based solely on this objective did increase knowledgeamong children and adolescents, as intended, but the programs were consistently foundto be ineffective in the long term in dissuading young people from smoking. [Chapter Two ] The Knowledge-Behavior Gap in Health PromotionYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE | SECTION ONE | 14The limitations of this approach led to ef- forts in the 1970s to identify a more com- plex set of personal factors possibly linkedto cigarette smoking by young people. Uti-lizing the affective education model , efforts were oriented to help young people de-velop stronger these programs demon-strated that they were almost as ineffectivein reducing cigarette smoking amongyoung people as programs based on the in-formation deficit model. On a positive note, the affective education strategy didmark the beginning of promising trends inthe design of education programs to pre-vent smoking. For the first time, manyprograms began to directly incorporate re-search regarding factors that influencesmoking initiation, and they began to in-clude more powerful theoretical models ofbehavior change. The concept of \"behavior change\" de- scribes not only the shift from health-compromising behaviors to health-promoting behaviors, but also explains theprocess of change in adopting and main- taining new behaviors .For example, early adolescents are less likely to engage insexual activity, but as they begin to exploretheir sexuality, it is important for them toadopt safe sex practices once they decide toinitiate sexual activity. Another example isthe process of adopting and maintainingresponsible and reasonable drinkinghabits as young people increase the fre-quency of their participation in social events with their peers. The failure of various kinds of programs targeting adolescents to reduce health-compromising behavior and to enable theadoption of health-promoting behaviorshas led to two questions: \"What influencing behaviors inadolescence?\" and \"How does behaviorchange occur in adolescents?\" The factors that influence the likelihood of engaging in health-compromising behav-iors during adolescence can be quite com-plex. They include, but are not limited to,the following: individual factors, such as an impulsive or sensation-seeking temperament, the influence of hormones on aggres-sion and sexual behavior, and highlevels of anxiety and mood regulationdifficulties; interactive patterns, such as an opposition-defiant, aggressive, or ex-tremely self-absorbed personality type; relationship factors, such as negative emotional experiences and climatewithin the family, with peers, and withothers in the community, and care-givers with poor parenting skills; and social influences in the immediate envi- ronment, as well as those drawn fromthe wider community and culture,which promote health-compromisinglifestyles (e.g., mass media messages,industry marketing targeting youth,harmful adult role models, economichardship and inequity, and violence). Having identified these factors, it is im- portant to clarify that the display of one orYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWO | 15two in isolation does not determine the likelihood that adolescents will engage inhealth-compromising lifestyles. Risky be-havior, instead, results from the buildup ofmany factors. Behavior change theoriesdescribe how these factors and other de-terminants of behaviors (e.g., beliefs, val-ues, self-efficacy) can be changed, rein-forced, or introduced to achieve a desired behavioral change. Seeking to answer the second question\u2014 how behavior change can occur in adoles-cents\u2014experts developing programs topromote healthy eating, physical activity,nonsmoking, delay in sexual initiationand adoption of safer sex practices, andother similar ones have focused over thelast decade on introducing concepts ofbehavior change and health promotiontheories into their interventions. Severalschool and community-based programs,and some behavior change communica-tion interventions, are examples of thisapproach. Longitudinal research increas-ingly supports a wide-ranging, but well-coordinated and integrated approach in-corporating interventions at several levelssimultaneously\u2014interpersonal, commu- nity, and policy, for example\u2014rather thanconcentrating solely on changing individ-ual behaviors. The U.S. Surgeon General,in a recent report on reducing tobacco use(U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices 2000), and the InternationalConsultation on Tobacco and Youth, in itsfinal conference report, What in the World Works ? (World Health Organiza- tion 1999), contributed an assessment ofthe value and efficacy of the major ap-proaches that have been implemented toreduce tobacco use. According to theWHO report, \"no single policy or programmeasure will be effective. Rather, a broadmix of initiatives is required, with theinterventions varying according to thecircumstances of each country\" (WorldHealth Organization 1999). These conclu-sions are supported in the 2000 U.S. to-bacco reduction report, in which Dr.David Satcher, then U.S. Surgeon Gen- eral, noted unequivocally: \"Our lack ofgreater progress in tobacco control ismore the result of failure to implementproven strategies than it is the lack ofknowledge about what to do.\"InHealth Behavior and Education: Theory, Research, and Practice , the authors observe that: \"Programs to influence health behavior, including health promotion and education programs and interventions, are most likely to benefit participants and communitieswhen the program or intervention is guided by a theory of health behavior. Theories ofhealth behavior identify the targets for change and the methods for accomplishingchanges. Theories also inform the evaluation of change efforts by helping to identify theoutcomes to be measured, as well as the timing and methods of study to be used.\"(Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002) The importance of theories to successful adolescent programs has been described by dif- ferent authors (Kirby 2001, Jemmot and Jemmot 2000). In a review of more than 250 ef-fective sex education programs designed for young people, Kirby found 10 common char-acteristics. One is that the programs were \"based on theoretical approaches that havebeen demonstrated to influence other health-related behavior and identify specific im-portant sexual antecedents to be targeted.\" During the last decade, attention has focused on the fact that too often in public health practice, interventions are adopted and applied although no real evidence exists of theireffectiveness. It follows that all countries and communities\u2014but especially those withscarce economic resources\u2014pay a high opportunity cost if the interventions chosen donot yield the highest possible health return on the investment made. In this light, it is[Chapter Three ] The Importance of Behavior Theories to Successful AdolescentHealth ProgramsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THREE | 17imperative that decision-makers carefully investigate what the research literature hasidentified as the best interventions, takingthis knowledge as the departure point for the design of locally appropriate programs. In today's environment of \"accountability\" and the need to demonstrate impact, pro-motion and prevention programs mustproduce tangible results. Governmentsand private donors are interested in fund-ing programs with measurable outcomes.The new emphasis on performance meansthat promotion and prevention practition-ers must show that the programs they pro-pose will achieve the results predicted.Using scientifically defensible principleswill help practitioners respond to de-mands for accountability and will simulta-neously ensure that program participantsreceive the most effective services avail-able (U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services 2001c). There are increasing efforts to identify programs that meet various sets of criteriathat define what is science- or evidence-based. In general, a program designated asevidence-based has been reviewed by a panel of experts who determine that theprogram meets a set of predeterminedstandards of empirical research; for exam-ple, if a program is theory-based, if it hassound research methodology, and if it canshow results that are clearly linked to theintervention itself and not to extraneousfactors (Education Development Center2001). The effort to identify \"best practices\" for adolescent health promotion and preven-tion programs is the result of a new era of\"evidence-based medicine,\" in contrast toearlier programs designed according totradition, intuition, or general principles.The use of a strong and effective theoreti-cal framework allows program developersto evaluate interventions and obtain thenecessary evidence of effectiveness. Theories help in the stages of planning, implementing, and evaluating an inter-vention. They help to identify what the program designer needs to know beforedeveloping and implementing an inter-vention program. They can provide insightinto how to choose program strategies to reach and impact adolescents within theirenvironment. Theories also help to pin-point what should be monitored, meas- ured, or compared in a program evaluation(Glanz, Lewis, and Rimer 2002; Glanz andRimer 1995). The theoretical framework is the basic foundation upon whichevidence-based interventions are built inorder to achieve successful programs or\"best practices\" for adolescents. Nevertheless, not all theoretical frame- works are equally helpful in designing, im-plementing, and achieving successful in-terventions for young people. This bookintends to guide program designers in theselection of health promotion and behaviorchange theories that have shown to provideuseful, practical concepts and constructsthat have been successfully tested and ap-plied to interventions with adolescents. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 18 Kok, Schaalma, De Vries, Parcel, and Paulussen, for example, have had signifi- cant experience in the study of tobacco andAIDS prevention programs for adoles-cents. These authors emphasize theimportance of using \"problem-driven ap-plied social psychology,\" versus \"theory-driven applied social psychology,\" whenselecting a theoretical framework. In otherwords, Kok and colleagues insist on theneed to select not one single theory, but atheoretical framework that includes a se-ries of theories which lead to a better un-derstanding of the specific problem to beaddressed and of how best to solve it. Theywarn against using theory-driven appliedpsychology, whose end goal is to test thetheory itself, thereby considering practicalproblems from a single theoretical per-spective, instead of allowing oneself theflexibility to choose from among a varietyof theoretical constructs that can best ad- dress the problem. This dichotomy harksback to Einstein's words of caution re-garding perfection of means and confu-sion of goals. It is important to not losesight of the final goal, which is to enablethe adoption and maintenance of healthybehaviors, through the development of ef-fective health promotion and preventionprograms for adolescents, in which theo-ries serve as a navigator or roadmap alongthe continuum to behavior change. Problem-driven psychology requires a thorough analysis of the practical problemin question and involves the considerationof multiple theoretical perspectives to find answers to the problem. Before potentialtheoretical frameworks are selected, pro-gram designers need to answer such ques-tions as: What is the problem? Why is it aFigure 3-1. The Theoretical Framework as the Basic Foundation for Successful Adolescent Health Programs Theoretical frameworkEvidence-based interventionsBest practices Successful programs for adolescentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THREE | 19problem? Whose problem is it? What are the possible causes? A narrow focus ononly one theory, or a restrictive samplingof only a few theories, can lead to hypothe- ses that may not contribute to a reductionor solution of a practical problem (Kok etal. 1996). Nor should the selection of agiven framework be guided solely by prior familiarity with it or because it currentlyhappens to be in vogue (Glanz, Rimer, andLewis 2002), but instead by its provenability to respond adequately to the prob-lem and achieve the established goal(Sussman and Sussman 2001).The U.S. Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, in a review of evidence-based programs for adolescents, states that successful programs in substance abuseprevention possess three key characteristics: they are guided by \"theories that blend both individual and environmental approaches,\" apply \"multiple strategies inmultiple settings,\" and follow \"a logical design that includes assessment and evaluation\"(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2002a). Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, and Gottlieb, in their book Intervention Mapping: Designing Theory- and Evidence-Based Health Promotion Programs ,propose using a social ecological approach . Through this approach, health is viewed as a function of individuals and the en- vironments in which the individuals are embedded , including the family, social networks, organizations, communities, and society as a whole (Bartholomew et al. 2001, Stokols1996). Since adolescent behavior is influenced by determinants at these various levels,Bartholomew and colleagues encourage program developers to see these various levels asembedded systems , in which higher-order systems (e.g., society) set constraints and pro-[Chapter Four ] Adolescents Living in a Complex Environment of Multiple Levels of Influence Box 4-1. Three Key Aspects in the Development of Successful Adolescent Health Programs They are guided by theories that blend both individual and environmental approaches. They apply multiple strategies in multiple settings. They follow a logical design that includes assessment and evaluation. U.S. Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 2002vide input to lower-order systems (e.g., individuals), and the lower-order systemsin turn provide input back to systems at ahigher level. In view of new knowledge and ongoing re- search, Lawrence Green and MarshallKreuter (1999) have had to revise the subti-tle of each subsequent edition of theirgroundbreaking work Health Promotion Planning , first published in 1980 .The three editions taken together reflect a shift overthe past quarter century from a health edu-cation approach (1 stedition) into one that incorporates a more comprehensive envi-ronmental approach (2 ndedition, 1991), and finally a more multi-sectoral and mul-tilevel, or ecological, approach (3 rdedition, 1999). In addition, in the work's most re-cent edition, the authors further refine theso-called magic bullet approach by import- ing from the medical field the concept ofevidence-based practice and then applying it to the health promotion arena, noting that\"Human biology is relatively uniformacross the human species; however, humanbehavior, culture, and social changeprocesses are not uniform enough to per-mit a single set of best practices to sufficethe way medical best practices might\"(Green and Kreuter 1999). Within this redefined framework, then, it is important to select theories that help toachieve change at different ecological levels in a complex environment. The levels ofinfluence for health-related behaviors andconditions that have been identified are asfollows (McLeroy et al. 1988): (1) individual factors; (2) interpersonal factors;(3) institutional, or organizational, factors; (4) community factors; and(5) public policy factors. Table 4-1. presents a list of behavior and social change theories and models as pre-sented in three major health promotionworks, selecting those that are particularlyrelevant to the development of healthyadolescent behaviors. (The majority ofthese theoretical constructs will be dis-cussed in greater detail in Section Two ofthis book.) An important contribution of Green and Kreuter's work has been the developmentof the PRECEDE-PROCEED model for health promotion planning and evalua-tion, which highlights the three character-istics presented in Box 4-1., i.e., the appli-cation of theory-based approaches andmultiple strategies in a logical design al-lowing for adequate assessment and evalu-ation. The PRECEDE component of themodel includes assessment at five differ-ent levels: social, epidemiological, behav-ioral and environmental, educational andecological, and administrative and pol-icy, while the PROCEED component fo-cuses on developing the implementa-tion and evaluating its process, impact,and outcome. Figure 4-1. illustrates the structure of Green and Kreuter's model, including thefive levels, or phases, of the PRECEDE YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FOUR | 21YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE | SECTION ONE | 22 component and the four corresponding to the PROCEED component. Green and Kreuter (1999) emphasize the importance of identifying the pertinentdeterminants of health as the first step in the design development of any health pro-motion intervention. Green and Kreuterrefer to health determinants as a broadgroup of forces or factors that predispose ,Table 4-1.

Also in-cluded are \"changeable\" factors, suchas knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, val-ues, and confidence, or self-efficacy.Green and Kreuter also include in thisgroup several constructs describedwithin the Health Belief Model (to bediscussed in Chapter Eight of thisbook) and the Theory of Planned Be-havior (Chapter Eleven), both at theindividual level of influence andchange, as well as the Social CognitiveTheory (Chapter Sixteen) at the inter-personal level of influence and changeand its self-efficacy construct (which was also later incorporated by theHealth Belief Model). Regarding values as predisposing factors, the authorsestablish an important ethical distinc-tion that sometimes gets lost in the ef-forts to achieve behavioral change: \"We do not set out in short-term health ed-ucation or health promotion programsto change values. We seek instead to help people recognize inconsistenciesbetween their values and their behav-ior or environment\" (Green and Kreuter 1999). enabling factors : The authors define these as the \"factors that facilitate the performance of an action by individualsor organizations.\" These factors in-clude the availability, accessibility, andaffordability communityresources; of \"fast foods\"); community andgovernment commitment to goodhealth through policies and legislation;as well as barriers to adopt a healthybehavior (e.g., lack of smoke-freeschool zones, playgrounds and otherrecreational areas, legal drinking agelaws), including health-related skills tocarry out a behavioral or environmentalchange. Most of these enabling factorshave been addressed by community andpolicy level interventions based on the-ories and models that help to promotechange at this level (e.g., communityorganization, organizational change,diffusion of innovations, developmentof policies and legislation models) which will be discussed later on in thecommunity and policy level sections ofthis book. reinforcing factors : According to Green and Kreuter, \"reinforcing factors arethose consequences of actions that de-termine whether the actor receivespositive (or negative) feedback and issupported socially afterward.\" Thesefactors include feedback and pressure,as well as the kinds of social supportYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FOUR | 25provided by family members, peers, teachers, employers, health providers,community leaders, and decision-makers. Furthermore, Green andKreuter highlight, in the case of ado-lescents, the characteristics of the dis-tinct developmental stages will need tobe taken into account when identifyingreinforcing factors (e.g., preadoles-cents will more likely first seek socialsupport from parents, while middleadolescents tend to seek out friends). Figure 4-2. presents a more detailed ren- dering of the fourth phase of thePRECEDE-PROCEED model shown inFigure 4-1. In this configuration, the pre- disposing, enabling, and reinforcing fac-tors that determine behavior form thefourth phase of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, educational and ecological assess-ment. Although Green and Kreuter's three cate- gories can be extremely helpful in identify-ing health determinants at different levelsof influence, they nonetheless rely on the most traditional concepts in behavior andsocial change, without a particular focus onyoung people and without addressing addi-tional important theories that incorporateother factors that predispose, enable, Predisposing Factors: knowledge beliefs values attitudes confidence Reinforcing Factors: family peers teachers employers health providers community leaders decision-makersSpecific behavior by individuals or by organizations Environment (conditions of living)Health Enabling Factors: availability of health resources accesibility of health resources community/government laws, priority, and commitment to health health-related skillsFigure 4-2.

YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE | SECTION ONE | 26and/or reinforce specific behaviors among adolescents and youth. Furthermore, thedistinction between predisposing, en-abling, and reinforcing factors is perhapsmerely didactic in purpose, but it also caninadvertently lead to confusion. As the au-thors themselves admit, sometimes thesame factor may play different roles simul-taneously (e.g., learning enabling skillsabout how to use condoms can also becomea predisposing factor for adolescents to ac-tually use them, and gaining improved nu-tritional knowledge can predispose indi-viduals to make healthier food choices aswell as enable them to plan individualizeddiets to meet any specific goals they haveset). A final observation regarding thePRECEDE-PROCEED model is that eventhough the use of theories to help iden-tify health determinants and to developtheory-based interventions is present inthis model, the lack of sufficient explicit-ness regarding the sequence of steps andactions that need to be taken may increasethe temptation of program developers todevote insufficient time to theoreticalframework choices and overall interven-tion structure and to move too prematurelyinto actual practice. Having said this, PRECEDE-PROCEED is an excellent model for health promotionplanning and program development ad-dressing multiple levels of influence.Youth: Choices and Change will attempt to serve as a complement to Green andKreuter's latest iteration of Health Pro- motion Planning by providing a review of theories pertinent to the promoting, pre-disposing, enabling, and reinforcing of healthy adolescent behaviors, while alsoincorporating a developmental (and,whenever possible, gender) perspective.This publication will also strive to comple-ment other worthy publications that em-phasize the need to follow a logical modelfor project assessment, design, and evalu- ation to address behavioral change at mul-tiple levels, but which perhaps do not ex-pand in sufficient depth in their coverageof the underlying theories and models that are helpful in guiding intervention design,particularly as regards adolescents andyouth. One of the most recent contribu-tions is Behavior Change Interventions for Sexual Health Promotion: A Manual pub- lished by the Caribbean EpidemiologyCenter (2003), which urges its readers to\"refer to the research literature, experts inthe field, [and] common sense and knowl-edge of behavior or learning theories/models\" to select the appropriate inter-vention approach. Figure 4-3. is a guide proposed by the au- thors of this book that builds on the threefactors described by Green and Kreuter asdetermining individual lifestyles andshaping environmental living conditions.The figure is intended to facilitate a closerlook by program designers at the underly-ing theories and models that help to iden-tify, promote, or change predisposing,enabling, and reinforcing factors for ado-lescent health behaviors.

In presenting this proposal, the authors of Youth: Choices and Change wish to note that they share in Green and Kreuter's preference to think ofpredisposing, enabling, and reinforcingfactors as human capacities to be strength-ened, rather than deficits or problems tobe overcome. The theories and models presented in Figure 4-3. are a selection of those the au-thors of this book consider particularlyimportant to keep in mind when design-ing health promotion and preventionprograms for adolescents and youth. Thisselection is based on a body of evidencefound in the literature regarding theoret-ical frameworks whose constructs predict youth health behavior and/or support ef-fective interventions for young people.The authors recognize that, since Youth: Choices and Change represents the first at- tempt to present a compilation of theoriesand models and the corresponding em-pirical evidence regarding their use-fulness as regards adolescent behaviorchange, some inadvertent omissionsmight have occurred. At the same time, in future editions, it will be important toinclude any relevant emerging theoriesand corresponding evidence, for whichinsufficient information was available atthe time of this book's printing. Different authors (Buchanan 2000, Kipnis 1994) have criticized the use of be- havior change theories and strategies in vertical programs designed by govern-ment agencies, international organizations, or other \"outside\" entities, which do not include community participation and which attempt to manipulate and/or coerceindividuals and groups to change their lifestyles without according due consideration tobasic issues related to human dignity, integrity, and autonomy. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the authors of this book share these criticisms and consider adolescent and community participation in the planning ofhealth promotion interventions and programs to be fundamental. The use of behaviorchange theories and strategies is merely part of understanding successful interventions.While many of these theories show great promise, they are empty without an under-standing of adolescent development processes, their social context, and how adolescentneeds and wants change as adolescents mature. A special concern is that changing beliefsand attitudes and teaching skills to adolescents might not be enough to improve theirhealth and well-being. Adolescents must be motivated to utilize the information they are provided, practice the skills they are taught, and take advantage of the services that aretargeted to them. Youth culture has, perhaps always throughout history, been misunderstood and misrep- resented by older generations, resulting in an unfortunate situation of victimization, dis-crimination, stereotyping, and mass generalization. Researchers have focused on iden-[Chapter Five ] Listening to Adolescents' Needs and Wants: A Respectful InterventionYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 30tifying behavioral determinants of health utilizing a problem-based approach thathas tended to place blame on individualsrather than searching farther beyond forenvironmental explanations. Adolescentshave been transformed into \"cases\" andlabeled as different categories of problems(\"youth at risk for substance abuse,\"\"youth at risk of early sexual initiation,\"\"youth at risk for HIV infection,\" etc.). Yet,as young people see when they observetheir parents and others around them whoare older, risk-taking in and of itself is notnecessarily an undesirable trait. In someinstances, such as when making certaincareer-related decisions, risk-taking isviewed as a very positive quality, conduciveto personal growth and maturity. So whenshould adolescents be encouraged and al-lowed to take risks, and how do they de-velop the ability to distinguish betweengood choices and bad ones, given that somany mixed messages and double stan-dards exist in the environment they sharewith others? The opportunities for risk-taking and the need to make choices are nowhere moreplentiful and powerful than for youth liv-ing in poor communities. These youth,too, bear the brunt of significant discrim-ination and exclusion by a larger societythat often engages in \"blaming the vic-tim\" when patterns emerge that many inthis group are engaging in early unpro-tected sexual relations, defending them-selves on the streets using violence, andwarding off loneliness with alcohol and/or drugs. Adolescence is a transitional period in which gradually increasing autonomy co-exists with the more traditional relation-ships of dependency upon parents, teach-ers, and other figures of authority.Adolescents need more freedom and trustin making their own choices within thelimits that family and society provide.Families, communities, and society as a whole also need to define their beliefs, at-titudes, and limits regarding different be-haviors, in order to protect young peoplefrom harming themselves or others. Somebehaviors already have a clear limit, withclear legal consequences set by societywhich are accepted by the majority of thepopulation (e.g., rape, drug possession).Other compromising behaviors lack aclear consensus among individuals in cer-tain communities (e.g., coercive use ofsex, tobacco use) and usually lack legalconsequences as well. The United Nations'Convention on the Rights of the Child pro-vides a global framework for protectingadolescents from these types of behaviors,but as long as key members of society (par-ents, teachers, community authorities)don't clarify their beliefs and attitudes to-ward these behaviors, they will have nomoral authority to pursue changes andlimits among adolescents. The challenge for those who work and in- teract with adolescents is how to best sup-port them as they learn how to improvetheir own capacity for practical autonomy,to become more mindful about theirchoices (e.g., the value of not having earlysex and of using contraceptives whenYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FIVE | 31needed), and to act accordingly, as these choices become part of their internal set ofstandards and sense of personal identity.An accumulating body of research suggeststhat taking a positive approach by promot-ing skills and assets instead of preventingdeficits seems more likely to engage ado-lescents, helping them to realize their po-tential and avoid negative influences(Child Trends 2002). This approach alsotakes into account the needs and wants ofadolescents, thereby helping to set thestage for a respectful intervention . As we have seen in the Ottawa Charter, the finalgoal of health promotion is to increasepeople's control over the determinants oftheir health by increasing their self-carecapacities, which are the decisions and ac-tions individuals take in the interest oftheir own health. In order to help adolescents take an active interest in optimizing their own health, itis necessary to understand their needs and wants . For the purposes of this book, needs are defined as the requirements to promote adolescent health and development and wants as the interests, desires, and wishes that motivate the adoption of different behav-iors. According to UNICEF (1997), adolescents have basic requirements (rights) that gov- ernments and society must ensure are sat-isfied: nutrition, exercise, recreation, andaccess to services. Several authors (Brazel-ton and Greenspan 2000, Reich 1991, Wil-son 1987) and institutions (United Na-tions Children's Fund 1997, Takanishi andHamburg 1996, World Health Organiza-tion 1989) have produced a list of basicconditions, or \"needs,\" for the healthy de-velopment of adolescents and youth: (1) to have had a healthy childhood, in a safe setting, characterized by positiveand nurturing emotional experiencesand interactions; (2) to live in a safe environment that pro- vides the basic necessities of food,rest, and protection from violent sur-roundings and traumatic experiences; (3) to maintain positive affective rela- tionships and interactions with peersand adults who offer support and op-portunities, as well as set limits andrealistic expectations and providestructure; (4) to have access to information and op- portunities that are appropriate foradolescents' level of development Box 5-1. The Definition of Needs and Wants Needs Needs are the requirements to promote adolescent health and development. Wants Wants are the personal interests, desires, wishes, and goals that motivate the adoption of different behaviors.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 32and individual differences and allow them to develop a wide range of prac-tical, vocational, and life skills; (5) to have equal access to a wide range of services, such as those related to edu-cation, employment, health, justice,recreation, and mental and emotionalwell-being; (6) to live in a supportive environment molded by policies and legislation,social values, positive role models,and behavioral norms, with positivereinforcement of these by the massmedia; (7) to live in supportive, stable communi- ties that provide cultural continuity; (8) to have a sense of belonging and the opportunity to participate and be ac-tive, contributing members of theirsocieties as parents, workers, andcitizens; (9) to believe in a promising future that offers real social and economic op- portunities, in awareness that withoutthe hope of achieving a modicum ofsocioeconomic stability, youth havelittle incentive to invest in their owneducation and to avoid unhealthyhabits; (10) to develop technical and analytical skills that allow adolescents to com-pete in the technologically savvyworld economy; and (11) to develop a motivation for continu- ous learning, the preparation for liv-ing with uncertainty and change, andthe values needed to grow up in com-munities with different ethnic, reli-gious, and cultural groups.While satisfying these basic requirements or \"needs\" will support adolescent healthand development, it might not be enoughto motivate young people to adopt healthybehaviors when confronted with newchoices. According to Acuff and Reiher(1997), a deep understanding of the ado-lescent consumer provides a \"winningformula\" for the development of products and programs that succeed with youngpeople. In their book What Kids Buy and Why , the editors describe a series of \"wants\" of adolescents regarding mediainterests and recreation. Yet as child andadolescent psychiatrist and developmentaltheorist Stanley Greenspan notes, \"it is af-fect (feelings) that gives rise and organizesthinking\" (Greenspan 1993). He alsostates that the ability to be intentional is the ability to create and direct desire, which in its very nature is experienced as an affec- tive or emotional sense of purpose(Greenspan 1997a). Adolescents want toexplore novel challenges and experiences,partake in \"grown-up\" activities, be partof a social group, have money and access to buy things of interest to them, listen tomusic, watch TV, play video games andsports, and, overall, have fun in life. Table5-1. compares common needs and wantsof adolescents. In order to develop effective health pro- motion and prevention programs for ado-lescents, it is crucial to understand the\"needs and wants\" of each gender as ado-lescents progress through different stagesand begin identifying the choices that theycan safely make on their own, the limitsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FIVE | 33 that they still need, and the healthy but en- joyable and challenging activities they canparticipate in. Behavior change theoriescan provide effective behavior changestrategies that will help adolescentsachieve their self-set goals. Theories canalso contribute strategies that strengthenadolescents' capabilities to organizeamong themselves and make positivechanges in their social group and the com- munity to support new healthy lifestylechoices. The challenge facing designers ofprograms and interventions is how toachieve an adequate balance of response toboth adolescent needs and their wants,while providing opportunities, protecting,and motivating young people to adopt andmaintain healthy behaviors.NEEDS WANTS Love, ongoing nurturing relationship Autonomy Acceptance Social interactionDevelopmentally appropriate experiences and \"Grown-up\" experiencessuccessOpportunities and guidance NoveltyExpectations, limits, and values Humor and funSafe and supportive environments at home and Music, television shows and movies, video andschool and in neighborhoods computer games, magazines and books, hang out with friends at social places, parties Structures that provide healthy nutrition, Fast foods, sports, stay up latephysical activity, and proper sleepTable 5-1. Comparison of Common Needs and Wants of Adolescents Source: Breinbauer and Maddaleno/PAHO The importance of acknowledging the developmental processes of adolescents when planning health promotion and prevention programs has been emphasizedpreviously in the literature. Linda Juszczak and Lois Sadler (1999), in their arti- cle \"Adolescent Development: Setting the Stage for Influencing Health Behaviors,\" un-derscore the importance of assessing individuals within the stage of adolescence they arecurrently undergoing, and tailoring interventions specifically for the abilities and inter-ests of that age group. Joy Dryfoos (1998), in her book Safe Passage (Making It through Ado- lescence in a Risky Society: What Parents, Schools, and Communities Can Do) , also empha- sizes the importance of developmentally appropriate programs to achieve effectiveness.She notes that the most effective programs relate to teenagers according to where theyoung people \"are\" developmentally speaking, instead of where health and other types ofprofessionals think they ought to be, based on their body size, appearance, and/orchronological age. One of the key concepts of social marketing, increasingly used in the field of public health and social communications projects, is audience segmentation, or differentia-tion of large groups of people into smaller, more homogeneous subgroups. Acuff (1997)divides the period from 8 to 19 years of age into 4 different stages (preadolescence, andearly, middle, and late adolescence). In 2001, the National Youth Anti-Drug MediaCampaign in the United States adjusted its campaign targets from the original group of9-17-year-olds to those ages 11 to 14 (U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy2002b). [Chapter Six ] The Crucial Link between Theories and Developmental Stages ofAdolescencePAHO and the World Health Organization define \"adolescence\" as the period be-tween 10 and 19 years of age and \"youth\" asthe period between 15 and 24 years of age.This distinction has been made to high-light the growing consensus that effectiveinterventions can no longer pretend totarget \"adolescence\" and \"youth\" as a uni-fied homogeneous group, since strategiesand the goals of the interventions devel-oped will vary for different adolescentstages and by gender. With this in mind,Section Three of this book is devoted to athorough discussion of the various stagesof adolescent development, with particular emphasis on preadolescence and earlyadolescence, the needs and wants specificto these age groups, and how they are fur-ther differentiated by gender. At this juncture, it should also be noted that PAHO considers that the single-mostimportant of all these groups to be targetedby health promotion and prevention pro-grams is the preadolescence period. Untilrecently, the great majority of interven-tions promoting safer sex practices, forexample, have been directed to middle andlate adolescents (e.g., increasing condomuse and developing other necessary nego-tiation skills to ensure safe sexual prac-tices). Yet preadolescence marks the ad-vent of increased sexuality and intimacydevelopment, which will continue throughearly, middle, and late adolescence. In thissense, Youth: Choices and Change is in- tended to serve as a practical guide forprogram designers to plan developmen-tally appropriate goals for interventions,with an emphasis on promoting the adop- tion and maintenance of health behaviorsbeginning with preadolescence, instead oflater on, when health-compromising be-haviors have already begun and may bewell engrained, thus making them moredifficult to change. Section Three of this book will stress the overarching importance of integrating be-havior change theories with developmen-tal goals to improve adolescent health, astrategy that PAHO believes has, for toolong, been overlooked and underutilizedin the design of adolescent health noted the paucity of efforts to an-alyze the concepts and constructs of be-havior change theories with a develop-mental perspective. Part of the explanation for this situation lies in the fact that traditional behaviorchange theories are often referred to in theliterature as \"learning theories.\" Learningtheorists stress the context within whichbehavior takes place and are not especiallydevelopmental in their approach. Forlearning theorists, the basic processes ofhuman behavior are the same during ado-lescence as they are during other periodsof the life span. The introduction of be- havior change theories to increase effec-tiveness of health education and healthpromotion interventions was first used toaddress adult behaviors (e.g., the HealthBelief Model, discussed in Chapter Eight YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIX | 35YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 36of this book) and then extrapolated to tar- get adolescent lifestyles. The shortcomings and gaps of a \"theories- only\" approach, within the context of ado-lescent health, are quite clear, since thisage group is in a state of constant changeand rapid development. As Mary Pipher,author of Reviving Ophelia (1994), writes: \"Adolescence is a fascinating time ofmarked internal development and massivecultural indoctrination.\" The benefit oftailoring the application of behaviorchange theories, concepts, and constructsto the developmental stage and by genderenables the resulting interventions to bet-ter guide adolescents through the com-plex and ever-changing web of socio-environmental factors that make up theirlives. An integrated approach allows programs to be developed that analyze adolescentbehavior with the framework of social envi-ronment and developmental stage and en-ables program designers to orient inter-ventions by considering the followingquestions: Do determinants of adolescent healthbehaviors described by different theo-ries (e.g., subjective norm, perceived behavioral control) change through dif-ferent developmental stages? If so, inwhat ways? Are there adolescent gender-specificbehavior determinants tobacco, al-cohol, and drug use; nutrition activity; sexual activity and contra-ceptive use; and violence? If so, how andwhy must interventions for girls andboys be structured differently? Are there any other preadolescent be-haviors that have not been sufficientlyaddressed that should be promoted to help adolescents adopt health-enhancing behaviors? The answers to these and other similar types of questions will vary from commu-nity to community, culture to culture, andage group to age group in response to localrealities. Therefore, the mix of programdesign elements will be unique as well, re-quiring health promoters to approach pro-gram design with a clear understanding ofthe target audience, the behavior changetheories which may applied, and why (orwhy not) they might be appropriate. As we saw in Chapter Two of this book, longitudinal research is increasingly pointing to the efficacy of adopting broad-based, multilevel approaches to be-havior change rather than concentrating on changing individual behavior in isolation. Chapter Four presents three ecological levels\u2014interpersonal, community, andpublic policy\u2014at which, optimally, change also needs to occur in order to support and re-inforce change at the individual ecological level. Chapter Six discusses the importance ofidentifying the target group by stage of development (preadolescence; early, middle, orlate adolescence), while Chapter Five shows why adolescent needs and wants need to betaken into account when developing respectful health-promoting interventions. ChaptersTwo and Three illustrate how behavioral change theories may be used to close the gap be- tween the knowledge young people possess about how to lead healthy lives and actual pos-itive changes they decide to make on their own to initiate these healthy lifestyles. The basic elements highlighted in the first six chapters of this book provide a complete framework within which program designers may develop a series of interventions to sup-port adolescents and youth in achieving and maintaining healthy behaviors andlifestyles. In this chapter, the Youth: Choices and Change Model is presented to enabledesigners to better visualize what their fully constructed program might look like. Themodel, developed by PAHO, provides a grid interlinking the components describedabove (Figure 7-1.) and allows designers to build programs utilizing a step-by-step ap-proach. The model's key conceptual components are further defined and/or reviewed inBox 7-1. [Chapter Seven ] The Youth: Choices and Change Model for Designing EffectiveInterventions for AdolescentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 38 During the design of adolescent health programs, it is important to distinguishbetween health behavior determinants ,as described in most of the health educationtextbooks (Box 7-1.), and health determi- nants ,as described by the population health approach (Health Canada 2003, Frankish et al. 1996), which aims to improve thehealth of the entire population and to re-duce health inequities among populationgroups. The population health approach describes a broad range of factors andconditions that have a strong influence onour health, which are described as health determinants , and are identified as the fol- lowing: income and social status social support networks education and literacy employment/working conditions Individual level theories Individual needs and wants of adolescents of different ages, genders, and cultureClusters of individual health-promoting developmental capacities and health-compromising determinants and behaviors Clusters of interpersonal health-promoting and health-compromising determinants and behavior Clusters of community health-promoting health-compromising and behaviorClusters of more of more interpersonal health-promoting determinants and behaviorsClusters of more developmentally recommended health-promoting capacities, determinants, and behaviors Clusters of more health-promoting regulations and policiesClusters of health-promoting and health-compromising regulations and policiesIndividual level interventions Interpersonal level interventions Community level interventions Policy level interventionsPolicy needs and wants of adolescents, parents, and policymakersCommunity needs and wants of adolescents, parents, and other community actorsInterpersonal needs and wants of adolescents, parents, teachers, and peersPreadolescent boys' and girls' health-promoting lifestyles Early adolescent lifestyles Late adolescent boys' and girls' young adolescent boys' and girls' level theories Policy level theoriesFigure 7-1.

Definition of Terms Used in the Youth: Choices and Change Model Health behavior determinants are the conditions and circumstances that influence behaviors which, in turn, affect health. Within the framework of behavior change theories, they consist of aseries of theoretical constructs that predict behavior (e.g., attitudes, perceived benefits, intentions,subjective norms). These conditions or behavior determinants can be identified at all four ecologicallevels: the individual (e.g., attitudes), interpersonal (e.g., role models), community (e.g., youth em-powerment), and policy (e.g., public policies). Determinants may be expressed as variables, may bemeasured and changed, and may serve as indicators of progress towards behavior change. Health-promoting determinants are those determinants, at different levels of intervention, which facilitate the adoption of healthy behaviors (e.g., positive attitudes towards condom use, positive rolemodels, youth participation in HIV prevention campaigns, effective policies for condom availability).Protective factors, described by the Resiliency Theory (see Chapter Nineteen), as well as develop-mental assets, are health-promoting determinants. Health-compromising determinants are those determinants which facilitate the adoption of un- healthy behaviors (e.g., negative attitudes towards condom use, role models favoring early unpro-tected sex, lack of social support and networks, policies restricting condom distribution). Risk factorsare health-compromising determinants. Health-promoting developmental capacities are those age-appropriate developmental capaci- ties which facilitate the adoption of healthy behaviors (e.g., to have developed a personal convictionagainst early sexual relationships during preadolescence, to be able to set limits in sexuality explo-ration and negotiate alternative behaviors to intercourse for channeling sexual arousal during earlyadolescence). Needs are the requirements, by different actors at different levels (e.g., adolescents, parents, teach- ers, community leaders, policymakers), to promote adolescent health and development. Wants are the personal interests, desires, wishes, and goals of different actors (e.g., adolescents, parents, teachers, community leaders, policymakers) at different levels that motivate the adoption ofvarious types of behaviors. Heath-promoting lifestyles refer to a cluster of behaviors that can help to preserve adolescent health, including sexual behaviors, and those related to violence; alcohol, tobacco, and drug use; andnutritional habits and physical activity. In identifying developmental stages: preadolescent refers to girls who are ages 9-12 and boys who are ages 10-13; early adolescent refers to girls ages 12-14 and boys ages 13-15; middle adolescent refers to girls ages 14-16 and boys ages 15-17; late adolescent refers to girls ages 16-18 and boys ages 17-18; youth refers to boys and girls ages 18-21; and young adult refers to boys and girls ages 21-24.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 40Within the definition of health determi- nants utilized by the population health ap-proach, health behavior determinants would be one of those listed above; specifically,the \"personal health practices and copingskills\" determinant. This differentiationparticularly applies when the concept ofhealth behavior determinants is used to de-scribe those determinants that affect indi-vidual behaviors at the individual level,without considering the other levels of in-fluence. Nevertheless, experts working inthe health education and health behaviorfields have also incorporated more andmore this broader notion of health deter-minants, defining health behavior as \"theactions of individuals, groups, and organi-zations as well as their determinants, corre-lates, and consequences, including socialchange, policy development and imple-mentation, improved coping skills, of andLewis 2002; Parkerson 1993). How-ever, for the health behavior approach, ef-forts to improve environmental factors, policies, and the above-listed broaderhealth determinants should in the end beevaluated for their effects on measurablechanges in health behavior or health out-comes. Glanz and colleagues (2002) cautionthat a policy change that does not lead tomeasurable changes in behavior may be ei-ther too weak or too short-lived, or be onlya limited determinant of behavior. Putting It All Together\u2014The Youth: Choices and Change Model The following steps will help developers of adolescent health programs to approachprogram planning systematically, allowing reflection about each of the components tobe included in the design of interventionsand facilitating the decision-makingprocess: (1) Identify the target group: adolescent stage and gender. In applying the Youth: Choices and Change Model, PAHO recommendsthat program designers begin by identify-ing the specific adolescent stage(s) andgender(s) they are going to target, given thestated needs and goals of the different ac-tors involved. It is worthwhile noting that,historically, the needs frequently stated asbeing urgent are those related to changingmiddle and late adolescent behaviors,without due consideration being given tothe value of focusing instead on buildingthe strengths and positive behaviors ofthese age groups. As pointed out in ChapterFive, recent research shows that taking apositive approach by promoting skills andassets instead of preventing deficits has abetter chance of engaging the interest andparticipation of adolescents, helping themto achieve their potential and avoid nega-tive influences (Child Trends 2002). Forthese reasons, PAHO advises that programdesigners make special efforts to interveneearly and to also target pre- and early ado-lescents, even when community membersin these age groups might not yet showovert signs of health-compromising be-haviors. (2) Identify adolescent needs and wants. As we will see in much greater detail inSection Three of this book, adolescentYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVEN | 41needs and wants will vary according to gender and the various different stages ofdevelopment. Nevertheless, an awarenessand understanding of the needs and wantsof girls and boys at different ages, within the cultural context of the community it-self, is crucial to the development of suc-cessful health interventions. Since cul-tural and social values will vary fromcommunity to community, learning thespecific needs and wants of the local ado-lescent population usually occurs by or-ganizing small focus groups among thetarget population. (3) Identify level of intervention . As we saw in Chapter Four, adolescents live in a complexenvironment in which they are subject tomultiple levels of influence for health-re-lated behaviors: individual, interpersonal,institutional and/or organizational, com-munity, and public policy. Given that thebody of research continues to grow indicat-ing that successful behavior change is bestachieved if multilevel inputs are providedto support and reinforce this change syner-gistically, PAHO recommends that inter-ventions calling for positive change be in-corporated at each ecological level ratherthan focusing exclusively on changing in-dividual behavior. (4) Identify other actors' needs and wants. In a multilevel approach, the needs andwants of the other actors involved in pro-moting healthy adolescent lifestyles\u2014parents, other family members, care-givers, teachers, peers, community leaders,and others\u2014will need to be taken into ac-count in order to secure this group's active support of and participation in the inter-ventions and programs created. Since themembers of this diverse group relate toadolescents in different ways, each willbring unique perspectives to the designprocess, enhancing the possibility of de-signing and implementing respectful in-terventions that are meaningful and age-appropriate for the recipients, therebystimulating greater interest and commit-ment on the latter's part. (5) Identify the theories that will support the design of the intervention. The Youth: Choices and Change Model proposes thatat least one theory be selected at each ecologi-cal level to guide the design of interven- tions. Table 4-1. shows the various theo-ries that may be applied at each level, andSection Two of this book explores each ofthe theories within its ecological context.But before theoretical frameworks are se-lected, ideally composed of theories cho-sen from the different ecological levels,program designers will need to utilize aproblem-driven psychological approach(see Chapter Three) to answer the ques-tions that will lead to a better understand-ing of the specific problem at hand andwhat needs to be done to achieve change. (6) Translating theory into practice. The selection of meaningful theories to addressa specific adolescent behavior or challenge(e.g., adopting responsible and reasonabledrinking habits, reducing overall alcoholdrinking among adolescents) will help toidentify clusters of health-promoting andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION ONE | 42health-compromising determinants (e.g., attitudes, subjective norms, choice of rolemodels, coping strategies, poverty, local al-cohol regulations for youth) and behaviors(e.g., adolescent drinking behaviors,parental drinking habits, school connect-edness, ease of access to alcohol products)at each ecological level. The challenge is totranslate those theoretical constructs intomeasurable variables before the interven- tion, so that changes may be measured after the intervention. In this way, the interven-tions will follow a logical design that in-cludes assessment and evaluation, one ofthe key elements in the development ofsuccessful adolescent health interventionsand programs (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services 2002a), as we saw inChapter Four. The selected theories will also help to design the interventions at each ecolog-ical level in order to decrease the amount of health-compromising deter-minants and behaviors and increase theamount of health-promoting determi-nants and behaviors after the interventiontakes place. Although adopting and main-taining health-promoting behaviorsamong adolescents and changing health-compromising behaviors at each level isthe ultimate goal, the process of achieving this might require targeting determinantsof behaviors first (e.g., attitudes), which can then serve as measurable process in- dicators before changes in outcome indi- cators (final behavior) are ultimately obtained. The Youth: Choices and Change Model also proposes targeting not only adolescent-specific determinants and behaviors (e.g.,attitudes toward alcohol, resistance skillswhen offered alcohol) but also promotingthe strengthening of developmental ca-pacities appropriately gauged for pre- andearly adolescent boys and girls through the interventions, which will, in turn,strengthen their abilities to make con-scious healthy decisions (e.g., to improvemood regulation, control expression ofemotions, critically analyze role modelsthat involve excessive or irresponsibledrinking habits). These developmental ca-pacities will be more fully discussed inSection Three of this book. *** Throughout the world, there is a growing number of successful adolescent healthinitiatives that incorporate the elementsdiscussed so far in this book. Many ofthese were presented at an internationalconference sponsored by the World HealthOrganization in Stockholm, Sweden, in2001 (Foxcroft et al. 2001). One of these is\"Strengthening Families,\" a highly effec-tive alcohol and drug prevention programdeveloped in the United States by IowaState University and consisting of seven 2-hour sessions and four booster sessionsduring which parents work to improvetheir parenting skills and adolescentsstrive to achieve more effective communi-cation with their parents (Iowa State Uni-versity 1997). The program has been sci-entifically evaluated and shown to beYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVEN | 43effective and is recognized by four U.S. federal agencies: the National Institute onDrug Abuse and the Departments of Edu-cation, Justice, and Health and HumanServices. Youth attending the program hadsignificantly lower rates of alcohol, to-bacco, and marijuana consumption, aswell as school conduct problems, com-pared to their control group counterparts.Furthermore, the differences betweenprogram and control youth were shown toincrease over time, indicating that theskills learned and the strengthening ofparent-child relationships continued tomanifest their influence as these youthprogressed through their adolescent years. Perhaps the proven effectiveness of the \"Strengthening Families\" program lies intwo key ingredients: first, that it promotessimultaneous changes at the individual, in-terpersonal, and community levels; andsecondly, that it targets pre- and early ado-lescents (in this case, ages 10 to 14), which,as we have already seen, is a critical agegroup to be targeted by any and all adoles-cent health promotion initiatives. Impor- tant, also, is the fact that the program takesinto account the needs of other actors\u2014from family members and caregivers tocommunity leaders\u2014and that it is based ontheories that facilitate the design of inte-grated interventions occurring across thelines of the different ecological levels. In Section Two, we will review a variety of behavior change theories at different lev-els of intervention that are consideredparticularly relevant in the design of ado-lescent health promotion and preventionprograms. Like the components of thetheoretical framework of \"StrengtheningFamilies,\" the theories presented have demonstrated their ability to achieve pos-itive results. The participants themselveshave reported that they find the interven-tions to be innovative and appealing, per-haps because adolescents are granted theopportunity for greater autonomy andchallenged to make conscious choices thatplace them firmly in charge of their owngrowth and maturation process. [Section Two] Theories and Models for Health Promotion andBehavior Change: Their Application toAdolescentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE | |SECTION TWO | 46Theories and Models that Promote Change at the Individual Level As we saw in Chapter Four, behavior, when viewed from an ecological perspective, is af-fected by\u2014and has an effect on\u2014multiple levels of influence. The levels of influence forhealth-related behaviors and conditions that have been identified are the following(McLeroy et al. 1988): (1) individual factors;(2) interpersonal factors;(3) community and organizational factors; and(4) public policy factors From this ecological perspective, behavior both influences and is influenced by the social environment. This multilevel, interactive perspective clearly shows the advantages ofmultilevel interventions, such as those that combine developmental, behavioral, and en-vironmental components. For example, adolescents are less likely to take up smoking ifthey reach early adolescence with a strong internal sense of what is \"right\" and what is\"wrong,\" and believe that smoking is unpopular, even if this feeling disagrees with that ofother peers (individual level). Similarly, if their best friends also disapprove of the habit,their role models do not smoke, and they have developed healthy coping mechanisms todeal with the daily pressures of their personal lives, they will be less inclined to beginsmoking (interpersonal level). Adolescents will also be less likely to adopt this behaviorif they live and study in a smoke-free environment and listen to mass media advertisingwith attractively designed messages that encourage health-promoting lifestyles (com-munity level). And finally, adolescents will also be more inclined to refrain from tobaccouse if product prices are high and laws that prohibit tobacco sales to minors are strictlyenforced (public policy level). Theories on health behavior attempt to explain health behaviors (\"explanatory theories or theories of the problem\") and propose ways to reach behavior change (\"theories of action that guide the development of interventions\"). Oftentimes, one theory seems to be in-sufficient to explain the complexities of health behavior, leading to the development ofmodels of health behavior. Models draw on a number of theories and empirical findings to help people understand a specific problem within a particular setting or context(Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002). Theories also form the basis for evaluation, ensuringYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INDIVIDUAL LEVEL | 47that the evaluator will set realistic and achievable expected results before the interven- tion begins and that these results can be measured following the intervention. Chapters Eight through Fifteen of Section Two will deal with the first level, that of chang- ing individual behavior. Individuals constitute the basic units of groups, families, orga-nizations, schools, communities, and governments. Individual behavior shapes dimen-sions of collective health behavior and vice versa, including the complex interactionbetween the two. In the above-mentioned chapters, the following theories and models ofindividual health behavior will be reviewed in the context of working with adolescents: the Health Belief Model the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change the Theory of Reasoned Action the Theory of Planned Behavior the Goal-Setting Theory the Self-Regulation Theory the Sensation-Seeking Theory As in the subsequent chapters in Section Two, which deal with the remaining three eco- logical levels of influence, a description of relevant theories and models will be pre-sented, followed by a discussion of how these constructs may be applied to specific ado-lescent behaviors, such as reproductive health and sexual activity; violence; tobacco,alcohol, and drug use; and nutrition and physical activity. Each theory or model will beanalyzed from a developmental perspective and include observations on its applicationas it relates to the different stages of adolescence. At the same time, gender differencesfor behavior determinants will be highlighted.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 48 Recommended Bibliography for Section Two For further reading on topics related to health education, health behavior, and health promotion, the following works may be of interest: Theory at a Glance: Guide for Health Promotion Practice (Glanz and Rimer 1995) Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice (Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002, 1997) Intervention Mapping: Designing Theory- and Evidence-Based Health Promotion Pro-grams (Bartholomew et al. 2001) Emerging Theories in Health Promotion Practice and Research: Strategies for Improving Public Health (DiClemente, Crosby, and Kegler 2002) An Ethic for Health Promotion: Rethinking the Sources of Human Well-Being (Buchanan 2000).The Health Belief Model was one of the first models to adapt theory from the be- havioral sciences to health problems, and it remains today one of the mostwidely recognized conceptual frameworks of health behavior. It was originally introduced in the 1950s by psychologists Hochbaum, Kegels, Levanthal, and Rosenstockof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Hochbaum 1958). This model predicts that individuals will take action to ward off, screen for, or control illness if they: regard themselves as susceptible to the condition (perceived susceptibility) believe the condition to have potentially serious consequences (perceived severity) believe that a course of action available to them would be beneficial in reducingeither their susceptibility to the condition or the severity thereof (perceived benefits) believe that the anticipated barriers to (or costs of) taking action are outweighedby its benefits (perceived barriers) An additional concept, cues to action , would activate the \"readiness to act\" in the model. These cues may be bodily events (symptoms) and/or environmental events (the use ofreminders, how-to information, media publicity, and activities promoting increasedawareness), which serve to instigate action. Another concept, self-efficacy, was added later by Rosenstock and others in 1988 to the model. Self-efficacy is defined as \"the con-viction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes\"[Chapter Eight] The Health Belief ModelYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 50(Bandura 1977). This concept was added in recognition of the challenges presented inmodifying lifestyles and behaviors in thelong term, since the problems involved inmodifying such habits as eating, drinking,exercising, smoking, and sexual practicesrequire a good deal of confidence that onecan, in fact, alter such lifestyles beforesuccessful change is possible. In summary, in the Health Belief Model, for behavioral change to succeed, people must feel threatened by their current behav- ioral patterns, and they must believe thatchange of a specific kind will be beneficialby resulting in a valued outcome at an ac-ceptable cost. At the same time, they mustbelieve that they have the ability to over-come any and all perceived barriers to tak-ing action. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Health BeliefModel to Adolescent Lifestyles The Health Belief Model can be a very use- ful one when working with adults, but itshould be used with caution with adoles-cents. Because of the assumption that theperson must feel threatened by their cur- rent behavior, the model may be used forcertain adolescent concerns (e.g., bodyimage and fat consumption for girls) butnot necessarily for all risk behaviors, es-pecially if the individual does not feelthreatened. Younger children (i.e., 8-10years) have reported higher levels of fearintensity than older children and adoles-cents (i.e., 10-16 years), although the lat-ter group tends to report more fears relat-ing to illness, disease, and school (Gullone2000). There is some evidence that sensation- seeking traits, which represent the opti-mistic tendency to approach novel stimuliand explore the environment, accompa-nied by increased risk behaviors, rise be-tween 9 and 14 years of age and begin todecline in late adolescence (Zuckerman1994). During adolescence, increases inrisk behaviors can be accompanied by agreater perception of prevalence of the be-haviors in the surrounding environment,along with decreases in perceptions of vul-nerability and of the influence of healthand safety concerns on behaviors. Al- Box 8-1. The Health Belief Model: Key Theoretical Concepts in the Adoption of Healthy Behaviors perceived susceptibility: Individuals consider themselves at risk. perceived severity: Individuals consider the risk to have serious consequences. perceived benefits: Individuals consider that taking actions will be beneficial. perceived barriers: Individuals consider that the costs are less than the benefits. cues to action: reminders (e.g., symptoms, media publicity) that instigate action to adopt a health-promoting behavior self-efficacy: the conviction that one can successfully execute the health-promoting behavior required to produce outcomesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHT | 51though adolescents can become more aware of risks, they can also modify theirthinking in ways that enable their contin-ued participation in risky situations (Ger-rard et al. 1996). For the adolescent, risk-taking may have fewer perceived costs andmore benefits, because of immature cog-nition; the need for novelty, esteem, andconfidence; and a relative lack of lifeexperiences. Sturges and Rogers (1996) applied theo- ries of health psychology, such as theHealth Belief Model, to 10-year-oldpreadolescents ( n= 112) who had not reached the stage operationalthought, 15-year-olds ( n= 67), and 20- year-olds ( n = 93). The authors found that among adolescents and young adults, thethreat appeals worked only if people be-lieved they could cope effectively with thedanger; if they believed they could notcope, higher levels of the threat resulted indecreased intentions to refrain from to-bacco use. Although preadolescents un-derstood the information about threatseverity and personal vulnerability, thefragility and malleability of the preadoles-cent's beliefs in self-efficacy demon-strated the importance of adding a devel-opmental perspective to theories ofpreventive health psychology. One promising future use of the Health Belief Model with adolescents and tobaccoconcerns their attitudes towards second-hand smoke, as seen in one recent study(Glantz and Jamieson 2000). The studyfound that the only statistically significantpredictor of planning to stop or having ac- tually stopped smoking among adolescentswas believing that secondhand smokeharmed nonsmokers, which more thandoubled the chances of planning to stopsmoking or actually doing so. The samestudy found that nonsmoking teens weretwice as likely to consider secondhandsmoke dangerous as smokers. This sug-gests that educating young people aboutthe dangers of secondhand smoke and, atthe same time, empowering nonsmokersto speak out, should be strong elements ofany tobacco control program. These find-ings are consistent with the results of twoeconometric studies. The first showed thatthe presence of an indoor clean air law wasassociated with lower teen smoking(Wasserman et al. 1991). The second indi-cated that secondhand smoke is a highlyeffective message for reaching young peo-ple through focus group studies of anti-tobacco advertising for teens (Goldmanand Glantz 1998). These findings also may be explained by understanding adolescent development.Although adolescents might not feel per-sonally threatened by their current or fu-ture smoking behavior because of theirsense of invulnerability and their need toexplore risky situations, they might indeedfeel threatened, concerned, or responsiblefor the possibility of harming others, espe- cially those perceived as being more vul-nerable than they are. During adolescence,standing up against unfair situations andthe fear of contributing to these injusticesmight be a powerful motivation for change. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 52Another promising future use of the Health Belief Model in adolescents couldbe the use of short-term instead of long-term consequences as something adoles-cents would fear. This could be the case fordiscouraging driving while drinking alco-hol. Although most adolescents know thatthis is a potentially harmful behavior,many of them still make the decision to doso. Reaching the legal age to obtain a dri-ver's license is a universal dream amongadolescents. A recent U.S. study, using theHealth Belief Model (Gotthoffer 1999),revealed that the consequence youth fearmost is being charged with driving underthe influence (DUI), yet current anti-drinking and driving public service an-nouncements rarely portray this as a pos-sible negative consequence. This studyprovides information to effectively targetyouth with media campaigns oriented to-ward reducing drinking and driving by ad-dressing the fear of receiving a DUI andthe negative consequences this can bring. The use of the model to promote regular physical activity among youths has beenless successful. Messages that focus on thebenefits of avoiding future chronic dis-eases are not effective in motivating youth.Nor do beliefs about the health benefits ofphysical activity correspond to actual ac-tivity levels among adolescents (Strauss etal. 2001). Yet, in another study, the per-ceived immediate benefits and barriers, two other key concepts in the Health BeliefModel, have been shown to exert some in-fluence on the physical activity of adoles-cents (Sallis et al. 1992). Perceived barriersin particular can be a very useful theoreti- cal construct to apply when planninghealth promotion interventions. The de-sign of the intervention can include youthparticipation when helping them identifythe barriers they feel are interfering withadopting a new behavior. The interventioncan include a change in those identifiedbarriers; behaviors can be measured withand without the barriers. In a recent studyof Hispanic and African-American middle adolescent girls, the perceived barriers tophysical activity identified included nega-tive experiences in physical educationclasses, concerns about personal appear-ance after the activity, and lack of opportu-nity and accessibility (Taylor et al. 1999). The application of the Health Belief Model when promoting safer sex practices andreducing the risk of contracting HIV hasalso been challenging. Greater perceivedchance for contracting HIV and lower con-cern about HIV infection have been asso-ciated with high-risk behaviors in runawayand homeless adolescents. Nevertheless,among Asian-American students (Yep1993), the belief that the anticipated bar-riers to taking action are outweighed by itsbenefits, and awareness of the disease'sgraveness\u2014more than fear of contractingthe virus itself\u2014have proven to be signifi-cant predictors of the adoption of HIV-preventive behaviors. Partner preferencefor condoms was a strong predictor of con- sistent condom use in another study (Lar-raque et al. 1997). The self-efficacy com-ponent of this model seems to play acrucial role in adolescents' confidence inYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHT | 53their ability to discuss and insist on condom use with a partner (Mahoney,Thombs, and Ford 1995). The Health Belief Model has also been used to explain parents' participation inat-home sexuality education activities foradolescents. Perceived self-efficacy andperceived barriers were the most signifi-cant factors differentiating parents in-volved in these activities from those notinvolved. Compared with highly involvedparents, noninvolved parents were: (1)less confident that their children (ninthgrade students) wanted to participate inthe activities with them; (2) less sure oftheir children's desire to talk with themabout sex-related issues; and (3) less cer-tain that their own knowledge of AIDS-related issues was current. Parents highlyinvolved in these activities reported be-coming more comfortable talking withtheir adolescents about sexually transmit-ted infections (STIs) and felt that theirchildren talked a little more openly withthem about AIDS and STIs after partici-pating in the activities. In contrast, unin-volved parents reported no changes rela-tive to communicating with their childrenabout sexuality (Brock and Beazley 1995). This book's authors found only one article analyzing the Health Belief Model with adevelopmental perspective (Petosa andJackson 1991). The purpose of this studywas to use the model concepts to predictsafer sex intentions among adolescents of different ages (seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade students). A predictivemodel was constructed of the Health Belief Model variables. The model was able topredict better safer sex intentions amongyounger students, accounting for 43% ofthe variance in safer sex intentions amongseventh graders, and only 27% of the vari-ance for ninth graders and 17% of the vari-ance for eleventh graders. The results ofthis study suggest that the Health BeliefModel variables can be useful in guidingthe design of educational programs to pro-mote safer sex intentions in younger stu-dents, but their effectiveness decreases asthey get older. Although the model has been widely used among the general population, its specificuse with the adolescent population has notyet been analyzed. Research for this publi-cation included an extensive MEDLINEsearch that retrieved all published articlesusing the Health Belief Model to addressdifferent adolescent lifestyles and behav-iors. This review indicated that the major-ity of research using the model was in thearea of sexual health in an attempt to re-duce teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and STIs,and to increase the use of safer sexualpractices. Unfortunately, most of the re-viewed articles using the model variablesto promote safer sex practices targetedmainly middle and late adolescents andyouth. It is not surprising to continue tofind several safer sex educational pro-grams based on Health Belief Model vari-ables that target these instead of youngerage groups. Table 8-1. shows the numberof articles dedicated to each of the adoles- cent lifestyle areas of concern.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 54 Box 8-2. Summary of the Health Belief Model and Adolescent Lifestyles The model has demonstrated its usefulness in guiding the design of educational programs to promote safer sex intentions in younger students, but its effectiveness decreases as they get older. The threat appeals work only if adolescents believe they can cope effectively with the danger. Believing that secondhand smoke harms nonsmokers is a significant predictor among adolescents ofnonsmoking, planning to stop, or stopping smoking. Short-term, versus long-term, consequences for reducing drinking and driving are more effective,particularly if the consequence is the suspension of the adolescent's driver's license. Messages that focus on the benefits of avoiding future diseases are not effective in motivating youth toadopt and maintain physical activity. Perceived immediate benefits and barriers are helpful in promoting physical activity among adolescents. Perceived severity of HIV is a better predictor of the adoption of safer sex practices among adolescentsthan fear of contracting the disease. Self-efficacy plays a crucial role in adolescents' confidence in their ability to discuss and insist oncondom use with a partner. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived barriers are significant factors differentiating parents involved inat-home sexuality education activities from those who are not involved.Sexual and Reproductive Health 37 Teen Pregnancy 12 HIV/AIDS 17STIs 7 Condom Use 21 Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drug Use 18 Tobacco 11 Alcohol 10 Drugs 7 Physical Activity and Nutrition 9 Obesity 5 Physical Activity 4 Nutrition 2 Violence 2 TOTAL 66Table 8-1. Most Commonly Researched Adolescent Behaviors Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) NUMBER OF ARTICLES NUMBER OF ARTICLES ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORS USING THE HBM BY KEYWORDSThis model emerged from a comparative analysis of leading psychotherapy and behavioral change theories. The comparative analysis identified 10 processes ofchange among these theories, such as consciousness-raising from the Freudian tradition, contingency management from the Skinnerian tradition, and helping rela-tionships from the Rogerian tradition. The Transtheoretical Model uses stages of changeto integrate processes and principles of change from across major theories of interven-tion, hence the name trans theoretical (DiClemente and Prochaska 1982, Prochaska 1979). The model conceives behavioral change as a process and not an event, which involves a progression through six different stages : Pre-contemplation is the stage in which people have no intention of taking action to change their behavior in the foreseeable future, usually measured as the next sixmonths. According to DiClemente and Prochaska, people may be in this stage becausethey are uninformed or insufficiently informed about the consequences of their be-havior, or they may have tried to change a number of times in the past and have becomedemoralized about their inability to do so. The authors of this book think that there may be other reasons, as well, why adoles- cents do not move out of the pre-contemplation stage. It is particularly important inthe case of young people to also explore the underlying emotional reasons that inhibit[Chapter Nine ] The Transtheoretical Model and Stages of ChangeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 56them from taking action to move into the next stage of change. For example,they might be afraid to adopt a new be-havior (e.g., physical activity) becauseby changing a securely set habit or rou-tine, they will be exposing themselves toa new, unknown reality (e.g., competi-tion and potential failure). Not wantingto change a current health-compromis-ing behavior (e.g., fast food consump-tion, drug use) could also result from alack of motivation due to the potentialloss of pleasure if they abandon a dailyroutine they look forward to and partic-ularly enjoy (eating hamburgers, smok-ing marijuana). Adolescents may fail torecognize or even unconsciously denythey have a problem because of theselast two reasons. Contemplation is the stage in which people intend to change within the nextsix months. They are now aware of theadvantages of changing but are alsomore acutely aware of the disadvan-tages. This balance between the costsand benefits of changing can produceprofound ambivalence that can keeppeople \"stuck\" in this stage for longperiods of time. Adolescents may linger in this contempla- tion stage because a conscious weighing ofthe pros and cons provides insufficientmotivation for them to take action; theymay be overcome by an emotional aware-ness accompanied by intense feelings ofanxiety, fear, or insecurity about how totake the next step. They might also feel alack of self-efficacy in preparing a plan for action. This is a developmental skill that isnot easily acquired by many adolescents,especially younger ones, who may there-fore need external support. Preparation is the stage in which peo- ple intend to take action in the immedi-ate future, usually measured as the nextmonth. They typically have alreadytaken some significant steps within thepast year. These individuals have a planof action. Action is the stage in which people have made specific overt modifications intheir lifestyles within the past sixmonths. Maintenance is the stage in which peo- ple work to prevent relapses. They areless tempted to relapse and increasinglymore confident that they can take onfurther changes. It is estimated that thisstage lasts from six months to about fiveyears. Termination is a sixth stage that applies to some behaviors, especially thoserelated to addictions. This is the stage in which individuals experience notemptations and enjoy complete self-efficacy. Studies have shown that individuals go through these same stages when using self-help or self-management methods, orwhen they seek professional help or go toorganized programs. It is important to noteYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINE | 57 that this is a circular or spiral\u2014and not a linear\u2014model (Prochaska, DiClemente,and Norcross 1992). In other words, peopledo not go through the stages and \"gradu-ate;\" instead they are thought to progressthrough these stages at varying rates, oftenmoving back and forth along the contin-uum a number of times before attaining thegoal of maintenance. According to this the-ory, tailoring interventions to match a per-son's readiness or stage of change is essen-tial. For example, for people who are not yetcontemplating becoming more active, en-couraging a step-by-step movement alongthe continuum of change may be more ef-fective than encouraging them to move di-rectly into action. This is particularly truefor pre- and early adolescents, who still need significant guidance on the sequenc-ing and planning of new experiences (e.g.,eating more fruits and vegetables or takingpart in new sports). This model states that people use different processes of change as they move from one stage of change to another. Efficient self-change thus depends on doing the rightthing ( processes ) at the right time ( stages ). Processes of change provide importantguides for intervention programs, becausethe processes are like independent vari-ables that people need to apply to move from stage to stage. Below is a list ofprocesses that have received the most em-pirical support to date: From pre-contemplation to contemplation: Raising consciousness involves increased awareness about the causes that relate toa particular problem behavior, its con-sequences and cures. Interventions thatcan increase awareness include feed-back, confrontations, interpretations ofsymbolic or somatic behaviors, andmedia campaigns. In moving from pre-contemplation to contemplation, it is important to bringto a conscious level not only the currentbehavior and its consequences, but alsothe emotions that might be triggeringthe current behavior or lack of actiontowards a healthier behavior. Dramatic relief involves experiencing the negative emotions (fear, anxiety, worry)that go along with the unhealthy behav-ioral risks and their consequences.Psychodrama, role-playing, grieving, personal testimonies, and media cam-paigns are examples of techniques thatBox 9-1. Key Stages of Behavior Change Pre-contemplation: no intentions of taking action in the next six months Contemplation: intention to change within the next six months Preparation: intention to take action in the next month Action: engaging in new behavior within the past six months Maintenance: continuing to implement new behavior and prevent relapse (six months to five years)YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 58facilitate acknowledgement of the emo- tions' existence and a greater awarenessof why they are unpleasant and/or painful. The use of dramatic relief strategies to elicit these types of negative emotions inadolescents needs to be accompanied bythe modeling of healthy coping skills todeal with those intense emotions. Youngpeople, especially early adolescent girls,are particularly vulnerable to stress dur-ing this period, and many of them havenot yet fully developed healthy copingmechanisms. The exposure to dramaticrelief strategies without the skills to copewith strong emotions might only in-crease anxiety and denial of the behav-ior. Having said this, one of the most ef-fective dramatic relief techniquesamong young people tends to be per-sonal testimonies, in which the adoles-cent shares with others the healthy cop-ing mechanisms he or she has utilized todeal with the problematic behavior. Environmental reevaluation combines both emotional and cognitive assess-ments of how the presence or absence ofa personal habit affects one's social en-vironment, such as an assessment of theeffect of smoking on others. It can alsoinclude the awareness that one can serveas a positive or negative role model forothers. Empathy training, documen-taries, and family interventions can leadto such assessments. This strategymight be more useful for middle or lateadolescents, since it requires cognitiveand reflective empathy skills, which most pre- and early adolescents are stilldeveloping. From contemplation to preparation for action: Self-reevaluation combines both af- fective and cognitive assessments ofone's self-image with and without thepresence of a particular unhealthyhabit. Clarifying values, havinghealthy role models, and using men-tal imagery are techniques that canmove people forward to the nextstage. This strategy is particularly ap-propriate for use with pre- and earlyadolescents, since it helps tostrengthen their identity develop-ment and self-regulation abilities,which do not become fully developeduntil late adolescence. Other authors have suggested addi- tional processes for moving aheadbetween these 2 stages (Bartholomewet al. 2001) when working withadolescents: Self-efficacy and social support (De Vries and Backbier 1994) This process can involve skills train-ing in coping with the emotional dis-Box 9-2. Processes of Change: Pre-contemplation to Contemplation Raising consciousness Dramatic relief Environmental reevaluationYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINE | 59advantages of change and provide guidance on how to prepare a plan ofaction. Mobilizing social supportmight be crucial for adolescents dur-ing this stage. PAHO believes that this process of change is crucial in helping adoles-cents to move ahead, since preparinga plan of action requires develop-mental skills (sometimes called \"ex-ecutive functions,\" or self-directedactions the individual employs forself-regulation purposes) that areunderdeveloped until late adoles-cence (especially in males). Adoles-cents also need social support to bet-ter regulate the intense emotions thataccompany change and uncertainty(especially girls). Decision-making perspective(Holtgrave, Tinsley, and Kay 1995) This requires certain cognitive abili-ties that adolescents are strengthen-ing during pre-, early, and middleadolescence, which include the abil-ity to decompose problem-solvinginto small steps, visualize differentconsequences for different decisions,and overcome being overwhelmed byanxiety when confronted with severalpossible consequences. Tailoring on time horizon (Holtgrave, Tinsley, and Kay 1995) This can involve skills training intime management for adolescents,incorporating realistic, personal timehorizons into their lives and taking into account their various interests.Helping adolescents with this processof change is particularly important. Good time management also requiresthe development of executive func-tions, which are related to the matu-ration of the prefrontal lobes, the lastcerebral structures to reach fulldevelopment. Focus on important factors (Holtgrave, Tinsley, and Kay 1995) This process refers to incorporatingfactors of high importance to adoles-cents that will likely motivate them toprepare for action. Generally, adoles-cents still need guidance on how toprioritize their activities. Motivationis a key aspect of deciding to change.Linking factors that highly motivateadolescents to embrace a plan of ac-tion for adopting a new behavior orchanging a health-compromising be-havior might be crucial to success.The Goal-Setting Theory (ChapterTwelve) expands on this aspect. It is important to remember that motiva-tion in adolescents and adults oftendiffers, even if the new behavior isthe same. For example, adolescentsmight not be interested in increasingtheir level of physical activity forhealth reasons, but they might bemotivated to participate in a newsport or pastime because of its nov-elty, high sensation level, ability toproduce pleasure, or because they canenjoy it together with their friendsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 60 (e.g., rollerblading, mountain biking, rock climbing). Trying out new behavior (Maibach and Cotton 1995)This process involves changingsomething about oneself and gainingexperience from that behavior. Al-though adolescents might be eager totry out new behaviors when they aremotivated, they might also be afraidof the uncertainty of whether the new behavior is going to be a pleasurableexperience. It is crucial to supportadolescents by showing empathy fornegative feelings of fear and uncer-tainty when they are trying out a newbehavior. Persuasion of positive outcomes(Maibach and Cotton 1995)This involves promoting new positive outcome expectations and reinforc-ing already-achieved positive out-comes or progress to encourage ado-lescents to try out new behaviors.Adolescents are particularly in needof positive reinforcement while in the process of deciding to try newbehaviors that are not popular among peers (e.g., eating healthierfoods).Modeling (Maibach and Cotton 1995) This involves the illustration of mod-els that effectively overcome barriersand/or provide how-to guides for be-havior change. Adolescents needconstant modeling of new behaviors,not only by observing positive rolemodels but also by being explicitlycoached by these positive role modelson how to adopt new behaviors. From preparation to action: Self-liberation is both the belief that one can change and the commitmentand recommitment to act on that be-lief. New Year's resolutions and pub-lic testimonies are examples ofmechanisms that can enhance thewillpower necessary to follow throughwith actions signaling a new behavior. Maibach and Cotton (1995) suggested the following processes to move fromthe preparation stage to the actionstage. They are particularly relevantwithin the context of adolescence be-cause of the support and guidancethat this age group needs from a de-velopmental perspective: goal-setting : helping set specific and incremental goalsBox 9-3.

TheTheory of Reasoned Action de-scribed in Chapter Ten capturesthis concept under the construct of\"motivation to comply.\" From action to maintenance: Helping relationships combine caring, trust, openness, and acceptance aswell as support for the healthy behav-ior change. Rapport-building, atrusting relationship with a therapistor counselor, counselor calls, andbuddy systems can be sources of so-cial support. The existence of sup-portive relationships is perhaps thesingle-most important element in fa-cilitating behavior change amongadolescents. Counter-conditioning requires the learning of healthy behaviors that caneffectively substitute for problem be-haviors. Relaxation, assertion, de-sensitization, nicotine replacementtherapy, and positive self-statementsare strategies for discovering health-ier, safer substitutes. It is crucial to help adolescents iden- tify healthy behaviors that can replaceproblematic behaviors. Young peoplewill adopt new, healthier behaviors ifthey satisfy the need which thehealth-compromising behavior wasformerly fulfilling (e.g., need for novelty, pleasure, high sensation-seeking; regulation of positive andnegative affections or moods; be-longing to a social group). Sometimesa health-compromising behaviormight be serving as a strategy toachieve a highly motivating goal foradolescents (e.g., smoking to controlweight among girls, being accepted by Box 9-4. Processes of Change: Preparation to Action Self-liberation Goal-setting Skill improvement Coping with barriers Modeling Pleasing loved onesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 62a particular social group). The chal- lenge is to help adolescents identifyeffective health-promoting substi-tutes that can also satisfy these basicneeds. Contingency management provides consequences for taking steps in aparticular direction. Although con-tingency management can includethe use of punishments, the literatureasserts that individuals who want tomake significant changes in theirlives rely much more on rewards thanon punishments. Therefore, rein-forcements are emphasized, since the philosophy of the stages of behavioralchange model is to work in harmonywith a person's natural dispositiontowards change. Contingency con-tracts, overt and covert reinforce-ments, and group recognition areprocedures for increasing rewards aswell as the probability that healthierresponses will be maintained. Ado-lescents need constant positive rein-forcements and rewards when adopt- ing a new behavior or changing ahealth-compromising behavior. Theyalso need clear limits. Parents andadolescents should define in advancethe consequences of oversteppingthose limits as a mechanism to rein-force recognition by adolescents that they will be held accountable for theiractions. Stimulus control involves removing reminders or cues to engage in theunhealthy behavior and replacing them with cues or reminders to en-gage in the healthy behavior. Avoid-ance, environmental reengineering,and self-help groups can providestimuli that support change and re-duce risks for relapse. The ability toeffectively apply stimulus control isdirectly related to the two key compo-nents of self-efficacy :confidence and temptation. Confidence is the situation-specific trust ingrained in people, wherebythey can cope with high-risk orchallenging situations and still en-gage in the new healthy behaviorwithout relapsing. Temptation describes the intensity of urges to engage in a specific habit when in the midst of difficultsituations. The three most com-mon types of tempting situationsare: negative feelings or emotionaldistress social occasions conducive to thehabit cravings Pre- and early adolescents need support and reminders to deal with temptations,especially when their self-control is poor.They also need support, guidance, andpractice on how to redirect their behav-iors. Increased confidence will result fromthis process, but it requires adult involve-ment. From a developmental perspective,pre- and early adolescents need trainingin recognizing temptations and then devel-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINE | 63oping a plan on how to redirect their be- haviors towards healthier alternatives.Constant monitoring of how they deal withdaily temptations is also necessary in thecase of these age groups. Social liberation involves the realization, on the part of the adolescent, that socialnorms are changing in favor of support-ing the healthy behavior change. Thiscould be an important process to applywhen dealing with socially ambiguousbehaviors (e.g., sexual coercion, to-bacco use). Adolescents need to beaware of social norms of what is \"ac-ceptable\" or \"desirable\" in order to de-velop healthy lifestyles. This process ofsocial liberation could also be used tohelp adolescents redefine what is \"cool\"and what is not, what is \"in\" and what is\"out.\" This requires an increase in so-cial opportunities or alternatives, espe-cially for young people who are rela-tively deprived of access to fun healthyalternatives. Advocacy, empowermentexercises, and appropriate policies canproduce increased opportunities forhealth promotion. Examples of thesepolicies include smoke-free zones,salad bars in school lunchrooms, and easy access to condoms and other con-traceptives, all of which serve to signifythe changing of social norms in favor ofhealthier alternatives. The processes listed above are each inte- gral facets of moving from the stage ofpre-contemplation to actual behavioralchange, and there is a wide variety ofstudies across a broad range of behaviorsand populations that provide empiricalsupport to each of the stages andprocesses of the Transtheoretical Model.However, if interventionists are to meetthe needs of entire populations, they mustalso know how to distribute the messagesand efforts devoted to each stage andprocess when targeting specific high-riskbehaviors. Although there are variationsin the distribution of high-risk behaviors,the results of a variety of studies support ageneral rule of thumb: at any given time,approximately 40% of the population willbe in the pre-contemplation stage, 40%in the contemplation stage, inthe preparation (Glanz, Rimer, andLewis 2002). Decisional balance reflects an individual's weighing of the relative pros and cons ofchanging a behavior. Findings also suggestseveral principles in decisional balancefor advancing through the stages (Pro- chaska et al. 1994): To progress from pre-contemplation to contemplation, the pros of changingmust increase.Box 9-5. Processes of Change: Action to Maintenance Helping relationships Counter-conditioning Contingency management Stimulus control (confidence and temptation) Social liberationYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 64To progress from contemplation to action, the cons of changing mustdecrease. Before an individual progresses to ac-tion, the pros and cons should crossover, with the pros becoming higherthan the cons, as a sign that the personis well-prepared for action. Progress from pre-contemplation to ac-tion involves approximately a 0.5 stan-dard deviation decrease in the cons ofchanging; in other words, the perceivedbarriers to changing decrease by half. The practical implications of these princi- ples are that the pros of changing must increase twice as much as the cons mustdecrease. This indicates that perhaps twiceas much emphasis should be placed onraising the benefits as on reducing thecosts or barriers. With people in pre-contemplation, practitioners would targetthe pros for intervention and save the consfor people who have progressed to con- templation. Focusing more on the prosthan on the cons is particularly effectivewith adolescents. This decisional balancebetween pros and cons has been studiedfor adolescent drinking (Migneault, Pallo- nen, and Velicer 1997). The relationshipwas replicated for the stages of acquisitionof the drinking behavior, where the pros showed a maximum increase of 1.06 stan-dard deviations and the cons a maximumdecrease of 0.63 standard deviation. Forcessation, the relationship was not repli-cated, with the change in the pros and thecons being about equal (0.88 and 0.84standard deviation, respectively). The structure of the processes across stud- ies has not been as consistent as the struc-ture of the stages or the pros and cons ofchanging. In early stages, people tend toapply cognitive, affective, and evaluativeprocesses to progress through the stages.In later stages, people tend to rely more oncommitments, conditioning, contingen-cies, environmental controls, and supportfor progressing towards maintenance. To help people progress from pre- contemplation to contemplation, practi-tioners need to apply processes such asconsciousness-raising and dramatic re-lief. In this sense, applying processes suchas contingency management, counter-conditioning, and stimulus control topeople in the pre-contemplation stagerepresents a theoretical, empirical, andpractical mistake. But for people in action,such strategies represent an optimalmatching of process and stage. Figure 9-1.

It is an easy-to-use theoretical construct for evaluatingthe effectiveness of interventions. It helpsidentify baseline behaviors by stages anddescribes the processes that a health pro-motion intervention should promote toobtain a behavioral change and progres-sion to the next stage. Post-interventionbehaviors can be compared to baselinebehaviors by stages to find evidence of ef-fectiveness of the behavior change inter-vention. The model also provides an op-portunity to investigate which factorsdetermine the stage an adolescent is induring different behaviors, as well as thebarriers and processes involved when ad-vancing to other stages of behaviors. It in-cludes theoretical constructs described byinterpersonal- and community-level the-ories as an important part of the processesof change (e.g., modeling, social support, empowerment, organizational change).There has been fascinating research in this area, as described in the followingparagraphs. The cross-sectional relationships between weight concerns, weight control behav-iors, and initiation of tobacco use amongyouths have been studied using the Trans-theoretical Model of Change in a sample of 16,862 pre- and early adolescents ages 9 to14 (Tomeo et al. 1999). Contemplation oftobacco use was associated with misper-ception of being overweight, unhappinesswith appearance, and a tendency to changeeating patterns around peers. Gender dif-ferences were observed. Experimentationwith cigarettes was associated with dailyexercise to control weight among boys andwith periodic purging and daily dietingamong girls. Pallonen and colleagues (1998) analyzed the relationship between temptations totry smoking and stages of smoking acqui-sition among adolescents. The studyshowed that nonsmokers' reasons to initi-ate smoking were related to socializing orto simple curiosity at the very beginning ofthe acquisition phase. Regulation of nega-tive and positive affective states becameprominent at the later acquisition stageswhen adolescents were prepared to trysmoking. Nonsmokers were most temptedto try smoking when they anticipated thatsmoking would help them reduce negativemoods and increase positive ones. Thefindings in the smokers' temptation levelconfirmed the importance of affect regu-lation in maintaining smoking, which isalso reported in adolescent drug use. Mayhew, Flay, and Mott (2000) reviewed empirical studies of predictors of transi-tions in stages of smoking progressionduring adolescence. Parent and family in-fluences were found repeatedly to be ofmajor importance in stages of smokingYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 66beyond the experimental. Another trend indicated that females who have a smokingand smoking-supportive social network(friends and family members) were morelikely to transition from experimental toregular smoking, suggesting that femalesmay display a greater social sensitivity tothe smoking environment than males. Werch and DiClemente (1994) developed a multi-component stage model formatching drug prevention strategies andmessages to youth stages when use occurs.The model suggests the most effective useof different channels when motivating youth to avoid drugs. Media and media-related materials such as television,videotapes, comic books, and billboardsare believed to be most effective in influ-encing youth in the pre-contemplation,contemplation, and preparation stages ofchange. The idea that media can com-monly be expected to produce alterationsin personal factors such as awareness,knowledge, and motivation is supportedby a considerable amount of research. In-terpersonal delivery modes such as schoolclasses, health screenings, self-helpgroups, and student assistance programsare thought to be most effective in influ-encing youth in the preparation and ac-tion stages of change. Personal contactsare believed to significantly increase thereception and integration of communica-tions and are commonly used for teachingand modeling the attitudes and skillsneeded for behavioral change related todrug use prevention. Lastly, environmen-tal delivery modes, including peer facili-tators, parental training, policies, and legislation, are believed to be most effec-tive in influencing youth in the action andmaintenance stages of change. Environ-mental prevention channels are necessaryfor effecting successful behavioral change in that youth are influenced as much bythe physical and social situation in whichthey function as by personal and behav-ioral factors. In addition, social support isbelieved to be essential to the successfulmaintenance of behavioral change andimprovement of health. The multi-component stage model de- scribed by Werch and DiClemente mightwork with other adolescent health-relatedbehaviors as long as the reasons for notmoving from pre-contemplation to thecontemplation and preparation stages arelack of awareness and/or information.Raising consciousness through the massmedia can definitely increase motivationto move from pre-contemplation to con-templation, particularly since young peo-ple enjoy media communications. Never-theless, if the underlying reasons for notmoving from the pre-contemplation stageinclude strong emotional feelings ofavoidance to change (e.g., misperceptionof being overweight and smoking), which can be conscious or unconscious, mediamessages will need to create awareness of those feelings and show how to deal with them. These messages might beeffective for those adolescents withhealthy coping styles, but might not workwith adolescents using avoidance copingmechanisms.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINE | 67The readiness to change the drinking habits of university students who drinkheavily was investigated in a recent study(Vik, Culbertson, and Sellers 2000). Two-thirds of the heavy drinkers were found tobe at the pre-contemplation stage (67%).Only 20% were at the contemplation stageand 13% at the action stage. The stage distribution for smoking cessa- tion among adolescents has also been de-scribed. A recent study (Prokhorov et al.2001) involving 1,111 current or formersmokers in higher nicotine depend-ence scores than did students in the con-templation or preparation stages. Asimilar trend was observed for withdrawalsymptom scores across the stages ofchange. Another recent study examinedthe relationship of nicotine dependence,stress, and coping methods between pres-ent and past adolescent smokers aged 12 to21 and used the Transtheoretical Model ofChange to analyze these factors among ad-jacent smoking cessation stages (Siqueira,Rolnitzy, and Rickert 2001). Smokers weresignificantly more likely to report smokingadditional cigarettes per day as well ashave higher levels of physical addiction,greater levels of perceived stress, and lessuse of cognitive coping methods than for-mer smokers. Three out of 20 withdrawalsymptoms (cravings, difficulty dealingwith stress, and anger) were reportedmore frequently among current smokers who had attempted to quit during the pastsix months than among former smokers (P= .01). A study undertaken with early adolescent girls using the Transtheoretical Model andstages of change to promote higher con-sumption of fruits and vegetables (Cullenet al. 1998) suggests that to move from pre-contemplation to the action stage for fruitconsumption, programs should target fruitpreferences and barriers to increased con-sumption. Finding out which fruits adoles-cents like and having them available atschool and home will increase the effec-tiveness of the intervention. Skills tochoose and prepare fruits and vegetables,problem-solving, and goal-setting activi-ties to reduce perceived barriers also con-tribute to behavior change. The \"Agita S\u00e3o Paulo\" experience, a multi- level, community-wide intervention topromote activity among the 34million inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo State,Brazil, applied the TranstheoreticalModel, among other theories, in its de-sign. The program developers applied themodel to the assessment of changes in thereadiness of various subgroups and the se-lection of change methods and mediamessages relevant to people in each stage.Focus groups included students from the elementary to university levels, amongother population segments. The Caribbean Food and Nutrition Insti- tute, a PAHO regional center based inYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 68Kingston, Jamaica, and its collaborators analyzed the readiness of the Caribbeanpopulation for change in behaviors relatedto diet and exercise (Caribbean Food andNutrition Institute 2002). They found thatamong the obese population, most werebetween the pre- and contemplationstages for consumption of fruits and veg-etables, but among the non-obese popula-tion, most were at the pre-contemplationstage. Findings were more encouraging forpromoting exercise, where most of theobese population was between the prepa-ration and action stages; however, most ofthe non-obese population was in the pre-contemplation stage. It would be interest-ing to analyze this type of information forthe different adolescent stages to deter-mine if they behave in the same way as thetotal population and if there are differentcultural barriers to change in behaviors.The compilation of information regardingadult nutritional and physical activitystages of change nonetheless sheds im-portant light on the type of role modelsparents are being for their children, avalue which seems to be deeply rooted inCaribbean culture. In the sexual and reproductive health arena, Students Together against NegativeDecisions (STAND) (Mercer University1998) is an example of a new genre of HIVprevention that utilizes complementarytheoretical models to develop a programthat targets both individual and commu-nity level change in rural adolescents.STAND is a 28-session teen peer educatortraining program promoting both absti- nence and sexual risk reduction. The the-oretical foundation of the curriculum in-cludes the Transtheoretical Model and theDiffusion of Innovations Theory (ChapterTwenty-three) and focuses on individual and community norm change. STAND isteen-centered and skills-based; activitiescenter on active learning and are beingimplemented in a rural county in thesoutheastern United States. Acceptance ofand participation in STAND suggest thatadolescents in rural communities can beaccessed through community-based in-terventions, that they are willing to partic-ipate in such intensive programs, and thatthey perceive the intervention as valuableand enjoyable. Results from a pilot studyshowed significantly greater increases inself-efficacy and condom use (16% vs. a1% decrease in the control group) and inconsistent condom use (+28% vs. +15%).Adolescent trainees also reported a seven-fold increase in condom use (+213% vs. 31%) and a 30% decrease in unprotectedintercourse, compared to a 29% increasein the control group. These various studies are only a sample of those that have utilized the Transtheoreti-cal Model for behavioral change. Interest-ingly, in contrast with the findings for theHealth Belief Model, sexual health in ado-lescents is one of the lesser-studied areasusing the Transtheoretical Model andstages of change concept. This model couldbe used to further study the stages andprocesses of change not only for condomYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINE | 69use or negotiation, but also for changing social norms regarding harmful aspects oftraditional versions of masculinity andfemininity and sexual coercion. TheTranstheoretical Model variables can help measure concrete behaviors that should be promoted or changed during pre-adolescence, for example, for a more equi- table gender development.

Summary of the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change and Adolescent Lifestyles believed to be most effective in influencing youth in the action and maintenance stagesof change. Social support is believed to be essential tothe successful maintenance of behavioralchange. One study (Vik et al. 2000) of the readinessto change drinking habits during late adoles-cence found that 67% of heavy drinkers areat the pre-contemplation stage, 20% are atthe contemplation stage, and only 13% are atthe action stage. Another study of smoking cessation amongadolescents found that 52.5% are at the pre-contemplation stage vs. inmaintenance. Pre-contemplators exhibit significantly highermean nicotine dependence scores thanadolescent smokers in the contemplation orpreparation stages. In a comparison of the consecutive stages of behavior change among smoking adoles-cents, the most significant difference in cog-nitive coping skills is between those in thepre-contemplation and contemplation stages. Interventions encouraging early adolescentgirls to move from pre-contemplation to theaction stage for increased fruit consumptionshould target fruit preferences and reducebarriers to its improved consumption.It is an easy-to-use theory for evaluating theeffectiveness of interventions. It helps to identify baseline behaviors bystages and describes the processes ofchange needed to move to the next stage. Among pre- and early adolescents, contem-plation of tobacco use is associated with themisperception of being overweight, desire tosocialize, and simple curiosity. Preparation to try smoking is associated withthe anticipation of reducing negative moodsand increasing positive ones. Experimentation with cigarettes is associatedwith daily exercise to control weight amongboys and with daily dieting among girls. Girls who have a smoking and smoking-supportive network (friends and familymembers) are more likely to transition fromexperimental to regular smoking. Media and media-related materials (television,videos, comic books, billboards) are believedto be most effective in influencing youth inthe pre-contemplation, contemplation, andpreparation stages. Interpersonal delivery modes (school classes,health screenings, self-help groups, studentassistance programs) are thought to be mosteffective in influencing youth in the prepara-tion and action stages of change. Environmental delivery modes (peer interac-tion, parental training, policies, legislation) areThe Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980, Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) states that individual performance of a given behavior is primarily deter-mined by a person's intention to perform that behavior. This intention is deter- mined by two major factors: attitude (positive or negative feelings) towards performing a behavior. Attitude is de- termined by: the individual's beliefs about the outcomes of performing the behavior ( behavioral beliefs ) and the value of these outcomes ( evaluation ). subjective norm associated with the behavior; i.e., the person's perception of other peo- ple's opinions regarding the defined behavior. A person's subjective norm is deter-mined by: beliefs about what other people think the person should do ( normative beliefs ) and the person's motivation to comply with the opinion of others. A person who strongly believes that, for the most part, positively valued outcomes will re- sult from performing a given behavior will have a positive attitude towards that behavior.A person who holds strong beliefs that negatively valued outcomes will result from a givenbehavior will have a negative attitude towards that behavior. These beliefs will differ frompopulation to population, as well as by culture and age. In the case of the adolescent age[Chapter Ten ] The Theory of Reasoned ActionYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 72 group, such emotions as pleasure, joy, an- ticipation, excitement, or \"having fun\" aregenerally considered the most commonelements of positively valued outcomes,beyond rational or cognitive evaluations.(Within this context, an interesting possi-bility for future research might be to de-termine to what extent, if any, the ele-ments of positively valued outcomes varythrough different adolescent develop-mental stages and by gender.) A person who believes that certain refer- ents (peers, parents, teachers, etc.) thinkhe/she should perform a behavior, andwho is motivated to meet the expectationsof those referents, will hold a positive sub- jective norm. A person who believes cer-tain referents think he/she should notperform the behavior will have a negativesubjective norm, and a person who is lessmotivated to comply with the referents willhave a relatively neutral subjective norm.Adolescents who have ongoing nurturingrelationships with caregivers, teachers, orother adults tend to respond more to posi-tive or negative subjective norms thanadolescents who do not have this type ofrelationship.The Theory of Reasoned Action assumes a causal chain: behavioral beliefs and nor-mative beliefs are linked to behavioral in-tention and behavior via attitude and sub-jective norm. The authors of the modelpropose that changes in an individual'sbehavioral and normative beliefs will ulti-mately affect the individual's actual be-havior. But for adolescents, who devotemore time and energy (relative to older agegroups) trying to please or displease oth-ers (friends, parents, teachers), a changein normative beliefs will most likely bewithin the context of ongoing nurturingrelationships; otherwise, the adolescentwill have little or no motivation to comply. The measurement and computation of model components and causal relation-ships among those components are clearlyspecified in Ajzen and Fishbein (1980).The relative weights of attitude and sub-jective norm depend upon the behaviorand the population under investigation.Some behaviors are entirely under attitu-dinal control, while others are under nor-mative control. The same behavior hasbeen found to be under attitudinal controlin one population but under normativecontrol in another population (Fishbein1990). The relative weights are deter-mined empirically for the particular be-havior and population under investiga-tion, and this information suggestswhether attitude or subjective norm is thebest focus for behavioral change efforts.Correlation and analysis of variance can beused to determine which specific behav-ioral beliefs or normative beliefs are most Box 10-1. The Theory of Reasoned Action: Key Theoretical Constructs Intention Attitude behavioral beliefs evaluation Subjective norm normative beliefs motivation to complyYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TEN | 73 strongly associated with intention and be- havior, thus providing empirically identi-fied targets for intervention efforts. The assumption of the Theory of Reasoned Action is that individuals are rational ac-tors. That is, all individuals process infor-mation at a cognitive level and are moti-vated to act upon it. The theory furtherassumes that there are underlying reasonsother than emotions that determine an in-dividual's motivation to perform a behav-ior. The strength of the theory is that itprovides a framework for identifying thoseunderlying reasons and a means to makesense of actions by recognizing, measur-ing, and combining beliefs that are rele-vant to individuals or groups. Neverthe-less, when working with adolescents,reasons and emotions blend easily. Atyounger ages (e.g., preadolescence), un- derlying emotions are probably more de-terminant than underlying reasons whendeciphering behaviors. At this age, manypreadolescents still have significant diffi-culty identifying the underlying emotionsand reasons for specific behaviors. The success of the theory in explaining ac- tual behavior is dependent also upon thedegree to which the behavior is under voli-tional control. It is not clear that the the-ory's components are sufficient for pre-dicting behaviors in which volitionalcontrol is reduced. A person who has highmotivation to perform a behavior may notactually perform that behavior due to in-tervening environmental conditions.

A middle adolescentmay have decided to use condoms whenhaving sexual relations but may not be ableto buy or obtain free condoms in the localcommunity. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Theory of ReasonedAction to Adolescent Lifestyles The use of the Theory of Reasoned Action to change adolescent behaviors has beenstudied in Africa, Europe, India, and theUnited States. Instruments to measureadolescents' attitudes and subjectivenorms have been developed. The predic-tive value of these constructs has beendemonstrated for tobacco and drug con-sumption. The effect of the subjectivenorm for condom use behavior has alsobeen studied among adolescents. The ef-fect of the different theoretical constructs(subjective norm, attitude, intention)tends to vary for the different adolescentbehaviors being analyzed. Using data from a diverse statewide sam- ple of tenth grade middle adolescents inCalifornia in 1996 and 1997, Unger et al.(2001) investigated the associations be-tween peer influence variables and sus-ceptibility to smoking. Peer influencevariables included attitudes about the so-cial consequences of smoking and subjec-tive norms, as described by the Theory of Reasoned Action. Among those who had never smoked ( n= 2,681) and ever-smokers\u2014those who either had smoked at one time and had quit or continue tosmoke\u2014( n= 4,248), attitudes about social consequences of smoking and subjectivenorms each were associated with an in-creased risk of susceptibility to smoking.The model explained a larger proportionof the variance in susceptibility among ever-smokers than among never-smok-ers. These results are congruent with pre-vious studies using the Theory of ReasonedAction to analyze cigarette use by adoles-cents and the effects of peer influence(O'Callaghan, Callan, and Baglioni 1999).Another study examined the relationshipbetween beliefs regarding chewing to-bacco use and addiction among 473 maleuniversity athletes (Hilton et al. 1994).Beliefs were assessed using methods pre-scribed by the Theory of Reasoned Action.One highlighted finding was that all ath-letes believed that clinicians, parents, andgirlfriends did not approve of their chew-ing tobacco use, but that male peers,coaches, and professional athletes werefairly indifferent to it. The authors pointedout the importance of strengthening thesupport of male peers and other athleteswho influence the subjects' social normswhen planning interventions to help themquit. Lawson (1994) examined the role of ciga- rette smoking in the lives of low-income,pregnant adolescents. Based on in-depthinterviews, subjects' beliefs and attitudestowards smoking are described in thestudy. The findings indicated that thispopulation smoked to cope with weightYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TEN | 75gain, to deliver smaller infants which in turn would decrease the duration of laborand reduce the pain of delivery, to coun-teract anxiety arising from feelings ofabandonment by their families and/orboyfriends, and to establish an identityseparate from their parents' and peers'drug abuse. These results suggest that low-income, pregnant adolescents perceiveimmediate benefits from cigarette smok-ing that outweigh long-term health conse-quences. The author argued that smokingprevention programs based on an inaccu-rate understanding of the social context inwhich smoking occurs can reinforce theuse of tobacco among high-risk, pregnantadolescents. Laflin et al. (1994) compared the role of self-esteem, attitudes, and subjectivenorms in the prediction of drug and alco-hol use. Measures of self-esteem, drug at-titudes, subjective norms, and drug usebehaviors were collected from 2,074 U.S.high school and university students. Re-sults indicated that attitudes and subjec-tive norms do predict drug and alcoholuse, but self-esteem does not add signifi-cantly to the prediction of the drug and al-cohol behaviors. O'Callaghan et al. (1997)compared the Theory of Reasoned Action,the Theory of Planned Behavior (reviewedin Chapter Eleven), and an extension ofthe Theory of Reasoned Action that incor-porates past behavior in explaining alco-hol use among 122 U.S. university students(82 of whom were female). The resultssuggested that the extension of the Theoryof Reasoned Action provides the best fit tothe data. For these students, their inten- tions to drink alcohol were predicted bytheir past behavior as well as their percep-tions of what others think they should do(subjective norm). In 1999, the authorspublished the same comparison of theo-ries for cigarette use by adolescents. Re-spondents consisted of 225 U.S. highschool students (O'Callaghan, Callan,Baglioni 1999). Results indicated that themodification of the Theory of ReasonedAction incorporating past behavior pro-vided a marginally better fit than the othermodels. Nevertheless, they concluded thatfor this group of high school students, atti- tudes towards smoking, past behavior inrelation to smoking, and perceptions ofwhat others think they should do were sig-nificant predictors of their intentions tosmoke. Selvan et al. (2001) studied the intended sexual and condom behavior patternsamong higher secondary school studentsin India using the Theory of Reasoned Ac-tion constructs. The results revealed thatperceived norms and perceived peergroup norms showed significant associa-tion with intended sexual behavior andactual sexual behavior and that those chil-dren of more highly educated parents areless likely to engage in sexual activitiesduring their adolescent years. Condomuse intentions of students at a universityin southern Ghana have also been studiedusing the Theory of Reasoned Action (Bo-sompra 2001). Subjective norms and theperceived disadvantages of condom usewere significant determinants of inten-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 76tion, with the former being more impor- tant. The critical difference was that \"in-tenders\" consistently held a strongerbelief than \"non-intenders\" that theirsignificant referents approved of condomuse. The author proposed shifting from atraditional approach of focusing on indi-vidual behaviors to focusing simultane-ously on individuals, their sexual part-ners, and the broader social networks towhich the individuals belong in order toenhance perceptions of peer acceptanceof condom use. Predictors of intention to be sexually active among Tanzanian mid-dle adolescents were investigated byKlepp et al. (1996). A total of 2,026 stu-dents (mean age: 14 years) participated,representing a wide variety of ethnic, so-cioeconomic, and urban-rural groups.Sixty-three percent of the boys and 24%of the girls reported having already had their first sexual encounter. Attitudes,subjective norms, and self-efficacy wereall predictors of intention to have sexualintercourse within the next three months,but prior behavior emerged as thestrongest predictor of intention. Freeman and Sheiham (1997) analyzed the decision-making processes for sugar con-sumption among adolescents using theTheory of Reasoned Action. One hundredand eighty-seven 16-year-olds in theUnited States completed a questionnaireon the consumption of sugar using themethod developed by Ajzen and Fishbein.The findings suggested that although past dental experiences, behavior, and educa-tion, together with the role of parental fig-ures, acted as important influences, the immediate pleasurable taste of sugar out- weighed and deferred the recognition ofdangers associated with its consumption.In another study, Mesters and Oostveen(1994) analyzed the determinants of eat-ing snacks filled with sugar and fats be-tween meals by 560 Dutch adolescentsages 12-15. The results showed that atti-tude turned out to be more important thanthe subjective norm in predicting inten-tion to consume such snacks. The various studies just reviewed are only a sample of those that have used the Theoryof Reasoned Action to look at behavioral change. The authors of this book were un-able to find any studies applying this the-ory to change adolescent behaviors whichanalyzed the theoretical constructs by de-velopmental stages. Most of the researchusing the theory in adolescents has fo-cused on sexual health and tobacco, alco-hol, and drug use. Nevertheless, most ofthe studies on sexual health were orientedtowards condom use and HIV prevention.Unfortunately, no research was foundlinking condom use, HIV prevention, andchanges in normative beliefs or subjectivenorms regarding sexual coercion or abuse.Table 10-1. shows the number of studies found using the Theory of Reasoned Ac- tion according to health behavior.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TEN | 77NUMBER OF ARTICLES NUMBER OF ARTICLES ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORS USING THE TRA BY KEYWORDSTable 10-1.

Summary of the Theory of Reasoned Action and Adolescent Lifestyles Perceived norms and perceived peer group norms show significant association with in-tended sexual behavior and actual sexual be-havior among middle and late adolescents. Subjective norms and the perceived disadvan-tages of condom use are significant determi-nants of intention. \"Intenders\" consistently have a stronger beliefthan \"non-intenders\" that their significant ref-erents approve of condom use. Attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacyare all predictors of intention to have sexualintercourse within the next three months. The immediate pleasurable taste of sugaroutweighs and postpones the recognition ofdangers associated with sugar consumptionamong adolescents. Attitude is more important than subjectivenorm in predicting intention to consumesnacks filled with sugar and fats among earlyand middle adolescents.The theory's use to change adolescent be-haviors has been studied in Africa, Europe,India, and the United States. Instruments to measure adolescents' attitudesand subjective norms have been developed. Attitudes about the social consequences ofsmoking and subjective norms are associatedwith an increased risk of susceptibility tosmoking. Low-income, pregnant adolescents perceiveimmediate benefits from cigarette smoking: tocounteract feelings of abandonment, to es-tablish an identity separate from their parents,to cope with increased weight, and to deliversmall infants, which decreases the duration oflabor and reduces the pain of delivery. Thestudy (Lawson 1994) suggests that positiveattitudes towards cigarette smoking outweighlong-term health consequences. Attitudes and subjective norms predict drugand alcohol use among adolescents, but self-esteem does not add significantly to theprediction of this behavior.Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen and Madden 1986) is an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (Chapter Ten) that adds perceived behavioral con- trol (Figure 11-1.). This accounts for factors outside the individual's control, which may affect his/her intention and behavior. This extension was based in part on theidea that behavioral performance is determined jointly by motivation (intention) andability (behavioral control). Ajzen indicates that his perceived behavioral control is notreally different from Bandura's self-efficacy (i.e., the perceived ability to perform a givenbehavior, as described in Chapter Eight). According to the Theory of Planned Behavior,perceived control is determined by: control beliefs concerning the presence or absence of resources for, and impediments to, behavioral performance perceived power ,or the impact of each resource and impediment to facilitate or inhibit the behavior A person who holds strong control beliefs about the existence of factors that facilitate the behavior will have high perceived control over the behavior. A person who holds strongcontrol beliefs about the existence of factors that impede the behavior will have low per-ceived control over the behavior. As in the Theory of Reasoned Action, the particular resources and impediments that are to be measured are not specified by the theory, but instead are identified through inter-[Chapter Eleven ] The Theory of Planned Behaviorviews conducted among the particular population for the behavior under investi-gation. Once these factors are identified, aperson's control beliefs and perceivedpower regarding each factor are measured. The theory postulates that perceived con- trol is an independent determinant of be-havioral intention along with attitude to-wards the behavior and subjective norm.Holding attitude and subjective norm con-stant, a person's perception of the ease ordifficulty of behavioral performance willaffect his/her behavioral intention.

Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Theory of PlannedBehavior to Adolescent Lifestyles The use of the Theory of Planned Behavior to change adolescent behaviors has beenstudied in Canada, Europe, and the UnitedStates. One well-researched topic using the the- ory is the onset of smoking in youth, as de-scribed by Kok and colleagues in a chapterentitled \"Social Psychology and HealthEducation\" published in the European Re- view of Social Psychology (Kok et al. 1996). Nonsmoking and regular smoking Dutchyouth ages 10 to 15 ( n= 219) were askedquestions about smoking, in interviews or open response questionnaires, to elicitsalient outcome beliefs, normative beliefs,self-efficacy expectations, and intentions.Based on this eliciting procedure, struc-tured questionnaires were developed,which consisted of the following: beliefs and evaluations of the conse-quences of smoking (e.g., \"If I smoke orshould start to smoke, this is very [ so- ciable versu s unsociable .\"]) normative beliefs and corresponding motivations to comply with respect to various social referents (e.g., mother,father, brothers, sisters, friends,classmates) self-efficacy expectations (e.g., stu-dent's perceived ability to refuse offersof cigarettes, to provide argumentsBox 11-2.

The Theory of Planned Behaviorprovided the basis for the development ofthe research instrument. Participants in-cluded 141 African-American, 146 PuertoRican, and 143 non-Hispanic white fe-males, ages 13 to 19. Logistic regressionanalysis identified beliefs that were sig-nificantly related to smoking behavior ineach cultural group. Beliefs related to atti-tudes about smoking and perceived socialpressure regarding smoking differed among the three cultural groups . The find- ings suggest that specific beliefs differen-tiate between smokers and nonsmokersand that some beliefs differ by culture. One of the limitations of most studies on adolescents is that smoking behavior ismeasured in a dichotomous manner: thatis, a smoker or a nonsmoker. This classi-fication does not allow for an understand-ing of the process and stages by whichadolescents progress from nonsmoking tooccasional smoking to smoking on a regu-lar basis. Godin (1996) proposed identi-fying stages of adoption of a behavior bythe intersection of two variables: recentpast behavior and the intention to adoptthis behavior in a stated time frame (nearfuture). Following this approach, thestages of adopting a smoking behaviorwould be: Stage 1: consists of nonsmokers who donot intend to smoke Stage 2: consists of nonsmokers who,contrary to stage 1, intend to smokeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 82Stage 3: consists of occasional smokers who do not intend to smoke Stage 4: consists of occasional smokerswho intend to smoke Stage 5: consists of regular smokers whointend to maintain their smoking In addition, Godin identified a sixth group, known as \"quitters,\" which consists of reg-ular smokers who express the intention tonot smoke in the short term. He did not in-clude this group as a stage of behavior, al-though the intention of this group couldserve as the next possible step when and ifits members decide to follow through andaccompany the intention with actions. Jomphe Hill et al. (1997) developed a study to identify variables from the Theory ofPlanned Behavior that differentiated anddiscriminated among these stages ofsmoking acquisition in adolescence. Thesample consisted of 294 Canadian stu-dents, ages 11 to 15. Results showed thatthe variables of attitude and perceived be-havioral control significantly differenti-ated the students situated in stages 3 and4. The perceived behavioral control vari-able significantly differentiated the stu-dents situated in stages 4 and 5. Based onthe results of the study, the authors suggestthat the stages could be characterized inthe following manner: students who aresituated in stage 1 have an unfavorable at-titude towards smoking. Although this at-titude remains negative, it is more favor-able for students in stages 2 and 3, despitethe fact that there is no statistically signif-icant difference. However, compared tostage 3, stage 4 is accompanied by a favor- able attitude towards smoking. Stage 5 il-lustrates an attitude even more favorabletowards smoking. A similar profileemerges for the perceived behavioral con-trol variable. The authors propose that thecontent of smoking prevention programsfor adolescents should be based on the be- liefs underlying attitude, subjective norm,and perceived behavioral control, andadapted to each stage of smoking acquisi-tion. Students in stages 1 and 2 (nonsmok-ers) may be influenced by messages thataim to strengthen their unfavorable atti-tude towards smoking cigarettes. For stu-dents at stage 3, messages should aim atthe short- and long-term effects of smok-ing, but also at providing messages thatsuggest alternatives to the advantages thatsmokers associate with tobacco smoking,since it was observed that it is at the subse-quent stage 4 that students present a fa-vorable attitude towards smoking. Wall, Hinson, and McKee (1998) used the Theory of Planned Behavior to assess thecontribution of alcohol outcome expectan-cies and attitudes towards drinking in 316U.S. university undergraduates of legaldrinking age who reported drinking atleast once a month. Intentions to drink\"too much\" and self-reported excessiveconsumption episodes served as criterionmeasures and attitudes, subjective norm,perceived behavioral control, and theevaluation of behavioral outcomes wereemployed as predictor variables. The re-sults suggested that the theory appeared tobe a valid framework for predicting exces-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER ELEVEN | 83sive alcohol consumption among under- graduates. The predictive power of themodel, however, was enhanced throughthe inclusion of gender-specific alcoholoutcome expectancies. Specifically, in ad-dition to attitudes and perceived behav-ioral control, women's expectancies forsociability enhanced the prediction of in-tentions to drink \"too much.\" Expectan-cies for sexual functioning (male) andassertiveness (female) improved the pre-diction of excessive consumption, overand above intentions and perceived be-havioral control. The authors concludedthat gender-specific alcohol outcome ex-pectancies, unlike attitudes, are proximalpredictors of excessive alcohol consump-tion among undergraduates. These gender-specific determinants are influenced bytraditional expectations of masculinity andfemininity, in that boys drink to improvetheir expected sexual functioning and girlsdrink to improve their otherwise weakassertiveness. Table 11-1. presents the findings of a Canadian study ( n= 746) which analyzed how determinants of physical activitycould change with adolescent develop- ment, using the Theories of Reasoned Ac-tion (Chapter Ten) and Planned Behavior(Mummery, Spence, and Hudec 2000). The authors found significant differences in the importance of the different theoret-ical constructs in adolescent development.The study shows that addressing the sub-jective norm will be effective when plan-ning a physical activity promotion pro-gram for preadolescents, but will not beinfluential when planning an activity di-rected to late adolescents. Perceived be-havioral control is equivalent to Bandura'sself-efficacy concept; that is to say, in thiscase, the perceived ability to successfullyexecute a regimen of physical activity. Per-ceived behavioral control will be impor-tant to consider when planning a programdirected to middle or late adolescents, butnot necessarily when planning a programfor preadolescents.

Regarding attitudes towards consistent condom use, the results revealed that mostyoung people saw this behavior as sensibleand necessary because it provided protec-tion against developing AIDS. On the otherhand, they did not regard condom use assomething pleasant. Young people whohave had intercourse were the least likelyto have a positive attitude towards consis-tent condom use. Although they regardedusing condoms consistently as the sensi-ble thing to do, they did not always con-sider it necessary to do so, especially whenhaving intercourse with a relatively well-known partner. In their opinion, condomuse signified an annoying interruption,reduced sensitivity, and reduction inpleasure. These results indicate that ingeneral, young people endorse the pre-ventive advantages of consistent condomuse and recognize that these advantagescounterbalance the disadvantages and un-pleasantness of condom use. However,when young people gain experience withsexual intercourse, the disadvantages ofconsistent condom use seem to gain in-creased significance, and the necessity ofconsistent use seems to become less sig-nificant to them.With respect to social influences, the study revealed that young people did not perceivecondom use as a common current practiceamong their peers, although perceivedsubjective norms with regard to using con-doms consistently were moderately posi-tive. Perceived subjective norms of youngpeople who had not had intercourse weremore positive than those of young peoplewho had. When different social referentswere considered, the positive social influ-ence of parents was striking. In regards to self-efficacy or perceived be- havioral control, the study showed thatyoung people did expect difficulties re-garding their ability to purchase condoms,to carry them regularly, to use them con-sistently, and to negotiate their consistentuse with a (potential) sex partner. Youngpeople who had not had intercourse weremost likely to expect difficulties with thepurchase of condoms and with carryingthem regularly. Young people who had hadintercourse were most likely to expect dif-ficulties with the maintenance of consis-tent use with a relatively well-known part-ner. Young people who did not form a habitof condom use were more likely to have low self-efficacy expectations regardingthe maintenance of condom use and re-garding their communicative skills to ne-gotiate condom use with a well-known sexpartner. In addition, the Theory of Planned Behav- ior has been used to examine the votingYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER ELEVEN | 85intentions of state legislators in North Carolina, Texas, and Vermont. These find-ings can provide guidance to health educa-tors in planning messages for advocacy ef-forts. The theory was also used to select messages in the National Anti-Drug MediaCampaign, developed in the United States in 1997 (Capella et al. 2001).

Summary of the Theory of Planned Behavior and Adolescent Lifestyles consistent condom use seem to become more significant, and the necessity ofconsistent use seems to become lesssignificant to them. Young people with intercourse experience are the least likely to have a positive attitudetowards consistent condom use, especiallywhen having intercourse with a relatively well-known partner. The positive social influence of parentsregarding condom use is striking. Regarding perceived behavioral control ofcondom use, young people expect difficultiesregarding their ability to purchase condoms,to carry them regularly, to use them consis-tently, and to negotiate their consistent usewith a sex partner. Young people without intercourse experience are most likely to expect difficulties with thepurchase of condoms and with carrying themregularly. Young people who do not form a habit of condom use are likely to have low self-efficacy expectations regarding the mainten-ance of condom use and regarding theircommunicative skills to negotiate condom usewith a well-known sex partner.Attitudes and perceived behavioral controlsignificantly differentiate occasional adoles-cent smokers who intend to smoke fromthose who do not. Perceived behavioral control differentiatesregular adolescent smokers from occasionaladolescent smokers who intend to smoke. Attitudes, perceived behavioral control, andexpectancies for sociability enhance theprediction of intentions of late adolescent girls to drink alcohol. Gender-specific outcome expectancies\u2014better sexual functioning among boys andmore assertiveness among girls\u2014improve theprediction of excessive alcohol consumption,over and above intentions and perceivedbehavioral control in late adolescence. Subjective norm is effective when planning a physical activity promotion intervention for preadolescents, but is less influentialwhen planning an activity directed to lateadolescents. Perceived behavioral control is important toconsider when planning a program directed to middle or late adolescents, but not whenplanning a program for preadolescents. When young people gain experience withsexual intercourse, the disadvantages ofThe setting of goals leads to better performance because individuals with goals exert themselves more, persevere in their tasks, concentrate more, and, as thesituation requires, develop strategies for carrying out the behavior (Bartholomew et al. 2001). The Goal-Setting Theory is clearly a theory of action and de-scribes a particular method for achieving behavior change. In teaching about HIV/AIDSprevention, for example, the health educator might attempt to associate safer sex withother important goals the students have chosen, such as future careers, which might bethreatened by the consequences of practicing unsafe sex. In this way, safer sex becomespart of the strategy to attain long-term goals young people have set for themselves. A main criticism of the traditional behavior change theories (e.g., Health Belief Model, Stages of Change, Theory of Planned Behavior) is that they do not take into account the factthat individuals may differ with respect to the goals they pursue (Buchanan 2000) and, asa result, may vary in the extent to which they value their health (Gebhardt and Maes 2001).According to this criticism, these theories also overrate rational decision-making aboutpros and cons as the main process underlying health behavior. Historically, health pro-motion program developers have been trained to identify the behavior goals of a given in-tervention according to the health outcome they wish to achieve (e.g., to decrease HIV in-fection as the health outcome and increase condom use as the behavioral goal). Goal theories, on the other hand, which have been applied more recently in psychologi- cal research, dolead researchers to focus on variances in the goals individuals pursue and[Chapter Twelve ] The Goal-Setting TheoryYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 88differences in the relative value assigned to personal health. The theories assert thatbehavior is effectuated to achieve one'spreviously set goals, whatever the nature ofthese might be. These goals are the resultof personal processes that are related to one's self-concept and/or an analysis ofthe personal desirability and feasibility ofa potential goal. From this goal-orientedapproach, behavior is believed to be initi-ated only when it is expected to serve ahighly valued goal. Goal selection, the con-secutive choice of behavior, and the con-trol mechanisms to accompany the behav-ior change all determine whether a changein behavior will occur. (1997)and Maes de-veloped Goal Model\"based on these considerations. A basictenet of the model is that progression to-wards the target health behavior is de-pendent upon the degree of compatibilitybetween the target behavior and other per-sonal goals of the individual. The conceptof personal goals, which is at the core of the model, encompasses all that is impor-tant to the person; that is, the things a per-son wants to do with his or her life. AsMartin E. Ford notes, \"Facilitating per-sonal goals and not coercing humansshould be the guiding principle in moti-vating humans to change their behaviors\"(Ford 1992, also cited in Maes and Geb-hardt 2000, and in Gebhardt and Maes2001). He further notes that motivation is the combination of three psychologicalfunctions: goals ,emotions , and personal agency beliefs ,or the expectations aboutwhether one can achieve a goal (Ford 1992). Facilitating personal goals is a key con- tributing element to the consolidation ofidentity development during the adoles-cent period. Goal-setting has been tradi-tionally encouraged among middle and lateadolescents, but it is also crucial to includethis approach in programs and interven-tions targeting pre- and early adolescents.Goal-setting helps to develop an \"egoideal,\" which permits young people tomodel, evaluate, and picture themselves inthe future. This \"ego ideal\" enables earlyadolescents to envision and project a senseof self over time instead of merely reacting to daily events in which they respond to theneeds of the moment (pleasure, need foraffiliation and acceptance) and exhibithigh vulnerability to peer pressure (Green-span 1993). In this sense, the assumptionthat behavior will be initiated only if it isexpected to serve a highly valued goal is aparticularly promising one within the con-text of adolescent health research. A goal should be behaviorally specific and measurable or observable. Strecher andcolleagues (1995) advise that goals shouldbe stated in terms of behavior (e.g., exer-cise and food intake) instead of health out-comes (e.g., weight loss). Locke andLatham (1991) have demonstrated thatsetting a challenging goal, one that is diffi-cult but nonetheless feasible, leads to abetter performance than does setting aneasy goal or no goal at all. This positiveYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWELVE | 89 effect of difficult goals occurs only if a per- son accepts the challenge and has suffi-cient experience, self-efficacy, and feed-back to perform adequately. Becauseadolescents may lack experience and self-efficacy, this positive effect will usuallydepend on social support received fromparents, teachers, other adults, and/ormore experienced friends who are willingto guide them through the process oflearning, adhering to the goal, and over-coming barriers. The rewards for reachingthe goal are not only the expected out-comes but also a sense of self-satisfaction.Although goal-setting may not be effectivewhen the task is relatively complex, theeducator can still work to help identifysmaller, incremental goals leading to theoverall goal and suggest viable strategiesfor reaching it, especially when working with younger adolescents. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Goal-SettingTheory to Adolescent Lifestyles The Goal-Setting Theory helps adoles- cents organize their dreams and design acorresponding plan of action. Scales andLeffert (1999) describe the \"sense of pur-pose in life\" as one of the important Posi-tive Identity Assets in their DevelopmentalAssets Framework (further described inChapter Nineteen). The ability to plan forthe future is part of the executive functions , which are instrumental in self-regulationactivities and emanate from the brain'sprefrontal lobes. As noted in Chapter Nineand as will be discussed further in ChapterBox 12-1. The Goal-Setting Theory: Key Concepts in the Adoption of Healthy Behaviors Facilitating personal goals motivates humans to change behaviors. The choice and pursuit of individual goals is a key element of adolescent identity development. Goal-setting should be encouraged not only during middle or late adolescence, but also during pre- and early adolescence. Behavior will be initiated only if it is expected to serve a highly valued goal. Compatibility between the target behavior and other personal goals of the individual is crucial forbehavior change. A goal should be behaviorally specific and measurable. Goals should be stated in terms of behavior instead of health outcomes. Goal-setting may be not effective when the task is too complex. Setting a challenging goal\u2014one that is difficult but nonetheless feasible\u2014leads to betterperformance than setting an easy goal or no goal at all. It is important for health educators to provide small, incremental goals leading to the overall goaland to suggest viable strategies for reaching it. Social support for developing strategies and reaching self-set goals is particularly critical foryounger adolescents lacking in experience and self-efficacy.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 90Thirteen, this asset does not reach full ma- turity until the last stage of adolescence(ages 16 to 19). Goal-setting can also be an effective way of capturing child and adolescent motiva-tion, since the ability to face challengesand competition is an important ingredi-ent in the development of personal iden-tity. This is especially true for the 9-to-12age group, when engaging in competitionwith others is the primary means by whicha child figures out what he or she does anddoes not excel at in relationship to others.Although more so for males than for fe-males, competition in sports and games isparticularly attractive at this stage of de-velopment. In the later stages of adoles-cent development, the need for success is aconstant given; therefore, efforts to com-pete against one's own goals can becomean effective way to obtain behavioralchange. Thus, creating opportunities foradolescents to feel competent and suc-cessful, especially in areas they highlyvalue, is an important way to encouragehealth-promoting behaviors. The Goal-Setting Theory has demon- strated that adolescents who target a be-havior (physical activity or eating habits)tend to improve more than those who donot (Cullen, Baranowski, and Smith 2001;Patrick et al. 2001; Schnoll and Zimmer- man 2001). The University of Californiahas pioneered once such successful exam-ple of this with EatFit, an educational in-tervention targeted to middle school stu-dents living in low income communities.Personally guided goal-setting is the piv- otal strategy, and computer technology isemployed to assist adolescents with dietassessment and \"guided\" goal-setting asthey make their own healthy lifestylechoices. The program's nine lessons ad-dress three messages previously identifiedby the middle school students' focus groupas motivators for changing eating andphysical activity behaviors: increased en-ergy, improved appearance, and greaterindependence. In a crossover controlled field trial, the EatFit intervention was evaluated foreffectiveness. Students made positivechanges in dietary behaviors ( p = .03) and physical activity self-efficacy (paired T-test: p= .02). When students set a di- etary goal, they increased positive dietarybehaviors specific to that goal ( p = .04). Participants rated themselves as making at least one lasting improvement in di-etary (74%) and physical activity (69%)choices, respectively. A randomized con-trolled field trial investigated the effect ofthe guided goal-setting component ofEatFit. Seventy-three percent of the par-ticipants in the treatment group (inter-vention with goal-setting) made im-provements in their dietary practicescompared to control group (interven-tion without guided goal-setting) with53% ( p= .04). Treatment participants also improved significantly compared to con-trol participants (44% vs. 29%) on thephysical activity self-efficacy variable (p = .01). In 2003, 10,000 middle school students in California participated in theYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWELVE | 91EatFit program (University of California 2004). Sanderson and Cantor (1995) examined whether late adolescents bring differentgoals to bear in social dating by applying a\"Social Dating Goals Scale\" to 905 studentsin the United States. The study identifiedtwo different prevailing dating goals: inti- macy goals related to open communica- tion and mutual dependence and identity goals related to self-reliance and self- exploration. These different prevailingdating goals were also associated withdifferent patterns of dating and sexualbehavior: adolescents with predominantidentity goals had more casual dating andsexual partners and those with more inti-macy goals had longer dating relationships. Sanderson and Cantor further hypothe- sized that adolescents with predominantintimacy goals would be particularly likelyto identify with educational activities thatemphasize effective communication with apartner about safer sex. On the other hand,those with predominant identity goals maygravitate towards activities that facilitateself-reliance by focusing on technical anderoticizing skills relevant to condom use.The study suggests that tailoring activitiesthat teach about safer sex to fit these dif-ferent dating goals should increase the im-pact and effectiveness of such education. The authors developed a second study in which to test this hypothesis. One hundredand thirty-six U.S. undergraduates (meanage of 19.8 years) were randomly assignedto one of three education conditions: tech- nical skills, communication skills, or a no-education control group. The communica-tion skills group included activitiesfocused on negotiation with partners about condom use and training in role-playing. The technical skills group in-cluded activities focused on proficiencywith condoms and eroticizing skills train-ing. The results of a one-year follow-upindicated the long-term effects of partici-pation in goal-relevant safer sex educationfor greater intentions of using condoms. These results provided evidence that indi-viduals are most likely to learn and followthrough on intentions about safer sex ineducational and naturally occurring datingsituations that are most relevant to theirpredominant dating goals. Kaldmae and colleagues (2000) described their experience with three preventionprojects that were carried out with youngpeople by the Estonian Anti-AIDS Associ-ation from 1997 to 1999. The idea of pre-ventive strategies was to promote youngpeople's own decision-making about riskbehavior. The authors highlight the im-portance of maintaining the continuity ofpreventive projects that will help youngpeople to develop personal insight and en-able them to establish goals regardingtheir sexual and general health. The Goal-Setting Theory also has been used to address teen pregnancy (Mont-gomery 2001; Perrin et al. 2000; Brown,Saunders, and Dick 1999; Walsh and Cor-bett 1995). The Dollar-A-Day program inYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 92the U.S. state of North Carolina was estab- lished in 1990 to discourage subsequentpregnancies in girls under 16 years of agewho had already given birth to one child(Brown, Saunders, and Dick 1999).Weekly meetings featured education on nutrition, an informal program to con-sider needs identified by members, thesetting of short-term goals, and an awardof a dollar for each day the participants did not become pregnant. After five years ofoperation, only 15% of the 65 girls en-rolled in the program experienced subse-quent pregnancies. The program remainsa model for similar initiatives. Although the Goal-Setting Theory is de- scribed as an individual behavior changetheory, it could also be applied to promotechanges at the interpersonal and commu-nity levels. MacDonald and Green (2001)studied the implementation of a school-based alcohol and drug prevention projectin secondary schools in British Columbia,Canada. The authors explain that one of the main focuses of the project workersafter establishing their credibility in theschool was to reconcile the goals , values, and philosophy of the project with those ofthe school. The Goal-Setting Theory has been less commonly researched in adolescent be-haviors than the other theories describedin previous chapters, although it appearsto play a critical underlying role in theplanning, implementing, and monitoringof health promotion interventions for adolescents. The theory helps to foster de-velopment of an \"ego ideal,\" an importantdevelopmental task of early adolescence,as we have seen. It also allows for the en-couragement and monitoring of specificbehavior changes during adolescence.

Summary of the Goal-Setting Theory and Adolescent Lifestyles Possessing a sense of purpose in life, as it relates to establishing personal goals, is an important internal developmental asset and has been associated with health-promoting lifestyles amongadolescents. Goal-setting helps to develop an \"ego ideal,\" which allows young people to model, evaluate, and picture themselves in the future. Setting individual goals can be an effective way of capturing child and adolescent motivation, since the ability to face challenges and competition is an important ingredient in the development ofpersonal identity. Adolescents who target a behavior (e.g., physical activity or eating habits) tend to improve more than those who don't. Adolescents can have two different prevailing dating goals: Intimacy goals (longer dating relationships) Identity goals (casual dating with different partners) Goal-relevant safer sex education will increase intentions of using condoms among adolescents.Recently, a new theoretical perspective has emerged emphasizing the importance of self-regulation, whose development, as we have already seen in previous chapters, reaches its peak during late adolescence. The Self-Regulation Theory underlines the dynamic processes involved in setting, striving toward, and achievinghealth goals. These processes encompass the consequences of both successes and fail-ures and also how to deal with obstacles to change health-compromising behaviors andadopt new, healthier ones. Self-regulatory conceptualizations deal with how individuals can correct personal behav- iors on their own (Bartholomew et al. 2001). The basic elements are: accurately identifying and recording a specific type of behavior; setting acceptable objectives; evaluating the response; and changing the previous behavior according to assessment of the response or reinforc-ing the response if the standard is met. The above process is cyclical and based on monitoring. The ability to self-regulate is an extremely important developmental task to learn during adolescence. It is more easilyachieved by some adolescents and presents greater challenges for others, due to biolog-ical and environmental differences. Self-regulatory capabilities include self-demands ingoal-setting, self-motivation, and self-direction in reaching the proposed goals, and[Chapter Thirteen ] The Self-Regulation Theoryself-evaluation in assessing errors, short- comings, and obstacles. Self-regulation isachieved when individuals are able tomonitor their own behavior through cuesand feedback from the outside world aswell as through internal cognitive assess-ment and affective processes. While self-regulation capacity increases with age, ac-tual functioning nonetheless is alwaysdetermined by biological considerations(i.e., the state of development of the pre-frontal lobes in the brain) and objectiveexternal forces, as well as by socio-environmental consequences (Muss 1996). As noted in Chapters Nine and Twelve, the term executive functions refers to self- directed actions the individual employs forself-regulation purposes. Analysis and un-derstanding of these functions can provideunique information about how human be-havior becomes self-regulated or inter-nally guided. Russell Barkley (1997) re-viewed 1978, 1977;Vygotsky 1962) and suggested the following functions as necessary for self-regulation: behavioral inhibition working memory internalization of speech motivational appraisal system reconstitution (behavioral synthesis) Behavioral inhibition: Behavioral inhibition requires the ac-quisition of a system that provides forthe inhibition of responses that have as their function the maximization of im-mediate consequences. The develop-ment of the behavioral inhibition func-tion is critical in enabling delayedconsequences to affect behavioral con-trol. The teaching of self-regulatoryskills has been demonstrated in theschool setting (Schunk 1998). Mostyoung people train their behavioral in-hibition capacity to not disrupt a class-room through constant reinforcementfrom their teachers, for example. Overtime, they gradually learn to suppressthe impulse to speak loudly or out ofturn and engage in other disruptiveclassroom behaviors. This inhibitorysystem also provides adolescents withthe power to interrupt ongoing behav-ioral patterns, should informationfrom immediately past behaviors in thesequence be indicating errors or theineffectiveness of the ongoing pattern.For example, in this system, children will interrupt disruptive behavior if theresponse of the teacher is a silent, but stern facial expression. Finally,it appears that this inhibitory systemfunctions to control potential sourcesof interference that could disrupt, sub- vert, or preempt the activities takingplace within working memory. The endresult is that over time children learn tokeep their attention focused on theclassroom and to filter out extraneousenvironmental distractions. The development of behavioral inhibi- tion ability is crucial in helping adoles- YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTEEN | 95YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 96cents effectively face and learn to deal with the numerous temptations anddangers that are part of their daily lives.Unfortunately, the achievement of be-havioral inhibition is increasingly chal-lenged in today's world by the perva-siveness of media messages, such asthose found in musical videos, radio andtelevision advertisements, and movies,which encourage the enactment of im-pulsive behaviors related to the con-sumption of unhealthy foods, as well astobacco and alcohol, and sexual experi-mentation and to the resolution of con-flicts through violence. This situation isfurther abetted by the fact that adoles-cents find themselves acquiring in-creasing levels of autonomy at the sametime that parental supervision is de-creasing. Particularly in those cases inwhich parents spend a great deal of timeoutside the home due to work schedulesand other nonfamily commitments,valuable opportunities to provide ado-lescents with constant reinforcementsand feedback about their behavioral in-hibition abilities are missed. The acquisition of behavioral inhibition abilities by adolescents sets the stage forthe development of the capacity to en-gage in self-regulation via the four otherexecutive functions that are discussedbelow. Working memory: In most real-life situations, individuals will store and be able to recall informa-tion not for the purpose of recall itself, but as a prerequisite for solving a prob-lem at hand. These memory recalls in-volve deciding which types of informa-tion are useful for dealing with thesituation at hand and then selecting thisinformation out of the totality of allavailable knowledge stored in the brain.Furthermore, as the nature of our activi-ties changes, we can make a smooth, in-stantaneous switch from one selection toanother, and then are able to repeat theprocess. Memory that is based on suchever-changing, fluid decision-making,information selection, and informationswitches back and forth is guided by thefrontal lobes and is called working mem- ory. It is closely linked to the critical role the frontal lobes play in the temporal or-ganization of behavior and in controllingthe proper sequence in which variousmental operations are enacted to meetthe individual's objective. Goldman-Rakic (1995a) described two temporally symmetrical functionswithin this system, one of which permitsthe recall or re-sensing of the past andwhich in turn gives rise to the second,which is the construction of hypotheticalfutures, the preparation of plans for at-taining those future scenarios as envi-sioned, and the construction of behav-ioral structures that are associated withthem. When adolescents are confronted by temptations and pressures, they needYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTEEN | 97to not only possess behavioral inhibi- tion abilities, but also the skills to makedecisions on how to react to thosetemptations. In this way, the workingmemory system appears to shift behav-ioral response away from the immedi-ate stimulus and away from externalcontrol and focus it more towards thefuture by way of internally-generatedinformation arising from private,covert mental activity. Internalization of speech: Research in developmental psychologysuggests that this process of turningspeech inward in a form of internal dia-logue with oneself, which becomes pro-gressively more private, covert, or in-ternalized, is a major contributor to thedevelopment of self-control (Berk1994, 1992; Kopp 1982). Therefore,speech internalization will need to beincluded in any model of executivefunctions that is used to account for thedevelopment of human self-regulation.Adolescents facing temptations anddangers will be able to increase theirpossibilities of making a mindful andhealthy choice if they have the capacityto activate an internal dialogue andthink through the array of different re-sponse alternatives, instead of merelyreacting upon impulse. Motivational appraisal system: This system provides for the affectiveand motivational appraisal of past eventsbeing held in the working memory andof the hypothetical futures created from them. By providing such affective andmotivational color or tone to theseevents, the motivational appraisal sys-tem permits them to be immediately re-tained or discarded depending upontheir affective and motivational value tothe individual. Such a system, as Dama-sio (1994) notes, provides the con-straints that must be placed on decision-making when a variety of past events andhypothetical option-outcome pairs arebeing considered. The reactivation ofpast sensory-motor information brings with it the affective/motivational aspects linked to thoseevents in the past (their somatic mark- ers), and these markers are then inher- ently linked with those plans or hypo-thetical futures constructed from thepast. For example, if an adolescent has apleasurable experience with his or herfriends when participating together in aphysical activity, it is more likely that heor she will be motivated to exercise againwith those friends in the future. Reconstitution (behavioral synthesis): Bronowski (1977) asserted that thepower to synthesize novel and complexbehavioral structures arises out of theability to analyze and dismember pastbehavioral structures and their hierar-chy. One can then reorganize them intonew structures and sequences, all ofwhich is done mainly for the purpose of attaining a specific goal. Such a function grants humans a tremendousYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 98capacity for diversity, flexibility, and creativity in the formulation of behav-ioral structures aimed at the future. Forexample, as we saw in Chapter Nine,role-playing can be an effective tech-nique of dramatic relief to help move in-dividuals from the pre-contemplation tocontemplation stage because it facili-tates the acknowledgment of the under-lying emotions that accompany un-healthy behavioral risks and theirconsequences. In this sense, when ado-lescents are taught drug-resistant skillsthrough role-playing, they will be reconstitute those previouslylearned skills when a real-life situationoccurs that is charged with similar emo-tions to those they have come to recog-nize and understand through the role-playing exercises. Studies of the development of executive functions in children and adolescentsillustrate the probable differential tim-ing for the maturation of these func-tions. Levin et al. (1991) found signifi-cant increases as a function of age on a number of executive function measures.Differences in sensitivity to feedback,problem-solving, concept formation,and impulse control between 7- to-8-year-old and 9- to-12-year-old agegroups of normal children were found.Further significant developmental ad-vances were noted in memory strate-gies, memory efficiency, planning oftime, problem-solving, and hypothesis-seeking between 9-to-12-year-old and13-to-15-year-old age groups of normaladolescents.

Executive Functions Needed for Self-Regulation Behavioral inhibition: the ability to inhibit responses and delay immediate gratification Working memory: the ability to store and recall information useful for problem-solving Internalization of speech: the ability to turn speech inward in a form of dialogic conversation with oneself Motivational appraisal system: the affective and motivational assessment of past events being held in the working memory for their applicability to the creation of hypothetical futures Reconstitution (behavioral synthesis): the ability to synthesize novel and complex behaviors, analyze and/or dismember past behavioral structures and their hierarchy, and combine and reorderboth past and novel behaviors into new structures and sequencesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTEEN | 99deemed to be important in the etiology of drinking were also assessed. Studentswere followed up in the 12th grade, when16% were categorized as heavy drinkers.Logistic regression analysis revealed thatheavy drinking was predicted by havingexperimented with alcohol or cigarettes,having had a majority of one's friends whoalso drink, and having had poor behavioralself-control during early adolescence.Tarter et al. (1995) analyzed the associa- tion between childhood irritability and li-ability to substance use during early ado-lescence. The follow-up results indicatedthat family dysfunction, the stress state ofthe child, and low behavioral self-controladded up to a significant proportion ofvariance on irritability scale scores twoyears later, and that this trait, in conjunc-tion with family discord, was associatedwith substance use being adopted duringearly adolescence as a coping response. Wills et al. (2001a) examined the relation- ship between temperament dimensionsand substance use in 1,810 U.S. publicschool students (mean age 11.5 years). Thepresence of good self-control led to higheracademic competence and had direct ef-fects on lowering individual substanceuse; poor self-control led to more deviantpeer affiliation. Novak and Clayton (2001) looked at the influence of school environment and self-regulation on transitions between stages of cigarette smoking. The analyses of the multilevel interactions between self-regulation and school context revealedthat students possessing low emotional regulation were more likely to initiate ex-perimental smoking in schools with poorlevels of discipline and involvement (i.e.,less caring for the students and showing aless active interest in their well-being)than similar types of students in schoolswith higher levels of these characteristics.This study illustrates how psychologicalrisk factors for substance use may varyacross school social environments. Wills, Sandy, and Yaeger (2002a) tested predictions, derived from the self-regulation model, about variables moder-ating the relationship between level ofsubstance use (tobacco, alcohol, and mar-ijuana) and problems associated with use(interpersonal relationships, school per-formance, and difficulties with the legal/ justice systems) in middle adolescence. Ithas been proposed that some individualshave difficulty in coping with problemsand regulating emotions and that severalaspects of these self-regulation charac-teristics would make individuals moreprone to experience substance-relatedproblems. The authors hypothesized thatvariables related to poor self-control andnegative affectivity would increase the re-lationship between substance use leveland these problems. The presence of goodself-control and positive affectivity wouldhave protective moderation effects, re-ducing the relationship between sub-stance use level and the problems. Thepredictions were tested in two samples (n= 1,699 and n= 1,225) of U.S. adoles- cents. Mean age was 15.5 years (middleYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 100adolescence). The results confirmed the prediction that variables indicative ofgood self-control had protective modera-tion effects, reducing the relationshipbetween level and problems. Variables in-dicative of poor self-control had risk-enhancing moderation effects, increas-ing the relationship between level andproblems. These findings help to empha-size the importance of fostering self-regulation and self-control as develop-mental capacities in the earlier stages ofadolescent development. Hern\u00e1ndez factors,and among U.S. male universitystudents. They found that late adolescentswho had low scores for ego-development(goal-directedness) and self-control weresignificantly more likely to engage in sexwithout condoms. In another study of gen-der differences and sexual behavior(MacKellar et al. 2000), low self-controlwas also associated with non-use of con-doms among homeless and runaway youths, but only among males. The studies just described are only a sample of those that have used the Self-Regulation Theory to analyze adolescenthealth behaviors. Generally, the theory hasbeen utilized to understand tobacco, alco-hol, and drug consumption among adoles-cents, yet has scarcely been taken intoconsideration when examining sexual andreproductive behaviors. Self-regulationand self-control abilities are extremelyimportant developmental tasks to masterduring the pre- and early adolescent de-velopmental stages. They allow, amongother things, for a better regulation of sex-ual arousal in boys in today's society whichencourages sexual experience in youngmales and which is characterized by highrates of sexual coercion and gender abuse.

Summary of the Self-Regulation Theory and Adolescent Lifestyles Poor behavioral self-regulation and self-control during adolescence are associated with heavy drinking, substance use, experimentation with tobacco, deviant peer affiliation, and increasedlikelihood of engaging in sex without condoms. Good self-control and positive affectivity have protective moderation effects, reducing the rela- tionship between substance use level (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana) and problems associatedwith substance use (interpersonal relationships, school performance, and difficulties with thelegal/justice systems). The presence of good self-control leads to higher academic competence and has direct effects on lowering adolescent substance use.Why are some adolescents more temperamental, active, risk-taking, and/or \"difficult\" than others? Individual differences have been described as beingpresent at birth and influenced\u2014but not determined\u2014by postnatal experi- ence. The concept of temperament has been widely recognized as one of the basic aspectsof the psychological component of behavioral functioning. Findings of a systematic study by Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas in their long-term investigation, the New YorkLongitudinal Study (NYLS), led to the establishment of an extensive body of research ontemperament and other individual differences ( seeKohnstamm et al. 1989). Chess and Thomas (1996) described nine categories of individual variance that determine tem-perament: (1) activity level; (2) \"rhythmicity\" or regularity of biological functions andpredictability; (3) tendency to approach or withdraw when confronted with new stimuli;(4) adaptability to new situations; (5) threshold of responsiveness; (6) intensity of reac-tion; (7) quality of mood; (8) distractibility; and (9) attention span and persistence. Chess and Thomas also described three main temperament constellations: Easy temperament , which is characterized by regularity, positive approach responses to new stimuli, high adaptability to change, and mild or moderately intense mood that ispreponderantly positive; Slow-to-warm-up temperament , which is a combination of negative responses of mild intensity to new stimuli with slow adaptability after repeated contact, as well as someirregularities of biological functions (e.g., sleep patterns and feeding schedules); and [Chapter Fourteen ] The Sensation-Seeking Theory Difficult temperament , which is charac- terized by significant irregularities inbiological function, negative withdrawalresponses to new stimuli, nonadapt-ability to change, and intense mood ex-pressions that are frequently negative. The NYLS showed that infants with diffi- cult temperaments tended to evolve into\"difficult children and adolescents,\" char-acterized by an oppositional, defiant styleof interaction with others. Chess and Thomas have insisted that although \"diffi-cult children\" display behavior disorders(e.g., aggressiveness, delinquency), thisbehavior only occurs as the result of inter-action in an inappropriate caretaking en-vironment or otherwise inadequate socialenvironment. Furthermore, according toan earlier study (Thomas, Chess, andBirch 1968), parent-child interactionshould be analyzed not only for parentalinfluences on the child but equally for theinfluence of the child's individual charac-teristics upon the parent. The term good- ness of fit was coined by these authors to explain how the consonance between thechild and his/her environment potentiatesoptimal positive development, and howthe dissonance between the capacities andcharacteristics of the child, on the onehand, and the environmental opportuni-ties and demands, on the other, lead tomaladaptative functioning and distorteddevelopment ( poorness of fit ). Carey (1989) introduced the concept of temperament risk factors as any temperament characteristics predisposing a child to a poor fit with hisor her environment, to excessive interac-tional stress and conflict with his/her caretakers, and to secondary clinical prob-lems manifesting themselves in the child'sphysical health, development, and/orbehavior. One of the important individual differ- ences described by the temperament stud-ies is the tendency to approach or with-draw when confronted with new stimuli.According to Zuckerman (1994), this gen-eral dispositional approach involves sociability represents the opti-mistic tendency to approach novel stimuliand explore the environment. Impulsivityis a style of rapid decision-making whenfaced with a given stimulus. Sociability isthe tendency to approach others in socialsituations, whether familiar or strangers,with few or no reservations. Persons withlow sociability, on the other hand, tend towithdraw under circumstances where thestimuli are too novel or the anticipatedoutcome is too uncertain. All three com-ponents of approach\u2014sensation-seeking,impulsivity, and sociability\u2014have a geneticbasis accounting for 40% to 60% of thevariance in the approach trait. The modelsuggests that underlying this trait, at thebiological level, are the monoamine neu-rotransmitters and the gonadal hormones. Sensation-seeking is a trait describing the tendency to seek novel, varied, complex,and intense sensations and experiencesand the willingness to take risks for thesake of participating in the experience. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FOURTEEN | 103YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 104The idea of \"novelty\" presupposes that the given situation or event is something notpreviously experienced. The need forcomplexity in perceptual stimuli and cog-nitive challenges is a salient feature of thesensation-seeking trait. In those situa-tions that entail risk, high sensation-seekers find the sensations or experiences wellworth the risk, whereas low sensation- seekers either do not value the sensations of the activity as highly or do not think theexperience is worth the risk involved. The end goal of sensation-seeking behav- ior is the increase of stimulation. Gener-ally, human beings enjoy a large variety ofstimulation emanating from the differentsenses: sight (e.g., provocative images,whether witnessed first-hand or throughthe media); smell (e.g., perfumes, aro-mas); taste (e.g., sweet, salty, or spicyfoods); tactile (e.g., gentle touch, caresses) and deep proprioception, or the receptionof heightened pressure by cells located be- tween the skin and muscles (e.g., mas-sages); sound (e.g., music, nature); andmovement in space (e.g., riding rollercoasters, water slides). Some people arehighly reactive to these types of stimulationand prefer to enjoy them at a lower inten-sity, while others are less reactive anddesire a higher intensity. During preado-lescence (ages 9-12), young people in-creasingly complain of being \"bored.\" Thereason for this is that the need for highsensation-seeking increases during thepreadolescent period, accompanied by anincrease in the cognitive, verbal, motor,and social developmental skills, while atthe same time, the lack of complete auton- omy from parents, teachers, and otheradults presents restraints to the adoles-cent's ability to react to these sensory stim-ulations as fully and intensely as he or shewould like to. Sensation-seeking is a normal trait of per- sonality. Sensation-seekers have a strongcapacity to focus attention on a particularstimulus or task. Cognitive styles associatedwith sensation-seeking include a tendencyfor broad cognitive generalization and an inclination toward employing more com-plex cognitive categories. Low sensation-seekers, on the other hand, use a narrowerrange of simpler constructs. Openness tonew experiences is a requisite for creativityin any field. Sensation-seekers tend to beoriginal and innovative in open-endedproblem-solving. However, particularly inthe case of preadolescents, when highsensation-seeking is combined with othernegative traits or affective experiences(e.g., lack of positive socialization), thesituation can result in a severe health-compromising lifestyle, which in turncould become a serious clinical conditionaffecting the adolescent's physical andmental health and development. The Sensation-Seeking Scale (SSS), origi- nally developed by Zuckerman and col-leagues (Zuckerman et al. 1964), has be-come the basic method of identifying highversus low sensation-seekers in the popu-lation in order to study their behaviors andbiology (Zuckerman 1994).

Gender differ-ences were also found, with males pre-senting higher scores than females. Find-ings indicating a decline in generalsensation-seeking, and in the forms ofthrill- and adventure-seeking and socialdisinhibition, beginning in late adoles-cence or during the early 20s, have beenwidely demonstrated through cross-sectional studies. A significant relationship between adoles- cent risk behaviors and sensation-seekinghas been described in the literature. Ado-lescents who rank high in their tendencyto seek sensation (high sensation-seekers), relative to those who rank low(low sensation-seekers), are much moreat risk of using a variety of drugs and of ex-periencing an earlier onset of use. Zuck-erman (1988) described the relationship between sensation-seeking and past orcurrent smoking in students at the Uni-versity of Delaware in the 1980s. The rela-tionship is highly significant. Among thehigh sensation-seeking students, 43%were current smokers or had smoked inthe past, compared to 32% of the mediumsensation-seeking group and 22% of thelow sensation-seeking group. The rela-tionship between smoking and sensation-seeking has also been found for U.S. highschool students (Dinn et al. 2004, An-drucci et al. 1989), British male collegestudents (Golding, Harpur, and Brent-Smith 1983), Norwegian high school stu-dents Clausen, and Lavik1989), and Israeli adolescents (Teichman,Barnea, and Rahav 1989). Although this relationship between sensation-seeking and smoking was foundin both genders, females who were currentheavy smokers, smoking two or more packsa day, were as low as nonsmokers on theSensation-Seeking Scale. Zuckerman sug-gests that in this group, smoking may bemore related to anxiety than to sensation-seeking. Teichman and colleagues foundthat those who started at a younger age had the highest scores on the Sensation-Seeking Scale, followed by those whostarted later, while those who consistentlyabstained had the lowest scores. Sensation-seeking is also related to alco- hol and drug use in adolescence andpreadolescence, and early adolescentsensation-seeking traits can predict laterYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 106substance use (Crawford et al. 2003, Stan- ton et al. 2001). This relationship hasbeen found in many countries. Marijuanatends to be the first illegal drug used andis favored by young high sensation-seekers. In all of these studies of adoles-cent drug use, sensation-seeking isstrongly implicated, whereas anxiety anddepression seem to have little or no pre-dictive value. Only the use of depressantsin the Israeli sample (Teichman, Barnea,and Rahav 1989) was associated with anx-iety and depression. In another studydone in 20 U.S. middle schools ( n= 3,127 eighth graders) the author was able todemonstrate that peer pressure and per-ceived peer marijuana use had only a rel-atively trivial effect on low sensation-seekers and a much greater effect on highsensation-seekers (Slater 2003). In an-other study conducted in Spain, Com\u00ednBertr\u00e1n and colleagues (Com\u00edn Bertr\u00e1n,Torrubia Beltri, and Mor Sancho 1998) found not only an association between to- bacco and alcohol use and sensation-seeking scores in sixth graders (mean age:11.4) and eighth graders (mean age: 13.2),but also high scores among those whowere actively involved in sports and exer-cise. These results support the need foralternative experiences for youth exhibit-ing high levels of sensation-seeking andrefocusing this tendency on healthier, butstill novel and intense experiences. High sensation-seekers' needs for stimu- lation are associated with distinct prefer-ences for high sensation-value mediamessages that elicit greater sensory, affec-tive, and arousal responses. Such mes- sages contain elements that are novel, dra-matic, emotionally powerful, physicallyarousing, graphic, explicit, unconven-tional, fast-paced, and/or suspenseful.High sensation-value messages haveproven to be more effective than lowsensation-value messages among highsensation-seeking teenagers and youngadults in helping them decide to call a pre-vention hotline, in improving media mes-sage recall, in having more negative atti-tudes towards drugs, and in loweringbehavioral intentions to use drugs (Palm-green et al. 2001). The same study showedthat antidrug public service announce-ments placed in high sensation-valuetelevision programming also elicit sig-nificantly greater attention from high sensation-seekers than do those placed in low sensation-value programs. These findings led Philip Palmgreen, pro- fessor of communications at the Univer-sity of Kentucky in Lexington, to developthe Sensation-Seeking Targeting (SEN-TAR) prevention approach. This approach incorporates four principles: (1) usesensation-seeking as a targeting variable;(2) conduct formative research with tar-get audience members; (3) design highsensation-value prevention messages; and(4) place messages in program contextsthat are attractive to the target audience. The SENTAR prevention approach was ef- fectively used in a recent television cam-paign to reduce marijuana consumptionamong high sensation-seeking adoles-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FOURTEEN | 107cents in two different communities (Palmgreen et al. 2001). Five televisedpublic service announcements (PSAs) ap-peared between January and April 1997 inFayette County, Kentucky. Similar cam- paigns were launched there again and inKnox County, Tennessee, between Januaryand April 1998. The PSAs were designed toappeal to adolescents who had tested highon a Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale andwere placed during television programs(such as The Simpsons and StarTrek: The Next Generation ) that were most likely to be watched by this group of teens, as deter-mined by a survey before the spots aired.Effects from the single campaign in KnoxCounty were still evident several monthsafter its conclusion. There, the estimateddrop in the relative proportion of highsensation-seeking adolescents using mar-ijuana was 26.7%. In Fayette County, thedrop in marijuana use among this groupwas estimated to be approximately 38%.Forlow sensation-seeking adolescents, both marijuana usage rates and reactionsto the PSAs were much lower than for theirhigh sensation-seeking counterparts. Thecampaign effects were specific to mari-juana use, however, with no effects seen inthe use of tobacco, alcohol, and otherdrugs. The four SENTAR principles are currently being applied in the U.S. Office of NationalDrug Control Policy's five-year NationalYouth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2002b), in conjunction with other proven cognitively-oriented theoretical frameworks, such asthe Social Cognitive Theory, the Health Be- lief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action,and the Theory of Planned Behavior(Chapters Sixteen, Eight, Ten, and Eleven,respectively, in this book). The newest wave in information technol- ogy, media communications, and com-mercial advertising is the presentation ofhighly compressed visual and auditory im-ages and stimuli displays, a product partlyof economics and partly of recently ex- panded digitalization capacities. The ad-vent of video games and cutting-edge mu-sical programming on cable networktelevision has created an entirely of processing information through\"sight bites\" and \"sound bytes,\" andtoday's young people have come to expectand prefer this type of high-paced stimu-lation from the media. Substantive research indicates an increase in sensation-seeking during the pre- andearly adolescent periods (9-14 years ofage), which reaches its peak during middleadolescence (ages 15-16 years) and tendsto decline in late adolescence, around theage of 20. These findings, combined withthe reality that adolescents respond to tar-geted messages on a spontaneous and vis-ceral level, provide a strong argument forthe need to \"use what works\" when devel-oping health-promoting media campaignsdirected towards adolescents and youth. In this sense, effective program design should not only target behaviors to adoptor change, but also seek to satisfy adoles-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 108cent needs and wants (Chapter Five), ap- propriately tailor interventions to the ado-lescents' developmental stage (ChapterSix), and take into account gender and cul-tural considerations, which will be dis-cussed further in Chapter Twenty-seven.The research shows that adolescents want novelty and fun, and they will search forways to satisfy their increasing need for sensation-seeking. Additionally, whatmight be considered exciting to the senseswill be different for boys and girls, forpreadolescents and late adolescents, andfor youth living in Argentina, Jamaica, Panama, and the United States (as well as in different communities within each ofthese countries). PAHO recommends thatprogram designers keep these ideas inmind when planning all types of healthpromotion and prevention interventions.It is also crucial that the team developingthe interventions be highly creative, youngin spirit, and empathetic to the intensifiedneed for novelty during adolescence. Given that adolescents find the elements of novelty, drama, fast pacing, emotional arousal, unconventionality, suspense, etc.,to be highly appealing, another importantaspect in designing successful health pro-motion and behavior change interventionsis discussing the reasons behind adoles-cent preferences and concerns with theparticipants themselves. In this sense,program developers should seek to activelyengage adolescents from the beginningand encourage their input and feedback,thereby winning their trust, helping themto see the relevancy of the process, andbuilding their confidence in their ability to become agents of their own change. As all parents and teachers of \"bored\" ado- lescents will agree, young people, as theybecome older, need to gradually shift fromexpecting the world to entertain them tolearning to entertain themselves, over-come feelings of boredom, and seek sen-sations in healthy ways. Part of this shiftwill occur naturally as the adolescentmoves through the different develop-mental stages, faces new challenges andexperiences, and gains increased self-confidence in his or her decision-makingability. But this shift also needs to be ac-companied by support from the surround-ing social environment in which the ado-lescent lives, studies, plays, and works.Families, schools, and other key commu- nity members need to work together informal and informal partnerships to pro- vide positive forms of stimulation to ado-lescents that enable them to discover theworld around them and embrace new andhealthier activities on their own terms. The studies just described are only a sam- ple of those that have used the Sensation-Seeking Theory to analyze adolescenthealth behaviors. Generally, the theory hasbeen utilized to understand tobacco, alco-hol, and drug consumption among adoles-cents, yet has scarcely been taken intoconsideration when examining sexual andreproductive behaviors, physical activity,eating behaviors, and violence. The fewstudies examining risky early sexual activ-ity have been in relationship with otherYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FOURTEEN | 109risky behaviors, such as alcohol and drug abuse.

Summary of the Sensation-Seeking Theory and Adolescent Lifestyles sensation-seekers and a much greater effect on high sensation-seekers. High sensation-seekers' needs for stimulation are associated with distinct preferences fornovel, high sensation-value media messagesthat elicit greater sensory, affective, andarousal responses. High sensation-value messages have proven to be more effective than low sensation-valuemessages among high sensation-seekingteenagers and young adults in helping themdecide to call a prevention hotline, in improvingmedia message recall, in having more nega-tive attitudes towards drugs, and in loweringbehavioral intentions to use drugs. Research shows that adolescents want nov- elty and fun, and they will search for ways to satisfy their increasing need for sensation- seeking. Therefore interventions will be moreeffective if they are highly creative, young inspirit, and empathetic to the intensified needfor novelty during adolescence.Sensation-seeking is a trait describing the tendency to seek novel, varied, complex, and intense sensations and experiences andthe willingness to take risks for the sake ofparticipating in the experience. There is an increase in sensation-seeking during the pre- and early adolescent periods(9-14 years of age), which reaches its peakduring middle adolescence (ages 15-16years) and tends to decline in late adoles-cence, around the age of 20. A significant relationship between adolescent risk behaviors and sensation-seeking hasbeen described in the literature. Adolescents who rank high in their tendency to seek sensation (high sensation-seekers),relative to those who rank low (low sensation-seekers), are much more at risk of using avariety of drugs and of experiencing an earlieronset of use (tobacco, alcohol, and illegaldrugs). Peer pressure and perceived peer marijuana use have only a relatively trivial effect on lowOf all the theories and models reviewed in Chapters Eight through Fourteen to promote change at an individual level, the Health Belief Model (Chapter Eight)has been the most utilized when addressing adolescent behaviors, particularly those involving sexual and reproductive health. This finding must be taken with caution,however, since, as noted in Chapter Eight, the studies of adolescent behaviors using themodel usually lack a developmental perspective, and, in essence, represent the extrapo-lation of a theory developed to change adult health behaviors to this younger age group.Furthermore, most of the interventions to reduce HIV-risk-associated sexual behavioramong adolescents in community settings using the model have been conducted withyouth in late adolescence (Jemmot and Jemmot 2000). Interestingly, tobacco, alcohol,and drug prevention efforts have relied more on the Self-Regulation Theory andSensation-Seeking Theory to explain underlying factors and have used the Stages ofChange Model to promote healthy behaviors. This model has also been the one most usedto promote physical activity and healthy nutrition among adolescents. While there havebeen a few efforts to understand aggressive behaviors at the individual level using theSelf-Regulation Theory and Sensation-Seeking Theory, this adolescent behavior hasbeen the least studied through individual change theories.

Individual Level Theories and Models and Their Application to Adolescent Behavioral Change: A Comparison of Conceptual Frameworks, Applications, and Benefits Theory/Model Conceptual Framework Application Benefits Health Belief Model (Chapter Eight)This theory proposes that ado- lescents will change their health-compromising behaviors and/oradopt health-promoting behav-iors if they consider themselvesvulnerable to a disease, believe ithas serious consequences, andfeel that changing their behaviorwill reduce their susceptibility tothe disease or its severity.This theory is a very useful one when working with adults, but itshould be used with caution withadolescents. Because of the as-sumption that the person mustfeel threatened by their currentbehavior, the model may be usedfor certain adolescent concerns(e.g., body image and fat con-sumption for girls), but not nec-essarily for all risk behaviors, es-pecially if the individual does notfeel threatened or dissatisfiedwith his or her current behavior. The majority of research using this model to address differentadolescent lifestyles and behav-iors has been in the area of sex-ual and reproductive health, suchas efforts to reduce teen preg-nancy, STIs, and HIV/AIDS. One important finding is that theseverity of the HIV/AIDS dis-ease, more than fear of con-tracting an infection and barriersto taking action, is a significantpredictor of the adoption of HIV-preventive behaviors among ado-lescents (Yep 1993). The results of the only known study to analyze the Health Be-lief Model with a developmentalperspective (Petosa and Jackson1991) suggest that the modelvariables can be useful when de-signing educational programs topromote safer sex intentions inyounger adolescents; however,its effectiveness decreases asthey grow older. This model can be useful for program developers when de-signing interventions and mes-sages encouraging pre- andearly adolescents to delay sexualinitiation and protect themselvesfrom contracting STIs or HIV/AIDS or getting pregnant. How-ever, evidence suggests thatthese types of messages are notlong-lasting among the adoles-cent population, and their effec-tiveness decreases for middleand late adolescents and youngadults. The model may be con-sidered when choosing the con-ceptual framework for pre-adolescent interventions, butshould not be the only theorychosen to guide program inter-ventions because of its limitedeffect.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 114Table 15-2.

Accordingto this model, tailoring interven-tions to match the adolescent'sreadiness or stage of change isessential. This model states thatpeople use a variety of differentprocesses (e.g., dramatic relief,environmental reevaluation, self-efficacy and social support,modeling, coping with barriers,counter-conditioning) as theymove from one stage of changeto another. Efficient behaviorchange thus depends on theindividual doing the right thing(processes) at the right time(stages).

It hasalso been adopted to match drugprevention strategies and mes-sages to youth stages when useoccurs and to study the readi-ness to change drinking habitsamong university students.

Post-intervention behav-iors can be compared to baselinebehaviors by stages to find evi-dence of effectiveness of the be-havior change intervention. Another benefit of this model, from a developmental perspec-tive, is that it can serve as a plan-ning guide for how to change be-haviors step-by-step, particularlywhen adolescents have not yetdeveloped sufficient skills to planahead on an independent basis. The model also provides an op- portunity to investigate whichfactors determine the stage anadolescent is in during differentbehaviors, as well as the barriersand processes involved whenadvancing to other stages ofbehavior. A final benefit is that the model may be used to promote changenot only at the individual level,but also at the interpersonal andcommunity levels.

The Theory of Planned Behavior is an extension of the Theory ofReasoned Action which addition-ally considers that there are fac-tors outside the adolescent'scontrol that can affect his or her intention to adopt a behaviorand that these need to be ad-dressed, as well, in the design of interventions. Adolescents with goals exert themselves more, persevere intheir tasks, apply greater con-centration, and, as the situationrequires, develop the necessarystrategies for carrying out thebehavior (Bartholomew et al.2001). From this goal-orientedapproach, behavior is believed to be initiated only when it issmoking; the role of smoking in the lives of low-income pregnantadolescents; in comparisons ofself-esteem, attitudes, and sub-jective norms in the prediction of drug and alcohol use; the in-tended sexual and condom be-havior patterns among highschool students; and in theanalysis of the decision-makingprocesses for sugar consumptionamong adolescents. The use of the Theory of Planned Behavior to change adolescentbehaviors has been studied inCanada, Europe, and the UnitedStates. Research applying thetheory includes the onset ofsmoking in youth, a cross-cultural study of beliefs aboutsmoking among female teen-agers, the identification of vari-ables that differentiate and dis-criminate among the variousstages of cigarette smoking, thecontribution of alcohol outcomeexpectancies and attitudes to-wards drinking, how determi-nants of physical activity changewith adolescent development,and the measurement and analy-sis of the determinants of youngpeople's intentions to use con-doms to prevent HIV infection. The theory has been used to demonstrate that adolescentswho target a behavior for im-provements (e.g., physical activ-ity, eating habits) tend to achievegreater success than those whodo not. It has also been utilizedto examine the different goals(intimacy vs. identity) late adoles-cents bring to bear in socialdeterminants of behaviors that can be targeted to change ado-lescents' behavioral intentions,and, ultimately, their actual be-haviors, it is important that pro-gram developers give carefulconsideration to the particularsociocultural context within whichthe interventions will take place.At the same time, program plan-ners and developers should keepin mind that there can be signifi-cant differences in the role thatdifferent theoretical constructs(e.g., subjective norm and be-havioral control) can play at dif-ferent adolescent stages. Although described as an individ- ual behavior change theory, theGoal-Setting Theory may also beapplied to promote changes atthe interpersonal and communitylevels.

Goal selection, the consec-utive choice of behavior, and thecontrol mechanisms to accom-pany the behavior change all de-termine whether a change in be-havior will be achieved. Self-regulation conceptualiza- tions focus on how individualscan monitor and correct personalbehaviors on their own. Master-ing self-regulatory techniques isan extremely important develop-mental task to be learned duringadolescence. It requires the abil-ity to make self-demands ingoal-setting, as well as the de-velopment skills self-direction inreaching the While self-regulation ca-pacity increases with age, actualfunctioning is determined by theextent of the adolescent's bio-logical growth process, objec-tive external factors, to pro- mote young people's owndecision-making about riskysexual behavior choices, and to address teen pregnancy. The Goal-Setting Theory has been less commonly researchedin adolescent behaviors than theTheories of Reasoned Action andPlanned Behavior and the HealthBelief and Transtheorical Models. The theory has been utilized to better understand tobacco, al-cohol, and drug consumptionamong adolescents, yet hasscarcely been taken into consid-eration when examining sexualand reproductive health behav-iors. Issues studied using thistheory include psychosocial andbehavioral factors in early adoles-cence as predictors of heavydrinking among high school stu-dents; the association betweenhyperactivity and executive cogni-tive functioning in childhood andsubstance abuse in early adoles-cence; the influence of schoolenvironment and self-regulationon transitions between stages ofsmoking; predictions regardingvariables moderating the relation-ship between substance abuselevel and problems (interpersonal,academic, and legal) associatedwith use in middle adolescents;and HIV-related knowledge, atti-tudes, moral development, psy-chosocial factors, and behaviorsamong university-age males. an important developmental goal of early adolescence: the emer-gence of an \"ego ideal\" and a\"sense of purpose in life,\" whichhave been identified as protectiveinternal assets that help ward offrisk-taking behaviors. A strongadvantage of this theory is that itencourages health providers andprogram developers to facilitateadolescents' personal healthgoals, rather than employ strate-gies which youth might find toocoercive in nature and thus havegreater difficulty identifying with. The success of self-management interventions, obviously, dependsupon the level of the individualadolescent's skills. Evidenceshows that adolescent maleshave greater difficulties acquiringself-regulation and self-controlthan their female counterparts.Yet these are extremely important developmental goals to masterduring pre- and early adoles-cence, particularly among males,because they will allow for a bet-ter regulation of boys' sexualarousal in a society that encour-ages sexual experience in youngmales and which is characterizedby high rates of sexual coercionand gender abuse.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER FIFTEEN | 117Table 15-2. Individual Level Theories and Models and Their Application to Adolescent Behavioral Change: A Comparison of Conceptual Frameworks, Applications, and Benefits \u2014(continued) Theory/Model Conceptual Framework Application Benefits Sensation-Seeking Theory(Chapter Fourteen)Sensation-seeking is a normal trait of personality describing the tendency to seek novel, var-ied, complex, and intense sen-sations and experiences and thewillingness to take risks for thesake of experience. Openness to new experiences is a requisitefor creativity and personalgrowth. Sensation-seekers tendto be original and the caseof preadolescents, when highsensation-seeking is combinedwith other negative traits or af-fective experiences, the situationcan result in a severe health-compromising lifestyle, which in turn may become a seriousclinical condition affecting theadolescent's physical health and development. A version of the Sensation- Seeking Scale has been devel-oped for adolescents (Russo et al. 1993). A significant rela-tionship between adolescent riskbehaviors and sensation-seekinghas been described, particularlyfor tobacco, alcohol, and druguse (Zuckerman 1994). Thesefindings have led to the develop-ment of the Sensation-SeekingTargeting (SENTAR) prevention approach (Palmgreen 2001),which utilizes messages,and seeks to place messageswithin contexts that are attractiveto the adolescent target audi-ence. Substantive research indi-cates an increase in sensation-seeking during the pre- and earlyadolescent periods (9-14 yearsof age), which reaches its peakduring middle adolescence (ages15-16) and tends to decline inlate adolescence, around theage of 20.The studies conducted on sensation-seeking among ado-lescents have shed much lighton the reasons behind thisgroup's need for novelty, adven-ture, and intense stimulation, in-cluding the adoption of new (andpotentially risky) sexual behav-iors. It has also helped develop-ers of interventions and pro-grams to better understand anddesign \"what works\"\u2014i.e., whatadolescents will find appealingand will attract their attention. Inthis sense, activities will have abetter chance of reaching youngpeople and satisfying their needfor sensation-seeking if theyoffer elements of novelty andnon-conventionality, a variety ofphysical, mental, and/or emo-tional stimulation, heightened in-tensity, and age-appropriatecomplexity. In this sense, it iscritical that the intervention teambe highly creative and \"cuttingedge\" in its collective thinkingand sincerely empathetic and re-sponsive to the needs and wantsof adolescents. At the sametime, program designers shouldbear in mind that what is consid-ered exciting and new might bedifferent for boys and girls, forpreadolescents and late adoles-cents, and for young people liv-ing in different socioeconomicand cultural settings.IntroductionTheories and Models that Promote Change at the Interpersonal Level Individuals are social beings who derive their sense of self and of personal efficacy from others through interpersonal exchanges. This interpersonal environment provides themeans, models, reinforcements, and resources with which people can learn more aboutthemselves and is also critical in affecting and predicting an individual's health behaviorand, in turn, health outcomes. Consideration of the social influences on health behaviorsand outcomes during adolescence is crucial. Most recent reviews on resiliency to adver-sity (Infante 2001) and other human development literature (Greenspan and Shanker2003, 2002) also highlight the crucial role of the ongoing interplay between the charac-teristics of the individual, the family, the community, and the broader culture. While theadolescent's gradual separation from the parents allows for the development andstrengthening of individual identity, there may be less of a buffer as he/she experiencesincreased exposure to the larger social environment. In Chapters Sixteen through Twenty-one, the following theories and models of interper- sonal health behavior will be reviewed within the context of working with adolescents: the Social Cognitive Theory the Social Network and Social Support Theories the Authoritative Parenting Model the Resiliency Theory the Stress and Coping TheoriesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 118[Chapter Sixteen ] The Social Cognitive Theory Bandura's (1986) Social Cognitive Theory encompasses both determinants of be- havior and the methods of promoting behavioral change. The theory explainsbehavior in terms of a triadic, dynamic, and reciprocal model in which socio- environmental , personal orcognitive , and behavioral factors all interact. This theory provides a particularly useful theoretical framework for understanding and describing the potential impact of the social environment on health behaviors amongadolescents. Three basic principles emerge from this framework. The first, according to this theory, is that behavior is influenced by both socio-environmental and personal factors. Thisprinciple emphasizes the multifaceted nature of adolescent behavior. Therefore, a be-havior such as high-risk sexual activity is not the result of a single factor (e.g., lack ofknowledge about the consequences of unprotected sexual activity), but rather the resultof numerous factors within the adolescent's social environment and his/her individual disposition. The second principle is that socio-environmental factors play a significant role in the onset of behaviors, but their influence is mediated via personal cognitions. In otherwords, the adolescent does not respond automatically to socio-environmental factors(e.g., pressures to be thin) but instead makes personal choices as to whether or nothe/she will engage in a particular behavior. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 120Thirdly, adolescent behavior is not only influenced by socio-environmental andpersonal factors, but also influences thesefactors. This simultaneous influence iscalled reciprocal determinism and posits that a change in one component holds im-plications for the others. Figure 16-1. illustrates the triangular re- lationship between socio-environmental,personal (cognitive), and behavioralfactors. The environment is important in this the- ory in part because it provides models for behavior. Bandura and Walters (1963)proposed that children could watch otherchildren learn a new behavior and did notneed to be rewarded directly. Thus, a childlearns by observing ( observational learning ) the behaviors of others ( modeling ) and the rewards these others receive ( vicarious re-inforcement ). In other words, people learn what is appropriate by observing the be-haviors, successes, and mistakes of others.Specifically, adolescents observe theirparents when they eat, drink, smoke, anduse seat belts, and they see the various re-wards or penalties the parents receive forthese activities. In the same way, adolescents observe their peers smoking and notice the rewards andpunishments that the smokers receive. Ifthe observers consider the consequencesof smoking to be rewarding (e.g., accept- ance from peers, the creation of a desir-able image), the observers become morepredisposed to smoke. Observationallearning presents the greatest impactwhen the person being observed is power-ful, respected, and/or considered to belike the observer (in age, interests, back-ground, etc.). Figure 16-1.

Media today surrounds youth.As the media increasingly shapes society'simages of reality, we learn a great deal bythe consequences media characters expe-rience as a function of their behavior. Thecontent featured in these technologies isincreasingly graphic, interactive, provoca-tive, and commercially manipulative innature, and media corporations are in-creasingly recognizing and targeting youthas a profitable group of consumers.UNESCO recently reported that today'saverage 12-year-old spends three hours aday watching television (Groebel 1999). Inaddition to traditional television pro-gramming, music, magazines, and moviescatering to the youth market, new kinds ofmedia such as interactive CD-ROMs,video games, e-mail, chat rooms, and Websites offer everything from instructions onhow to form anonymous friendships to in-formation on how to lose weight overnight to access to electronic displays of virtualsex and violence. A recent survey in theUnited States found that 8-to-18-year-olds spend six to eight hours a day exposedto some form of media (Roberts 2000).Furthermore, this media use is becomingmore private as children recede to theirbedrooms to watch television or listen tomusic alone and unsupervised. Researchby PAHO in the area of adolescent healthand media exposure has yielded resultsthat closely parallel those of other interna-tional studies. In 2003, a study of 11 LatinAmerican countries revealed that adoles-cents ages 12 to 19 are permanently en- gaged with one or another type of mediacommunication (particularly televisionand radio), except when they are in theschool classroom or interacting withfriends and/or parents (Organizaci\u00f3nPanamericana de la Salud 2003a). It is important to note at this juncture that while Albert Bandura and other learningtheorists stress the context in which be-havior takes place, they are not especiallydevelopmental in their approach. Forlearning theorists, the basic processes ofhuman behavior are the same during ado-lescence as they are during other periodsof life. Although Bandura included in his model the mediation of personal cogni-tions to respond to socio-environmentalfactors, the principal emphasis of his the-ory is on how the socio-environment mayaffect behavior, and it has tended to over-look or ignore developmental and emo-tional aspects that will affect personalcognitions to respond to these socialinfluences. Within the framework of the Social Cogni- tive Theory, before performing a new be-havior, people anticipate many aspects ofthe situation in which the behavior mightbe performed. They develop and teststrategies for dealing with the situationand anticipate what will happen as a resultof their behavior in this situation. People develop expectations about a situation andexpectations for outcomes of their behavior before they actually encounter the situa-tion (\"If I use a condom consistently, I willYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 122prevent STIs\"). These anticipatory out- comes of a behavior are known as outcome expectations. This anticipatory behavior reduces anxiety and increases one's abilityto handle the situation. Outcome expecta-tions are observed in adolescents in theprocess of exploring a new behavior, ex-cept when the behavior is performed im-pulsively. Outcome expectations are com-parable to the behavioral beliefs described in the Theories of Reasoned Action andPlanned Behavior (Chapters Ten andEleven). In considering the Social Cognitive The- ory, health promotion project designersshould be cautioned about automaticallyassuming that anticipatory behavior is adeveloped ability in adolescence. In theearlier stages of adolescence, such as pre-and early adolescence, these age groupsare still developing their cognitive abilitiesto anticipate what will happen as a result of a behavior, and consequently, many of their exploratory behaviors will have an impulsive component, and they will be learning more by experience than byanticipation. Other aspects involved in the process of engaging in a new behavior are the outcome expectancies orincentives , meaning the val- ues that individuals place on a certain out-come. Expectancies influence the behav-ior according to the level of pleasureexperienced; that is, if all other things areequal, a person will choose to perform anactivity that maximizes a positive outcomeor minimizes a negative outcome. Out-come expectancies are comparable to eval- uations (outcome values) in the Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior. A person's positive expectancies should beassessed very early on in any project de-signed to promote changes in health be-havior in order to identify motivators forthat behavior. An emphasis on immediatepositive expectancies, for example, ismore likely to influence the initiation desired behaviors than an emphasison long-range expectancies. McAlister etal. (1980) provided strong evidence forthis when it was shown that smoking pre-vention programs for adolescents aremore successful if they emphasize avoid-ance of the immediate negative effects ofsmoking, such as bad breath or unattrac-tiveness, rather than the long-term effectssuch as morbidity and mortality from can-cer and heart disease. The types of outcomes people anticipate depend largely on their judgments of howwell they will be able to perform in givensituations. Self-efficacy , as noted in Chap- ters Eight and Eleven, is the level of confi-dence a person feels about performing aparticular activity, including confidence inovercoming the barriers to performingthat behavior. Bandura proposed that self-efficacy is the most important prerequisitefor behavioral change, because it affects how much effort is invested in a given taskand what level of performance is attained.When a person is in a situation in whichoutcome expectations are positive andstrong, but self-efficacy for that behavioris low, avoidance or denial may occur, andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 123the person is unlikely to attempt to achieve the new behavior. A meta-analysis of theresearch literature published between1983 and 1991 (Gillis 1993) showed thatself-efficacy was the strongest predictor ofa health-promoting lifestyle. In an exam-ple of a specific behavior, self-efficacy hasbeen identified as a primary predictor ofintention to make healthier food choicesamong third- and fourth-grade students(Parcel et al. 1995a). Complex behaviors usually involve a se- quence (steps) of simple tasks that all to-gether might seem difficult for an adoles-cent to perform. Bandura and otherlearning theorists propose that repetitionof the performance of a single task builds a person's self-efficacy by changing theperson's performance expectations. Forexample, when learning to play basket-ball, repetitions of a single task (e.g.,dribbling) build the adolescent's self-efficacy by changing his/her performanceexpectations every time he/she experi-ences better control of the ball. The goal,then, is to break down any particular chal-lenge or multi-step complex new behaviorso that the adolescent can have a sense of success as he/she masters one step at a time. Learning theorists state thatthrough the repeated successful enact-ment of incremental tasks (e.g., the firststep as learning to master dribbling, thenext step as learning to pass and catch theball, the third step as learning to run anddribble simultaneously, and the final stepas running, catching, dribbling, andshooting) the person acquires enhancedexpectations of success in the tasks to be learned, which in turn affects task initia-tion, persistence, and endurance, andthus serves to promote and reinforce be-havioral change. Simplifying a complex new behavior into small steps of incremental tasks and al-lowing individuals to practice each one inisolation, with many repetitions, enablesthem to build self-efficacy about perform-ing each task. When people are self-confident about each step, they can pro-gressively put the steps together and buildself-efficacy about the entire behavior.The strategy of breaking down complexnew behaviors into small steps is particu-larly useful when working with adolescentsto the degree that it keeps them motivatedand avoids mechanical and boring repeti-tion. It should not be assumed that adoles-cents will stay motivated repeating a singletask just because they will improve self-efficacy by changing their performanceexpectations. The key to success, there-fore, becomes the structuring of the more mechanical and/or repetitive aspects lead-ing to mastery of a new behavior\u2014whetherit be to play basketball or tennis, learnmutiplication tables or verb conjuga-tions in a foreign language, adopt the useof a condom or healthier eating, etc.\u2014in such a manner that the adolescent's moti-vation and interest levels are always kepthigh. Furthermore, in order to actually assume a new behavior (behavioral change), tasksmust not only be learned by adolescentsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 124with a desire to perform them, but they must also be actually performed . A task may be learned yet not performed, whereasperformance presumes learning. Theconcept of behavioral capability maintains that if a person is to perform a particularbehavior, he or she must know what thebehavior is (knowledge of the behavior)and how to perform it (skill). Self-efficacyis the person's perception; capability isthe real thing. Behavioral capability is theresult of the individual's training, intel-lectual capacity, and learning style. Theskills training, called mastery learning , provides cognitive knowledge of what is tobe performed, practice in performing ac-tivities, and feedback and reinforcementto refine successful performance until theperson performs the behavior at a prede-fined level of acceptability. The Social Cognitive Theory incorporates different types of reinforcement: directreinforcement (as in operant condition-ing), vicarious reinforcement (as inobservational learning), and self-reinforcement. It also describes external reinforcement as the occurrence of an event or act known to have predictable rein-forcement value and internal reinforcement as a person's own experience or percep-tion that an event has some value. Educa-tional programs that are intrinsically rein- forcing result in more learning, interest in, and retention of the subject matter.Program designers and health practition-ers may also choose to use external re-wards to encourage the adoption of be-haviors that are part of a behavioralchange program. These may be discontin- ued by the end of a program, when the in-trinsic rewards of the behavioral changeitself are strong enough to maintain thenew behavior. Self-control of performance refers to a person's behavior focused onthe achievement of self-set goals. One ofthe most important goals of this type ofhealth education is to bring the perfor-mance of health behavior under the con-trol of the individual. Bandura recognized that excessive emo- tional arousal inhibits learning and per-formance. Yet while Social Cognitive The- ory constructs and methods are oftenemployed to learn behavioral managementof emotional and physiological arousal, they usually ignore the underlying reasonsfor those emotions. The principles of reciprocal determinism may be useful in developing adolescentbehavioral change programs that do notfocus on behavior in isolation, but rather on changes in the environment and in theindividual himself/herself. Examples ofthe social environment include familymembers, friends, neighbors, and class-mates and peers. The physical environ-ment might include the availability ofhighly nutritious and healthy foods, aplayground and/or gymnasium to encour-age adequate physical activity, acceptableindoor and outdoor air quality, and publicrestrictions on smoking. The Social Cognitive Theory describes a number of crucial personal factors that areYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 125 part of the process of analyzing influences, messages, and/or models from the envi-ronment before an adolescent makes thechoice to engage or not engage in the newbehavior. These factors are the adoles-cent's capacity to: symbolize behavior ( cognition ) anticipate the outcomes of behavior (outcome expectations ) possess confidence in performing a behavior, including overcoming anybarriers to performing the behavior(self-efficacy )possess self-determined or self- regulated behavior ( self-control of performance ) reflect upon and analyze experiences learn by observing others ( observational learning ) The capacity for observational learning, in turn, will be affected by: attention to and perception of the relevant aspects of modeled behaviors (includ-ing characteristics of the observer andthe model)Box 16-1. The Social Cognitive Theory: Key Theoretical Concepts in the Adoption of Healthy Behaviors a given situation and about the outcomes of the behavioral response to it (e.g., \"If I use acondom consistently, I will prevent STIs.\") outcome expectancies: the values that individuals place on a certain outcome; alsothe incentives to perform the behavior; comp-arable to evaluations (outcome values) pre- sented in the Theories of Reasoned Actionand Planned Behavior (Chapters Ten andEleven) behavioral capability: the capability to per- form a given behavior that results from pos-session of knowledge about the behavior andof skills in how to perform it self-efficacy: the degree of confidence a person feels about performing a particularactivity, including confidence in overcomingthe barriers to performing that behavior; also a key theoretical concept in the HealthBelief Model (Chapter Eight) and the Theoryof Planned Behavior (Chapter Eleven) self-control of performance: the posses- sion of self-determined or on achievementof self-set goalsreciprocal determinism: the simultaneous influence between socio-environmental,cognitive, and behavioral factors observational learning: learning by observing the behaviors of others modeling: the illustration by positive role models of how to effectively overcomebarriers and achieve behavior change; alsothe modeling of behavior , in which adoles- cents are shown by others, step-by-step, how to perform a new behavior, such as thecorrect way to put on a condom vicarious reinforcement: through observa- tional learning, the gaining of increased aware-ness regarding the rewards received as aresult of specific behaviors enacted by others external reinforcement: the occurrence of an event or act known to have predictablereinforcement value internal reinforcement: a personal experi- ence or individual perception that an act orevent has some value outcome expectations: the expectations that are developed prior to the occurrence ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 126retention, representation, and remember- ingof learned knowledge production of appropriate behavior ( be- havior capability ) motivation as a result of observed posi- tive incentives and reinforcement What is not sufficiently emphasized in Bandura's model is that the proficiency in use of these personal factors will vary through the different developmentalstages and need to be fostered by adoles- cents, rather than assumed as currentcapabilities. Messages and models thatcapture the adolescent's attention and per- ception will vary by age, gender, learning style, and personal interests. These as-pects and the level of attention given to themessage or model will also affect retention , representation , and remembering .The ca- pacity to symbolize behavior , anticipate the outcomes of behavior , self-regulate , and re- flect upon and analyze experiences will also vary by individual personality differences,gender, and age. Recent Additions to and Refinements of the Social Cognitive Theory During the past two decades, Bandura has continued to permanently review and re-fine his theory to respond to the passage oftime and the emergence of new concepts.As a result, over the past five years or so, hehas shifted the focus of the Social Cogni-tive Theory from the domain of mechanis-tic constructs of human behavior to theviews of the person as an agent in controlof his or her own life (Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002; Bandura 2001, 1997). Hestates in one of his more recent articles that \"the capacity to exercise control overthe nature and quality of one's life is theessence of humanness,\" whereby \"con-sciousness is the very substance of mentallife that not only makes life personallymanageable, but worth living\" (Bandura2001). These statements are similar tothose expressed by David Buchanan in hiswork An Ethic for Health Promotion: Re- thinking the Sources of Human Well-Being(2000), in which he encourages \"collectiveconsciousness-raising and strengtheningpeople's capacity toward mindful, respon-sible choices.\" Along this same line of thought, Bandura's article \"Social Cognitive Theory: An Agen-tic Perspective,\" published in the 2001 An- nual Review of Psychology , describes core features of intentionality as a representation of a future course of action to be per- formed, in which \"intentions center on plans of action.\" Forethought refers to peo- ple setting goals for themselves, motivat-ing themselves, and guiding their actionsin anticipation of future events. Self- reactiveness refers to the ability to give shape to appropriate courses of action andto motivate and regulate their execution.Bandura incorporates concepts of theSelf-Regulation Theory (Chapter Thir-teen) recognizing that \"this multifacetedself-directness operates through self-regulatory processes that link thought toaction.\" With self-reflectiveness ,\"peopleYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 127evaluate their motivation, values, and the meaning of their life pursuits.\" All of these core features of human agency described by Bandura are essential goals toachieve during adolescent development.Most young people enter adolescencewithout a full development of these capac-ities and need help in mastering them.PAHO encourages program developers to incorporate these latest additions to theSocial Cognitive Theory and not operatewithin the older versions that carry a morelimited, mechanistic view of humanbehavior. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Social CognitiveTheory to Adolescent Lifestyles A number of principles similar to those in the Social Cognitive Theory are incorpo-rated in Jessor's model (Jessor 1993)aimed at explaining adolescent risk/lifestyle. The tendency for behaviors tocluster together provides support for theconcept of lifestyle. This concept directsour attention away from the specific be-haviors (substance abuse, risky sexualpractices, etc.) towards the adolescent as awhole person. In Jessor's model, personal , socio-environmental, and behavioral factors are shown to influence the adolescent'slifestyle with reciprocal relationshipsamong all of the factors (reciprocal deter-minism). Personal factors are separatedinto biological and personality domains,while socio-environmental factors are di-vided into actual domains (e.g., socioeco-nomic status) and perceived domains(e.g., models for deviant or conventional behavior). Both risk factors and protectivefactors may exist within each domain. Consideration of the Social Cognitive The- ory and the concepts of risk and protectivefactors and adolescent lifestyle have anumber of significant implications for thedevelopment of intervention programs foradolescents. Jessor summarized these asfollows: The complexity of causation suggests that interventions that are comprehen-sive promise to yield greater successesthan those that are limited in scope. Programs should aim to simultaneouslyreduce risk and promote protection. Programs directed at lifestyle changemay be more appropriate than programsfocusing on specific behaviors. Programs need to acknowledge the salience of the social environment,where young people growing up in ad-verse social environments may experi-ence more risk factors and less protec-tive factors. Programs should not only focus on theindividual but also need to aim for socialchange because risk is embedded in thelarger social context of adolescent life(Neumark-Sztainer 1999, Jessor 1992). In many ways, the contribution of Jessor's model represents an integration of the So-cial Cognitive Theory with an ecologicalapproach (Chapter Four) and evidencecoming from resiliency studies (ChapterNineteen). However, in this work, as inYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 128many others discussed in this book, there appears to be little or no emphasis on thechanging developmental aspects of ado-lescent health which PAHO considers to beso critical to the relevancy and effective-ness of targeted interventions. In a review of the literature, the Social Cog- nitive Theory has been identified as theunderlying theoretical framework for anumber of adolescent health promotionand prevention programs, probably be-cause of its consideration of socio-environmental factors affecting individualbehaviors. However, one of the drawbacksof such a broad theoretical formulation (environmental, personal, and behavioralfactors) is that program designers mightfeel pressured to explain almost any phe-nomenon using one or more of the con-structs without a complete understandingof how they operate separately and to- gether. They might even adopt the theory astheir theoretical framework even if the in-terventions include actions only at the en-vironmental and personal level and do notinclude a focus on specific behavioral vari-ants, such as the target group's capacities inobservational learning, self-efficacy, andself-control of performance. At the sametime, there is considerable conceptualconfusion about how to apply, measure,and analyze constructs of health behaviortheories (Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002). One example of this problem is the work of Pender (1998), who conducted a research literature review of 20 studies aimed at en-couraging children and adolescents toadopt more active lifestyles. He found that although the Social Cognitive Theory pro-vided the theoretical basis for most of thestudies reviewed, specification of how the-ory concepts were operationalized in theinterventions was often unclear. In hisconclusions, he proposed that in the fu-ture, the rigor of theoretically-based in-tervention studies aimed at promotingphysical activity be increased in order toprovide the much-needed answers to thisquestion. Moreover, it is not only important that program designers possess a clear under-standing of how theoretical constructs op-erate in practical interventions, but alsoabout the people who implement the in-tervention itself (e.g., facilitators of aworkshop, teachers in a school sexual edu-cation program). In one study, the SocialCognitive Theory was used to define thereasons why fourth- and fifth-gradepreadolescents were not consuming suffi-cient amounts of fruit, vegetables, and100% juice products. The reasons, ac-cording to the theory, were due to envi-ronmental, personal, and behavioral fac-tors. A creative school curriculum called\"Gimme Five!\" was designed to help rem-edy these influencing factors and therebyincrease consumption of these healthyfoods. Outcome analyses of this project re- vealed no change in consumption patternsby the end of the fifth grade (Baranowski etal. 2000). Yet, as a process evaluation ofthe project revealed (Davis et al. 2000),classroom teachers implemented onlyabout 50% of the \"Gimme Five!\" curricu-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 129lum tasks and only 22% of the curriculum tasks shown most likely to result in behav-ior change. Teachers might not have fullyimplemented the curriculum for a varietyof reasons. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory, as we will see in Chapter Twenty-three, helps to anticipate and avoid fail-ures due to low implementation whenplanning health promotion and preven-tion projects, because it focuses on theneed for a strong linkage system betweenthose who develop innovative messagesand tasks, those who are charged withadopting and diffusing them (in this ex-ample, schoolteachers), and those who areto be the recipients (the students). In thissense, the inclusion of this theory in theoverall theoretical framework designwould perhaps have ensured the project'sgreater success. The Social Cognitive Theory also has been used to understand the determinants ofphysical activity in children and adoles-cents as they relate to the prevention ofobesity in these age groups. Strauss et al.(2001) conducted a study with 92 pre-,early, and middle U.S. adolescents, aged10 to 16 years. Health beliefs, self-efficacy,social influences, and time spent insedentary behaviors were determinedthrough questionnaires. There was a sig-nificant decline in physical activity levelsbetween ages the ages of 10 and 16, partic-ularly in girls. In their responses, the chil-dren reported spending 75.5% of each dayin sedentary activities\u2014watching televi-sion, sitting at the computer, and prepar-ing homework assignments. In contrast,this group replied that only 1.4% of their day was spent in vigorous physical activity.Among other findings, Strauss and col-leagues conclude that health promotionprograms that enhance adolescents' self-efficacy\u2014their belief in their ability to suc-cessfully adhere to a regular regimen ofexercise\u2014increase the motivation to bephysically active. Wallace et al. (2000) applied the Social Cognitive Theory and the Stages of ChangeModel (Chapter Nine) to determine thepersonal, behavioral, and environmentalcharacteristics associated with exercisebehavior and intentions among 937 youthbetween the ages of 17 and 24. Amongfemales, exercise self-efficacy and familysocial support for physical activity were thebest predictors of the stage of exercise be-havior change. Social support fromfriends, the history of physical activity,and exercise self-efficacy were significantpredictors of the stage of exercise behaviorchange among males. Exercise self-efficacy was associated with the stage ofbehavioral change, but the source of sig-nificant social support (family vs. friends)was different for males and females. From the perspective of the Social Cogni- tive Theory, substance use is conceptual-ized as a socially learned, purposeful, andfunctional behavior which is the result ofthe interplay of socio-environmental andpersonal factors. By the mid-1980s, de-tailed analyses of research results indi-cated that social influence programs , most of them designed under the concepts of theYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 130Social Cognitive Theory (Clubb 1991), were consistently more effective than pro-grams based on the information deficit oraffective education models (discussed inChapter Two) in preventing cigarettesmoking. Several of the most successfulsmoking prevention programs includedcomponents designed to increase adoles-cents' ability to resist the various pro-usesocial pressures, particularly pressurefrom their peers. Social influence strate-gies have typically been applied in theUnited States through school-based pro-grams for students in the sixth througheighth grades. Although several of these programs have had significant and substantial short-termimpacts on smoking behavior (U.S. De-partment of Health and Human Services2000), the effects have tended to dissi-pate over time (Wakefield and Chal-oupka 2000). A meta-analysis of ProjectD.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Educa- tion) outcome evaluations concluded thatthe initiative's effect on tobacco use wassmall at best (Ennet et al. 1994) and sub-stantially less than that of other, moreinteractive prevention programs. TheHutchinson Smoking Prevention Project,also in the United States, provides moreevidence that pure \"social influence\" pro-grams are not effective over time (Hatcherand Scarpa 2002, Peterson et al. 2000). Several health promotion programs have tried to increase adolescents' problem-solving capacities through role-playingactivities, also with mixed results. Al-though strengthening these capacities during adolescence is crucial to help youngpeople in their decision-making, formulasthat have no meaningful reference pointsin the adolescents' personal experienceare learned in a rote manner and cannotreadily be transferred from one situationto another. On the other hand, programsthat have demonstrated greater effective-ness in improving adolescents' problem-solving abilities have been those that havebeen most successful in coupling the par-ticipants' prior intense emotional experi-ences with the skills needed to successfullyaddress those experiences. Langlois, Petosa, and Hallam (1999) used the Social Cognitive Theory to examine theimpact of participating in a school-basedsmoking prevention program in improv-ing several variables related to smokinginitiation reduction. The study's theoryconstructs included behavioral capabilityto resist positive images of smoking, skillsefficacy in refusal to smoke, total positiverefusal expectations and importance, andtotal negative refusal expectations and im-portance. The smoking prevention pro-gram had a significant impact on the stu-dents' refusal skills efficacy, along withtotal positive refusal expectations and im-portance. However, the program did notaffect behavioral capability to resist posi-tive images of smoking and total negativerefusal expectations and importance. The 2000 report of the U.S. Surgeon Gen- eral (U.S Department of Health andHuman Services 2000), Reducing TobaccoYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 131Use,concludes that attempts to reduce the scope of smoking prevention programs toskills training alone are likely to be inef-fective. More complex and intensive pro-grams combining interventions withinand outside of schools are needed to over-come the powerful pro-smoking culturalimages fostered by the larger socialenvironment. Sargent et al. (2002) employed various So- cial Cognitive Theory constructs, such asobservational learning and modeling, tostudy the association between viewing to-bacco use in movies and attitudes towardsmoking among early adolescents ( n= 3,766) who had never tried cigarettesmoking. The results showed that greaterexposure to depictions of tobacco use inmovies significantly increased the numberof positive expectations endorsed by the adolescent and the perception that mostadults smoke, but not the perception thatmost peers smoke. Chen et al. (2002) studied the receptivity to pro-tobacco media and its impact onearly and middle adolescent cigarettesmoking for African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanic, and non-Hispanicwhites in California ( n = 20,332). The re- sults showed that receptivity to pro-tobacco media is associated with a higherprevalence of cigarette smoking amongCalifornia youth from diverse ethnic back-grounds. Hawkins and Hane (2000) stud-ied adolescent perceptions of smoking inU.S. print advertising. The authors con-cluded that students who smoked at leastoccasionally were more likely to believe messages conveyed by print cigarette adsthan were students who had never smoked.Hawkins and Hane attribute this differ-ence to the vicarious reinforcement por- trayed in print cigarette advertising. Fur-thermore, the authors propose that theSocial Cognitive Theory can help to in-crease the efficacy of anti-smoking adver-tising campaigns. A cross-country study by the Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collaborative Group (2002) showed that in Latin America andthe Caribbean, exposure of middle ado-lescents to pro-tobacco advertising is ex-tremely high, reaching over 90% in Ar-gentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mexico, andUruguay. Padgett, Selwyn, and Kelder(1998) investigated adolescent attitudesand behaviors toward cigarette smokingin Ecuador. Using the Social CognitiveTheory as a basis, the cross-sectional sur-vey focused attention on such social influ-ences as the smoking habits of familymembers and peers, as well as on the roleof cigarette advertisements. The smoking status of family members and peers sig-nificantly predicted student-smokingstatus. The Global Youth Tobacco SurveyCollaborative Group study (2002) foundthat in Latin America and the Caribbean,the percentage of middle adolescents ex-posed to smoke from others at homereaches over 60% in Argentina, Chile,Cuba, and Uruguay, and that of this group,two out of every three definitively thinksmoke from others is harmful to theirhealth.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 132Project Northland (2003), a large ran- domized community trial conducted forthe prevention of adolescent alcohol use,involved approximately 2,400 studentsfrom the graduating class of 1998 from 24school districts in northeastern Min-nesota during their sixth-, seventh-, andeighth-grade (1991-1994). cognitive theoretical concept ofreciprocal determinism, Project North-land utilized an understanding of the envi-ronmental, intrapersonal, and behavioralfactors that influence alcohol as a basis fordesigning school and community-level ac-tivities. The project's intervention in-volved three years of behavioral curriculain the classrooms, parental involvementprograms, extracurricular peer leader-ship, and community-wide task force ac-tivities. After three years, when studentswere at the end of eighth grade, reports ofmonthly drinking were 20% lower amongstudents in the intervention school dis-tricts compared with students in the refer-ence districts, and reports of weeklydrinking were 30% lower. Project North-land was effective in changing peer influ-ence to use alcohol, normative expecta-tions about how many young people drink,and parent-child communication aboutconsequences of alcohol use, while at thesame time reinforcing the importance ofreasons for not using alcohol (Komro et al.2001, Perry et al. 2002). Project Northland is an excellent example of an intervention in which the Social Cog- nitive Theory has been identified as thesuccessful underlying theoretical frame-work (Glanz, Rimer, and Lewis 2002), in the sense that it incorporated the environ-mental, intrapersonal, and behavioral fac-tors that influence alcohol as a basis fordesigning school and community-level in-terventions. However, the project's devel-opment was not limited solely to con-structs described by the Social CognitiveTheory; namely, role-playing, rewards,and the use of parents and peers as rolemodels. Other elements, borrowed from avariety of other constructs, included in-tensive group discussions on problem-solving, entertaining classroom games,strengthening of parenting skills, youthdevelopment, and community organiza-tion components (Bernstein et al. 1999,Veblen-Mortenson et al. 1999). In as- sessing the long-term outcomes to com-munity actions such as Project Northland,Perry and colleagues emphasize, however, that developmentally appropriate, multi-component, community-wide programsshould be developed to remain in placethroughout the adolescence period to re-duce and maintain low levels of alcohol use(Perry et al. 2002). The Social Cognitive Theory states that health behavior essentially results from ajudgment of self-efficacy. The 1993 Gillisreview of research literature published be-tween 1983 and 1991, mentioned earlier inthis chapter, focused on identifying the de-terminants of a health-promoting lifestyle.From 23 studies reviewed, six dealt with children and adolescents. A meta-analysisof these studies showed that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of a health-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SIXTEEN | 133promoting lifestyle, followed by social support, perceived benefits, self-concept,perceived barriers, and health definition. Although it was Bandura who first intro- duced the concept of self-efficacy as themost important prerequisite for behav-ioral change, it was also added later byRosenstock, Stretcher, and Becker (1988)to the Health Belief Model. The literaturepublished on self-efficacy and adolescentbehaviors is extensive. The impact of theself-efficacy construct has also beenwidely studied for several behaviors re-lated to sexual health and reproductionamong adolescents, particularly condomuse. In a Medline search focusing exclu-sively on sexual behaviors among adoles-cents, the authors of this book were able toretrieve 86 articles addressing self-efficacy issues and condom use. Researchindicates that this behavior may dependon critical factors such as the expectedconsequences of condom use, perceivedsocial support for condoms, perceivedbarriers to condom use, perceived suscep-tibility to HIV infection, and perceivedself-efficacy in condom use (Zamboni,Crawford, and Williams 2000; Adih andAlexander 1999). Adih and Alexander studied the determi- nants of condom use to prevent HIV infec-tion among youth in Ghana ( n= 601 men, ages 15-24). The study used constructsfrom the Health Belief Model and SocialCognitive Theory and adopted them to theGhanaian sociocultural context. Findingsfrom multiple logistic regression analysisindicate that perceived susceptibility to HIV infection, perceived self-efficacy to usecondoms, perceived barriers to condomuse, and perceived social support weresignificant predictors of condom use.Young men who perceived a high level of self-efficacy to use condoms and a low levelof barriers to condom use were nearly three times more likely to have used condomsduring their last intercourse when com-pared to others who did not hold these per-ceptions. Self-efficacy scales for HIV riskbehaviors have been developed for differ-ent adolescent populations (Smith et al.1996; Bilodeau, Forget, and Tetreault1994). Richard, Van der Plight, and DeVries (1995), based on previous research find-ings indicating that sexual behavior isheavily influenced by emotions that mightinterfere with rational decision-making(Gerrard et al. 1993), decided to investigatewhether anticipated, post-behavioral, af-fective reactions influence sexual behav-iors among 822 Dutch adolescents between15 and 19 years of age. Their study foundthat adolescents are more likely to refrainfrom sexual intercourse or to use condomsin casual sexual encounters if they believethemselves capable of managing sexual sit-uations (perceived self-efficacy). They alsofound that anticipated affective reactions predict a significant proportion of variancein behavioral expectations, over and abovecomponents of the Theory of Planned Be-havior (e.g., attitudes, subjective norm,perceived behavioral control). The authorsstress the importance of emphasizing notYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 134only cognitive but also affective issues when designing AIDS prevention cam-paigns aimed at adolescent sexual behav-ior. They suggest that social modelingcould easily combine efforts to increaseself-efficacy and the salience of negativefeelings that may be experienced followingrisky sexual activities and the positive feel-ings that may be experienced after safe sex. The Social Cognitive Theory and the The- ory of Gender and Power (Wingood andDiClemente 2002, Connell 1987) wereused as theoretical models to guide the de-velopment of a five-session social skillsintervention. Its effectiveness was testedthrough a randomized, single blind con-trolled trial among economically disad-vantaged youth and young adult African-American women. Compared with thedelayed HIV education control condition,women in the social skills interventiondemonstrated increased consistent con-dom use and the adoption of norms sup-porting this practice by their partners andgreater sexual self-control, sexual com-munication, and sexual assertiveness (Di-Clemente and Wingood 1995). The authorsconcluded that the effectiveness of this in-tervention might be attributed to the use ofthe Social Cognitive Theory constructs(e.g., positive role models facilitating theacquisition of social skills through model-ing exercises that emphasized skills mas-tery training) within a gender-appropriatemodel useful for understanding relation-ship dynamics, as is stressed in the Theoryof Gender and Power. The studies reviewed in this section are only a sample of those that have utilizedthe Social Cognitive Theory to analyze ado-lescent health behaviors. It has been by farmostly used to understand tobacco, alco-hol, and drug consumption among adoles-cents, as Table 16-1. illustrates. The the-ory's concepts have also been used tounderstand and develop violence preven-tion programs for early and middle ado-lescents (Durant, Barkin, and Krowchuk2001; Orpinas et al. 2000). Research todate in this behavior indicates that obser-vational learning and role modeling arekey elements to be considered when de-signing interventions oriented to promotenonviolent anger expression and conflictresolution, particularly among youngerage groups before violent behavioral pat-terns have been adopted. Table 16-1. presents a breakdown of the number of studies found using the SocialCognitive Theory according to healthbehaviors. At this juncture, it is interesting to note that the Social Cognitive Theory has beenutilized more frequently to understand anddevelop interventions to change adolescentbehaviors than any of the individual leveltheories and models introduced in ChaptersEight through Fourteen. Table 16-2. shows acomparison of the total number of pub-lished articles using the Social CognitiveTheory and each of the individual level the-ories and models to address four categoriesof adolescent lifestyles and behaviors.

There are, for example, several articles using other theories or models toresearch behavioral change among ado-lescents (e.g., the stages of change model)that specifically identify the self-efficacyconstruct as being among the variablesstudied. Box 16-2. Summary of the Social Cognitive Theory and Adolescent Lifestyles images fostered by the larger social environment. Social influences, such as the smoking habits of family members and peers, as well ascigarette advertisements, significantly predictstudent-smoking status. Self-efficacy is the strongest predictor of a health-promoting lifestyle. Young men who perceive a high level of self- efficacy to use condoms and a low level ofbarriers to condom use are nearly three timesmore likely to use condoms during their lastintercourse when compared to others who donot hold these perceptions. Adolescents are more likely to refrain from sexual intercourse or to use condoms incasual sexual encounters if they believethemselves capable of managing sexualsituations (perceived self-efficacy). Safe sex health promotion and HIV preven- tion campaigns directed towards adolescentswill be more effective if they combine socialmodeling with efforts to increase self-efficacyand the salience of negative feelings that maybe experienced following risky sexual activitiesand positive feelings that may be experiencedafter safe sex, along with a gender-appropriatemodel useful for understanding relationshipdynamics, such as the Theory of Gender andPower.This theory explains behavior in terms of a triadic, dynamic, and reciprocal model inwhich socio-environmental , personal or cognitive , and behavioral factors all interact. The environment is particularly important in this theory in part because it provides models for behavior. Thus, an adolescent learns byobserving ( observational learning ) the behaviors of others ( role models) and the rewards these models receive ( vicarious reinforcement ). Within the Social Cognitive Theory context, the mass media provides adolescents with heavy doses of vicarious learningexperiences. The Social Cognitive Theory incorporates different types of reinforcement: direct rein-forcement (as in operant conditioning),vicarious reinforcement (as in observationallearning), and self-reinforcement. Health promotion programs that enhance adolescents' self-efficacy\u2014their belief in theirability to successfully adhere to a regularregimen of exercise\u2014increase the motivationto be physically active. Attempts to reduce the scope of smoking prevention programs to skills training aloneare likely to be ineffective. More complex andintensive programs combining interventionswithin and outside of schools are needed toovercome the powerful pro-smoking culturalSocial relationships are the foundation for human existence and interdependency. In particular, the adolescent lives in a number of social worlds, many of whichoverlap and interact with each other. The concept of the social network is an analyt- ical framework for understanding relationships among members of various social sys-tems. Networks are classified as personal, based on ties that an individual has with otherpersons, or as an integrated network, based on the relationship among a defined group ofpeople. Sociologists have referred to the actual and potential resources available to an in-dividual through a network as social capital . Within the health education community, Green and Kreuter (1999) have defined social capital as the structures and processes de-veloped among people and organizations that lead to accomplishing goals with outcomesof mutual societal benefit. Understanding the role of social networks and social support in adolescent life and their impact on adopting healthy or unhealthy behaviors is crucialto the design of effective health promotion and prevention interventions. The personal social network , defined as a person-centered web of social relationships, is the structure through which social support may be provided. Social support is defined as \"aid and assistance exchanged through social relationships and interpersonal transac-tions\" (Israel 1982). Four main types of social support have been identified: emotional : the provision of love, caring, and/or empathy; instrumental : the provision of aid or a service (e.g., babysitting or lending money); informational : the provision of information, advice, and/or suggestions; and[Chapter Seventeen ] The Social Networks and Social Support TheoriesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 138appraisal : the provision of infor- mation that is useful for self-evaluation pur- poses, such as construc-tive feedback, affirma-tion of beliefs, and socialcomparison. Social networks have structural and rela- tionship properties, as shown in Box 17-1.The structure can be described as consist-ing of nodes (individuals, groups, or or-ganizations) and the relationships as theties among these nodes (Bartholomew etal. 2001).An individual, group, or organization may play any of several roles in a network: serv-ing as a member, as a linking agent thatbrings information across networkboundaries, or as an isolate with few ties toother network members (Bartholomew etal. 2001, Fulk and Boyd 1991). Further-more, different types of social networksare associated with specific types of socialsupport. Small, dense, geographicallyclose, intense networks provide moreemotional and appraisal support. On theother hand, large, diffuse, and less intensenetworks provide more informationalsupport and social outreach. Box 17-1. Structural and Relationship Properties of Social Networks Cliques: the portions of networks in which all members are tied directly Clusters: the portions of networks in which not all members are tied directly Relationship Properties Frequency: the quantity of contact between two network members Duration: the length of time a relationship has existed Intimacy or intensity: the perceived emotional closeness between two networkmembers Symmetry: the extent to which social sup- port is both given and received between twonetwork members Reciprocity: the extent to which resources and support are both given and received in arelationship Multiplexity: the number of different types of social support exchanged between two net-work members Complexity: the extent to which social rela- tionships serve many functionsStructural Properties Range: the number of network members Geographic dispersion: the extent to which network members live in close proximity toone another and to the individuals of interestto the network analysis Homogeneity: the extent to which network members have similar characteristics (age,race, gender, economic status, etc.) Boundedness: the proportion of all ties of network members that stay within the net-work's boundaries Density: the extent to which network mem- bers know and interact with each other andare connected; measured by the proportion of direct ties that exist among networkmembers out of all possible ties that couldexist among them Reachability: the average number of ties required to link any two network members Degree: the extent to which a network member has direct ties with other networkmembersYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 139The extent and nature of social relation- ships have been linked to a person's healthstatus in a number of studies (Heaney andIsrael 1997). The mechanisms underlyingthese epidemiological findings have beenhypothesized to include modeling and re-inforcement of positive health-related be-haviors, the buffering of the effects ofstress on health, and providing access toresources to cope with stress. John Cassel(1976), a social epidemiologist whose workhas served to highlight the importance ofsocial support to physical and mental well-being, states that social support constitutesa key protective factor that reduces indi-vidual vulnerability to the harmful effectsof stress on health. Among the four types of social support described above, emotionalsupport is known to be the most stronglyand consistently associated with goodhealth and well-being (Heaney and Israel2002). Michael and colleagues (1999)demonstrated that having at least onestrong intimate relationship is an impor-tant predictor of good health. There is alsoincreasing evidence that negative interper-sonal interactions (e.g., mistrust, criti-cism, and excessive demands) are morestrongly related to negative mood (Fleish-man et al. 2000) and cigarette smoking(Burg and Seeman 1994) than is lack of so-cial support (Heaney and Israel 2002). Heaney and Israel also suggest that any proposed support-enhancing interven-tion needs to begin with an assessment ofthe social networks that are maintained bythe study population; in this case, adoles-cents of different ages, genders, and cul-tural backgrounds. These authors recom- mend assessing the weaknesses as well asthe strengths of existing networks in termsof their abilities to meet the needs of the targeted (i.e., focal) individuals (i.e., ado-lescents). In recent years, several differ-ent social network mapping and assess-ment tools have been developed for thispurpose. The software package UCINETallows users to undertake sophisticatednetworks analysis. Other programs, suchas KrackPlot and Pajek, also map networksfor visual display and analysis (see Barrera 2000 and Berkman and Glass 2000 for re-views of these tools). Heany and Israel (2002) identify four ways in which social networks and social sup-port may be strengthened. (1) Developing new social network linkages might be called for when the existing socialsupport is ineffective or insufficient. Thestrategies include: introducing mentors oradvisers ; i.e., in- dividuals who have already coped withthe situation being experienced by thefocal individual; providing buddies ; i.e., individuals who are experiencing the same or a similarstressor or life transition at the sametime as the recipient; and coordinating self-help groups , in which the roles of support provider and sup-port recipient are mutually sharedamong the various members. (2) Enhancing existing social network link- ages might be called for when existing net-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 140works are ignored because they are not perceived as being useful. The perceivedvalue of the networks may be improved bychanging the attitudes and behaviors ofsupport providers, including: strengthening network members' skillsto provide effective support; and training focal points who become incharge of mobilizing and maintainingsocial networks. Heany and Israel point out several special challenges that might arise when attempt-ing to enhance existing social networks.These include identifying existing networkmembers who are committed to providingsupport and who possess the necessary re-sources to sustain their commitment,identifying the changes in provider atti-tudes and behaviors that might improveperceived support by the support recipi-ent, and intervening in ways that are con-sistent with the network's establishednorms and styles of interaction. (3) Enhancing networks at the community level through participatory problem-solvingprocesses , or involving network members' participation in the identification andresolution of community problems, helpsto collectively strengthen social networkties and to stimulate the creation of newones. This process also promotes the net-work's identification and assessment ofoverlapping networks within the commu-nity and increases its own understandingof how the network members seek social support and how this is provided in thecommunity. (4) Enhancing networks through the use of natural helpers provides a community- based system of care and social supportthat complements, but does not replace,the more specialized services of healthprofessionals (Eng and Smith 1995). Nat-ural helpers are members of social net-works to whom other network membersspontaneously turn for advice, emotionalsupport, and concrete help. Naturalhelpers are different from lay health ad-visers (e.g., outreach workers), who alsoprovide social support, but who may not bepart of the recipient's social network. Im-proving social networks through naturalhelpers calls for: identifying natural helpers in the com-munity; identifying existing social networks ofnatural helpers; training natural helpers to provide im-proved advice, assistance, and referralswithin their existing helping networks; linking natural helpers with healthservice providers and community lead-ers to facilitate an ongoing dialogue onlocal health problems; and supporting natural helpers in imple-menting short-term and long-termself-help actions in response to localhealth needs. According to Eng and Parker (2002), forming a partnership between natural helpers and health professionals increasescommunity competence in two importantways: it improves health practices, and itenables a more effective coordination ofcommunity services.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 141Although a variety of social networks and resources most likely already exist in anygiven community, effective social networkprograms must nonetheless be tailored tothe needs and goals of the targeted partic-ipants. Thus, establishing participatoryassessment processes during which mem-bers and participants may identify anddiscuss the strengths and weaknesses oftheir social networks will help structureand further fine-tune truly supportiveprograms. Heany and Israel (2002) list a series of characteristics for health-enhancing so-cial support among members of the gen-eral population. They hold equal relevancein the case of the adolescent population, aswell: Interactions between helpers and indi-viduals receiving social support shouldfacilitate expressions of trust, close-ness, and caring. Helping relationships should befounded on a basis of mutual interde- pendence and exchange. People who are socially similar to the support recipient and who have experi-enced similar stressors or situationshave a better chance to provide effectivesupport (Thoits 1995). It is crucial that the support providerunderstands, and can be empathetic to,the needs and values of the support re-cipient. Social support will be most effective if ittakes into consideration the recipient'sown perception of support needs. Heany and Israel also note that it is not clear whether professional helpers (e.g.,health care providers) are effective sourcesof social support. Professional-lay rela- tionships (e.g., physicians or nurses andadolescents) usually involve asymmetry interms of information management andpower, which may result in a poor empathicunderstanding of the adolescent's needsand wants. Additionally, professionalhelpers are rarely available to provide sup-port over long periods of time, and, partic-ularly in the case of primary health caresettings, personnel availability follows ahighly rotational structure. These authorssuggest that a combination of formal andinformal helpers may be most effective,then, in cases in which both informationaland emotional support are needed. Adolescence can be a challenging period of life for parents, adolescents, and all otherswith whom they normally interact withinthe community at large. Rapid physicaland emotional changes that accompanythis period ensure that the future will al-ways be unpredictable. To better cope withand derive maximum benefit from thistime of growth and maturity, both adoles-cents and parents need social support. Theparticipatory assessment should thereforeinclude as many of the community actorswho form part of the adolescent's socialworld as possible. Heaney and Israel(1997), in recognizing the need for and thevalue of ecological approaches to adoles-cent health promotion, note that socialnetwork interventions that combinestrategies across multiple units of practiceYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 142(e.g., family, friends, neighbors, institu- tions) deserve the greatest attention. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Social Networks and Support Theories to Adolescent Lifestyles Adolescents grow up establishing new so- cial relationships with peers and adults within their schools ,neighborhoods ,and workplaces . The peer group can be crucial in adolescent development by responding tothe adolescent's need to be accepted, be-long to a group, and develop identity. En-nett and Bauman (1993) pioneered use ofthe Social Networks Theory in assessingpeer social networks among 1,092 ninth graders in five different high schoolswithin a large North Carolina school dis-trict in the United States. Based on inter-views with students over a one-yearperiod, the authors described three cate-gories of social network affiliation amongadolescents: clique members : adolescents who carry out most of their interactions withintheir small group of peers. Cliques areusually composed of four to six adoles-cents (but may be as small as two or aslarge as 12 members) who are generallyof the same sex and age. The clique is the social setting in which adolescentsshare together in informal and leisure-time activities, frequently communicatevia telephone, e-mail, etc., and formclose relationships. liaisons : adolescents who interact with two or more adolescents who are mem-bers of a clique, but who are not them- selves part of the clique isolates : adolescents who have few or no linkages to others via a social network Figure 17-1. depicts the spatial differences between these three categories. Social network analysis also permitted Ennett and Bauman in this study to de-scribe the proportion of adolescents oc-cupying each social position. Althoughthis varied among the five studiedschools, in all of them less than half of theadolescents were members of cliques. Thepercentage of isolates ranged from 17.5%to 38.2%. The study also examined the re-lationship between peer group structureand cigarette smoking, in order to betterunderstand the assumption at the time ofthe study that peer group plays a crucialrole in the initiation and maintenance ofsmoking. Surprisingly, the authors foundthat at four of the five schools, the odds ofbeing a current smoker were significantlyhigher for isolates than for clique mem-bers and liaisons. The authors concludedthat emphasis in smoking preventionprograms perhaps should be placed moreon helping adolescents join and partici-pate in cliques and not only on resistingpeer influence, at the same time that iso-lates should be considered as possiblehigh-risk targets. Ennett, Bauman, and Koch (1994) also used network analysis to understand cigarettesmoking within and between adolescentfriendship cliques in the same sample ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 143 ninth graders described above. The authors found intra-clique homogeneity and inter- clique heterogeneity in current cigarettesmoking patterns: i.e., smokers tended tobelong to cliques in which other memberssmoked, while nonsmokers tended to begrouped with other nonsmokers. Ennett,Bauman, and Koch highlighted the fact thatmost cliques (68%) were composed en-tirely or mostly of nonsmokers (89.9%),suggesting that friendship cliques con-tribute more to the maintenance of non-smoking than to the onset and maintenanceof smoking. They also confirmed, however, that smoking has a greater social signifi-cance for girls than boys. Using data from 10,030 Californian ado- lescents, Unger and Chen (1999) foundthat age of smoking initiation was earlier among those whose friends, siblings,and/or parents were smokers, and amongthose adolescents who had a tobacco ad-vertisement they particularly liked, whohad received tobacco promotional items,or who would be willing to use tobaccopromotional items. Alexander and col-leagues (2001) studied the effect of popu-larity, best-friend smoking, and cigarettesmoking within peer networks on the cur-rent smoking patterns of seventh- through12 th-grade students in the United States. Adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity,parent education, school, and availabilityof cigarettes at home, the risk of current smoking was significantly associated withpeer networks in which at least half of themembers smoked, or one or two bestFigure 17-1.

In a literature review of adolescent alcohol use, Monica Gaughan (2003) found thatthe most important predictor of this be-havior is the use pattern of peers. Shefound significant evidence supporting the fact that adolescents whose peers con-sume alcohol are more likely to drink thanadolescents without friends who drink,and that adolescents with friends whodrink heavily are more likely to engage inthis type of behavior as well. Thomas Va-lente (2003) points out in the introduc-tory article for a journal review on socialnetwork influences on adolescent sub-stance use: \"We find in these results, andother studies, that social network matters . Adolescents select friends like them-selves, those friends influence their be-havior, and they often engage in risky be-havior together.\" The analysis by Gaughan(2003) published in the same journal alsodemonstrates that adolescent friends notonly influence one another to establishand maintain alcohol use patterns overtime, but that healthy friends can alsocreate social dynamics that exert protec-tive effects to help reduce the frequency ofexcessive drinking. The strong influence of peers on adoles- cent behavior has led to the increased useof peer education in health promotion pro- grams. Other theories have also beenidentified as supporting the developmentof peer education: the Social Cognitive Theory (Chapter Sixteen) because of itscontribution of using peers to serve as be- havioral models, the Theory of ReasonedAction (Chapter Ten) because of the influ-ence exerted by individual perception ofsocial norms or beliefs on behavioralchange, the Diffusion of Innovations The-ory (Chapter Twenty-three) because of itsuse of opinion leaders who serve as agentsof behavioral change by disseminating in- formation and influencing group norms in their community, and the Theory of Par-ticipatory Education (Freire 1970) becauseof its empowerment component (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS1999b). However, peer education in prac-tice has differed in its definition of who constitutes the most appropriate kind ofpeer and what type of education this peer ideally should provide (e.g., counseling,distributing materials, providing support,making referrals to services, facilitatingdiscussions, etc.) (Shoemaker et al. 1998;Flanagan, Williams, and Mahler 1996). The Social Networks and Social Support Theories provide a natural framework tounderstand the person-centered network of social relationships through which social support may be provided. The description of health-enhancing social support char- acteristics and how social networks and so-cial support may be strengthened (Heanyand Israel 2002) are useful contributionsthat will most likely improve the effective-ness of peer education in the future, espe-cially among adolescents. Unfortunately,much of the evidence of peer education andHIV/AIDS in the last decade, for example,comes from experiences among the adultYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 145population (e.g., commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, factory work-ers, people living with HIV/AIDS) (JointUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS1999b). On the other hand, however, overthe past five years a growing evidence baseof peer education effectiveness among youth has been developing. Albrecht and colleagues (1998) studied the use of peer support in smoking cessation programs in the United States for pregnantadolescents (ages 12-20). Participantswere randomized to one of the followinggroups: a buddy pro-gram (TFSB), a Teen FreshStart program(TFS) without peer support (a standard-ized cognitive behavioral group model de-veloped by the American Cancer Societyspecifically for adolescents), and the usualcare control group. The group that re-ceived peer support (TFSB) achieved con-sistently higher smoking cessation ratesacross all measures when compared to thesubjects in the other two groups. Further-more, peer education programs have beenfound to offer benefits to adolescent peer leaders by increasing their knowledge,teaching them new skills, encouragingthem to assume greater responsibility for their own health, and improving their self-perception as an agent of positivechange in their community (Pearlman etal. 2002, Neumark-Sztainer 1999). However, a few studies have shown contra- dictory findings regarding the effective-ness of peer education. Kirby et al. (1997)found that although a peer-led interactiveHIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention cur- riculum significantly increased HIV/AIDS-related and reproductive health-related knowledge, it did not significantlychange actual sexual or contraceptive be-haviors. A study by Dishion, McCord, andPoulin (1999) found that high-risk youth are particularly vulnerable to peer groupinterventions when they are grouped to-gether, a situation that can lead to in-creased occurrences of substance abuseand acts of violence. Greydanus and colleagues (1990) have de- scribed the gang phenomenon as the ex-treme use of a negative peer group for thepurpose of securing self-identificationand note that adolescents are more likelyto join a gang if their families and commu-nities do not offer them the security,structure, and opportunities that theyneed. According to Dishion and colleagues(1991), the process of antisocial peergroup formation begins at home withproblematic parent-child relationshipsthat are coercive and hostile. This is alsomentioned in a survey of 938 youth maras (gangs) living in El Salvador, where almosthalf of them described their early familyrelationships as bad or very bad and re-ported having witnessed domestic vio-lence against their mothers and/or sib-lings, and one-third reported being therecipient of physical violence coming fromtheir fathers (Santacruz Giralt and Concha-Eastman 2001). Mara members describe their fellow gang members as their fam-ily, a reference group from which they re-ceive social support, establish a sense ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 146belonging, exercise mutual loyalty and protection, and share positive affects,freedom from obligations, and the oppor-tunity to \"hang out\" together. Moraes and Reichenheim (2002) esti- mated the prevalence of domestic vio-lence during pregnancy and its principalrisk groups among public health careusers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The au-thors found that physical violence mainlyoccurred among adolescent women withcomparatively fewer years of schooling,who did not work outside the home, whohad fewer prenatal care visits, and who re-ported having little social support. Fami-lies with proportionately more childrenunder age 5 in the household, who re-ported alcohol and drug abuse, and whoheld low socioeconomic status were alsomore likely to report the presence of do-mestic violence. Several studies have reported associations between neighborhood conditions andlevels of parent-to-child physical aggres-sion (Limber and Nation 1998). Molnarand colleagues (2003) conducted a multi-level study to understand the associationbetween several neighborhoods' charac-teristics and parent-to-child aggression.Data used in the analysis came from the Project on Human Development inChicago Neighborhoods and from cohortsin the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old agegroups and their caregivers. In 30% of thehouseholds, the primary caregiver was afemale single parent. The authors foundthat concentrated disadvantage (using several poverty-related neighborhood in-dicators) and community violence (usingthe 1995 neighborhood murder rate as anindicator) significantly predicted higheruse of parent-to-child physical aggres-sion, controlling for sex and age of thechild. However, the authors also found thatfor Hispanic families only, the size of the social network was significantly associatedwith lower use of physical aggression bycaregivers. In this interaction model, theexistence of family social support also pre-dicted lower rates of parent-to-childphysical aggression. Familias Unidas (Coatsworth, Pantin, and Szapocznik 2002) is a multilevel, family-centered intervention designed to preventproblem behaviors in Hispanic adoles-cents. The intervention rests on building astrong parent-support network and thenuses that network to increase knowledgeand improve practice of culturally relevantparenting skills to reduce behavioral risksfrequently found in poor, urban environ-ments. The intervention found that someneighbors may be less inclined to feel it istheir role to watch out for the safety ofneighborhood adolescents and may eventhink that this role is an inappropriate onefor them. However, in other instances, communities have created formalized op-portunities to reach out to high-risk youthvia block parties, regular activities at localcommunity centers, the creation of com-munity newsletters, and adult mentoringprograms (Neumark-Sztainer 1999).YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 147One successful program, based on devel- oping new social network linkages bymatching adolescents with adult mentors,has been the Big Brothers/Big Sisters pro-gram (Furano et al. 1993). The programprovides mentors to young people betweenages 10 and 16 living in single-parenthouseholds in the United States. Partici-pants in the intervention group had statis-tically significant better attitudes towardschool and better school attendance, im-proved relationships with their parentsand peers, and less likelihood of antisocialbehavior and of initiating drug and alcoholuse. The benefits were particularly strongamong minority youths. Mentors who be-lieved that their major role was to supportthe growth and development of theirmentees were more successful than men-tors who believed that their major role wasto change their mentees (Glantz, Rimer,and Lewis 2002). These results have beenused to inform the development of suc-cessful mentoring guidelines (Jucovy2001) for broader use in other types ofsimilar health promotion and preventionactivities. There is also increasing evidence of the critical role that social networks and socialsupport play in the school environment.Adolescents who feel part of their school,and who feel cared for by people in thisenvironment, are less likely to use sub-stances, engage in violence, or initiatesexual activity at an early age (McNeely,Nonnemaker, and Blum 2002). The au-thors analyzed data from the in-school andschool administrator surveys of the Na- tional Longitudinal Study of AdolescentHealth (75,515 students in 127 U.S.schools) to estimate the association be-tween school characteristics and the aver-age level of school connectedness in eachschool. Positive classroom managementclimates, participation in extracurricularactivities, tolerant disciplinary policies,and small school size were associated pos-itively with higher school connectedness.Laufer and Harel (2003) studied the rela-tive importance of family, peers, andschool in predicting youth violence amonga nationally representative sample of8,394 students from grades 6-10 in Israel.The authors found that lack of parentalsupport in the family regarding school, alack of social integration by peers, andperceptions of frequent acts of violence in school were variables that predictviolence. Primary health care services in the com- munity could play a potentially importantrole in enhancing social support for ado-lescents and their families. However, inmany countries, adolescents do not usehealth services as often as they might be-cause they feel that their needs have notbeen appropriately targeted. Young malesin particular are in need of services ad-dressing their particular needs and con-cerns. Andrew, Patel, and Ramakrishna(2003) surveyed 811 students in India togenerate information regarding theirhealth needs. The findings revealed thatthere is not only an unmet need for sexualYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 148and reproductive health information, but also for psychosocial support on issuesranging from violence in schools to poorrelationships with caregivers, educationaldifficulties, and stress-related healthsymptoms, which are often perceived byadolescents to be of primary importance.

Results showedthat these adolescents have a broad com-municative network, including friends,dating partners, and extended familymembers, with whom they talk about sex.Daughters feel more comfortable commu- nicating with their mothers about sex, andsons are more likely to communicate andfeel comfortable communicating withtheir fathers. Regression analysis suggestscomfortable sexual communication is pre-dictive of less likelihood of being sexuallyactive, of being older at first intercourse,and of increased intentions to delay inter-course. However, comfortable mother-adolescent sexual discussions, but notfather-adolescent communication, wererelated to abstinence among adolescents.The study also showed that while comfort-able communication with nonparentalothers was related to safer sexual behav-iors, comfortable communication with Table 17-1.

Table 17-2. presents a breakdown of the number of studies found using the SocialNetworks and Social Support Theories ac-cording to health behaviors.

As young people enter into adolescence, they need\u2014and most of them want\u2014increasing amounts of social interaction.They want to spend time with their friendsin the neighborhood and other publicspaces, enjoy \"sleep-overs\" at theirfriends' houses, maintain frequent phonecontact when not together, and, if theyhave access to a computer, interact backand forth through \"instant messaging\" andother similar modern technologies. Re-search shows that parental support is crit-ical to the adoption of healthy behaviors,but there coexists a natural tendency to-ward separation and individuation duringthis second decade of life. Parents oftenhave difficulties in redefining how best tocontinue providing support in terms thatrespect the adolescent's need for explo-ration and separate identity formation. Inthis struggle, parents sometimes give up,and others purposefully spend less timewith their sons and daughters, relying ontheir growing independence to help themmake the best choices. The peer networkbecomes crucial at this point. Researchshows in this regard that healthy friendscan act as protective factors helping ado-lescents to adopt and maintain healthy be-haviors, just as friends exploring risky be-haviors can act as risk factors in theadoption of health-compromising behav-iors. Parents and other adults in the com- munity can play a pivotal role by offeringdevelopmentally appropriate social sup-port to adolescent networks that promotesthe adoption of healthy behaviors andacknowledges the members' particularneeds and wants. The number of articles found on social networks and social support within thecontext of adolescent health is higher thanfor the other behavioral theories and mod- els discussed thus far in this book, partic-ularly in the area of violence and adoles-cence (Table 17-3.). Although a fewarticles analyzed the impact of social net-works and community social support onadolescent violent behaviors, most ofthem provided compelling evidence forthe relationship between lack of parentalsupport, violence in the home, and the ex-pression of adolescent violent behaviors. Parental skill and support is perhaps the single-most important key to the success-ful transitioning of adolescents throughthe different stages of physical and emo-tional development. Yet at times, parentsneed special guidance in developing effec-tive parenting styles, and there is strongevidence linking the development of pro-tective adolescent health behaviors withwhat has been described as authoritative parenting , which will be discussed at fur- ther length in the following chapter. Pro-grams that enhance existing social net-work linkages both for adolescents andtheir parents; develop new social networkYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER SEVENTEEN | 151linkages, particularly through the training of natural helpers in parenting styles; and facilitate parental involvement in ongoingcommunity problem identification andproblem-solving will also contribute to protect adolescents from adopting health-compromising lifestyles.

Summary of the Social Networks and Social Support Theories and Adolescent Lifestyles protective effects such as reducing the fre- quency of excessive drinking. The strong influence of peers on adolescent behavior has led to the increased use of peereducation in health promotion programs. How-ever, in practice, there remain differences indefinition of who constitutes the most appro- priate kind of peer and what type of educa- tion this peer ideally should provide. Among Hispanic families, the size of the social network is significantly associated with loweruse of physical aggression by caregivers, andfamily social support also predicts lower ratesof parent-to-child physical aggression. Building parent-support networks and then using these networks to increase knowledgeand improve practice of culturally relevantparenting skills help to reduce adolescent risksfrequently found in poor, urban environments. Lack of parental support in the family regard- ing school, lack of social integration by peers,and perceptions of frequent acts of violencein school are variables that predict violence. Adolescents who feel part of their school, and who feel cared for by people in this environ-ment, are less likely to use substances,engage in violent behavior, or initiate sexualactivity at an early age. Comfortable mother-adolescent sexual discussions, but not father-adolescentcommunication, are related to abstinenceamong adolescents.Peer social networks may be characterized by clique members (a small group of adolescent peers generally of the same sex and age),liaisons (adolescents who interact with two or more adolescents who are members of aclique, but who themselves are not part of theclique), and isolates (adolescents who have few or no linkages to others via a socialnetwork). The odds of being a current smoker are sig- nificantly higher for isolates than for cliquemembers and/or liaisons. Adolescent smokers tend to belong to cliques in which other members smoke, while non-smoking adolescents tend to belong to cliqueswith other nonsmokers. The risk of current smoking is significantly associated with peer networks in which atleast half of the members smoke, or one ortwo best friends smoke, and with increasingrates of school smoking prevalence. Adolescents whose peers consume alcohol are more likely to drink than adolescentswithout friends who drink. At the same time,adolescents with friends who drink heavily are more likely to engage in this type ofbehavior, as well. Adolescent friends not only influence one another to establish and maintain alcohol use patterns over time, but healthy friendscan also create social dynamics that exertEducators Ralph DiClemente, Richard Crosby, and Michelle Kegler include in their 2002 book Emerging Theories in Health Promotion Practice and Research: Strategies for Improving Public Health (2002) a chapter dedicated to the link be- tween the Authoritative Parenting Model and adolescent health behavior. This parentingstyle approach, originally attributed to Diana Baumrind (1978) and refined by Maccobyand Martin (1983), has gained wide acceptance in the field of adolescent health educationbecause of the growing evidence showing inverse relationships between what has beenlabeled as \"authoritative parenting\" and the adoption of risky health behaviors amongchildren and adolescents. Baumrind (1971, 1967) explored the parenting practices that related to children's adjust- ment. She found that parents whose children were self-reliant, self-controlled, buoyant,and approach-oriented were themselves firm, loving, demanding, and understanding.Parents whose children were disruptive and not willing to comply were firm, punitive, and unaffectionate. Maccoby and Martin (1983) expand this line of thinking by analyzingparenting styles along two dimensions: demandingness : the extent to which parents demand mature behavior, supervise activ- ities, and discipline transgressions responsiveness : the extent to which parents are attuned to their children's physical, so- cial, and emotional needs and support their increasing autonomy[Chapter Eighteen ] The Authoritative Parenting Model YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 154 Figure 18-1. illustrates four different par- enting styles. This classification does notconsider the presence of abusive parent-ing, which nonetheless is a frequent real-ity in today's world. Abusive parenting be-havior as a form of discipline is most oftenseen linked to the authoritarian parentingstyles. If emotional, verbal, and/or physi-cal abuse accompanies other manifesta-tions of this style, the approach can resultin noneffective and detrimental parentingwith long-term consequences for the child(Kim et al. 2001, Champion 1999, Steven-son 1999).Maccoby and Martin observed that de- mandingness and responsiveness could berelatively independent of each other. It ispossible, for example, for a parent to bevery responsive without being very de-manding and vice versa. Many studies givesupport to the description of the four dif-ferent parenting styles presented in Figure18-1. by combining these two dimensions. Maccoby and Martin's model also enables the quantification of parental responsive-ness and demandingness. Measures ofparental responsiveness seek to quantifyAuthoritative Parenting (Highly Effective) Very responsive and very demanding Warm, firm, and fairAuthoritarian Parenting (Less Effective) Not responsive and very demanding Firm and punitive Permissive Parenting (Less Effective) Very responsive and not demanding Warm and laissez-faireHigh Responsiveness Uninvolved Parenting (Not Effective) Not responsive and not demanding Emotionally absentFigure 18-1.

YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 155how frequently, consistently, and suc- cessfully parents attend to their children.Measures of demandingness seek toquantify how frequently, consistently, andconcisely parents supervise and monitortheir children, set standards for their be-havior, and encourage specific, goal-directed behaviors (Simons-Morton andHartos 2002). Studies show a positiverelationship between parental demand-ingness and adolescent behavioral adjust-ment, as well as between parental respon-siveness and adolescent psychosocialdevelopment. The presence of both inbalance contributes to the adolescents'positive behavioral adjustment and psy-chosocial development. The Components of Authoritative (Effective) Parenting Authoritative parents are warm, firm, and fair. Although the literature refers to thistype of parenting with the original term\"authoritative\" given by Baumrind andMaccoby and Martin, the authors of thisbook prefer to use the term \"effective par-enting,\" whenever appropriate, in order toavoid confusion with the similar term \"au-thoritarian parenting,\" which has signifi-cantly different manifestations and out-comes. Most researchers agree thatauthoritative ,o r effective ,parenting is com- posed of three main components (Stein-berg 1999): warmth , structure , and auton- omy support . Following is a description of each of these components, with the addi-tion of a fourth, development support , which PAHO also considers to be a key aspect of effective parenting. Warmth (responsivenes s) is the degree to which a parent successfully communi-cates to the adolescent that he/she isloved and accepted. Authoritative or ef-fective parents are warm in their rela- tionships with their children. Whenadolescents have developed an earlierstrong attachment to their parents, theyare more willing to please them and bemore open to their influence. But par-ents need to be cautious and not takethis relationship for granted when con-flicts arise during adolescence. Instead,they need to constantly nurture existingpositive bonds by spending quality timewith their adolescents, sharing in theirinterests, and participating in activitiesof mutual enjoyment. Parents should also be empathetic when intense nega-tive emotions arise due to frustrationsand disappointments and maintain apermanent positive emotional climate , even at times of high environmentalstress and parent-child disagreements. Anger, aggression, rivalry, and compe- tition are healthy emotions that becomepart of the daily affective experiences ofadolescents, which are then expressedto parents in a variety of ways. Very oftenthis process becomes a mechanismthrough which adolescents attempt todefine their individuality and differen-tiate themselves from parents, siblings,and even peers. These intense negativeemotions can sometimes be difficult forparents to tolerate and react to withcalm and patience. Yet, as most parentscome to realize, ignoring these feelingsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 156or pretending that they do not exist will not make them go away and often onlyincreases their intensity or the fre-quency with which they are expressed.Parents do not really have a choice about whether or not adolescents have theseemotions. Yet, if they are counterbal-anced with expressions of warmth andempathy by the parent, this reaction canserve as a model to enable children andadolescents to learn more appro-priate and healthy ways to express nega-tive feelings. Structure (demandingness ) is the degree to which the adolescent has expectationsand rules for his or her behavior. Au-thoritative or effective parents are firm in the limits set for their sons anddaughters. Effective parents set stan-dards for the child's conduct but formexpectations that are consistent with thechild's developing needs and capabili-ties. The authoritative parents are effec-tive in protecting adolescents from neg-ative influences not only because they setclear limits and enforce consequenceswhen these limits are trespassed, butalso because they maintain an even bal-ance between restrictiveness and auton-omy by monitoring the adolescent's be-haviors and choices and anticipatingrisky situations. Effective parents alsoenforce limits by redirecting adoles-cents' behaviors before they trespass. In order to increase their autonomy, adolescents frequently attempt to \"push\"set limits. Authoritative parents recog-nize that there are negotiable limits , which teach responsibility, and nonnegotiable limits , which protect young people from harm. Adolescents occasionally will tres-pass negotiable limits (e.g., agreed timeto arrive home) and learn through en-forcement of the previously agreed-upon consequences. Authoritative or effectiveparents monitor closely the early signs ofrisky situations that could tempt adoles-cents to trespass nonnegotiable limits(e.g., consume illegal drugs) and antici-pate these by redirecting behaviors, of-fering other alternatives to satisfy theneed for exploring those risky behaviors,and increasing communication withtheir adolescents about the involvedrisks. Which limits are negotiable andwhich are not will vary from family tofamily and will also be influenced by cul-tural differences. Autonomy support is the degree to which parents accept and encourage the ado-lescent's individuality. Authoritative oreffective parents are fair in exercising their authority. Authoritative parentsare more likely than authoritarian par-ents to give children more indepen-dence gradually as they get older, pro-viding adolescents with opportunities todevelop self-reliance, but also provid-ing clear standards and limits for be-haviors, along with their respectiveguidelines. Effective parents place ahigh value on the development of auton-omy and self-direction but continue toassume ultimate responsibility for theirchild's behavior. Authoritative or effec-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 157tive parents increase the amounts of ne- gotiable limits gradually, according tothe child's developing needs and capa-bilities. They also closely monitor theadherence to nonnegotiable limits. Al-though there is a continuum from child-hood to adolescence, authoritative par-enting is extremely important duringpre- and early adolescence, duringwhich periods parents should still exertcontrol over adolescent behaviors, re-spond to negotiable and nonnegotiablelimits, and otherwise closely supervisethe process of assuming increasing au-tonomy. Parents who don't encourageautonomy (e.g., authoritarian parents)during these crucial periods miss animportant opportunity to closely super-vise the necessary process of acquiringindependence. Supporting autonomy involves not only granting more permission for adoles-cents to do things on their own (e.g., goto the movies with friends) but also en-couraging adolescents to express theirown choices and opinions, even if thesesometimes lead to disagreement. Ado-lescents appear to do best when theygrow up in an atmosphere of close fam-ily ties that permits the development ofindividuality (Steinberg 1999). Development support is the degree to which parents foster and enhance theadolescent's underlying developmentalcapacities for emotional and logicalthinking. Effective parents are morelikely to engage their children in verbalgive-and-take, which plays an important part in the development of reasoningabilities, role-taking, emotional think-ing, empathy, and moral judgment. Inthese families, verbal give-and-take isthe norm, emphasizing at the same timethe importance of maintaining close re-lationships and considering how actionsmay affect other family members (Stein-berg 1999, Rueter and Conger 1995).Hauser, Powers, and Noam (1991) de-scribe these characteristics as enabling interactions and promoters of healthy adolescent development, in contrast toconstraining interactions , which are judg- mental or devaluating of a family mem-ber's opinion. Enabling interactions, or verbal give- and-take, should not only foster reason-ing abilities and problem-solving, butalso emotional thinking. Parents have aunique opportunity to help pre- andearly adolescents recognize their emo-tions and express them verbally, therebydiscouraging the need for them to be\"acted out\" in more indirect ways. By ex-ercising empathy, parents can guide theiradolescents in the discovery of healthierstrategies to regulate intense feelings ofsadness, fear, envy, jealousy, anger, andeven uncontrolled excitement, while atthe same time providing the adolescentwith a strong role model for individual-ized empathy development. By the time young people reach middle ado- lescence (ages 15-16) their autonomy isgrowing, while at the same time their devel-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 158opmental capacity to confront and resist peer pressure is tested on a daily basis.Therefore, it is crucial that adolescenthealth promotion and prevention programsstart earlier (preadolescence and early ado-lescence) and coordinate efforts with pro-grams directed toward younger children togradually strengthen adolescents' capaci-ties to develop their own healthy choices asthey achieve more autonomy. It is also important to keep in mind that so- cialization is a two-way process, in thesense that adolescent behavior also affectsparental behavior. Some adolescents areless challenging to raise than others, due todifferent interactive styles (Greenspan1995). Secondly, parents naturally tend tohave different parenting styles, perhaps asa product of their own upbringing, child-hood experiences, and social and culturalvalues. Thus, it is not uncommon to see op-posing parenting styles in the same house-hold (e.g., authoritarian and permissive),which results in confusion and the child oradolescent receiving mixed messages.Lastly, parenting styles can also be affectedby environmental constraints, such as eco-nomic stress and poverty. Studies showthat parents under economic strain are lessinvolved, less nurturing, less vigilant,harsher in their treatment, more inclinedtoward depression, more enmeshed inmarital conflict, and less consistent intheir disciplinary methods than their moreeconomically stable counterparts (Stein-berg 1999, McLoyd 1990). Under thesecircumstances, adolescents present moreanxiety, depression, conduct problems,and diminished school performance (Steinberg 1999; Conger, Patterson, andGe 1995). Conger et al. (1993) developedthe Family Process Model linking eco-nomic stress and adolescent adjustment toexplain how economic stress and povertycan adversely affect adolescent develop-ment and behaviors by affecting parents'emotional tone and parenting skills. Sev-eral studies (Kim et al. 2001, Sheeber et al.2000) support aspects of this model bylinking parents' angry, irritable, and/ordepressive emotional tone and poor par-enting with health-compromising behav-iors. The interaction of these factors andhow they contribute to unhealthy adoles-cent behavior is shown in Figure 18-2. Studies of families living in poverty also provide insight into what parents living inpoor neighborhoods can do to help protecttheir children from the adverse conse-quences of growing up in poor inner-cityor rural areas. In general, families farebetter when they have adequate sources ofsocial support (Taylor 1996) and whenthey have strong ties to religious institu-tions (Brody, Stoneman, and Flor 1996).In addition, two specific sets of familymanagement strategies employed by par-ents in poor neighborhoods seem to work:promotive strategies, which attempt to strengthen the adolescent's competencethrough effective child-rearing within thehome environment and/or through in-volving the child in positive activities out-side the home; and restrictive strategies, which attempt to minimize the child's ex-posure to dangers in the neighborhood. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 159 Concentrated poverty has negative effects on the adolescent's transition to adult-hood; these effects are above and beyondthose attributable to growing up in a poorfamily. Adolescents growing up in impov-erished communities are more likely thantheir peers from equally poor house-holds\u2014but those nestled within, or closerto, more affluent neighborhoods\u2014to bearchildren as teenagers and to drop out ofhigh school (Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993).Interestingly, it seems to be the absence ofmore affluent neighbors, rather than thepresence of poor neighbors, that placesadolescents in impoverished communitiesat greatest risk (Ensminger, Lamkin, andJacobson 1996). In Latin America and the Caribbean, ado- lescents are surrounded by economicstress and poverty. In 1997, 32.5 millionadolescents between the ages of 13 and 19,or 47% of this age group, were living in poverty (Schutt-Aine and Maddaleno2003). In Haiti, more than 70% of thepopulation lives below the absolutepoverty level. Adolescents who grow up inpoor neighborhoods are far more likelythan other youth to be exposed to chroniccommunity violence. Family structure is also changing in many Latin American and Caribbean countries.The percentage of adolescents raised inhouseholds headed by women ranges be-tween 21% and 35% (Schutt-Aine andMaddaleno 2003). It is also estimated that80% of adolescent mothers in urban areasand 70% in rural areas belong to the poor-est 50% of Latin American and Caribbeanhouseholds (Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica paraAm\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe 1997).

A recently published Swedish re-search study found increased risks of psy-chiatric disease, suicide or suicide at-tempt, injury, and substance addiction inchildren in single-parent households,compared with those in two-parenthouseholds (Ringb\u00e4ck Weitoff et al. 2003).A recent study in nine English-speakingCaribbean countries indicates that 24% ofyouth feel that their mother \"understandslittle about their problems,\" and 32% ofadolescents feel the same lack of under-standing from their fathers (Pan AmericanHealth Organization 2000a). Adolescentboys from nine countries in the Region ofthe Americas indicate that sexual informa-tion received from parents is often pro-vided too late and is laden with myths andtaboos (Aguirre and G\u00fcell 2002). Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the AuthoritativeParenting Model to AdolescentLifestyles Substantial research supports the rela- tionship between the authoritative or ef-fective parenting style and the adoption ofhealth-promoting lifestyles. Authoritativeparenting has been positively associatedwith self-control, conflict resolution, andpeer resistance in ethnically diverse sam-ples of adolescents from fourth to 10 th grades (Carlson, Uppal, and Prosser 2000;Jackson, Henriksen, and Fosheen 1998).Authoritative parenting is associated in-versely with tobacco, alcohol, and drug usein adolescents, in contrast to authoritar-ian, uninvolved, and permissive parentingstyles, which have been positively related to these adolescent behaviors (Pierce et al.2002, Simons-Morton and Hartos 2002). Pierce and colleagues (2002) decided to further test this evidence, examiningwhether tobacco industry marketingpractices towards young people under-mine the protective effect of recom-mended authoritative parenting againstadolescent smoking in a representativesample of 1,641 U.S. adolescents aged 12to 14 years living in California. The studymeasured the level of receptivity to to-bacco industry advertising and promotionamong these adolescents. Those whonamed a brand but did not have a favoritecigarette advertisement were consideredas having a low level of receptivity. A highlevel of receptivity required the adoles-cent to be willing to use an item with abrand image or to have obtained the prod-uct. Although the study results confirmedthat adolescents in families with more au-thoritatively inclined parents were half aslikely to smoke by follow-up (between1996 and 1999) as adolescents in familieswith less authoritative parents (20% vs.41%, p < .0001), the promotion of smok-ing by the tobacco industry was found to undermine these effects among ado-lescents who were highly receptive to to-bacco industry advertising and promo-tions. In families with more authoritativeparents, these adolescents were 3 timesmore likely to smoke compared to thosewho were minimally receptive. The aver-age California retail outlet has 17 tobaccoads, with half of these placed at the eyeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 161level of young children (3 feet high or lower), and a quarter of all retail outletsoffer cigarette products right next to candy displays (Pierce et al. 2002, Feigh-ery et al. 2001). This evidence highlightsthe key role that authoritative parents canhave in helping pre- and early adoles-cents, who are highly receptive to tobaccoindustry advertising and promotions, todevelop media literacy skills so they maybecome more resilient to those marketingstrategies. The single most studied component of the Authoritative Parenting Model is parentalmonitoring. Low parental monitoring hasbeen directly related to increased risk be-haviors (Borawski et et al. Dickenson1999), substance use (Stanton et al. 2002,DiClemente et al. 2001), sexual involve-ment and intercourse (Borawski et al.2003, Henderson et al. 2002, Stanton et al.2002), unsafe sexual practices (Huebnerand Howell 2003, Short et al. 2003, Di-Clemente et al. 2001), teen pregnancy(Crosby et al. 2002; Unger, Molina, andTeran 2000), sexually 2003; DiClemente,Crosby, and Wingood et al.2001), and violent and delinquent behav-iors (DiClemente et al. 2001, Pettit et al.2001, Stattin 2001, Griffin et al. 2000b).These studies unanimously support the value of involved parents and stress theimportant role that effective parentalmonitoring and parenting styles serve as aprotective factor to promote the adoptionof healthy lifestyles and prevent risky be- haviors among adolescents. Of the above studies, of particular note is the research by Borawski and colleagues(2003). The authors recognize that oftenthe role of parental practices in preventinghealth risk-taking behaviors in adoles-cence is examined in a limited mannerthat focuses solely on the dimension ofparental monitoring. The Borawski et al.study introduces a developmental analysisby suggesting that parents need to adjusttheir supervisory practices as adolescentsmature and require more independencefor their own decision-making. Based on this evidence, the authors compare intheir study two different parenting prac-tices, parental monitoring and negotiatedunsupervised time, and ascertain per-ceived parental trust in the reporting ofhealth risk behaviors among 692 adoles-cents from six urban high schools (meanage 15.7 years) in the Midwestern UnitedStates. The results confirmed that higherlevels of parental monitoring are signifi-cantly associated with less sexual activity,lower intentions to have sex in the future,and lower rates of alcohol, tobacco, andmarijuana use, as well as higher rates ofconsistent condom use. Although reportsof higher levels of negotiated unsuper- vised time were significantly associatedwith more sexual activity and alcohol, to-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 162bacco, and marijuana consumption, this second parenting style was also associatedwith the health-promoting behaviors ofcarrying condoms for protection andchoosing not to have sex when condomswere not available. Another striking finding of this study was that students who reported having moreunsupervised time were no more likely toinitiate sex early, intend to have sex, en-gage in unprotected sex, or report havingsexually transmitted infections (STI) thanthose reporting permission for fewer un-supervised opportunities. Furthermore,reports of higher perceived parental trustwere associated with lower prevalence ofsexual activity, intentions to have sex, andreports of STI; higher rates of consistentcondom use; and lower use of tobacco, al-cohol, and marijuana. Thus, as the authorsof this study suggest, there appears to be more to effective parenting than merelyknowing the adolescent's whereabouts inorder to promote the adoption of healthybehaviors and the prevention of health-compromising ones. Kerr, Stattin, andTrost (1999) found that parental knowl- edge of adolescent daily activities thatcame from the latter's own spontaneousdisclosure was most closely linked toparental trust. Based on these findings,the authors propose a reinterpretation ofparental monitoring as one that emanatesfrom parental knowledge based princi-pally on the adolescent's spontaneous dis-closure rather than parental questioningof their adolescents regarding where they will be and with whom. Effective parentalpractices, then, will need to adjust and evolve to acknowledge and accommodatethe numerous changes and emergingneeds that characterize the adolescent'spassage from one developmental stage tothe next. Authoritative or effective parenting\u2014in contrast to authoritarian, permissive, anduninvolved parenting\u2014has also been in-versely related to anger, alienation, aggres-sion, psychological distress, delinquency,and school misconduct in adolescents. Therole of different parenting practices pre-dicting later antisocial behaviors and vio-lence, including dating violence, amongadolescents has been widely studied(Chapple 2003; (2002) fol-lowed up 717 Canadian boys living in lowincome families, beginning at age 10through age 18, and found a direct relation-ship between harsh parenting styles (in-sulting, rejecting, constant quarreling,and/or hitting), antisocial behavior, andlater dating violence. Scaramella and col-leagues (2002) also found that a lack ofnurturing and involved parenting indi-rectly predicted delinquency, and the ado-lescent's antisocial behavior over time pre-dicted similar decreases in nurturingparenting. Conger and colleagues (2003)examined intergenerational continuities inboth angry, aggressive parenting and alsothe angry, aggressive behavior of childrenand adolescents among three generations:22-year-old young parents (G2), theirYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 163mothers (G1), and the children of G2 (G3). The authors found in this prospective, lon-gitudinal study a direct connection be-tween observed G1 aggressive parentingand observed G2 aggressive parenting from5 to 7 years later. Adolescent attitudes towards violence are strongly associated with witnessing inter-parental violence, as well as with lowerparental attachment, and this associationappears to intensify with the simultaneouspresence and interaction of these two fac-tors. Furthermore, dating violence is sig-nificantly associated with having wit-nessed inter-parental violence, highdating frequency, and low parental moni-toring (Chapple 2003). Champion (1999)had also previously found, in a study con-ducted among rural Mexican-Americanadolescents in the southwestern UnitedStates, that histories of family violence arepredictors of adolescent acceptance ofinterpersonal violence within intimaterelationships. The perception of parents' attitudes to- ward fighting has been also identified asthe strongest predictor of aggression in astudy conducted among 8,865 12-15-year-old ethnically diverse U.S. adolescents liv-ing in Texas. The study found an inverserelationship between aggression scores,fighting, injuries due to fighting, andweapon-carrying and the following familyvariables: parental monitoring, positiverelationship with parents, and the lack of parental support for fighting (Orpinas et al. 1999). In another study, Simons-Morton and Hartos (2002) similarly found that weapon-carrying and interpersonalviolence among middle adolescents wereinversely correlated to effective parentingand positively associated with permissive,authoritarian, and uninvolved parenting. The role of parenting practices in promot- ing the adoption and maintenance of phys-ical activity and healthy nutrition amongadolescents has been less studied thanother typical adolescent risk-behaviorconcerns. Schmitz and colleagues (2002)conducted a study to examine associationsbetween demographic and psychosocialfactors and self-reported physical activityand sedentary leisure habits among 3,798U.S. adolescents ages 11-15 (mean 12.8years). One of the important findings wasthat girls who reported that their mothershad an authoritative parenting style alsoreported higher physical activity and lowersedentary leisure habits. Kremers and col-leagues (2003) found in another study thatfruit consumption and fruit-specificknowledge were higher among adolescents(mean age 16.5) who were being raisedwith an authoritative parenting style. Ado-lescents raised by permissive parents con-sumed more fruit than adolescents fromauthoritarian or neglectful homes. Mellinand colleagues (2002) found that over-weight teenagers who reported having aclose relationship with their parents (feel-ings of being understood, sharing activi-ties and problems) were more likely to beinvolved in healthy behaviors. They alsofound that extremes in parental monitor- ing (high and low) were associated withYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 164lower breakfast consumption among boys and higher rates of extreme dieting behav-iors among girls. Simons-Morton and Hartos (2002) pro- pose adoption of the Authoritative Parent-ing Model, as described earlier in thischapter, to guide the design of health pro-motion programs seeking to improve par-enting and adolescent health. The modelrecommends specifying adolescent out-comes of interest and defining aspects ofan authoritative parenting style and thepractices that will affect adolescent out-comes, and then planning interventionsbased on these findings. Currently, the au-thors are conducting a Young Drivers In-tervention Study, which seeks to improveteen driving through the application ofthis Authoritative Parenting Model. Foxcroft et al. (2001) consider \"Strength- ening Families,\" discussed in ChapterSeven, to be one of the most effective U.S.alcohol and drug prevention programs de-veloped to date for adolescents. It also hasdemonstrated effectiveness in violenceprevention. The theoretical framework thathelped to design the program's interven-tions included the Family Process Model(Conger et al. 1993), which describes therelationship between economic stress andadolescent adjustment and is describedearlier in this chapter, and concepts fromthe Resiliency Theory, which will be dis-cussed in Chapter Nineteen. The acquisition of effective parenting skills is not formally taught at any point orplace in life. Yet there is a growing body of evidence regarding parenting best prac-tices and the positive effects these prac-tices can have on adolescent behaviors andlifestyle choices. The Authoritative Par-enting Model has been presented in thischapter with the hope that professionalsinvolved in the design and implementa-tion of health promotion and preventionprograms for adolescents will seek to ac-tively involve parents as part of a multi-component health promotion and preven-tion program that can impart to parentsthe knowledge and skills necessary to be-come more effective parents whose atti-tude and approach to raising adolescentsincrease the likelihood that their sons anddaughters will adopt and maintain healthylifestyles. In many communities throughout the world, parents\u2014as we saw earlier in thischapter\u2014are additionally burdened withthe tremendous economic strain ofpoverty and the accompanying emotionalstress this situation brings into the familynucleus. Economic stress indirectly influ-ences adolescents through disruptions inparental mood and behavior and its ten-dency to exacerbate existing problems inmarital interactions (Conger et al. 1993),which in turn decrease the likelihood ofexercising authoritative or effective par-enting practices and increase the chanceof adopting more permissive or authori- tarian parenting styles. It is crucial thathealth promotion and prevention pro-grams for adolescents which include aparenting component take into accountYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER EIGHTEEN | 165the economic stress in which the particu- lar family at hand might be immersed.These programs would need to include in-terventions directed toward helping par-ents develop or regain authoritative or ef-fective parenting practices, particularlythe necessary balance between nurturanceand demandingness, and to consciouslydistance themselves from less effectiveparenting styles (uninvolved, permissive,authoritarian, even harsh and abusive)when confronted with stress. Table 18-1. presents a breakdown of the number of studies found using the Au-thoritative Parenting Model according tohealth behaviors. It is important to note, however, that fully two-thirds (i.e., 53 out of 80) of these pub-lished research articles focus primarily onthe effect of only one component of the Authoritative Parenting Model, that ofparental monitoring (or demandingness),as illustrated in Table 18-2. The significant number of articles found reviewing parenting styles and their im-pact on adolescent health behaviors alsoreveals that this area is of great interest toresearchers. Along with the Social Net-works and Social Support Theories (Chap-ter Seventeen) and the Social CognitiveTheory (Chapter Sixteen), the Authorita-tive Parenting Model is among the moststudied of all theoretical framework com-ponents. The area of parenting and its in-fluence on the development of violentadolescent behaviors appears to elicit themost interest of all in the social sciencesresearch community, as the table furtherindicates.

Summary of the Authoritative Parenting Model and Adolescent Lifestyles reling, and/or hitting) and antisocial behavior, including dating violence. Lack of nurturing and involved parenting indirectly predicts delinquency, and theadolescent's antisocial behavior over timepredicts similar decreases in nurturingparenting. Adolescent attitudes towards violence arestrongly associated with witnessing inter-parental violence, as well as to lower parentalattachment, and this association appears tointensify with the simultaneous presence andinteraction of these two factors. The perception of parents' attitudes towardfighting has also been identified as a strongpredictor of aggression among adolescents. Weapon-carrying and interpersonal violence among middle adolescents have been in-versely correlated to effective parenting andpositively associated with permissive, authori-tarian, and uninvolved parenting. Girls who report that their mothers have anauthoritative parenting style also report higherphysical activity and lower sedentary leisurehabits. Fruit consumption and fruit-specific knowl-edge are higher among adolescents who arebeing raised with an authoritative parentingstyle. It is crucial that health promotion and preven-tion programs for adolescents which includea parenting component take into account theeconomic stress in which the targeted fami-lies might be immersed. Such programswould need to include interventions directedtoward helping parents develop or regain au-thoritative or effective parenting practices,particularly the necessary balance betweennurturance and demandingness, and to con-sciously distance themselves from less effec-tive parenting styles (uninvolved, permissive,authoritarian, even harsh and abusive) whenconfronted with stress.Authoritative parenting is associated inverselywith tobacco, alcohol, and drug use in ado-lescents, in contrast to authoritarian, unin-volved, and permissive parenting styles,which have been positively related to theseadolescent behaviors. Low parental monitoring has been directly re-lated to increased adolescent risk behaviorincluding cigarette, alcohol, and substanceuse; sexual involvement and intercourse; un-safe practices; teen pregnancy; sexuallytransmitted infections; and violent and delin-quent behaviors. Although higher reports of negotiated unsu-pervised time are significantly associated withmore sexual activity and alcohol, tobacco,and marijuana consumption, this parentingstyle is also associated with the health-promoting behaviors of carrying condoms for protection and choosing not to have sex when condoms are not available. Adolescents who report greater unsupervisedtime are no more likely to initiate sex early,intend to have sex, engage in unprotectedsex, or report having sexually transmitted in-fections than those reporting permission forfewer unsupervised opportunities. Reports by adolescents of higher perceivedparental trust are associated with a lowerprevalence of sexual activity and intentions tohave sex, fewer reports of sexually transmit-ted infections, higher rates of consistent con-dom use, and lower use of tobacco, alcohol,and marijuana. Parental practices, in order to be optimallyeffective, will need to adjust and evolve asadolescents transition from one developmen-tal stage into the next, as parents acknowl-edge and accommodate the numerouschanges and emerging needs that character-ize this passage and natural growth process. There is a direct relationship between harshparenting (insulting, rejecting, constant quar-The Resiliency Theory seeks to understand how children, adolescents, and adults thrive despite adverse conditions such as extreme poverty, parental mental ill-ness, abuse, and/or catastrophic events (Infante 2001). Much of resilience re- search focuses on the personality traits, coping skills, and support systems that help in-dividuals endure, survive, and even thrive in challenging environments. For more than two decades, a number of educational researchers have been probing the issues surrounding youth and resiliency. One of the most influential works is a classicstudy conducted by Werner and Smith (1992). Over a 32-year period, they studied 505 at-risk children born in Hawaii under adverse circumstances, including chronic poverty. Bythe time the study participants reached their mid-30s, almost all had become construc-tively motivated and responsible adults. Only a small percentage of the original group didnot effectively \"bounce back\" from their adverse conditions. A distinguishing factorshared by each resilient child was a long-term, close relationship with a caring, respon-sible parent or other adult. The International Resilience Project defines resilience as a universal capacity, which al- lows a person, group, or community to prevent, minimize, and overcome the damagingaffects of adversity (Grothberg 1995). The Project, sponsored by the Civitan Interna-tional Research Center at the University of Alabama, was developed to examineresilience-promoting behavior in many nations around the world. Its scope of work in-cludes gaining a better understanding of the specific actions taken by parents or other[Chapter Nineteen ] The Resiliency Theory caregivers and children themselves that seem to promote resilience, with a focuson children up to age 12, as well as how thepromotion of resilience may vary accord-ing to the child's age and gender, and whatare the cultural and ethnic similarities anddifferences in the promotion of resiliencein children. The Project's Advisory Com-mittee is supported by an internationalcommunity which includes the United Na-tions Educational, Scientific, and CulturalOrganization; Pan American Health Orga-nization; and Bernardvan Leer Foundation. Resiliency theory proposes that although resilience is an emergent capacity presentto some degree in most people, its full de-velopment depends on the presence ofprotective factors during childhood. Ac-cording to Stanley Greenspan in his bookThe Growth of the Mind and the EndangeredOrigins of Intelligence , the mind's most im- portant faculties are rooted in emotionalexperiences from very early in life, whereaffect, behavior, and thought must be seenas inextricable components of intelligence(Greenspan 1997a). Specific protectivefactors have been identified repeatedly bydifferent studies of resilient children.These protective factors seem to fall intothree general categories: qualities of thechild, characteristics of the family, andsupport from outside the family involvingrelationships with friends and othermembers of the community (teachers,mentors, family social network). Groth-berg (1995) describes three sources having parents and other caregiverswho promote resilience through theirwords, actions, and the supportive envi-ronment they provide. The \"I Am\" sourcerefers to the inner qualities of the child(e.g., likeable, pleasing, witty, optimistic,respectful). The \"I Can\" source refers toskills or behavioral capabilities that helpthe child overcome adversity (e.g., verbal-izing emotions, solving problems, self-control, asking for help). Grothberg un-derscores that resilience results from acombination of these three sources. Com-bining Greenspan's and Grothberg's pos-tulates, children who have parents and other caregivers who help them to processearly emotional experiences and promote their intelligence so they can later integrate affect, behavior, and thought to overcome future adverse emotional experiences withtheir inner personal qualities develop resiliency. In her literature review, Infante proposes that resilience is not only a personal traitbut rather a process of positive adaptation despite adversity, which requires the par-ticipation of a variety of actors in order tobe optimally achieved. This process occursas a result of the characteristics and dy-namic transactions among the individual,the family, the community, and the cul-ture. Greenspan, like Infante, also consid-ers that resiliency is not an attribute of thechild alone but a product of the relation-ships the child has with his or her care- YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINETEEN | 169YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 170givers and how well these relationships can mesh with the child's unique develop-mental profile. He argues that merelylooking at poverty and children who sur-vive these precarious conditions, or look-ing at disruptive families and children whosurvive in those settings, fails to reveal thetrue essence of resiliency. \"This,\" hewrites, \"comes only from a closer under-standing of the nature of the particular re-lationships children have in these differ-ent settings\" (Greenspan 2002). Infanteincludes among these not only the child-caregiver relationships, but also the ongo-ing interactions with neighbors, the com-munity, and surrounding culture. Sheproposes that the most effective strategieswill be those that foster resilience at dif-ferent levels: political, institutional, com-munity, family, and individual (Infante2001). Chapter Four of this book reviewsthese multiple levels of influence and theirimpact on health-related behaviors andconditions. Greenspan also proposes that true re- silience means much more than succeed-ing in family life, academically, or career-wise in the face of adversity. He argues thatpositive adaptation includes the ability toenter fully into life's opportunities andmeet its challenges without compromisingany essential aspects of our humanity, par-ticularly the capacity to empathize and ex-perience intimate, warm relationshipswith a partner and/or children. He consid-ers that an individual is fully resilientwhen he or she is able to retain a full rangeof feelings and abilities in the midst ofhardship. \"Genuine resilience allows a person to grow and use the sorrows orfrustrations to become a fuller, deeper,and more humane person in the future\"(Greenspan 2002) . Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Resiliency Theoryto Adolescent Lifestyles Between September 1993 and August 1996, the International Resilience Re-search Project collected data from parentsand children up to age 12, including agroup of preadolescents 9-12 years old,from 27 sites in 22 countries around theworld. The data analysis indicated thatabout one-third of the parents studied arepromoting the development of resiliencein their preadolescents. An unexpectedfinding was that socioeconomic status didnot have a significant impact on parentalefforts to promote resilience. Resiliencewas promoted with equal frequency amongpreadolescents living in lower incomefamilies as in those living in higher in-come families. The only difference wasthat parents of preadolescents from higherincome families provided a greater num-ber of protective factors, a finding that isconsistent with results from a develop-mental assets study conducted by theSearch Institute, which will be describedin the next paragraph. The InternationalResilience Research Project also foundthat resilience was promoted in preado-lescents who were considered less intelli-gent or even intellectually impaired, par-ticularly when their parents helped themto learn how to reach out for help whenYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER NINETEEN | 171faced with difficulties or when in need of help (International Resilience ResearchProject 2004). The Search Institute is an independent nonprofit organization based in Min-neapolis, Minnesota, whose mission is toprovide leadership, knowledge, and re-sources to promote healthy children, ado-lescents, and communities. Guided by theResiliency Theory, it has surveyed over2,000,000 young people in Canada andthe United States since 1989 and has iden-tified the presence of a series of powerfuldevelopmental assets that positively affectadolescent behavior by protecting youngpeople from harmful and unhealthy be-haviors, on the one hand, and by promot-ing positive attitudes and behaviors on theother. To illustrate the power of these as-sets, the Institute surveyed 217,277 sixth-to-twelfth-grade adolescents in 33 statesand 318 communities across the UnitedStates during the 1999-2000 school year.The results showed that youth with themost assets were least likely to engage infour different patterns of high-risk behav-ior: problematic alcohol use, illicit drug use, sexual activity, and violence. A similarimpact was noted with other problem be-haviors, including tobacco use, depressionand attempted suicide, antisocial behav-ior, school problems, driving and alcohol,and gambling (Search Institute 2004).Table 19-1. illustrates the inverse correla- tion between the number of assets pos-sessed by students and the likelihood oftheir participation in high-risk behaviors. In this same study, it was found that in ad- dition to protecting youth from negativebehaviors, having more assets increasesthe chances that young people will havepositive attitudes and behaviors. A posi-tive correlation between the number of as-sets and success in school, good health,and ability to delay gratification was alsofound. The need to develop and nurture these assets during the critical adolescentyears clearly suggests a number of impor-tant roles families, schools, congrega-tions, neighborhoods, youth organiza-tions, and others in the community mayplay in shaping young people's lives.

This framework identifies 40 critical factors foryoung people's growth and development,which are divided into 20 external assetsand 20 internal assets. 1 The external assets focus on positive expe- riences that young people receive frompeople and institutions in their lives. Fourcategories of external assets are includedin the framework: support (six assets): includes family sup- port and love, positive family communi-cation, three or more nonparental adultrelationships, a caring neighborhood, acaring school climate, and parental in-volvement in schooling. empowerment (four assets): includes the young person's perception that adults inthe community value youth; providethem with useful roles to play in thecommunity; make adolescents feel safeat home, at school, and in the neighbor-hood; and encourage youth to partici-pate in community service initiativesfor one or more hours per week. boundaries and expectations (six assets): includes family, school, and neighbor-hood rules, monitoring, and conse-quences (three assets); parental and other adult role models for positive, re-sponsible behavior; positive peer influ-ence from best friends; and high expec-tations from parents and teachers to dowell. constructive use of time (four assets): in- cludes spending three or more hoursper week on lessons or practice inmusic, theater, and/or other creativeactivities; an equal number of hoursparticipating in sports, clubs, school, orcommunity organizations; one or morehours per week in activities in a reli-gious institution; and two or fewernights per week \"hanging out\" withfriends with no set plans. The Developmental Assets Framework considers that a community's responsibil-ity towards its adolescents does not endwith the provision of external assets, butrather emphasizes the need for a similarcommitment to nurturing internal quali-ties that guide choices and create a sense ofcenteredness, purpose, and focus. Fourcategories of internal assets are included in the framework: commitment to learning (five assets): in- cludes the motivation to achieve, activeschool engagement, doing at least onehour of homework every school day,caring about one's school, and readingfor pleasure three or more hours per week. positive values (six assets): includes placing high value on caring about andhelping others and on promoting equal-1Framework category descriptions adapted by Ce- cilia Breinbauer and Matilde Maddaleno with per-mission from the Search Institute, Minneapolis,Minnesota.

The Search Institute suggests that while there is no \"magic number\" of assetsyoung people should possess, the dataindicate that achieving 31 out of 40 \"is aworthy, though challenging, benchmarkfor experiencing their positive effects most strongly.\" Yet, according to the1999- 2000 study, only 9% of U.S. youthexperienced this level of assets, and morethan half have 20 or fewer assets, as seenin Table 19-2. These statistics, as well as the role assets play in predicting both positive and nega-tive outcomes for youth, underscore the importance of the Developmental AssetsFramework and the application of its prin- ciples in families, schools, and other keycommunity settings for the purpose of\"asset-building,\" the Search Institute'sterm for purposefully helping youth ac-quire more assets in their daily lives. The powerful and positive influence of asset-building has been demonstratedacross cultural and socioeconomic groupsof youth. A number of promising pro- grams have helped Mexican adolescentimmigrants living in the United States toincrease their resiliency (Chavkin andGonz\u00e1lez 2000). One example is the Ad-vancement via Individual Determination(AVID) in San Diego, California, whichplaced students from low-income, ethnic,and linguistic minority backgrounds incollege preparation classes along withhigh-achieving peers. The project re-sulted in higher college enrollment com-pared with the school district and nationalaverages (Mehan, Villanueva, and Lintz1996).

Zimmerman et al.(2002), using the Resiliency Theoryframework, explored the presence androle of natural mentors in the lives of 770U.S. adolescents. Fifty-two percent re-ported having a natural mentor. Thosewith natural mentors were less likely tosmoke marijuana or be involved in nonvi-olent delinquency and had more positiveattitudes toward school. Stronski and colleagues (2000), utilizing the Resiliency Theory, identified protec-tive factors that discouraged Swiss adoles-cents from progressing from marijuanause to that of other illicit drugs. The statis-tically significant factors included com-municating well with parents, academicachievement, being able to confide in afamily member, and regular participationin a sports facility. In the United States,Resnick et al. (1997) had previously foundamong 12,118 middle and adolescentsthat parent-family connectedness andperceived were pro- tective measures against every health riskbehavior except teen pregnancy. \"Conceptually, the work on resilience sug- gests that we need to move positive goalsfront and center,\" observes Ann S. Mas-ten, Director of the University of Min-nesota's Institute of Child Development.\"Promoting healthy development andcompetence is as important, if not moreimportant, than preventing problems, andwill serve the same end .As a society, we will do well to nurture human capital\u2014toinvest in the competence of our children.This means understanding how the capac-ity for academic achievement, rule-abiding behavior, and good citizenshipdevelops. It is important to identify risksand prevent them whenever possible, butit is also important to identify assets andprotective systems, and support these tothe best of our knowledge\" (Masten 2000).

Summary of the Resiliency Theory and Adolescent Lifestyles Having more assets increases the chances that young people will have positive attitudesand behaviors. External developmental assets (20) aredivided into four main categories: support empowerment boundaries and expectations constructive use of time Internal developmental assets (20) are divided into four main categories as well: commitment to learning positive values social competencies positive identity The powerful and positive influence of asset-building has been demonstrated across cul-tural and socioeconomic groups of youth. Having a natural mentor, communicating wellwith parents, being able to confide in a familymember, parent-family connectedness, andperceived school connectedness are all pro-tective measures against the adoption byyouth of risky health behaviors.International analysis indicates that approxi-mately one-third of parents promote resiliencein their preadolescent children. Socioeconomic status does not appear tohave a significant impact on the promotion ofresilience among preadolescents. Instead, itis promoted with the same frequency in lowerincome families as in those with higher in-come levels. However, parents of preadolescents fromhigher income families provide a greaternumber of protective factors. The Search Institute has identified thepresence of a series of powerful develop-mental assets (40) that positively affectadolescent behavior by protecting youngpeople from harmful and unhealthy behav-iors, on the one hand, and by promotingpositive attitudes and behaviors on the other. Youth with the most assets are least likely to engage in four different patterns of high-riskbehavior: problematic alcohol use, illicit druguse, sexual activity, and violence.NUMBER OF ARTICLES NUMBER OF ARTICLES ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORS USING THE RT BY KEYWORDSTable 19-3.

An understanding of the origins of stress and coping is es-sential to health promotion, in the sense that the presence of stress can trigger health-compromising behaviors (e.g., poor eating habits, insufficient sleep, depression,smoking, alcohol abuse), and the development of healthy coping mechanisms can pre-vent the initiation of these behaviors or counteract or reverse their harmful effects. Stress is an unpleasant state of arousal that occurs when people perceive that an event or condition threatens their ability to effectively and comfortably cope with the situation(Smith and Carlson 1997, Lazarus and Folkman 1984). A moderate level of stress may bebeneficial and is to be expected in many situations in life. But as people begin to feeloverwhelmed by the demands placed on them, their moods become negative and they ex-perience more stress than they can handle, which threatens their mental, physical, andemotional well-being. The variation of the effect that the same stressor can have on dif-ferent people depends on a variety of factors, including how the person perceives the stressful event, if the stressor is accompanied by other stressors, the individual's toler-ance for stress, and his or her personal beliefs about the resources he or she possesses tocope with the stressor. Adolescence is a particularly stressful period of life for several reasons (Kaplan 2004). Adolescents are required to adapt to a series of normative changes and increased ex-pectations to act in a more mature manner. They also develop more self-consciousness[Chapter Twenty ] The Stress and Coping Theoriesand devote more time to judging them- selves and evaluating how others seethem. This process is usually based on theverbal and nonverbal reinforcements theyperceive from others (peers, parents,teachers), in which girls are particularlyalert to facial expressions that communi-cate emotions (e.g., angry look fromfriend or teacher). It also marks the firsttime for several experiences related tochanges in the body (e.g., wearing a bra, using deodorant, menstruation, wetdreams), social changes (e.g., first flirtingexperiences and first dates), and in-creased behavioral autonomy (e.g., stay-ing at home alone, using public trans-portation on one's own). A stressor , the source of stress, is an envi- ronmental event or stimulus that threat-ens an organism and that leads to a copingresponse, which is any response made byan organism to avoid, escape from, orminimize an aversive stimulus (Gazzanigaand Heatherton 2003). Stressors usuallyare divided into two categories: major life stressors : changes or disrup- tions that affect aspects of great impor-tance in one's life (e.g., severe illness ordeath of someone close; moving to a newschool, neighborhood, city, or country;parental divorce; chronically stressfulconditions such as poverty, disablingillness, family conflict, physical and/orsexual abuse); and daily hassles : small day-to-day frustra- tions and irritations (e.g., dealing withunfair or unpleasant teachers, schoolexaminations, being teased by friends, arguments with siblings and parents). Research shows that unpredictable and un- controllable catastrophic events (e.g.,earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, civil un-rest, urban crime and violence, terrorist at-tack) are especially stressful. Life changesof any type are stressful in and of them- selves, and the greater the number ofchanges, the more intensely the individualwill likely feel stress. The effect of day-to-day hassles, if a large number of them pres-ent themselves simultaneously, can becomparable to those of major life changes.Although people seem to adjust to dailyproblems over time, interpersonal difficul-ties appear to have a cumulative effect onhealth (Gazzaniga and Heatherton 2003). Adolescents most often report daily has- sles as their most stressful event, particu-larly those involving parents and teachers.Nearly half of all U.S. adolescents reportdifficulty in coping with stressful situa-tions at home and/or at school (Gans1990). School-related stressors includeexaminations, and health problems, general con-flict with parents, conflict between par-ents, and parental divorce, which are allreported as being very stressful (Fore-hand, Biggar, and Kotchic 1998). As early as 1932, Walter Cannon described the fight-or-flight response as both an ani- YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY | 177YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 178mal and a human reaction to stress, which causes the person to either confront andcombat danger or flee rapidly from it(Cannon 1932). Shelley Taylor and her col-leagues (2000) have suggested, however,that the fight-or-flight response is moretypical for men, whereas females often re-spond to stress in a tend-and-befriend pat- tern, by protecting and caring for theiroffspring, as well as by forming alliances with social groups to reduce individualrisk. Taylor and colleagues further notethat women under stress seek out socialsupport, particularly from other women,and that they remain more connected totheir social networks than men do undersimilar circumstances. How the stressor is perceived and inter- preted ( cognitive appraisal ) affects the process of coping with the stimulus orevent. Lazarus (1993) described a two-stepappraisal process when a person is con-fronted with a stressful situation: primary appraisal : The person evaluates how stressful the situation is and thepotential threat or harm of the event. Ifthe person considers the stimulusstressful enough, the next step is a secondary appraisal : The person evalu- ates his or her ability to alter the situa-tion, manage negative emotional reac-tions, evaluate response options, andchoose coping behaviors. In the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Folkman and Moskowitz 2000,Lazarus and Folkman 1984), stressful experiences are construed as person-environment transactions wherein the im- pact of an external stressor, or demand, ismediated by the person's appraisal of thestressor and the psychological, social, andcultural resources at his or her disposal.Two basic primary appraisals are percep- tions of susceptibility to the threat and per- ceptions of severity of the threat. According to the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, appraisals of personalrisk and threat severity prompt efforts tocope with the stressor. However, height-ened perceptions of risk can also generatedistress and prompt escape-avoidance be-haviors to minimize the significance of thethreat. Beliefs of invulnerability, on theother hand, enhance perceived controland active coping, as well as reduce dis-tress. This is often the case for many ado-lescents. Minimizing appraisals may di-minish motivation to adopt recommendedpreventive health behaviors. Smokers, forexample, are significantly more likely thannonsmokers to perceive themselves as lesspersonally susceptible to the health effectsof smoking (Chapman, Wong, and Smith 1993). Other primary appraisals that have been described (Smith and Lazarus 1993, Smithet al. 1993) are motivational relevance of the stressor (i.e., when the stressor is consid-ered to have a major impact on a person'sgoal or concerns, that person is likely toexperience anxiety and situation-specificYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY | 179stress) and causal focus of the stressor (e.g., when perceiving oneself as being re-sponsible for the stressor). The primary appraisal, in the life of a typ- ical adolescent, is heavily influenced byemotions. Emotion (or affect ) refers to feelings that involve subjective evalua-tion, physiological processes, and cogni-tive beliefs. Emotions are immediate re-sponses to environmental events, such asreceiving a poor grade or having a familyargument (Gazzaniga and Heatherton2003). Emotions also provide informa-tion about the importance of stimuli topersonal goals and then prepare the indi-vidual to take actions aimed at achievingthose goals (Frijda 1994). Adolescents aremore affected by their own emotional re-actions in the presence of daily stressors(e.g., feelings of hurt when teased, angerwhen insulted) than by the perceived sus-ceptibility or severity of a health threat orrisky situation. Emotions are part of thedaily interpersonal dynamics in whichadolescents are immersed, and emotionalexpressions are powerful nonverbal com-munications. For example, Gazzaniga andHeatherton (2003) found that, in terms offacial expressions, the lower half of theface, and particularly the mouth (e.g.,smile), has been identified as more im-portant than the upper half of the face(eyes) in communicating emotion, espe-cially for positive affect. This findingcould be of significant relevance to par-ents and teachers as a mechanism theycan use (e.g., a daily smile) to help adoles-cents buffer daily hassles at school and home, in full awareness of the positiveimpact this gesture in particular has onyoung people. Secondary appraisal is an assessment of a person's coping resources and options. Incontrast to primary appraisals that focuson the features of the stressful situation,secondary appraisals address what one cando about the situation. Key examples ofsecondary appraisals are: perceived ability to change the situation(perceived control over the threat) perceived ability to manage one's emo-tional reactions to the threat (perceived control over feelings) expectations about the effectiveness of one'scoping resources (coping self-efficacy) Sturges and Rogers (1996) found that among adolescents and youth, the threatappeals of some health education inter-ventions worked only if the people be-lieved they could cope effectively with thedanger; if they believed they could notcope, higher levels of the threat resulted indecreased intentions to refrain from, inthis case, tobacco use. Although adoles-cents elaborated and integrated the infor-mation about threat severity, personal vul-nerability, and response efficacy, thefragility and malleability of the adoles-cents' beliefs in self-efficacy demon-strated the importance of adding a devel-opmental perspective to theories ofpreventive health psychology. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 180The secondary appraisal, in the life of an adolescent, is also heavily influenced byemotions. According to Slovic and col-leagues (2002), emotions serve as heuris-tic guides providing feedback for makingquick decisions when confronted withcomplex, multifaceted situations. Thejudgment concerning risky situations issignificantly affected by the emotions ex-perienced at the moment of decision-making, given that emotions usually havemore impact than cognitions on rapidlymade decisions (Loewenstein et al. 2001). Folkman and Lazarus (1980) suggested that there are two general categories ofcoping efforts orcoping strategies: emotion-focused coping : These are strategies of coping with stress thatfocus on reducing the discomfort asso- ciated with stress (Kaplan 2004). Thiscategory includes efforts to prevent hav-ing an emotional response to the stres-sor or changing the way one feels about the stressful situation. Emotion-focused coping involves strategies such as seeking social support, the venting offeelings, use of avoidance techniques,attempting to minimize the problem'ssignificance, efforts to distance oneselffrom the problem's outcomes, overeat-ing and/or overdrinking, to even com-plete denial of the situation at hand(Gazzaniga and Heatherton 2003).Emotion-focused strategies will bemost adaptive when the stressor is un-changeable or when all problem-focused coping attempts have beenmade. The adoption of one or more of these strategies allows people to con-tinue performing in the face of stressorsthat are out of their control. problem-focused coping : These are strate- gies of coping with stress that involve ac-tively confronting the problem in an ef-fort to solve it (Kaplan 2004). This form of coping is directed at changing the stressful situation by taking steps to solvethe problem (e.g., seeking information,generating alternative solutions, evaluat-ing costs and benefits for each possiblesolution, and choosing a response).Problem-focused strategies will be mostadaptive for stressors that are perceivedas controllable and changeable. People usually use either one or the other of the above categories of coping re- sponses, depending on the situation.Emotion-based strategies, such as choos-ing to ignore a problem, are effective onlyin the short term (e.g., ignoring sibling ri-valry issues may work on individual occa-sions, but it will not improve relationsover time), whereas problem-focusedcoping is often effective in the long term.Some strategies, such as denial, are con-sidered to be maladaptive in both types ofsituations; Herman-Stahl and Petersen(1996) found that teens who respond toproblems with denial have worse outcomes(e.g., depression) than those who do notadopt this response. Although some emotion-focused strate- gies are proactive in terms of helping theperson to process the emotion that he orYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY | 181she feels when confronted with the stres- sor, (e.g., seeking social support, ventingfeelings with a friend) other emotion-focused strategies (e.g., avoidance, mini- mizing the problem's importance, effortsto distance oneself from the problem'soutcomes, denial) discourage the process-ing of emotions and have been describedby Carver and colleagues (1993) as dis- engaging coping strategies .In contrast, problem-focused coping strategies may beconsidered engaging coping strategies ,since these involve consciously facing the prob-lem and adopting active coping (e.g., de-veloping a plan for solving the stress-causing problem, seeking information andsocial support). Moos's model (Moos 1993), employed ex- tensively in health psychology, is particu-larly useful because it combines measure-ments of the focus of coping (emotion vs.problem) with the method of coping (cog-nitive vs. behavioral) in a relatively briefinstrument. Moos's division of coping into\"approach\" and \"avoidance\" categoriesclassifies behaviors and cognitions intothose which are used by the subject to facethe problem squarely (approach), andthose which divert the individual's atten-tion away from the problem (avoidance)(Steiner et al. 2002). Additional coping strategies have been by Folkman tion of a stressful event in a personallymeaningful way (e.g., the use of spiritu- ality and religious beliefs) positive reappraisal : a cognitive process that includes a positive reinterpretationand acceptance of a stressful event theindividual is facing by viewing its posi-tive aspects (e.g., comparing one's ownsituation with that of others in less for-tunate circumstances) creation of positive events : a strategy in which the individual infuses ordinaryevents with positive meaning, allowinghim or her to focus on the positive as-pects of life (e.g., enjoying a beautifulsunset, quality family time in the pres-ence of a serious injury or illness) In contrast to coping strategies or efforts, which will vary according to different situ-ations, coping styles are considered dispo- sitional; i.e., a stable, unchanging char-acteristic of each person, despite thepresence of a stressor. There has been in-terest in analyzing individual differencesin coping, particularly in studying peoplewho remain healthy even while enduringstressful life experiences. In this line ofresearch, two coping styles have beendescribed: hardiness (Kobasa 1979): a stress- resistant coping style characterized bythree main components a strong sense of meaningfulness and commitment to self and one's daily activities a vigorous attitude toward life inwhich threats are viewed as challenges or opportunities for growthYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 182an internal locus of control , in which individuals see themselves as beingin control of their lives dispositional optimism : an innate ten- dency to expect positive, rather thannegative, outcomes from stressful situa-tions. The description of dispositionaloptimism emerges from a new line ofresearch referred to as positive psychol- ogy, which studies how people develop and sustain positive features such as hope, courage, perseverance, andfuture-mindedness despite levels ofsignificant stress in their lives. Severalstudies have found positive associationsbetween possessing a sense of purposein life and life satisfaction, positivemood states, and well-being (Kwan etal. 2003, Ryff and Keyes 1995, Ryff et al.1994). Regardless of the existence of different coping strategies and styles, one of themost important factors enabling individu-als to deal effectively with stress is the levelof social support they receive. According to Cohen and Wills (1985), social support canhave a stress-buffering effect on well-being, in the sense that this support willhave a consistently stronger positive im-pact on adjustment as the stressors be-come more intense or persistent. Gaz-zaniga and Heatherton (2003) note that\"social support needs to imply that peoplecare about the recipient of the support,\"and emphasize that receiving emotionalsupport is much more important than thesimple provision of information to bufferstressful events. Coping outcomes , a per-son's adaptation to a stressor, may be ob- served through the person's emotionalwell-being, functional status, and health-related behaviors. Research and Practical Applications of the Theories of Stress and Copingto Adolescent Lifestyles Levels of stress tend to increase from preadolescence into later adolescence, thetime at which gender differences becomemore obvious. There is also evidence indi-cating that the transition into adolescencerepresents a period of particular vulnera-bility for girls (Rudolph 2002). In a varietyof studies, coping has been shown to make significant contributions to adolescentadjustment (Steiner et al. 2002). Prospec-tively, it has been related to good or poorhealth outcomes in depressed and chroni-cally ill youths (Moos 1993). According to Ann Masten (2001), adoles- cents develop and maintain skills that helpthem to deal with stress through hav-ing warm, nurturing relationships withothers. Within this context, an interestingquestion for future research might be toanalyze to what degree adolescents developresiliency by growing up with parents orcaregivers who themselves present healthycoping styles, such as hardiness and dis-positional optimism, in addition to hav-ing a nurturing relationship with theirchildren.

Secondary appraisals include: perceived ability to change the situation perceived ability to manage one's emo-tional reactions to the threat expectations about the effectiveness of one's coping resourcesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 184adjustment over time. They measured five stressors in a sample of adolescents 11 to 15years old: parental marital status, parentaldepressive mood, maternal physical healthproblems, maternal depressive mood, andmother-adolescent relationship problems.The adolescents in the study were followedfor six years, and then measures of depres- sion, conduct disorders, and academicprogress were obtained. The researchersfound that as the number of stressors in- creased, so did the adolescent's vulnerabil-ity to internalizing problems (e.g., depres-sion) and/or externalizing them (e.g.,conduct disorders) later on. An increasefrom three to four stressors led to a signifi-cant increase in problems six years later.The authors conclude that although someadolescents may initially handle stress ef-fectively, as the number of stressors in-crease, over time their resources begin tobecome depleted and the adolescents areless able to cope than they were earlier. Steiner et al. (2002) examined 1,769 non- clinical high school students (48% ofwhom were girls, mean age 16 years) to es-tablish a link between coping styles, healthproblems, and health risk behaviors. Thefindings showed that approach copingcorrelated negatively with indicators ofhealth problems and health risk behav-iors, while avoidance coping correlatedpositively with these domains. When bothforms of coping (approach coping and avoidance coping) were used on differentoccasions, the presence of approach cop-ing served to mitigate the negative effectsof using avoidance coping alone. The au-thors highlight the importance of giving special attention to youth who present ahigh preponderance of avoidance coping.They describe these adolescents as quiteelusive, as evidence suggests they do notcome to the attention of surveys, studies,or health care personnel readily and will-ingly. The authors also found that a certaintype of coping (i.e., high avoidance in thepresence of low approach coping) seems tobe associated with the highest health risksand risk-taking behaviors. Steiner et al.propose that this association of avoidancecoping in the face of adversity and a hightendency to take risks is compatible with apsychodynamic formulation of risk-takingas a form of acting out (i.e., action taken toavoid confronting painful realities andemotions). Studies of adolescent populations have found that smoking is positively related to indices of negative affect and life stress(Lloyd and Lucas 1998, Sussman et al.1993). Prospective studies have foundstress measures to be predictive of smok-ing onset and escalation (Sussman andDent 2000; Dugan, Lloyd, and Lucas1999). In a 1999 journal article, Parrotproposed conversely that cigarette smok-ing causes increases in stress. Wills, Sandy, and Yaeger (2002b) con- ducted a comparative test of both hypothe-ses: stress as an etiological factor forsmoking and cigarette smoking as a causeof increases in stress. Participants were a sample of 1,364 adolescents who were ini-tially surveyed at mean age 12.4 years andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY | 185received three yearly follow-ups. Mea- sures of negative affect, negative lifeevents, and cigarette smoking were ob-tained at all four assessments. Latentgrowth modeling showed negative affectwas related to an increase in smoking overtime. There was no path from initialsmoking to change in negative affect.Comparable results were found for nega-tive life events, with no evidence for re-verse causation. Relations between stressand smoking were comparable for boysand girls. The authors suggest that a pri-mary aim for prevention programs shouldbe to strengthen efforts toward the devel-opment of coping mechanisms and tobuild engagement in alternative sources ofreinforcement. Stress might explain also why low-income pregnant adolescent girls smoke. Lawson(1994) found that this population groupsmoked to cope with anxiety and depres-sion, particularly when rejected by theirfamilies and/or boyfriends. They also re-ported smoking to cope with weight gainduring pregnancy. Furthermore, the girlsreported fearing the pain of delivery andknew that smoking would help them to de-liver smaller infants, which in turn woulddecrease the duration of labor. Siqueira, Rolnitsky, and Rickert (2001) examined the relationship of nicotine de-pendence, stress, and coping methods be-tween U.S. inner-city adolescent smokersand quitters and, using the Transtheoreti-cal Model and Stages of Change, amongadjacent smoking cessation stages. Smok-ers were significantly more likely to report smoking additional cigarettes per day aswell as have higher levels of physical ad-diction, greater levels of perceived stress,and less use of cognitive coping methodsthan quitters. Comparison of consecutivestages revealed a significant differenceonly between pre-contemplation and con-templation in cognitive coping methods.Three out of 20 withdrawal symptoms(cravings, difficulty dealing with stress,and anger) were reported more frequentlyamong current smokers who had at-tempted to quit in the last six months thanamong former smokers. The authors sug-gest that interventions for inner-city ado-lescents who smoke should be designed totarget those with the highest levels of nico-tine dependence, stress, and decreaseduse of cognitive coping methods, since themembers of this group are the least likelyto quit on their own. Sussman et al. (1999) reviewed the effects of 34 adolescent tobacco use cessation and prevention trials on regular users of to-bacco products. The authors found thatamong cessation studies, an emphasis onthe immediate consequences of use andinstruction in the development andstrengthening of coping strategies led torelatively successful programs. Wills et al. (2001b) tested the relation of seven coping dimensions to substance use(tobacco, alcohol, marijuana) with a sam-ple of 1,668 U.S. early adolescents whowere assessed at a mean age of 12.5 yearsand received two annual follow-ups. AnYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 186associative latent-growth model showed one index of engagement ( behavioral cop- ing) to be inversely related to the initial level of adolescent use and growth overtime in peer use. Behavioral coping wasdefined as taking action to try to solve theproblem (getting information, thinkingabout the choices before making a deci-sion, considering which steps to take).Three indices of disengagement ( anger coping , helpless coping , and hangout coping ) were positively related to initial levels ofpeer use and adolescent use and to growthin adolescent use. Anger coping was de-fined as becoming angry at and criticizingother people because of the problem;helpless coping as giving up on trying tosolve the problem; and hangout coping aschoosing to socialize with friends insteadof confronting the problem. Life stress was positively related to initial levels for peeruse and adolescent use and to growth inadolescent use. Moderation tests indicatedthat the effects of coping were significantlygreater at a higher level of stress, while be-havioral coping buffered the effects of dis-engagement. The effects of life stress weregreater for girls than for boys. Wills and Cleary (1996) examined how the effect of parental emotional and instru-mental support on substance use (tobacco,alcohol, and marijuana) in adolescents ismediated. Data were from a sample of1,702 adolescents in the United States whowere surveyed between the seventh andninth grades. Structural modeling analy-ses indicated the effect of support was me-diated through more behavioral copingand academic competence and less toler- ance for deviance and lack ofcontrol. Multiple-group analyses sug-gested buffering effects occurred becausehigh support reduced the effect of risk fac-tors and increased the effect of protectivefactors. Laniado-Laborin, Molgaard, and Elder (1993) demonstrated that a program em-phasizing training to cope with the socialpressures of cigarette smoking was effec-tive in preventing initial experimentationamong sixth graders in Tijuana, Mexico.Although not intended for this purpose,the program was also effective in helpingadolescent smokers to quit smoking. Theproportion of adolescents in the interven-tion group that quit smoking was signifi-cantly higher (72% vs. 35%) compared tothe control group that was not affected bythe coping skills training intervention. Shimai et al. (2000) studied the relation- ship between snacking behavior and stresscoping among elementary and junior highschool students in Japan and found a closerelationship. The authors suggest that be-havioral interventions to encouragehealthy eating habits should be included inthe development of stress-coping skillsagainst various kinds of life demands.Norris, Carrol, and Cochrane (1992) ex-amined the effects of physical activity onpsychological stress and well-being in anadolescent population. The analysis re-vealed that those who reported greaterphysical activity also reported less stressand lower levels of depression.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY | 187The process of moving to a new country, adapting to a new culture, and learning tointegrate one's own culture with a new onecan be a major stressor in the lives of an in-creasing number of adolescents migratingfor better opportunities. Infante (2003) de- scribes the resilience factors that helpLatino adolescents to cope successfullywhen immigrating to the United States.These include having parents with a strongsense of responsibility, optimism, auton-omy, and the confidence that they can cre-ate positive change by giving hope and op-portunities to their sons and daughters;adolescents with strong social skills en-abling them to express their feelings, tohave others find them likeable, and to es-tablish strong relationships with serviceproviders; a strong relationship within thefamily; and maintaining a strong culturalattachment and identification with theLatino community even as the adolescentlearns more about the values of the domi-nant culture. Stress and coping has been vastly re- searched for adolescent behaviors relatedto tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, but very poorly linked to violent and sexual health-related behaviors and physical activity andnutrition in adolescents. Literature re-views indicate that stress and coping theo-ries seem to be among the most crucialtheories to utilize when planning, imple-menting, and monitoring health promo-tion interventions for adolescents. Thetheoretical framework helps to foster animportant developmental task of pre- andearly adolescence, which is the develop-ment of healthy coping styles to deal withlife's minor day-to-day stressful events.The evidence also shows that most of the adolescent lifestyle decisions (to-bacco, alcohol, and drug use; physical ac-tivity and nutrition; sexual practices; anger expression) are at least partly in-fluenced by the anxieties surrounding male-female interactions and masculine-feminine expectations, although not al-ways significantly.

Summary of Stress and Coping Theories and Adolescent Lifestyles Adolescents develop and maintain skills that help them to deal with stress through havingwarm, nurturing relationships with others. As the number of stressors increase, so doesthe adolescent's vulnerability to internalizingproblems (e.g., depression) and/or externaliz-ing them (e.g., conduct disorders). High avoidance in the presence of low approach coping seems to be associatedwith the highest health risks and risk-takingbehaviors among adolescents. Smoking among adolescents is positivelyrelated to indices of negative affect and lifestress. Stress measures are predictive ofsmoking onset and escalation among thisgroup. Low-income pregnant adolescent girls smoketo cope with anxiety and depression, particu-larly when rejected by their families and/orboyfriends, and to cope with weight gain dur-ing pregnancy. Adolescent smokers are significantly morelikely to report smoking additional cigarettesper day as well as have higher levels of phys-ical addiction, greater levels of perceivedstress, and less use of cognitive copingmethods than quitters. Life stress is positively related to initial levelsfor peer and adolescent use of tobacco,alcohol, and marijuana and to growth in useover time. Training to cope with the social pressures of cigarette smoking has been shown to beeffective in preventing initial experimentationamong Mexican adolescents. A close relationship between snacking be-havior and stress coping has been shown forelementary and junior high school students. Physical activity is associated with lowerlevels of stress and depression amongadolescents.Levels of stress tend to increase from pre-adolescence into the later periods of adoles-cence, particularly among girls. Nearly half of all U.S. adolescents reportdifficulty in coping with stressful situations athome or at school (daily hassles). School-related stressors include being teasedby friends, examinations and grades, dealingwith unfair or unpleasant teachers, and feel-ing rushed. Home-related stressors include parental orsibling health problems, general conflict withparents, conflict between parents, parentaldivorce, and arguments with siblings. Primary appraisal (evaluating how stressful a situation is) is heavily influenced by emotionsamong adolescents. Adolescents are more affected by their ownemotional reactions in the presence of dailystressors (e.g., feeling hurt when teased,angry when insulted) than by the perceivedsusceptibility or severity of a health threat orrisky situation. Emotions are part of the daily interpersonaldynamics in which adolescents are im-mersed, and emotional expressions are pow-erful nonverbal communications. Secondary appraisal (deciding what to do in the presence of a stressful event) is alsoheavily influenced by emotions amongadolescents. The judgment concerning risky situations issignificantly affected by the emotionsexperienced at the moment of decision-making, given that emotions usually havemore impact than cognitions on rapidly madedecisions. Adolescents who use denial to respond toproblems have worse outcomes (e.g., de-pression) than those who do not respond this way.Of all the theories and models reviewed in Chapters Sixteen through Twenty to promote change at the interpersonal level, the Social Networks and SocialSupport Theories (Chapter Seventeen) have been the most utilized to address adolescent behaviors, particularly those involving sexual and reproductive health, aswell as the promotion of physical activity and healthy nutrition. Interestingly, tobacco,alcohol, and drug prevention efforts have relied more on the Stress and Coping Theo-ries to explain underlying factors and have used the Social Cognitive Theory to promotehealthy behaviors. On the other hand, comparatively little research has been conductedon adolescent sexual and reproductive health utilizing the Stress and Coping Theories,compared to their application to studies of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, even thoughthe two classifications are intimately related as risky behaviors, particularly the link be-tween alcohol use and unprotected sexual activity. Finally, while there have been a fewefforts to understand aggressive behaviors at the individual level, violence among ado-lescents, either as perpetrators or as victims, has been much more studied at the inter-personal level, particularly within the framework of different parenting practices and the influence of social networks and social support, as well as from the resiliencyperspective. Table 21-1. illustrates these ideas and summarizes the number of studies using the theories and models discussed in Chapters Sixteen through Twenty according to healthbehaviors.[Chapter Twenty-one ] At a Glance: The Interpersonal Level Theories and Models forBehavior ChangeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE | 191Table 21-2. presents a comparison of the total number of research articles on ado-lescent behaviors utilizing individual andinterpersonal level theories and models.An interesting observation that emergesfrom this comparison is that tobacco, al-cohol, and drug use behaviors have beenby far more researched than the other re-viewed behaviors, both at the individual level as well as at the interpersonal level.

Interpersonal Level Theories and Models and Their Application to Adolescent Behavioral Change: A Comparison of Conceptual Frameworks, Applications, and Benefits Theory/Model Conceptual Framework Application Benefits Social Cognitive Theory(Chapter Sixteen) Social Networks and Social Support Theories (Chapter Seventeen)This theory encompasses both determinants of behavior and the methods of promoting be-havior change. The theory ex-plains behavior as a triadic,dynamic, and reciprocal model in which socio-environmental,personal or cognitive, and be-havioral factors all interact. Itsthree main principles are that:(1) behavior is influenced byboth socio-environmental andpersonal factors; (2) socio-environmental factors play a sig-nificant role in the onset of be-haviors, but their influence ismediated via personal cognitions;and (3) behavior is not only influ-enced by socio-environmentaland personal factors, but also, inturn, influences these factors(called reciprocal determinism ). The theory also describes keyconstructs that help in promotingthe adoption of a new behavior,including observational learning,reinforcements, outcome expec-tations and expectancies, self-efficacy, behavioral capability,mastery learning, and self-control of performance. Personal social networks are es- sential for receiving social sup-port, which ranges from emo-tional support (love, caring,empathy) to the provision of aidor a service; information, advice,or and input that isuseful for self-evaluation pur-poses (constructive feedback,The Social Cognitive Theory has been identified as the underlyingtheoretical framework for manyadolescent health promotion andprevention programs, probablybecause of its consideration ofsocio-environmental factors af-fecting individual behaviors.However, one of the drawbacksof such a broad theoretical for-mulation (environmental, per-sonal, and behavioral factors) isthat program designers mightfeel pressured to explain almostany phenomenon using one ormore of the constructs without acomplete understanding of howthey operate separately and to-gether. At the same time, thereis considerable conceptual con-fusion about how to apply,measure, and analyze these con-structs. Keeping this precautionin mind, the application of thistheory to promote the adoptionof health behaviors and the pre-vention of risk behaviors amongadolescents has been success-ful, particularly among behaviorsrelated to tobacco, alcohol, anddrug use, and, more recently, toincreased condom use. The Social Networks and Social Support Theories have been ap-plied to guide the design ofhealth promotion and preventionprograms for adolescents. How-ever, most of the research hasbeen related specifically toparental support or the influencethat peers can have on adoles-This theory provides a particularly useful framework for understand-ing and describing the potentialimpact of the social environmenton health behaviors among ado-lescents. The theory is also help-ing health promotion plannersand project developers to moveaway from the mere provision ofinformation to adolescents. Thistheory emphasizes the impor-tance of teaching adolescentsthe necessary skills to performnew behaviors through effectiverole models and increasing theirself-efficacy and behavioral capa-bility. It additionally has raisedawareness regarding the signifi-cant impact that negative rolemodels and messages in themedia can have, through obser-vational learning, on the adoptionby adolescents of health-compromising behaviors (e.g.,violence; unsafe sex practices;tobacco, alcohol, and drug use).It is important, however, to com-bine this theory with others at theinterpersonal and community lev-els, since evidence shows thatskills training alone is likely to nothave sustainable positive resultsin the long term if interventionsonly target adolescents and nottheir surroundings (e.g., peers,parents, community at large). The beneficial and protective health effects of supportive socialnetworks may be cultivated in anycommunity, where a variety ofhuman resources most likely al-ready exist. Understanding peernetworks within a community canbe very helpful in the design andimplementation of health promo-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE | 193Table 21-3.

Social networksand social support are critical tothe health and well-being of ado-lescents within the communitywhere they live. Parenting approaches have been classified as authoritative, author-itarian, permissive, and unin-volved, and analyzed along thedimension of each's demanding-ness and responsiveness. Amodel which enables the quantifi-cation of these two dimensionshas been developed (Maccobyand Martin 1983), and studieshave demonstrated a positive re-lationship between parental de-mandingness and adolescentbehavioral adjustment, as well asbetween parental responsivenessand adolescent psychosocial de-velopment. The main compo-nents of authoritative parentingare warmth, structure, and au-tonomy and development sup-port. Growing evidence shows in-verse relationships betweeneffective (authoritative) parentingand health-risk behaviors amongchildren and adolescents. This theory seeks to understand how children and adolescentsthrive despite adverse conditionssuch as extreme poverty,parental mental illness, abuse,and/or catastrophic events.Much of resilience researchcent behaviors, and much less attention has been focused oncreating and strengthening pro-tective social networks for ado-lescents and tailoring these tothe adolescent's changing devel-opmental needs and wants andincluding a gender perspective. Research using this model has been conducted with ethnicallydiverse adolescent populationsand to study the effects ofpoverty on adolescent adjust-ment and development. The re-lationship between tobacco, alcohol,and use; violence schooldelinquency; and teen driving areamong the specific adolescentbehaviors that have been studiedto date. Studies of resilient children have identified specific protective fac-tors falling under three generalcategories: qualities of the child,characteristics of the family, andsupport from outside the family.Resilience appears to result fromtion and prevention programs for adolescents of different ages andgender. Strengthening adult sup-portive networks in the communitycan also play a major role, notonly for adolescents but also fortheir parents during the process ofaccommodating their parentingskills to new and constantlychanging developmental needs oftheir sons and daughters and thechallenges these changes bring. This model holds particular rele- vance for health promotion andprevention program designers inLatin America and the Caribbean,where nearly half of the adoles-cent population lives at or belowthe poverty line. A model hasbeen developed (Conger et al.1994, 1993) to explain how eco-nomic stress and poverty mayadversely affect adolescent de-velopment and behaviors by af-fecting parental emotional toneand parenting skills. The resultsof numerous studies related toadolescent health, parentingstyles, and poverty are providinginsight into how the design ofprotective interventions can facili-tate the adoption and mainte-nance of healthy behaviors andlifestyles despite the difficultsocio-environmental circum-stances and challenges theseyoung people face. This theory utilizes a strengths- based (vs. deficits-based) ap-proach to identify protective fac-tors and focuses on youths'potential contribution to societyinstead of viewing this group as asocial problem and burden. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 194Table 21-3. Interpersonal Level Theories and Models and Their Application to Adolescent Behavioral Change: A Comparison of Conceptual Frameworks, Applications, and Benefits \u2014(continued) Theory/Model Conceptual Framework Application Benefits Resiliency Theory (continued ) Stress and Coping Theories(Chapter Twenty)focuses on the personality traits, coping skills, and support sys-tems that help individuals en-dure, survive in, and overcomechallenging circumstances. Thetheory proposes that althoughresilience is an emergent capac-ity present to some degree inmost people, its full developmentdepends on the presence of pro-tective factors during childhoodand adolescence. An understanding of the origins of stress and coping is essentialto health promotion, in the sensethat the presence of stress cantrigger health-compromising be-haviors, and the development ofcoping mechanisms can preventthe initiation of these behaviorsor counteract or reverse theirharmful effects. Coping may beclassified by the focus of thecoping strategy (emotion vs.problem) or the method of coping(cognitive vs. behavioral). Copingmechanisms may further be di-vided into approach andavoid- ance categories, with coping be- haviors and cognitions beingclassified into those which areused by the subject to face theproblem squarely (approach), andthose which divert the individual'sattention away from the problem(avoidance).a combination of these three sources, reflecting the differentlevels of influence (individual, in-terpersonal, institutional, commu-nity) that may mutually reinforceone another and cause positiveimpact on health-related behav-iors and conditions. Based on theresults of a decade of develop-mental research, the Search In-stitute has identified 40 develop-mental assets for young people'sgrowth and development, whichare divided into 20 external as-sets and 20 internal assets. Re-search results show that youthwith most assets are least likelyto engage in four different pat-terns of high-risk behavior: prob-lematic alcohol use, illicit druguse, sexual activity, and violence. Stress and coping has been vastly researched for adolescentbehaviors related to tobacco,alcohol, and drug use, but verypoorly linked to sexual health-related behaviors and physicalactivity and nutrition inadolescents. The evidence shows that the majority of adolescent lifestyledecisions regarding the above-mentioned behaviors are at leastpartly influenced by the anxietiessurrounding male-female interac-tions and masculine-feminineexpectations.There is a growing body of evi- dence to indicate that taking astrengths-based approach bypromoting skills and assets as analternative to preventing deficitsis more effective in engagingand motivating adolescents todevelop healthy attitudes and be-haviors and grow into responsi-ble, caring adults. The powerfuland positive influence of asset-building has been demonstratedacross cultural and socioeco-nomic groups of youth. The Stress and Coping Theories are among the most crucial the-ories to use when planning, im-plementing, and monitoringhealth interventions for adoles-cents. The theoretical frameworkhelps to foster an important de-velopmental task of pre- andearly adolescence, which is togain practice and skill in the useof healthy coping mechanisms todeal with life's minor day-to-daystressful events.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |COMMUNITY LEVEL | 195Theories and Models that Promote Change at the Community Level Community level theories and models are essential for comprehensive health promotion efforts. Social norms, regulations, and policies are key factors to support the adoption ofhealth-promoting behaviors and to reduce or eliminate health-compromising rein-forcements in the social and physical environments. Community level theories and mod- els help us to better understand how social groups organize themselves to identify theirneeds and wants, to pinpoint the variety of possible and appropriate solutions to theidentified community problems, and to decide how best to promote social and environ-mental changes that make healthier choices easier choices to make. Community leveltheories and models are a meeting point for health education approaches and policy, eco-nomic, regulatory, and other environmental interventions. As Green and Kreuter (1999)note, \"health education provides the consciousness-raising, concern-arousing, action-stimulating impetus for public involvement and commitment to social reform essentialto its success in a democracy. Without health education, health promotion would be a ma-nipulative social engineering enterprise. Without the policy support for social change, onthe other hand, health education is often powerless to help people reach their healthgoals even with successful individual efforts.\" Health services, schools, recreational andsports facilities, community organizations, government agencies, and business and po-litical leaders are all part of the community where the adolescent develops, grows, stud-ies, plays, works, and seeks health advice and services. These entities and individuals areessential stakeholders that can play a pivotal role in promoting healthy lifestyles amongadolescents. Chapters Twenty-two and Twenty-three will review the following constructs for commu- nity level change in adolescent health promotion: the Community Organization Models the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, Behavior Change Models, and Social Marketing Community organization has its roots in the Theories of Social Networks and So- cial Support described in Chapter Seventeen through the use of the ecologicalperspective (see Chapters Four and Seven). Community organization is defined as the process by which community groups come together to identify common needs,problems, and goals; mobilize resources; and develop and implement strategies forreaching the collective goals they have set (Minkler and Wallerstein 2002). Minkler and Wallerstein (2002) emphasize that the definition of community organization clearly suggests that the needs or problems around which community groups are organizedmust, by necessity, be identified by the community itself. On the other hand, the authorswarn about the growing tendency in recent years for community needs or problems to beidentified by an outside organization or agent of change. According to Nyswander (1956),community organization captures one of health promotion's most fundamental princi-ples, which is to \"start where the people are.\" Therefore, health promotion program de-signers and health education professionals whose departure point reflects the specificneeds determined by the target community will be far more likely to experience success inthe change process and to promote true community ownership of programs and actionsthan will their counterparts who follow and/or impose a personal or institutionally dic-tated agenda developed outside the community and without its input. This is an important challenge for health intervention planners and developers, who have traditionally relied upon behavioral theories as powerful tools with rigorous[Chapter Twenty-two ] The Community Organization ModelsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 197methodologies for analyzing and changing behaviors as well as measuring thosechanges, but whose work calls for them tofollow the dictates of a particular institu- tional agenda or interest originating out-side the community. Furthermore, exter-nally funded projects usually come withpreset health and/or behavioral objectivesthat might tempt health promotion pro-gram developers to bypass the socialassessment phase when using thePRECEDE-PROCEED model discussed inChapter Four of this book. Yet Green and Kreuter (1999) encourage community health promotion planners touse an expansionist approach and includethis initial phase assessment, regardless ofthe nature of the particular communityproject's structure or type of funding, be-cause of its usefulness in determiningcommunity members' perceptions of theirown needs and quality of life and becauseof the valuable input this information pro- vides for the additional assessment phasesto follow. They reason that this initial so-cial assessment phase is essential becausepeople value their health to the degree thatbeing healthy allows them to achieve otherpersonal goals. In this sense, community organization is an excellent framework within which tocarry out this social assessment. In thecase of adolescent target groups, the as-sessment would yield essential informa-tion regarding their needs and wants, bygender and age group, that could be usedas the backdrop for a well-designed inter-vention or program that would be respon- sive to their specific problems and goals atthe particular point where they are now intheir lives. In this sense, positive commu-nity change and empowerment are mostoptimally achieved when the design ofhealth promotion programs embodies notonly the appropriate mix of behavioralchange theories, but successfully inte-grates them with developmental and eco-logical perspectives that prioritize theneeds and goals of the community or com-munity group desiring change. In his book An Ethic for Health Promotion: Rethinking the Sources of Human Well-Being , David R. Buchanan argues that well-being is achieved by cultivating cer-tain virtues, or dispositions of character,in which case the virtue of mindfulness isessential to the attainment of humanwell-being. According to Buchanan,\"mindfulness is gaining greater self-knowledge, or becoming more aware offelt desires and putting them into per-spective, in terms of the kind of person(or community) one aspires to be\"(Buchanan 2000). As noted in this book'sIntroduction, an understanding of behav-ior change theories includes the aware-ness that they are health promotion strate-gies chosen by people and communitiesfor the adoption of health-promoting lifestyles and positive, sustainable behav-ior change. These strategies, lifestyles,and long-term behavior change are, inthis framework, the means to the finalgoal of human self-realization and opti-mal well-being. Within this context,YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 198Buchanan's \"mindfulness\" may be viewed as a consciousness-raising and goal-setting construct leading to self-determined human well-being, as well asto the creation of stable, self-sustaining,and prosperous communities. In the public health field, a growing em- phasis on community participation, begunin the 1970s, culminated in the adoption ofthe Ottawa Charter for Health Promotionby the member governments of the WorldHealth Organization in 1986. Support ofthe Charter's precepts signaled a new ap-proach that encouraged governmental andnongovernmental sectors to work togetherin partnership, to seek universal partici-pation, to create health-promoting publicpolicies and sustainable environments,and, ultimately, to reduce inequities anddisparities between groups in community-driven projects (World Health Organiza-tion 1986). The concept of community- building has also emerged, in which people who identify themselves as members of ashared community engage together in theprocess of community change. The defini-tion of community may be based solely on geographical boundaries and related con-siderations, or it may refer to people livingwidely dispersed over large geographicalareas who nonetheless view themselves asunited through shared interests, ethnicity,profession, sexual orientation, or othersimilarities. Rothman (2001) describes community or- ganization as being composed of three al-ternative change models that sometimes overlap and may also be combined: Locality orcommunity development uti- lizes a broad cross-section of people inthe community to identify and solve itsown problems. It stresses consensus-development, capacity-building, and astrong task orientation. Outside con-sultants or specialists may help to coor-dinate and enable the community tosuccessfully address its particularconcerns. Social planning uses task goals and ad- dresses substantive problem-solving,with technical consultants provid-ing expertise to benefit communitymembers. Social action aims to increase the problem-solving capacity of the com-munity and to achieve concrete changesto redress social injustice issues affect-ing the community's most disadvan-taged and/or underserved groups. The main differences between these mod- els are that the locality orcommunity devel- opment model is seen as being more process-oriented, the social planning model is viewed as more task-oriented,and the social action model is considered to be both task- and process-oriented(Minkler and Wallerstein 2002). Community-building (Walter 1997, Gard- ner 1991) is a newer type of community or-ganization model whose approach is con-sidered to be more strengths-based andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 199community-centered. In contrast to the other models just described, whose ap-proaches are more needs-based and whichoften rely heavily on input supplied by ex- ternal consultants, community-buildingfocuses on increasing the community's own capacity to solve current and futureproblems. The Community Coalition Action Theory (Butterfoss and Kegler 2002; Butterfoss,Goodman, and Wandersman 1993) has alsogained recognition during the last decade.Community coalitions are formal, multi-purpose, and long-lasting alliances of indi-viduals representing diverse organizations,factions, or constituencies within a com-munity who agree to work together toachieve a common goal (Feighery andRogers 1990). As an action-oriented part-nership, a coalition usually performs avariety of functions: it analyzes the commu-nity problem to be prevented or addressed,gathers data and assesses the needs, devel-ops a plan of action, and implements iden-tified solutions, aiming to achieve commu-nity-level outcomes through social andbehavioral changes (Whitt 1993). The Community Organization and Develop- ment Model (Braithwaite, Bianchi, and Taylor 1994) involves the development of a community coalition board, which thenundertakes its own community assess-ment, facilitates leadership development,sets policy, and designs culturally rele-vant interventions through a communityproblem-solving approach. Several key concepts are shared by these various approaches and are central to ef-fect and measure change at the communitylevel: Empowerment is a social action process through which individuals, organiza-tions, and communities gain masteryover their lives in the context of chang-ing their social and political environ-ment to improve equity and quality oflife. In this regard, Minkler and Waller-stein (2002) pose an interesting ques-tion that must be addressed when con-sidering empowerment: \"Can people inpositions of dominance or privilege de-rived from culture, gender, race, orclass (and with funding attributions),empower others? Or must people em-power themselves?\" In the case of ado-lescents, Kim and colleagues (1998)emphasize the need to promote positivedevelopment through youth empower- ment , by shifting the paradigm of con- sidering youth as a community problemto one that views them as community re-sources and assets. Key components tothe empowerment process\u2014active par-ticipation, awareness of the surround-ing world, and identification ofstrengths\u2014are all essential aspects ofyouth development (Holden, Pender-gast, and Austin 2000). Critical consciousness is developing an understanding of the root causes ofproblems. This concept is directly re-lated to the empowerment concept. Ac-cording to the Brazilian educator PauloYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 200Freire (1970), real education enables people to engage in active dialogue anddevelop a critical consciousness, whichin turn allows them to challenge theconditions that keep them powerless. Community capacity is the approximate community-level equivalent of self-efficacy plus behavioral capability\u2014terms, as we saw in Chapter Sixteen, thatare integral components of the Social Cog-nitive Theory\u2014that is, the confidenceand skills to solve problems effectively.Seven dimensions have been described ascritical to the development of communitycapacity (Norton et al. 2002): level of skills, knowledge, and resources(e.g., skills for strategic planning andinterpersonal communication); nature of social relationships (e.g., social connectedness, sense ofcommunity); structures, mechanisms, and spaces forcommunity dialogue and collective ac-tion (e.g., social networks, commu- nity spaces); quality of leadership and its develop-ment (e.g., communication, analysis and judgment, coaching, visioning,trust-building, teamwork); extent of civic participation (e.g., vol- unteerism, voting behavior, publicconcern with governance); value system (i.e., norms, standards, expectations, and desires of the com-munity); and learning culture (i.e., the community's ability to reflect on the outcomes oftheir actions and on new availableoptions). Participation and relevance presuppose that citizens become actively involvedand possess a collective sense of readi-ness for change based on their own feltneeds, shared power, and awareness ofresources. Issue selection is the identification of the problem(s) the community feels moststrongly about. According to Minklerand Wallerstein (2002), a good issue se-lection must meet several importantcriteria: It must be winnable (i.e., contribute to an achievable goal). It must be simple and specific . It must unite members of the group. It must involve members in a mean- ingful way in resolving the commu- nity's problems. It should deal with a problem that af- fects a large number of people. It should strengthen the community or organization. It should be part of a larger plan or strategy. Social action approaches to community or- ganizing can go beyond geographical andpolitical boundaries and are able to co-alesce action around common healthproblems. These types of approaches (e.g.,HIV/AIDS prevention) have used media advocacy as a powerful tool in their efforts. Media advocacy is the strategic use of massmedia as a resource for advancing a socialor public policy initiative. Groups such asHIV/AIDS and tobacco control coalitionshave made major advances in public sup-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 201port, funding, and policies in a remarkably short time. The Communication for Social Change Model describes a reinforcing process ofcommunity dialogue and collective actionworking in tandem to produce socialchange in the community that improvesthe health and well-being of all of itsmembers (Figueroa et al. 2002). Thismodel proposes that usually communitiesdo not initiate dialogue and action on theirown. Instead, the catalyst or stimulus forthese\u2014which may be external or internalto the community\u2014might take any varietyof forms (e.g., mass media messages, new available technologies, a policy proposal, achange agent) and leads to a dialogue abouta specific issue of concern or interest tothe community. The model describes 10steps in the community dialogue: (1)recognition of a problem; (2) identifica-tion and involvement of leaders and stake-holders; (3) clarification of community'sperceptions regarding the issue; (4) ex-pression of individual and shared needs;(5) development of a vision of the future;(6) assessment of current status; (7) set-ting of objectives; (8) identification of op-tions for action; (9) securing consensus onthe proposed action; and (10) creation ofan action plan. This model further proposes that since the community dialogue and collective-actionprocesses are mutually reinforcing, theyhave the effect of increasing the commu-nity's capacity to cooperate effectivelyeach successive time it goes through theseprocesses. The model also postulates seven outcome indicators of social change:(1) leadership; (2) degree and equity ofparticipation; (3) information equity; (4)collective self-efficacy; (5) sense of own-ership; (6) social cohesion; and (7) socialnorms. As community members and stakeholders in their community's overall health andwell-being, adolescents and youth shouldbe considered by planners and promotersof social change as valuable community as- sets and resources. This group is addition-ally ideally suited to provide innovativeperspectives and other types of input intothe development of a vision for the futureand should therefore be encouraged toplay an active role in community dia-logues, coalitions, and all other forms ofcommunity organization. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the CommunityOrganization Models to AdolescentLifestyles Various initiatives launched in recent years indicate that the strategy of youthempowerment represents a potentiallypowerful tool in community efforts to en-courage health-promoting behaviorsamong young people. In an effort to address prevention in a more comprehensive manner, the Ameri-can Legacy Foundation (2000) developedand implemented a statewide tobaccoprevention program in Florida that in-cluded a focus on youth empowermentYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 202 through the initiation of youth-led and youth-driven coalitions. The Founda-tion's goals were to engage youth in com-munity actions against tobacco use by de-veloping a broad-based coalition thatreflected the state's ethnic and social di-versity, building or extending statewideyouth movements against tobacco use, and fostering meaningful youth-led to-bacco prevention activities or programsthat encouraged and increased youth empowerment, positive development,civic involvement, and leadership anddecision-making responsibilities.

The Community Organization Models: Key Theoretical Concepts in the Adoption of Healthy Behaviors on increasing the community's own capacity to solve problems Community coalition: a formal, multipurpose, and long-lasting alliance of individuals repre-senting diverse organizations, factions, or con-stituencies within a community who agree towork together to achieve a common goal Community Organization and Development Model: involves the development of a commu- nity coalition board, which then undertakes itsown community assessment, facilitates leader-ship development, sets policy, and designs cul-turally relevant interventions through a commu-nity problem-solving approach Empowerment: a social action process through which individuals, organizations, andcommunities take control over their lives in thecontext of changing their social and political en-vironment to improve equity and quality of life Community capacity: refers to the commu- nity-level equivalent of self-efficacy and behav-ioral capability (i.e., the confidence and skills ofa community to solve its problems effectively) Communication for Social Change Model: based on a mutually reinforcing process of com-munity dialogue and collective action that pro-duces social change, at the same time that itincreases community capacity to cooperate ef-fectively each time similar issues or problemsare faced in the futureCommunity: a group of people living within de- fined boundaries of the same geographical area;or alternatively, a group of people living widelydispersed over a large geographical area whoview themselves as united through shared inter-ests, ethnicity, profession, sexual orientation, orother similarities Community organization: the process by which members of a community come togetherto identify common needs, problems, and goals;mobilize resources; and develop and implementstrategies to address these concerns and toachieve collectively set expected results Community Development Model (Locality): a process-oriented model that utilizes a broadcross-section of people in the community toidentify and solve its own problems, andstresses consensus development, capacity-building, and task orientation Social Planning Model: a task-oriented model used to address substantive problem-solving, inwhich consultants provide technical expertise tobenefit community members Social Action Model: both a task- and process-oriented model whose aim is to in-crease the community's problem-solving capac-ity and to achieve concrete changes to redresssocial injustice issues affecting the community'smost disadvantaged and/or underserved groups Community-Building Model: a strengths- based and community-centered model CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 203Another teen empowerment movement to prevent tobacco use aspires to be a modelfor the rest of the United States in over- coming barriers related to tobacco useprevention. Martin and colleagues (2001)describe the North Carolina-based pro-gram in a recently published journal arti-cle and emphasize that \"youth speak with afresh voice, bringing energy and convic-tion, as well as nontraditional ideas andstrategies, to the achievement of theirgoals.\" The use of cigarettes among U.S. teens has been dropping steadily and substantiallysince the peak rates seen in 1996 and 1997.Between 2001 and 2002, the proportion ofteens saying that they had tried smokingfell by 4 or 5 percentage points in eachgrade surveyed (8, 10, and 12), more thanin any other recent year (Monitoring theFuture 2002). One of the factors men-tioned as facilitating the achievement ofthese results is the major anti-smokingcampaign aimed at youth launched by theAmerican Legacy Foundation. The Moni-toring the Future organization attributespart of the success to the important roleplayed by the American Legacy Founda-tion's \"Truth\" campaign in increasing theperceived risk of smoking among teens. While youth empowerment has proven to be a successful strategy in decreasing ado-lescent tobacco use in the United States(Monitoring the Future 2002, Martin et al.2001, American Legacy Foundation 2000),it has not been widely explored as an alter-native option to promote delay in sexualinitiation and the adoption of safer sex practices among adolescents. The authorsof this book found only two successful ex- periences, both directed towards Africanyouth: the Kenyan Youth Initiatives Projectand the Promotion of Youth ResponsibilityProject-Zimbabwe (Johns Hopkins Uni-versity Center for Communications Pro-gram 1999). The first one aimed to em-power young people with information ontheir reproductive health through a radiovariety show targeted to this group inwhich young people also developed andoversaw the presentation of the show'scontents. The second experience involvedyoung people in the development of an ex-tensive six-month communication cam-paign and in the identification of \"youth-friendly\" health centers. These experiences point to the possibility that HIV and teen pregnancy preventionprograms could benefit from fresh, non-traditional ideas and strategies, created byyouth themselves through the initiation ofyouth-led and youth-driven coalitions.These would foster meaningful youth-inspired and -directed HIV and teen preg-nancy prevention interventions, activities,and programs. Most of the interventions todate involving youth in sexual and repro-ductive health prevention programs usethem as peer educators, with some suc-cessful experiences (Pearlman et al. 2002,Feudo et al. 1998). However, the role of adolescents typically is limited to that ofserving as outreach agents to provide theprevention services, and their participa-tion is excluded from the programs'YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 204assessment and planning phases. A model for a youth-based approach to HIV/AIDS services is being implemented in SanFrancisco, California. Bay Positives is a peer-run, peer-based organization fundedby and for youth living with HIV. Among itsexecutive directorship, board of directors,staff, and cadre of volunteers, the oldestmember is only 26 years old (Bettencourtet al. 1998). A literature review by this book's authors of publications describing community coalitions to prevent teen pregnancy re-vealed that very rarely do these incorpo-rate youth as active participants in theproject development and implementationstages. Kegler and Wyatt (2003) haveidentified a series of factors associatedwith successful neighborhood mobiliza-tion to prevent adolescent pregnancy.These include a strong sense of commu-nity, consensus on the perceived need forthe initiative, support by key organiza-tions, shared leadership, effective groupaction processes, and a competent staffcontingent. An innovative approach to in-crease male involvement in teen preg-nancy prevention was initiated in theUnited States by the Teen Pregnancy TaskForce of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Through two local gatherings open only to men, the Task Force promoted com-munity dialogue among adolescent andadult men around such issues as male re-sponsibility in preventing pregnancy andsexually transmitted infections, feelingsabout sexual abstinence, and providingadvice to younger siblings about teenpregnancy prevention (Boyer and Yanoff 1995). The evaluation of youth-targeted commu- nity organization interventions has alsopresented challenges of its own, particu-larly when substantial financial resourceshave been invested in the intervention andthe expected results elude program spon-sors. Hallfors et al. (2002) highlight onesuch example of this in a research paperpresenting evidence on the effectivenessof community antidrug coalitions in re- ducing substance abuse in 12 U.S. com-munities participating in the FightingBack program. The federal government,through the Center for Substance AbusePrevention's Community Coalition Pro-gram, had supported local coalitions byinvesting almost half a billion dollars dur-ing the 1990s. Based on this precedent,and following several large-scale commu-nity trials for chronic disease preventionthat had had significant influence indeveloping community-based, compre-hensive health promotion programs, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundationlaunched the Fighting Back program. Theprogram promoted the development ofcommunity coalitions that would assesssubstance abuse problems in their localareas and respond with a comprehensiveand coordinated action plan. Communi-ties were encouraged to develop their ownprograms based on local needs and to in-clude separate components on publicawareness, prevention interventions forchildren and youth, early identification,treatment, and relapse prevention. De-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 205spite the planning and organization that had preceded the program's launching,the results of the Fighting Back evaluationshowed no effects in reducing substanceabuse among youth. Furthermore, strate-gies aimed at improving adult-focusedoutcomes showed significant negativeeffects over time, compared to matchedcontrols. Hallfors and colleagues also describe some lessons learned from this experience.First, they note, the Fighting Back pro-gram had extremely broad goals. It was ex-pected that the process would stimulate areduction in demand for all drugs and al-cohol among all target groups, which in ef-fect forced the coalitions to work on toomany fronts and to juggle competing pro-grammatic priorities. Based on the evalua-tion's disappointing results, the authorsrecommend that communities keep theirgoals focused and manageable, with well-defined expected results and appropriatecorresponding data for the evaluationprocess. Secondly, leaders in the 12 com-munities chose, developed, and imple-mented strategies without proper supervi-sion that could have ensured that thechosen strategies were supported by sci-entific evidence. Thirdly, the FightingBack coalitions were expensive to main-tain, and policymakers assumed the effec-tiveness of the strategies at the same timethat key elements had not been given dueconsideration. These included encourag-ing communities to choose research-based programs and to acquire the neces-sary technical expertise to effectively carrythem out, and incorporating appropriate environmental level interventions (e.g.,reducing youth access to alcohol and to-bacco), in addition to strategies focused atthe individual level. Green and Kreuter (2002) offer a series of possible strategies to help communitiesbridge the gap between scientific evidenceand the desire to develop their own localinterventions. One of these is for commu-nities to partner with the nearest and mostinterested university-based researchteams or schools of public health, in orderto ensure the community's access to bestpractices and adequate support in moni-toring and evaluating the intervention.Another alternative would be to encouragethe engaging of researchers, communityprogram developers, and local policymak-ers in the joint research, planning, andevaluation process. This collaborative ef-fort would assure the use of evidence- based interventions adapted to localcircumstances and adequate levels ofmonitoring and evaluation supervision. The Communities Mobilizing for Change on Alcohol (CMCA) initiative is an exam-ple of a successful U.S. community-basedeffort to change community policies andpractices and reduce youth access to alco-hol. CMCA was a group-randomized trialthat included seven Midwestern commu-nities assigned to the intervention condi-tion and eight communities assigned tothe control condition. The interventionconsisted of a 2.5-year process in which apart-time community organizer workedYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 206with local government officials, enforce- ment agencies, alcohol retailers, themedia, schools, and other communitygroups to reduce youth access to alcohol.The target group was youth ages 18-20years old. The evaluation of this processshowed that the CMCA intervention had asignificant effect in reducing alcohol con-sumption among the target group, as wellas in reducing the propensity to sell alco-hol to minors. The intervention also had asignificant effect in reducing the numberof arrests of 18-20-year-olds driving while under the influence of alcohol (Wa-genaar et al. 2000a, 2000b). New Zealand is currently carrying out a project focused on youth and drug use thatconsists of a partnership with six commu-nities in rural and urban areas, many ofwhose residents are predominantly of the Polynesian-speaking Maori culturalgroup. This project illustrates a model thataims to bridge the gap between researchand practice and to improve human healthand well-being by working with communi-ties to increase their capacity to deal withalcohol and drug issues and to introducesustainable initiatives (Conway et al.2000). Rudd, Goldberg, and Dietz (1999) have written one of the few articles to datewhich describes community organizationefforts to increase physical activity andhealthy nutrition among adolescents. Theysuggest that: (1)Community members themselves should take the initiative to identify thestrongest needs among the variouspopulation groups they serve and sug-gest where new resources could bemost strategically utilized. (2) Community experts who are familiar with or belong to the culture of the tar-get population should become mem-bers of the pilot program planning andimplementation team. (3) In order to actively engage members of the targeted population, there must bea strong foundation for communitylinkages and for community-building. These basic principles are indeed key to the success of any community health pro-motion program. They help to ensure thatthe initiatives will be able to increase theireffectiveness over time and thus becomeself-sustaining in the long term. Table 22-1. presents a breakdown of the number of studies found using Commu-nity Organization Models according toadolescent health behaviors. As seen in Table 22-1., community orga- nization models have been vastly re-searched for adolescent behaviors relatedto tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, but verypoorly linked to physical activity and nu-trition in adolescents. Although there arevarious publications describing commu-nity interventions to improve adolescentsexual and reproductive health, and to re-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO | 207duce teen pregnancy and youth violence, the effectiveness of these interventionsalone is less evident unless they are part ofcomprehensive programs that include in- terventions at multiple levels (individual,interpersonal, community, and policy).

Summary of Community Organization Models and Adolescent Lifestyles Communities should keep their goals focused and manageable, with well-definedexpected results and appropriatecorresponding data for the evaluationprocess. Communities should choose research-basedprograms and acquire the necessarytechnical expertise to effectively carry themout. Communities may wish to partner with the nearest or most interested university-based research teams or schools of publichealth, in order to ensure the community'saccess to best practices and appropriatesupport in monitoring and evaluating theintervention. Communities should also explore thepossibility of engaging researchers,community program developers, and localpolicymakers in the joint research, planning,and evaluation process. This collaborativeeffort would assure the use of evidence-based interventions adapted to localcircumstances and appropriate levels ofmonitoring and evaluation supervision. Community organizing efforts involving local government officials, enforcement agencies,alcohol retailers, the media, schools, andother community groups can be an effectivestrategy to reduce youth access to alcoholproducts.Youth empowerment has been a successful strategy in decreasing adolescent tobaccouse in the United States through youth-ledcoalitions that have fostered meaningfultobacco prevention activities and programsand increased youth civic involvement andleadership and decision-makingresponsibilities. Despite its demonstrated success in reducingadolescent tobacco use, youth empowermenthas not been widely explored as a potentialstrategy to promote delay in sexual initiation,the adoption of safer sex practices, adequatephysical activity, and healthier eating patternsamong this age group. While adolescents may be used as peereducators or outreach agents in the provisionof prevention services in sexual andreproductive health promotion programs, theytypically are not involved in the assessmentand planning phases of these programs. Factors that have been associated withsuccessful neighborhood mobilization toprevent adolescent pregnancy include astrong sense of community, consensus on theperceived need for the initiative, support bykey organizations, shared leadership, effectivegroup action processes, and a competentstaff contingent. The evaluation of youth-targeted communityorganization interventions has beenproblematic and challenging. Some lessonslearned are:An innovation is the introduction of an idea, practice, method, device, or object that is perceived as being new by an individual, family, organization, commu-nity, or even larger group of people. Diffusion is defined as \"the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among mem-bers of a social system\" (Rogers 1983). The Diffusion of Innovations Theory addresseshow new ideas and practices spread within and between communities. Within the context of health promotion, innovation presents special challenges, since first the need for it must be demonstrated; then the innovation must be developed andproven to be effective; and finally, ways must be found to widely disseminate informationabout it and encourage the adoption of its use among the population. Thus, the theory fo-cuses on both the characteristics of the particular innovation and how the innovation willbe communicated to its intended audience. Within the framework of adolescent health and positive behavior change, this chapter will highlight the theory's background and applications, principally within the schooland educational environment. It also contains a special section on a representative se-lection of social marketing techniques and behavior change communication models usedto diffuse innovative health messages and promote positive behavior change amongyoung people, both at the individual and community levels. Following is a summary of key characteristics of innovations, based on the work of Rogers (1995, 1983), which determine if the given innovation will be adopted by new individu-[Chapter Twenty-three ] The Diffusion of Innovations Theory, Behavior Change CommunicationModels, and Social Marketing YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 210als and groups and how quickly this adop- tion will occur. Characteristics of innovations: relative advantages : the degree to which an innovation is perceived as an im-provement over the idea, practice, pro-gram, or product it proposes to replace compatibility : how consistent the in- novation is with the values, habits,experiences, and needs of those towhom it is targeted and who will po-tentially adopt it complexity : how difficult the innova- tion is to understand and/or adopt communicability: the degree of ease with which the proposed innovationmay be described to potentialadopters so that they may clearly un-derstand the benefits it offers trialability : the extent to which the in- novation may be experimented withbefore a commitment to adopt it isrequired observability : the extent to which the innovation provides tangible or visi-ble results readily observable in oth-ers who have already adopted it risk and uncertainty level : the extent to which the innovation may be adoptedwith minimal risk and uncertainty reversibility : the degree to which the innovation may be reversed or dis-continued easily time required : an expression of the minimal time investment required toadopt the innovation commitment : an expression of the minimal level of commitment re-quired to adopt the innovation modifiability : the extent to which the innovation may be modified and/orupdated over time impact on social relations : an expres- sion of the degree to which adoptionof the innovation may have a negative effect on the individual's surround-ing social environment cost-effectiveness : Although this char- acteristic is not explicitly mentionedby Rogers, it is nonetheless a key con-sideration in developing countrieswherever and whenever economic re-sources are relatively scarce. Communication channels : Diffusion theorists view communication as a two-way process, in which opinion leaders(e.g., public figures well known to thecommunity) mediate the impact ofradio, television, newspapers, and otherpublic information sources by empha-sizing the value of social networks or in-terpersonal channels, over and abovemass media, when making decisions.The basic premise of this theory, con-firmed by empirical research, is thatnew ideas and practices spread throughinterpersonal contacts largely consist-ing of interpersonal communication.These interpersonal networks, then, actas an informal vehicle to accelerate thediffusion of innovations originally pre-sented through the mass media, with theresult that the work of the networks andmedia becomes complementary andmutually reinforcing. One example ofthis synergy would be the use by publichealth specialists of both the massmedia and community leaders to sup-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE | 211port and diffuse messages relating to a new smoking cessation program beingoffered in the community. The work of Valente and Davis (1999) sheds further light on the use of communicationchannels in innovations diffusion. The au-thors propose that using opinion leadersthat have been selected by all communitymembers, instead of having them recruitedby non-community members or nomi-nated by a few individuals within the com-munity, can accelerate the diffusion of in-novations. This selection system ensuresthe credibility and trustworthiness of theopinion leaders and facilitates more effi-cient learning because the individuals re-ceive the messages of innovation fromcommunity members whom they have cho-sen as their role models. The implementation of a structured, well- thought-out program is an essential partof the health promotion process. School programs for the prevention of smokingare ineffective, for example, if teachers donot understand the intrinsic benefit ofthis innovation and do not properly applyit with their students. On the other hand,underestimating the barriers to diffu-sion and adoption is one of the princi-pal reasons why innovations are some-times ineffective. While the need forinformation about the determinants ofindividual behavior is commonly ac-cepted, it is hardly recognized that in-formation about the determinants of institutional \"behavior\" (such as theadoption of a prevention program by or-ganizations) is also needed for the devel-opment of successful implementation strategies. The focus of contemporary research on the diffusion of school health promotion in-terventions has gradually shifted from theattributes of a particular innovation andthe characteristics of the target audience tothe planning behavior, thought processes,and actions of the schoolteacher, with re-gard to the proposed innovation process.This process, as it refers to the educationalrepresentative and his/her responsibilityof sharing the innovation with the stu- dents, involves four subsequent stages:dissemination, adoption, implementa-tion, and continuation. Dissemination refers to the transfer of information aboutthe innovation from its developers to itspotential users (in this case, teachers).Adoption refers to the potential users' in- tentions to adopt the innovation. Imple- mentation refers to the actual use of the in- novation. Continuation refers to the final stage in which the innovation has becomecurrent practice. Patterns of adoption havebeen described as having a normal, bell-shaped distribution, divided in five cate-gories: innovators, early adopters, earlymajority adopters, late majority adopters,and laggards (Rogers 1995). As Green,Gottlieb, and Parcel (1987) have noted,special efforts to identify barriers for lateadopters would be particularly useful asresearch continues to unfold in the field ofinnovations diffusion. According to Orlandi et al. (1990), many health promotion innovations have failedbecause of the gap that is frequently leftYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 212unfilled between the point where innova- tion development ends and diffusion be-gins. To bridge this gap, Orlandi and col-leagues stress the need for linkagebetween the resource system that develops and promotes the intervention (e.g., theministry of health's adolescence program)and the user system that is supposed to adopt the intervention (e.g., schools,community health centers, sports clubs).Such a liaison group should include repre-sentatives of the user system (e.g., schoolprincipal, teachers, health professionals,sports coaches, town mayor) and of the re-source system (experts who developed theintervention), and a linkage agent , or dif- fusion coordinator, who facilitates the col-laboration between user system and re-source system. This person or group plays a critical role in providing training, an-swering questions, and solving problemsthat may occur during the implementationphase. The essential point is that the dif-fusion planning process has been devel-oped through cooperation among diverseplayers, with the goal of improving the fitbetween innovation and user, of fine-tuning intervention innovations to localrealities, of identifying and working toovercome barriers, and of facilitatingwidespread implementation. In thissense, a strategy to stimulate implementa-tion should be based on a careful analysisof the determinants of implementation behavior, at both the individual and orga-nizational levels. Box 23-1.

According to Family Health In-ternational (1996), behavior change com-munication is \"a multi-level tool forpromoting and sustaining risk-reducingbehavior change in individuals and com-munities by distributing tailored healthmessages in a variety of communicationchannels.\" This strategy has been used by avariety of agencies (international, na-tional, nongovernmental) as a tool forcombating HIV/AIDS in developing coun-tries. A variety of multi-level activities hasbeen implemented across Africa under therubric of BCC, ranging from HIV/AIDSmedia campaigns, promoting generalawareness through community mobiliza-tion activities, and interpersonal/small-group communications, to social market-ing of condoms and HIV/STI-relatedservices and supplies. Media advocacy andpolicy advocacy approaches have also beenused. BCC constituted a major componentof the global AIDS Control and Prevention (AIDSCAP) Project, funded by the U.S.Agency for International Developmentfrom 1991 to 1997. AIDSCAP supportedsuch activities as radio call-in shows, peer education activities, and the production ofmusical revues and comic book and televi-sion serial dramas. BCC is also included among the technical strategies recommended by the GlobalAIDS Program (GAP) of the U.S. Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-vices 2001e). For the GAP program, theCDC analyzed the techniques employed bysuccessful BCC campaigns and health be-havior change literature and then pro-posed a series of \"best practice\" features ofBCC: The communication should be personal- ized . Successful public health projects, even when applied on a large scale (andperhaps especially so), work best whenthe public message is reinforced inter-personally and in concert with otherservices and sectors. Members of targetpopulations will almost always requireindividualized attention in obtaininggeneral information and attempting torelate it to their unique situations andconcerns. The messages should be emotionally compelling . Communication campaigns and programs that succeed in modifyingbehaviors appear to do so because theycreate an emotional stake that motivatesthe population to act, instead of relyingupon a purely cognitive approach. The strategy includes a role models com- ponent. The use of role models is at the heart of many interpersonal communi-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 214cations and community mobilization activities. From testimonials by personsliving with AIDS to peer educationstrategies, real-life models in the formof peers, friends, family members, and opinion leaders are extremely powerful.Role models are a particularly effectiveway to motivate individuals to changebehavior by increasing their confidencein their ability to change, by persuadingthem of the positive benefits of change,and by showing them how to change.Thus, the use of role models not onlycontributes to creating the sort of emo-tional commitment that can lead tochange, but also demonstrates con-crete examples of behavior that can beemulated. The messages must be embedded in exist- ing social and cultural norms and expecta-tions . For information to make sense and be useful to members of the targetpopulation, it must be easily integratedinto their social expectations, norms,and values, as well as be a part of theirpopular culture and relevant to theirsocioeconomic milieu. It must be appli-cable to people's everyday lives and pre-sented in a narrative form (i.e., story-telling) that is familiar to the targetaudience. There must be recognition of impediments to and facilitators of new behaviors . Suc- cessful BCC activities recognize thevariables in the environment that eitherimpede or facilitate the implementationof desired behaviors. Programs that have the greatest impact are usuallylinked to specific services or supplies(e.g., provision of condoms, birth con- trol pills) in the community. Where theinfrastructure and/or supplies are lim-ited, these conditions should be accu-rately reflected and compensated for inthe program. The CDC's GAP report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001e) pro- poses that the BCC approach that com-bines these elements most effectively isthe \"entertainment-education\" modali-ties. These may range from professional toamateur street theater, and from film andpopular music to radio and television soapoperas. One reason that \"entertainment-as-education\" is both popular and effec-tive is because it focuses on the emotionalas well as cognitive factors that influencebehavior, and it is closely aligned with thecustoms, norms, and narrative forms thatare familiar to the target audiences. One entertainment-education approach that is highlighted in this report as prom-ising, due to its recently demonstratedbehavioral impact in Africa, is the use oflong-running serialized dramas on radiousing a methodology first developed inthe 1970s by Mexican theater and televi-sion producer Miguel Sabido. An evalua-tion of a Sabido-based program was con-ducted in Tanzania (1993-1997), wherepart of the country did not receive theradio drama Twer Na Wakati for the first two years of the program. This two-yearperiod permitted a quasi-controlledstudy. Listeners in areas receiving theRadio Tanzania broadcast reported in-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE | 215creased commitment to use family plan- ning methods and to adopt sexual and re-productive health practices to preventHIV infection. There was a 153% increasein condom distribution (compared to a16% increase in the control area) and a33% increase in new clients at familyplanning clinics (Vaughan et al. 2000,Rogers et al. 1999). Research has alsoshown that entertainment-educationprogramming with social change mes-sages is a cost-effective method for reach-ing large audiences (Singhal and Rogers1999, Westoff and Bankole 1997). Social marketing techniques have also been employed, through a variety of mediachannels, to diffuse new messages and/orprograms to adolescents and youth. Socialmarketing theory predicts that target mar-ket members (e.g., adolescents) will vol-untarily exchange their resources (e.g.,money, time) for a product when they be-come aware that the innovation offersthem attractive benefits at a reasonablecost or price and that it is available at theright place and at the right time. Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, the use of social marketing techniques, aswell as behavior change communication,has at times drawn the attention of critics(Buchanan 2000), principally due to the ethical dilemma they present of imposingor selling an innovation without the volun-tary participation of the targeted group.Maibach, Rothschild, and Novelli (2002),for example, argue that several public health specialists, confusing its definitionwith commercial marketing, have poorlyunderstood the concept of social market-ing. In an attempt to rescue social market-ing from these criticisms and elevate itsrole in public health, Maibach and col-leagues have extracted from different au-thors (Rothschild 1999, Andreasen 1995,Kotler and Roberto 1989) a series of con-cepts considered key in defining socialmarketing: Social marketing's primary objective isto influence the voluntary behavior oftarget market members (e.g., adoles-cents and youth). Social marketing offers to target marketmembers an attractive package of bene-fits and reduced barriers to behaviorchange, in order to enhance the possi-bilities for the adoption of new andhealthier behaviors. Social marketing's primary beneficiar-ies are members of the target market,whereas commercial marketing's pri-mary beneficiaries are those who decide Box 23-2. Behavior Change Communication: Best Practice Features The messages must be embedded in exist- ing social and cultural norms and expecta-tions. There must be recognition of impediments to and facilitators of new behaviors.The communication should be personalized. The messages should be emotionally compelling. The strategy includes a role models component.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 216to market the innovation (e.g., product or service). Social marketing activities seek to cre-ate a voluntary exchange between themarketing organization and members ofthe target market through mutual ful-fillment of self-interest (e.g., participa-tion in campaigns promoting safer sexpractices that contain appealing mes-sages and offer youth opportunities toparticipate in interesting campaign ac-tivities with their friends). Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of the Diffusion ofInnovations Theory, Behavior ChangeCommunication Models, and SocialMarketing to Adolescent Lifestyles The Diffusion of Innovations Theory holds great potential in helping to scale up effec-tive interventions that promote the adop-tion of healthy behaviors or change of riskbehaviors among adolescents in a varietyof settings, including schools, community organizations, and sports clubs. One of the best examples found of research projects in the diffusion of innovations isthe implementation of \"Smart Choices,\" asmoking prevention program for adoles-cents in which more than 100 Texas schooldistricts participated (Parcel et al. 1989).The Smart Choices local implementationstrategies followed these four phases: Dissemination : The objectives were for teachers and administrators to indicatetheir awareness of the program, to view theprogram favorably, and to discuss the pro-gram with other colleagues participating in the innovation process. Adoption : The objectives were that school districts would see the advantages of theprogram in terms of outcomes, expectan-cies, and social reinforcements. The de-terminants study showed that the mostpowerful incentives were making a differ-ence in the lives of students and complyingwith the essential instructional elementsmandated by the Texas educational system. Implementation : The objectives were that the participating teachers possessed thenecessary skills and self-efficacy to use theprogram with acceptable proficiency,completeness, and fidelity. Continuation : The objectives were that teachers and administrators would haveexperienced positive feedback and rein-forcement on the use of the program after one year and would continue using it. An evaluation of the adoption phase (Par- cel et al. 1995b) showed the expected re-sults. In the intervention group, 56.3% ofthe districts adopted the Smart Choicesprogram, while in the comparison grouponly 10.5% adopted the program. Stepwiselogistic regression indicated that the vari-ables most closely related to adoptionamong intervention districts were teacherattitudes towards the innovation and orga-nizational considerations of administra-tors. In the evaluation of the implementa-tion phase, two strategies were compared:live workshop training and video training.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE | 217The results showed that a lower proportion of video-trained teachers implemented the program (video training: 78.9%; liveworkshop training: 97.4%). The Diffusion of Innovations Theory was also employed in Texas to plan the dissem-ination and adoption phases of the Childand Adolescent Trial for CardiovascularHealth (CATCH) health promotion projectamong elementary schools (Hoelscher etal. 2001). The project was designed to de-crease saturated fat and sodium levels, in-crease physical activity, and prevent to-bacco use among preadolescent-agechildren. Its effectiveness had been previ-ously demonstrated among 5,106 elemen-tary schoolchildren ages 9-11 in Califor-nia, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas(Luepker et al. 1996), and the behavioralchanges resulting from the project wereshown to persist three years later into thestudy group's early and middle adolescentyears (Nader et al. 1999). During the CATCH dissemination stage in Texas, the project's earlier successes and its state-of-the-art design were high-lighted in order to emphasize the innova-tion's relative advantage over other initia-tives that had been tested in the past.Developing teacher-friendly materialsminimized the complexity involved inadopting the program. Networking and theforming of partnerships were crucial to project implementation, as were the par-ticipation and support of local decision-makers. Yet the scaling up of projects ofthis nature takes time, careful planning,and persistence, as was shown in this par- ticular case, where only 24% of schools inTexas had adopted the intervention during its first two years of dissemination. The El Paso del Norte Health Foundation also chose CATCH as its first community-wide preventive health initiative for the El Paso, Texas/Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico border area. This predominantly Hispanic, low-income border community has activelyembraced the El Paso CATCH program, with 108 elementary schools from New Mexico to West Central Texas (Heath and Cole-man 2003) agreeing to participate in the ini-tiative, illustrating the potential of diffu-sion projects of this type to scale up over time. One research study conducted in Europe has yielded important results regardingthe role of teacher attitudes and behaviorin the diffusion of new health promotioncurricula. Paulussen and colleagues (1995,1994) have described the steps involved inthe diffusion and implementation of AIDSprevention programs in Dutch schools.They identified the steps leading from theinitial development of the innovation to anincrease in teachers' awareness andknowledge and to the uptake and imple-mentation of four nationally disseminatedAIDS curricula. An extended model ofplanned behavior (see Chapter Eleven),the attitude/social influence/self-efficacy model, was used as an organizing schemafor a questionnaire addressing teachers' social and psychological disposition to-wards the AIDS curricula innovation andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 218decision-making. When the extent of dif- fusion of classroom AIDS education wasexamined, the rates were similar to thosereported for most externally developedcurricula, indicating that around 50% ofteachers generally receive the curricula,while only 25% actively take notice of thecurricula content, and only 5%-10% usethe curricula in one way or another(Paulussen 1994). The different steps involved in the diffu- sion and implementation of the AIDS pre-vention programs in Dutch schools weredetermined by two principal factors. Firstof all, the diffusion of the curricula through teachers' networks within theparticipating schools mainly determinedthe extent of knowledge acquisition by theindividual teachers about the programs.Secondly, the teachers' intentions to pro-vide AIDS education in general weremainly determined by: subjective norms (i.e., the teachers'perceptions of how others felt about theprogram, especially students, other col-leagues, and the school's principal); self-efficacy; personal moral beliefs about sexualityissues in general; sense of professional responsibility; frequency of interaction with other col-leagues about HIV instruction; and the presence of a formal school policyconcerning AIDS education. In another study based on the Diffusion of Innovations Theory framework, Hallforsand Godette (2002) examined the adop- tion and implementation of the U.S. De-partment of Education's new policy, the\"Principles of Effectiveness,\" regardingthe governmental requirement to selectresearch-based programs for schoolhealth prevention initiatives. Results froma sample of 104 school districts in 12 statesindicated that only 19% of the schoolswere implementing a research-based cur-riculum with fidelity. Common problemsidentified included the lack of teachertraining and of the requisite materials; useof some, but not all, of the required les- sons and teaching strategies; and failure todeliver lessons to age-appropriate studentgroups. The authors concluded that lowlevels of funding, inadequate infrastruc-ture, decentralized decision-making, andthe lack of adequate program guid-ance contributed to the slow progress in improving school-based preventionpractices. A study by Buston and colleagues (2002) also concluded that interventions are un-likely to achieve their desired aims unlessthey are implemented as intended. Theseauthors analyzed the factors that impededand facilitated the implementation of aspecially designed sexual education pro-gram in Scotland. The analysis revealedthat program implementation was nega-tively affected by competition for curricu-lum time; brevity of lessons; the assigna-tion of low priority to implementation byschool managers, particularly in relationto time-tabling; and teachers' limited ex-perience and ability in the use of role-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE | 219playing. The nature of the adoption process, staff absence and turnover, lackof theoretical understanding of the pack- age, and commitment to the research were also factors influencing the extent of implementation within and across schools. The authors recommend thathealth promotion program managers takethese lessons learned into account whendesigning and implementing teacher-delivered, school-based health promotioninitiatives. Behavior Change Communication, Social Marketing, and AdolescentLifestyles To date, one of the most innovative behav- ior change communication initiatives tar-geting young people is loveLife , a multime- dia communications strategy developed inSouth Africa which includes advertising onthe Internet, television, radio, billboards,taxis, and in print materials and uses be-havior change as the cornerstone of HIVprevention. Launched in September 1999,loveLife 's design responds to the fact that risky sexual behavior among teenagers iscurrently driving the HIV epidemic in thiscountry. Since the highest rates of new in-fection occur in late adolescence and earlyadulthood, the initiative targets princi-pally youth ages 12 to 17. Major predictorsof high-risk sexual behavior in this age group are coercion, peer pressure, trans-actional sex, and abdication of sexual re-sponsibility by boys. loveLife combines its high-profile multi- media approach with institutional supportfrom government authorities, health ser- vices delivery, and community outreachwith the goal of creating a new vision foryouth in which they come to associate thelifestyles depicted in loveLife 's messages with healthy and positive behavioralchanges they can achieve in their ownlives. The content of communication isframed by three values: informed choice,shared responsibility, and safe sexualpractices. Since its launch, loveLife \"branding\" has positioned itself as part ofSouth African popular youth culture by fo-cusing on sensitive issues related to sex,sexuality, and gender inequities, while atthe same time rapidly transcending theboundaries that would narrowly define itas an HIV prevention initiative ( loveLife 2002). loveLife has significant public and political support. Public approval ratings arearound 85-90%. Political support is ex-pressed through a formal public-privatefinancing partnership between the SouthAfrican Government and the Henry J.Kaiser Family Foundation. In addition tothe above, considerable funding has beenreceived from the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation and UNICEF. loveLife's current budget is estimated at US$ 3.33 per capitain the country's 12- to 17-year-old popula-tion segment. Although young people in South Africa ex- posed to loveLife programming reported significant behavior change by the end ofyear two ( loveLife 2002), the multimedia initiative has not been able to reach youngYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 220people living in extreme poverty with the same positive results. A number of initiatives are currently un- derway to address this obstacle, such as theexpansion of loveLife Y-Centres in poor peri-urban and rural communities thatare supported by mobile outreach pro-grams with regular radio broadcasts. TheY-Centres combine educational skills de-velopment, such as computer literacy,personal motivation and leadership train-ing, and communications and broadcastskills, with popular sports such as basket-ball and volleyball. All Y-Centres include afully equipped sexual health clinic provid-ing clinical and counseling services in anonclinical setting. Another innovative BCC project in South Africa targeting young adolescents is SoulBuddyz (The Communication Initiative2003). The project was launched in 1999as a way to build on the success of the SoulCity multimedia series, which debuted in1992 and targeted its health and develop-ment issues to the general public. SoulBuddyz is best described as an \"edutain-ment\" vehicle conceived to promote goodhealth among children ages 8-12. Its de-velopers note that all the issues dealt within the series (e.g., HIV/AIDS, sexuality,nutrition, road safety, disability, genderequality, bullying, and conflict resolution)are framed within the U.N. Convention onthe Rights of the Child (see Chapter Five ofthis book). At the same time, the serieshighlights a number of underlying issues,including children's rights and responsi-bilities, respect for and sensitivity toward cultural differences, role-modeling goodbehavior towards others, and the need forchildren to view themselves as proactive,valuable, and productive members of thecommunity. The communications mediaemployed include a 26-part televisiondrama series representing \"children fromall life ... form a bond\" anddepicting \"issues that children are facingevery day of their lives\" and a half-hour-long radio program consisting of 10-minute dramas with young actors, a five-minute documentary insert for adults andchildren, and 15 minutes of interactive talkwith the audience hosted by a young per-son. In addition, a life skills booklet hasbeen designed for use by seventh-gradestudents, a parenting booklet has beendistributed as a newspaper supplement,and children have taken the initiative toform their own Soul Buddyz clubs. Based in schools and libraries across SouthAfrica, these clubs have served as a plat-form where the children may acquire ad- ditional knowledge and skills related tohealth issues and \"be empowered to real-ize and voice their rights, needs, and in-terests and interact with peers on an edu-cational and recreational level\" (TheCommunication Initiative 2003). While behavior change communication initiatives geared toward adolescents haveprimarily taken place in Africa, socialmarketing has led to several media cam-paigns in Europe and the United States.Kennedy and colleagues (2000) evaluateda multimodal social marketing interven-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE | 221tion aimed at reducing HIV infection among adolescents in California. Condomuse at last sex with a principal partner wasassociated with the number of channelsthrough which an adolescent had been ex-posed to the intervention, with a signifi-cant increase in the proportion of adoles-cents using condoms (4.3%) during aone-year intervention. Penfold and Kirk-man (2002) also used the social marketingof condoms to develop an innovative na- tional pilot project in the United Kingdom.The design of the intervention involvedselling packets of three condoms each atan affordable price through strategicallyplaced vending machines throughoutManchester. In marketing these condoms,the intervention designers decided topartner with Galaxy 102, Manchester'sleading youth-focused commercial radiostation, and branded the condoms as aGalaxy product. Evaluation of the Man-chester intervention's success is currentlyunderway. Media campaigns have also focused on im- proving anti-smoking advertising directedtoward young people. Florida's \"truth\"campaign is an excellent example of acounter-marketing, anti-tobacco youth-driven media campaign. Zucker et al.(2000) describe that the campaign hasbeen associated with a 92% brand awarenessrate among teens, a 15% rise in adolescentswho agree with key attitudinal statementsabout smoking, a 19.4% decline in smokingamong middle adolescents, and an 8% de-cline among late adolescents. Wakefield andcolleagues (2003), after conducting acomprehensive review of the published literature on the effects of anti-smokingadvertising on youth smoking, concludedthat these campaigns appear to have more re-liable positive effects among pre- and earlyadolescents by preventing smoking initia-tion. These authors highlight, however,that family and peer interactions can play a crucial role in reinforcing, denying, orneutralizing the potential effects of anti-smoking campaigns, and they warn againstisolated anti-smoking campaigns that are notenhanced by the use of other tobacco con-trol strategies. Diffusion of innovations, behavior change communication, and social marketing arecomplementary theories and modelswhich serve as instruments to reach dif-ferent population levels, through variouschannels, with the unifying goal of scalingup effective adolescent health promotionand prevention interventions. Table 23-1.presents a breakdown of the number ofstudies found using the Diffusion of Inno-vations Theory, behavior change commu-nication, and social marketing accordingto adolescent health behaviors. As seen in Table 23-1., the diffusion of health messages has mainly focused on theprevention of tobacco, alcohol, and druguse, followed by the promotion of safer sexpractices among adolescents. Table 23-2.presents a further breakdown of the re-sults in Table 23-1. by comparing the re-search and evidence published using theDiffusion of Innovations Theory with thatavailable utilizing behavior change com-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 222 munication models and social marketing techniques. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory has primarily been used to date to introduceand scale up adolescent health promotionand prevention programs as part of aschool health curriculum. Initially thisstrategy showed great promise within the context of adolescent health and the pro-motion of positive behavior change, be-cause its design allows for large popula-tions of adolescents to be reachedsimultaneously and interventions to bedelivered in a setting where this groupspends a significant amount of time\u2014the Table 23-2.

Yet as we have seen in this chapter, the adoption and implemen-tation of health promotion curricula byschoolteachers have presented challengesof their own. This is particularly the case for sexual education, where personal be- liefs may interfere with the fidelity of thecurricula implementation. In contrast to this approach, behavior change communication and social mar-keting have been widely used to diffusehealth messages through multimediachannels that young people find appealingand to which they often turn as a source forreliable information and entertainment.As seen in Table 23-2., BCC- and socialmarketing-based adolescent health initia-tives have also generated more interest inthe research community and have been farmore studied than their primarily school-based innovations diffusion counterparts. Although BCC and social marketing might appear to be more attractive strategies touse in scaling up health behavior messagesdirected toward adolescents, it is impor-tant to not confuse these strategies withthe channels (e.g., media) or settings (e.g.,schools) that are used most commonly tointroduce the innovative messages. Asnoted in this chapter, the Diffusion of In-novations Theory, behavior change com-munication models, and social marketingtechniques are all complementary con-structs used to reach large populations ofadolescents, with a variety of channels and settings options available to programdevelopers. It is interesting to further note that some of the key characteristics of innovations in the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, suchas the innovation's relative advantages,compatibility, complexity, trialability,and observability, have been successfullyapplied to social marketing strategies. Onthe other hand, while entertainment-education interventions with socialchange messages have been shown to beeffective, this approach has yet to be in-troduced in any significant way in theschool setting, even though adolescentsoften tend to complain about the lack of novelty and creativity in traditional edu-cational approaches. To date, no magic bullet has emerged that clearly demonstrates its effectiveness inreaching a wide range of adolescents,which may consist of different age groups,genders, and cultures, through the use ofonly one strategy applied in one setting.There are indications, however, based on the research findings discussed in this chapter, that a more synergisticapproach\u2014one which integrates effectivemultimedia social campaigns with thescaling up of evidence-based interven-tions in the school environment and at thecommunity level\u2014holds promise as a pos-sible best practice for the future.Models that Promote Change at the Policy Level The World Health Organization defines policy as a written \"expression of goals for im- proving the health situation, the priorities among these goals, and the main directions forattaining them\" (World Health Organization 1986). Widely defined, policy is a statementof aims and ideals or a guide for the achievement of goals (Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda et al. 1999). Health care policy, then, may be seen as a network of interrelated decisions, which to-gether form an approach or strategy in response to practical issues concerning the provi-sion of quality health care to all members of the community. Policies are expressed in abody of practices, statements, regulations, and laws (Barker 1996). A policy statementonly acquires true significance, however, if it is put into action. Policies are a way of ad-dressing the broader social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Health policy may be approached from different perspectives. For an economist, health policy will be seen as actions to optimize the allocation of scarce resources. From a clin-ical physician's point of view, improving the quality of health services will be of vital im-portance. From a public health perspective, the development of health promotion strate-gies\u2014to prevent poor health to the greatest degree possible\u2014will be paramount. And in the specific case of adolescents, the focus will be to forge health-promoting lifestyle policiesthat include opportunities for adopting health-promoting behaviors and that ensureprotections against adopting health-compromising behaviors, utilizing a comprehensiveapproach that goes beyond the health sector to include public and private partners, suchas schools, churches, commercial advertisers and services, the mass media, and families.In an ideal scenario, mutually reinforcing policies of this type will be in place at all levels\u2014institutional, community, national, and even international. As has already been pointed out in this book, adolescence is a singularly pivotal period of life in which increasing autonomy and exposure to risk are approaching the crossroads ofdiscovery, opportunity, and decision-making. On the one hand, the adolescent enjoysdecreasing adult supervision, while on the other, he/she may still possess insufficient in-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 224YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |POLICY LEVEL | 225struments (social, emotional, and cognitive skills and economic resources) to effectively manage and overcome the numerous risks faced. The World Bank's Social Risk Management framework for social protection (Holzmann and Jorgensen 2000) proposes that all individuals, households, and communities arevulnerable to multiple risks from different sources, whether they are natural (e.g., earth-quakes, hurricanes, floods) or man-made (e.g., those related to industrialization, urban-ization, social unrest, civil war, etc.). The framework also states that poverty relates tovulnerability since the poor are typically more exposed to risk, and they have a more lim-ited access to appropriate risk management instruments than less disadvantaged groups.This framework considers that the best social risk management is to take the neededsteps to ensure that the risk does not occur at all. One of the roles of international gov-ernments in the Social Risk Management framework, then, is to implement appropriatepolicy actions for risk prevention (Holzmann and Jorgensen 2000). The framework alsoidentifies empowerment, capacity-building, and increased opportunities for socioeco-nomic stability as crucial for poverty reduction. Adolescents who are still growing and developing are in particular need of social protec- tion, in the form of public interventions designed to assist them to better manage risk,take advantage of opportunities for self-improvement, master the necessary skills andassets to achieve their self-set goals, and express their needs and wants through positiveand healthy channels. The next chapter will present various models for policy and legislation development that can guide program developers in designing more effective policies for promoting healthylifestyles among adolescents. Models of Policy and Legislation Development[Chapter Twenty-four] Apolicy is a framework that guides decision-making in an organization or gov- ernment and is usually expressed in a statement of intended actions. Policiesmay be general statements regarding national or organizational priorities, written regulations, guidelines, procedures, and/or standards to be achieved. Alterna-tively, they may be informal (i.e., unwritten) but widely recognized practices (FamilyHealth International 1996). Usually, the creation of new policies (e.g., regarding com-munity health) does not occur in a vacuum, but instead within established networks ofinterrelated decisions that together form an integral approach or strategy in relation topractical issues regarding health care delivery (Barker 1996). Carol Barker, along with numerous other colleagues, has described the process of policy- making as a specific sequence of events. The stages of this process are shown in Figure24-1. However, Barker's work presents a caveat about such a stylized and vertical configura- tion, because it gives the false impression that policy-making is always within the fullcontrol of the policymaker, involving no outside interests or agendas. She emphasizesthat public policies address complex realities, and, on the one hand, the process needs tobe conducted in a style that emphasizes flexibility, responsiveness, accountability, trans-parency, and broad participation. On the other hand, by virtue of the presence of theseelements, a policymaker's freedom to act will be constrained at various different stagesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 227 during the policy-making process. It is also a fact that policies are made by politi-cians and people who hold positions of au-thority. Gill Walt (1994) declares that al-though health policy is concerned withcontent , health policy is really about process and power. She proposes that policy devel- opment is ultimately determined by whoinfluences whom in the making of policy,and how this comes about. There are dif-ferent theories about the roles of powerand influence in policy-making: pluralist view : Power is unequally dis- tributed and shifts between differentindividuals, interest groups, and pres-sure groups. elite view: Power is in the hands of small networks of elites who are powerful be-cause of their economic wealth and so-cial position. Marxist approach : Power is understood in relationship to the ownership of themeans of producing and distributinggoods and services. structuralist approach : Power is under- stood to be organized into variousstructural groups in which distinctionsare made among dominant interestgroups, challenging interest groups,and repressed interest groups. Thedominant interest groups are those whoare basically content with the status quoand whose interests are being wellserved by the way in which their sectoris currently structured within an or-ganization or government. Challeng-ing interest groups are those who areless content with the status quo and who feel that their interests would bebetter served by structural change. The repressed interest groups are thosewho are least content with the cur-rent situation and conditions and whofeel that their interests are not be-ing well served at all within currentstructures. Each of the above approaches may con- tribute to the process of policy-making,and the power influence will depend upon Issue Definition Setting Objectives Priority-Setting Defining Options Options Appraisal Implementation EvaluationFigure 24-1.

Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Ltd. \u00a91996.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 228the type of policy that is being decided upon. Policy Categories and Levels Policies may be differentiated between macro policies (high political issues) and micro policies (low political issues) (Walt 1994, Evans and Newnham 1992). Macro policies affect everyone; they in- volve or reflect long-term objectives ofthe State or of those in power (e.g.,major economic decisions, perceivednational security crises). These policiesare usually formulated by the govern-ment and are passed into law throughthe legislative branch. Governmentleaders are likely to discuss them onlywith groups considered important tothe nation's economic and political se-curity, and the policy process is likely tobe relatively closed. The macro policyprocess may be considered to be elitist. Micro policies involve more localized, sectoral interests. These low politics areusually placed in the hands of the de-partment in charge of the sectoral issue(e.g., the ministry of health) and are notconsidered by the government as awhole. Sectoral policies may be commu-nicated through institutional state-ments, memoranda, letters, or circularsrather than through formal legislation.The policy process may be much moreopen to groups with special interests,including nongovernment organiza-tions; professional, community, andadvocacy groups; and the church. Thesegroups may have considerable access togovernment and may be extended op- portunities to influence policy. Low po-litical issues can shift and become highpolitical issues over time. The micropolicy process may be considered to bemore pluralist. Health policies usually fall into the micro policy category, which does not mean thathealth policies are always noncontroversialor low political issues. Mass marketing ofcondoms and sexual education for adoles-cents, for example, often elicit impas-sioned public debate and discussion ema-nating from different sectors of societywith varying interests and values. Never-theless, it is interesting to point out that theSocial Risk Management framework for so-cial protection described in the introduc-tory section to this chapter categorizes theAIDS epidemic as a type of high politicalissue requiring the development of a macropolicy, given the level of risk it presents atall levels of society everywhere. The frame-work calls for the creation of publicly man-dated or provided arrangements that wouldbecome the principal instruments of riskmanagement strategies. Policymakers will need to recognize, how- ever, that even seemingly commonplacesectoral policies are very often based onnetworks of decisions that are interwovenwith other high political issues. Frenk(1994) describes four operational levels ofhealth policy: The systemic level deals with main fea- tures that shape the health system over-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 229all (e.g., the nature of public institutions involved in health care, the public/private mix, and the relationship be-tween health and other sectors). The programmatic level decides on the priorities for health care, the actualnature of health care programs, and the way in which resources will beallocated. The organizational level addresses the way in which resources may be usedmost productively to provide high qual-ity service. The instrumental level is the one at which various types of technical expertise andinstruments of good organization, suchas the systems for human resources de-velopment and information collection,are managed. The type of policies developed at the pro- grammatic, organizational, and instru-mental levels will depend on the nature ofsystemic level policy-making, which mayalso be considered to be of the high politi-cal or macro category. Policy Agenda-Setting Models Theorists also have examined how an issueis placed on the policy agenda . Following is a discussion of several different theoreti-cal models and constructs that explain thisprocess. The Hall Model: This model (Hall et al. 1975) suggests that an issue becomespart of the policy agenda only when ithas high legitimacy ,feasibility ,and sup- port. Legitimacy refers to those issues inwhich governments feel most people will accept State intervention. As Walt(1994) explains in her book Health Pol- icy: An Introduction to Process and Power , some evidence-based issues have a low-legitimacy public profile because of aprotracted ideological debate about theboundaries between individual freedomand the right of the State to restrain thatfreedom. For example, policies to pro-tect adolescents from certain health-compromising behaviors such as to-bacco use have low legitimacy in severalLatin American countries, where theprerogative of individual freedom stillprevails over public health concerns de-spite overwhelming scientific evidencein support of the proposed policy. Feasibility refers to the potential for im- plementing the policy. This will dependon the technical and theoretical evi-dence, financial and other resources,availability of skilled personnel, capa-bility of administrative structures, andexistence of necessary infrastructure.As we saw in Chapter Twenty-three,research has shown that teacher-delivered, school-based sexual educa-tion initiatives have low feasibility ofbeing implemented (Buston et al. 2002,Hallfors and Godette 2002) due to lackof proper teacher training, insufficient funding levels, and inadequate infra-structure, among other factors. Support refers to public support, in the sense of powerful and highly visible in-terest groups providing strong supportYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 230for, or resistance against, a specific pol- icy issue. Governments may successfullychallenge important interest groupssuch as the church, but only if they havesecured sufficient support among otherhigh-profile interest groups. Advocacymovements play a key role in supportinghealth-promoting policies for adoles-cents (e.g., smoke-free schools, drug-free zones, violence prevention inschools, sexual education, and access tocondoms and contraceptives). The Policy Windows Theory: Kingdon (1995) states that governments pay at-tention to policies only when a majorwindow of opportunity opens up simul-taneously in each of three \"streams\":the problem, the politics, and the pol-icy. The role of the policy advocate is tocreate, monitor, and capitalize on theseopportunities. This theory is also knownas the Kingdon Model. The problem stream refers to the issues that capture government officials' at-tention at a given point in time. Thismight happen because of a generalizedincrease in prevalence of a specific so-cial problem (e.g., teen pregnancy),news of high local impact (e.g., childrendying from alcohol intoxication), oreven a personal experience (e.g., a fam-ily member or close relative unexpect-edly commits suicide). Policymakerswill only identify an existing conditionas a problem when they feel (or othersconvince them to feel) that somethingneeds to be changed.The politics stream refers to the partici- pation of visible organized groups, whohighlight a specific problem and ma-nipulate the mass media to focus atten-tion on it, and of much less visiblegroups of specialists, who work towardsproposing alternative options for solv-ing the problem at hand (e.g., academ-ics, researchers, consultants). The poli-tics stream will be affected by politicalparty platforms, elections, changes inadministration, and national mood re-garding the role of government. The policy stream selects the proposals resulting from the previous streams thathave technical feasibility, congruencewith existing values, public acceptabil-ity, politicians' receptivity, and no sig-nificant financial restraints. Kingdonargues that although policies might bedeveloped in stages (such as those de-scribed by Barker and shown in Figure24-1.), the policies might be advocatedfor long periods before the opportunity appears for their acceptance. The Agenda-Building Theory : Cobb and Elder (1983) have described threemodels for agenda-building: the outside-initiative model, in which the publicsupports an issue that requires actionfrom the government; the inside-initiative model, in which the govern-ment takes the lead in supporting anissue; and the mobilization model, inwhich the government proposes a policyand seeks public support for its success-ful implementation. According to CobbYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 231and Elder, media attention and the sup- port of opinion and political leaders areessential to place an issue on the policyagenda. Media advocacy: Wallach and colleagues (1993) have proposed a media advocacyframework that may be used by commu-nity groups to influence policy. The au-thors describe three steps of media ad-vocacy: setting the agenda, shaping thedebate, and moving forward the policyby suggesting solutions and placingpressure on policymakers. The Ontario Public Health Association published Making a Difference in Your Community: A Guide for Policy Change(Danaher and Kato 1995), which includes aPolicy Development Model, an adaptation of which is shown in Figure 24-2. The fig- ure depicts the previously-mentionedstages in Barker's policy-making processbut also incorporates aspects such as as-sessing feasibility, legitimacy, and supportfrom the Hall model. The Web page of The Health Communica- tion Unit (THCU) of the University ofToronto's Centre for Health Promotion (http://www.thcu.ca/infoandresources.htm) also offers practical materials (publi-cations, workshop slides and workbooks,and other print and electronic resources)that can provide guidance to program de-velopers as they advocate for health-promoting policies. \"Policies define andsupport particular values and behaviors,\"the THCU emphasizes in the site's policydevelopment section. \"If implemented well, policy can profoundly influence theway people live and the choices that theymake. In terms of health promotion, poli-cies should make healthier choices easierand unhealthy ones more difficult.\" Effective communication within and between social networks is essential for successful leg-islative and policy formulation and imple-mentation. This ranges from face-to-face orsmall group level to media-based commu-nication. Short advocacy statements and factsheets are other tools that program devel-opers may use to guide their public actionsin support of policies, laws, and programsthat will facilitate the adoption of health-promoting lifestyles among adolescents(Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda et al. 1999). Policy Implementation and Legislation Development The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) promotes the use of risk assessmentand risk management to guide its technicalcooperation activities in the Region of theAmericas and works with its Member Gov-ernments to increase institutional capacityfor the management of health risks. One of the Organization's principal focuses in riskmanagement has been tobacco use preven-tion. Aware that a policy statement regard-ing health risks acquires real significance onlyif it is implemented through legislation,PAHO has published a series of guidelines in which legislation is described as an evolvingprocess that consists of three basic phases:development, implementation, and en-forcement (Pan American Health Organiza-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 232 Identify/describe/analyze the problem Develop policy goals and objectives Identify decision-makers and influencers Draft policy Implement action plan Has policy been adopted?

The guidelines describe various factors that need to be considered whilepreparing the law's specific content: the broader goals of a country's tobacco usereduction strategyThis is considered to be the most impor-tant of the factors, since it defines thecountry goals and the role of legislation/regulation in achieving those goals. scientific evidenceFocusing on empirical, scientifically val- idated evidence of \"what works\" is themost effective way to reduce tobacco useand should guide any tobacco controlstrategy. This type of foundation will notonly ensure effectiveness in achievingthe desired results, but also ensures thatthe law is defensible in the judicial sys-tem if the tobacco industry challenges thelaw on constitutional or other grounds. human or consumer rights perspectiveAny tobacco control legislation shouldinclude provisions to protect human orconsumers' rights (e.g., the right to beinformed about the ingredients of to-bacco products and their harmful ef-fects on health, the right to be protectedfrom second-hand smoke). Additionally, the PAHO guidelines de- scribe several other steps to be consideredduring the legislation development phase: consulting experts to ensure compatibil- ity with constitutional requirementsand other relevant national laws; directly addressing the public , which helps build support, and similarly, creating a communications strategy with fact-based, positive, and persuasivemessages; and anticipating and developing an effective re-sponse to industry or other groups' opposi-tion (e.g., not possible within theproposed time frame\"). These factors should be taken into account not only when developing tobacco controllegislation, but also when formulatingnearly any type of health promotion legis-lation for adolescents (e.g., marketing andsale of alcohol and tobacco products to mi-nors, treatment of teen driving-while-intoxicated violations, gun control legisla-tion, availability of contraceptives andcondoms in youth-friendly health ser-vices). Bartholomew and colleagues(2001) describe several legal and eco-nomic policy instruments, including di-rect spending (e.g., grants, contracts, pro-duction of goods and services), regulationand monitoring (e.g., minimum age for abehavior, fines), and fiscal incentives(e.g., subsidies, taxation, and tax deduc-tions), that may be incorporated intohealth promotion legislation. Research and Evidence of Practical Applications of Policies andLegislation Development toAdolescent Lifestyles According to research studies conducted in the United States, the two policy andlegislative actions that have had the mostYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 234decisive and immediate effects on pre- venting youth smoking are the establish-ment of smoke-free environments andcigarette tax increases (U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services 2000). Ex- isting literature suggests that a 10% in-crease in cigarette taxes leads to approxi-mately a 1%-4% decline in adult smokingand that teenagers are more susceptiblethan adults to the economic pressurescaused by taxation (Glied 2003, Lantz et al.2000). There is also research evidence suggesting that higher cigarette taxes decrease the in-tensity of marijuana use. According to Far-rely and colleagues (2001), a 10% increasein cigarette prices would lead to a 5.4%decrease in total marijuana use, and thiseffect would be greater among males,where a 10% increase in cigarette taxeswould lead to a 10% decrease in total mar-ijuana demand. However, Emery, White,and Pierce (2001) found that price is notsignificantly associated with tobacco ex-perimentation, although it is an importantfactor for more advanced smoking behav-ior among adolescents. Experimentersconsume only sporadically and very fewcigarettes, frequently obtaining themfrom friends. Price becomes relevant onlywhen teens begin smoking enough to buytheir own cigarettes. Sherry Glied (2003),on the other hand, worries that highertaxes only delay smoking initiation with-out having a significant reduction inprevalence rates through adulthood. Shesuggests that efforts to reduce smokingamong teens need to be continued intoadulthood, thereby also promoting adult cessation rather than simply focusing onadolescent initiation. Levy, Cummings, and Hyland (2000) de- veloped a simulation model that supportsGlied's argument. The model predicts thateven if tobacco policies eliminate youthinitiation, the number of smokers wouldnot be halved for more than 30 years, rein-forcing the need for more balanced poli- cies that also increase cessation rates.Lantz and colleagues (2000) conducted acomprehensive review of policies aimed atreducing youth cigarette smoking in theUnited States. Based on the evidencefound, the authors recommend an aggres- sive approach to changing the social con-text of smoking, which would include de-creasing the number of smoking adult rolemodels by emphasizing adult smokingcessation policies and expanding state andlocal clean indoor air laws. They also high-light the need to accelerate the develop-ment and implementation of adolescentsmoking cessation programs. Policies aimed at reducing youth access to tobacco do not show strong evidence of ef-fectiveness. Fichtenberg and Glantz (2002)conducted a rigorous meta-analysis ofnine controlled studies on this topic andfound that there was no evidence that an increase in compliance with youth accessrestrictions was associated with a decreasein youth smoking prevalence. The authorseven suggest that this type of policy has hadtwo negative effects: first, that it has cre-ated an opportunity for the tobacco indus-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 235try to build coalitions with local mer- chants; and secondly, that it has rein-forced the tobacco industry's central mar- keting message that smoking can beattractive to adolescents since it makesthem appear to be more adult. Non-retailsources, such as purchasing from olderpeers or through black markets, borrowingfrom parents or siblings, and stealing,usually increase as retail access is reduced(Levy and Friend 2000). Furthermore,adolescents are generally familiar withlaws and rules about access and possessionfor minors, but consider them ineffective (Crawford et al. 2002). On the other hand,strong local restaurant smoking regula-tions have been associated with reducedenvironmental tobacco smoke exposureamong youth (Siegel et al. 2004). Whilethis finding does not address active behav-ior change on the part of adolescentsthemselves, it does suggest that the exis-tence of strong smoking restrictions inrestaurants and other public places con-tributes to the subliminal \"denormaliza-tion\" of smoking and of its perception asan accepted and widespread behavioralnorm. Not surprisingly, tobacco advertising in- creases tobacco consumption (Saffer andChaloupka 2000). A significant portion ofyouth experimentation with smoking canbe attributed to tobacco marketing cam-paigns and promotional activities, such asgive-aways of free tobacco samples, cloth-ing, sporting equipment, and parapherna-lia for outdoor activities (Pierce et al.1998, Altman et al. 1996). Smoking initia-tion among adolescent girls has been asso- ciated with target advertising towardswomen (Pierce, Lee, and Gilpin 1994).Saffer and Chaloupka (2000) providedempirical evidence of the effect of tobaccoadvertising bans in 22 countries. The re-sults showed that comprehensive bans canreduce tobacco consumption by approxi-mately 6%, but a limited set of advertisingbans will have little or no effect, only re-sulting in substitution by the tobacco in-dustry in the remaining non-bannedmedia. Crawford and colleagues (2002) con- ducted focus groups among 785 adoles-cents, ages 12-19, from different ethnicand socioeconomic backgrounds living in13 different sites across the United States,with the purpose of exploring their re-sponses to potential tobacco control poli-cies. In every focus group in each of the 13sites, only two policies were identified asbeing potentially effective in encouragingthem to stop smoking: a sudden and largeprice increase, and listing ingredientswith common uses. Most agreed that theywould stop buying cigarettes at a price ofUS$ 6 per pack, which was about twice thecurrent price at the time the study wasconducted. The adolescents were familiarwith cigarette prices and knew how andwhere to find the best deals. Participants atall sites felt that warning labels alone areineffective, vague, ambiguous, and/ormeaningless. They were shocked and re-pulsed, however, to find out the commonuses of several potentially harmful sub-stances that are added to cigarettes or thatYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 236occur as a byproduct of burning tobacco, such as those also used to make pesticide,wood stripper, and nail polish remover.During interviews, the adolescents saidthey felt that the general public has a rightto have this information, and they ex-pressed the need to require tobacco com-panies to disclose it on every cigarettepackage and to display it at places wherecigarettes are sold. They added that the in-dustry should be further required to pro-vide complete information on all the addi-tives, identifying them not only by theirchemical names\u2014with which most of theadolescents were unfamiliar\u2014but also bytheir more common names and usages ineveryday life. Policies affecting the price of alcohol have a similar effect on youth alcohol consump-tion. Economists use the concept of price elasticity of demand to describe the per- centage change in consumption resultingfrom a 1% increase in price. For adults, theprice elasticity of demand for beer, wine,and distilled spirits is -0.3%, -1.0%, and-1.5%, respectively (Leung and Phelps1993). This means that a 1% increase inprice reduces beer consumption only by0.3%, but wine by more than three timesthat much and the higher-alcohol-contentdistilled spirits by five times that amount. Chaloupka, Grossman, and Saffer (2002) also reviewed the effect of price on alcoholconsumption and alcohol-related prob-lems among U.S. youth and young adults.These authors describe two scientificallyrigorous studies predicting the effects ofprice on alcohol use by youths ages 16 to 21. Both studies found an inverse relation-ship between beer consumption, beerprice, and the state's minimum legaldrinking age. Price increases had a morepronounced effect on fairly heavy andheavy drinkers than on occasionaldrinkers. Additionally, increases in beertaxes and/or state minimum legal drinkingage were shown to significantly reduceyouth motor vehicle fatalities (Saffer andGrossman 1987). Chaloupka and col-leagues (1993) additionally demonstratedthat increases in the full price of alcohol\u2014whether through tax increases, reducedavailability, and/or increases in the ex-pected legal costs of drinking and driving,including more severe drunk drivinglaws\u2014can reduce drinking and driving andits consequences among all age groups.Grossman and Markowitz (2001) describea 4% reduction in the number of collegestudents involved in violence each yeardue to a 10% alcohol price increase. Theseauthors had also previously demonstratedthat increases in the beer tax can be an ef-fective policy tool in reducing child andadolescent abuse (Markowitz and Gross-man 1998). Policies designed to reduce al-cohol consumption by increasing beertaxes are also associated with a reducednumber of young adult male suicides (ages20-24), although female suicides seemnot to be affected by this policy (Marko-witz, Chatterji, and Kaestner 2003). Although there is striking evidence that increases in the price of alcoholic bever-ages seem to be an effective policy for re-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 237ducing alcohol consumption and its con- sequences, this policy has been largely ig-nored in the United States. Real prices ofalcoholic beverages, after adjusting for theeffects of inflation, have declined signifi-cantly over the past 50 years, and particu-larly in relationship to the prices for otherconsumer goods and services. The princi-pal policy to decrease youth drinking inthe United States has been to increase thestates' minimum legal drinking age to 21years (Chaloupka, Grossman, and Saffer2002). Di Nardo and Lemieux (2001) analyzed the impact of increases in the minimumdrinking age on the prevalence of alcoholand marijuana consumption among lateadolescents from 43 states in the UnitedStates over the years 1980-1989. Duringthis period, the minimum drinking agewas raised in all the states from 18 to 21.The authors found that the policy of in-creasing the legal minimum drinking agedid reduce to some extent the prevalenceof alcohol consumption, but the reduction was also associated with a mild increase inthe prevalence of marijuana use in this ageperiod. Furthermore, between 1991 and2001, the percentage of U.S. youths aged 12to 17 who had tried marijuana increased by10.4%, from 11.5% in 1991 to a peak of21.9% in 2001 (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services 2003b). Farrelly andcolleagues (2001) found that higher finesfor marijuana possession and increased probability of arrest were effective policiesin decreasing the probability of use ofmarijuana among young adults.Several Latin American and Caribbean countries have minimum-age drinkinglaws banning alcohol consumption foradolescents under 16 (Trinidad and To-bago), 18 (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,Honduras, Panama, Peru), or 21 years ofage (Chile), but adolescents in these coun-tries are usually unaware of the legal con-sequences (if any) of trespassing this law.As noted in Chapter One of this book, oneof the obstacles to discouraging alcohol consumption among adolescents is the be-havior's widespread cultural acceptance,reinforced by the media and reflected inthe actions and attitudes of adult rolemodels emulated by adolescents. Thestarting point for the development of poli-cies and legislation in this area, then,should be based on consideration of themost appropriate measures to protectyoung people from the unhealthy effects ofdrinking, to promote a delay in the startingage for alcohol exploration, and to encour-age the adoption of reasonable and re-sponsible drinking behaviors. The partic-ular content of these measures might varyfrom one geographical area to another, de-pending on the severity of teenage drink-ing as a public health problem and thespecific nature of its relationship to motorvehicle accidents, suicides, sexual andphysical violence, and other social phe-nomena to which alcohol consumption hasbeen linked. Another area in which health-promoting policies are needed is that of encouragingadolescents to delay sexual initiation andto adopt safer sex practices. These policiesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 238may range from protecting their right to seek and receive information to teachingthem skills to develop their sexuality inhealthy ways. Policies can help protectthem from sexual coercion and abuse anddefine the range of developmentally ap-propriate confidentiality to which they are entitled when seeking sexual and re-productive health services. It should benoted, however, that adequate counselingmay be severely handicapped if adoles-cents believe that the information theyvolunteer during counseling will not keptin confidence (World Health Organization2002b), and fear that parents may learn oftheir visit to health services is often citedas a reason for not seeking or using ser-vices (especially reproductive health)when needed (Senderowitz 1999). Policies that regulate the price and avail- ability of contraceptives for adolescentswho decide to initiate sexual activity arealso crucial in the efforts to encourageyouth to adopt safer sex practices. Averett,Rees, and Argys (2002) found that makingfamily planning services more availableincreased contraceptive behavior among15-19-year-old U.S. women. Availabilitywas measured by the number of clinics per10,000 women in the county of residence,and a 1-unit increase was associated withan increase of 0.19 in the probability ofusing some form of birth control at last in-tercourse. Denmark has been a pioneer inits effort to reduce abortion among ado-lescent girls. Although Danish law author-izes abortion free of charge before the 12 thweek of pregnancy, the government hasintroduced a series of policies to reduceabortion among adolescents. Since 1970,sex education has been mandatory in Dan-ish schools. All counties are required tohave at least one clinic that provides con-traceptive counseling to adolescents. Jut-land, the county with the lowest teen preg-nancy rate, has introduced a program inwhich all middle adolescents are requiredto visit the county clinic to learn aboutcontraceptives availability and use, preg-nancy avoidance, and abortion reduction.Denmark was able to reduce the number ofteen abortions by 20% within one year ofintroducing these policies (Risor 1989). The introduction of laws in the United States requiring parental involvement in aminor's decision to abort a pregnancy hashad mixed results. Joyce and Kaestner(1996) found that this policy had had noimpact except for nonblack minors of 16years of age in South Carolina and Ten-nessee, a group in which a 10% decline inthe probability of abortion was seen. Levine(2003), on the other hand, found thatparental involvement laws resulted in fewerabortions for minors; this, in turn, had re-sulted from fewer pregnancies, in which thereduction in pregnancy seems to be attrib-utable to increased use of contraceptionrather than a reduction in sexual activity. The research evidence on the effectiveness of different policies to reduce youth vio- lence is much more limited than that forreducing tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 239use, and risky sexual behaviors. Most of the policy and legislation literature is re-lated to domestic violence in the generalpopulation and to protection of minors.The latest report of the U.S. Surgeon Gen-eral on youth violence mentions that anumber of effective intervention and pre-vention programs are available in thisarea. The most successful appear to bethose which combine components ad-dressing both individual risks and envi-ronmental conditions and which includebuilding individual skills and competen-cies, parent effectiveness training, im-proving the social climate of the school,and changes in the type and level of in-volvement in peer groups. However, thereport does not provide any evidence onthe effectiveness of policies and legisla-tion for the prevention of youth violence,suggesting instead that more research isneeded in this area (U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services 2001c). Theabsence of a policy analysis of the potentialimpact of gun control on youth violence isparticularly noteworthy, since at least onestudy (Vittes, Sorenson, and Gilbert 2003)has shown that most high school studentsin the United States favor more restrictivefirearms policies. There is also a gap in the research regard- ing effective policies to promote physicalactivity and healthy nutrition among ado-lescents. Dietz and colleagues (2002) statethat the rapid increase in adolescent over-weight between 1980 and 1999 can only beexplained by environmental factors andthat there is a need to expand the science base linking environmental conditionsand policies to youth health behaviors. The Ontario Public Health Association, through the Heart Health Resource Centre(Ontario Heart Health and Nutrition Re-sources Centres 2002), has recently pub-lished Policies in Action, a collection of in- ternational, national, and local policiesthat community health policy developersin other parts of the world may wish to useas a template during the writing stage of their own healthy policies. Policies in Ac- tion describes a series of youth-favoring policies to promote physical activity,including: ensuring that communities have acces-sible and safe opportunities to engage in physical activity, including reduc-ing barriers to and facilitating envi-ronmental support for physical activ-ity (e.g., implementing bicycle rackrequirements for new buildings, mak-ing cities more accessible by foot or bicycle, ensuring proper sidewalk construction/repair, improving streetlighting); mandating quality daily physical activity(30 minutes a day) for students at theelementary and secondary levels; mandating comprehensive health edu-cation (i.e., development of healthylifestyles) for elementary and secondarylevel students; and providing extracurricular physical ac-tivity programs that address the needsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 240and interests of all students, taking into account gender, ethnic, and culturalconsiderations. Policies in Action also offers a number of youth-favoring policies to promote healthy eating. Among these are: providing dietary guidance; increasing healthy food choices/reducing unhealthy food choices inschool cafeterias; reducing the promotion/advertising ofunhealthy food choices to pre- and earlyadolescents; increasing taxes on non-nutritioussnacks; modifying pricing policies to promotehealthy food choices; mandating nutrition education in ele-mentary and secondary level schools; reimbursing for nutrition counseling;and regulating nutrition information (e.g.,labeling). As this chapter has indicated, the re- sponsibility for the development ofcomprehensive, well-integrated health-promoting policies for adolescents willoften need to be shared among various in- terests and/or sectors. These includehealth, education, justice, finance, agri-culture, sports and recreation, transporta-tion and urban development, commerceand industry, housing, and labor. One ex-ample worth noting within this context isthe Government of the Netherlands, inwhich youth policy is part of the portfolioof the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport, and other government departmentshave worked jointly with the Ministry tocreate the general policy framework. ThisMinistry also coordinates youth researchand the reorganization of the youth healthcare system, the promotion of healthylifestyles, local preventive youth policy,parenting and development support, vol-untary youth work/national youth organi-zations, day care and after-school care,sports and cultural development, andyouth civic participation. The Ministry ofEducation, Cultural Affairs, and Scienceoversees policies to discourage studentsfrom dropping out of school, to provideeducational opportunities for disadvan-taged youth, and to promote safe schoolprojects. The Ministry of Justice has poli-cies targeting youth crime prevention,youth care/protection, ethnic minoritiesand youth crime, and metropolitan youthsafety. The Ministry of the Interior andKingdom Relations supports metropolitanyouth safety and ethnic minorities andyouth crime prevention, and the Ministryof Social Affairs and Employment estab- lishes minimum youth wages, oversees ayouth employment guarantee act and lawsand regulations on working conditions,and provides other types of incentives foryouth employment. \"Youth policy [in the Netherlands],\" notes its developers, \"does not only deal with thewell-being and participation of youngpeople, but also with education, employ-ment opportunities, (mental) health care,pre-school education, safety, sports, andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR | 241culture. Youth policy forms a horizontal layer across society: all the underlying pol-icy areas contribute . . . to achieve bettercoherence and collaboration between thevarious policy areas and the associated ad-ministrative layers, so as to arrive at a bet-ter youth policy\" (NIZW InternationalCentre 2001). Since 1996, Bolivia and the Dominican Republic have approved comprehensivenational policies that incorporate strongadolescent health components, includingreproductive health. Bolivia approved anational youth policy in October 1998,and its president issued a decree on youthin February 1999. The Dominican Repub-lic formally approved a national youthpolicy in January 1998 and enacted a youthlaw in August 2000. In both countries,strong national leadership was instru-mental in moving the policy implementa-tion process forward. Other keys to suc-cess were having effective intersectoralcoordination, consistent support frominternational agencies, and the availabil-ity of reliable information regardingyouth needs and behaviors, as well asbeing able to take advantage of windows ofopportunities, mobilize the youth vote,and forge a strong involvement by youthand civil society in the policy process. Ad-equate funding for implementation, how-ever, has been a persistent problem inboth countries, with the severity of thefunding constraint being greater in Bo- livia (Rosen 2001). Table 24-1. presents a breakdown of the number of studies found on the effect ofpolicies and legislation on adolescenthealth behaviors. As seen in Table 24-1., much of the evi- dence on the effectiveness of policies andlegislation in changing adolescent behaviorlies in the area of tobacco, alcohol, and ille-gal drug use. Perhaps surprisingly, the areasof physical activity and nutrition and vio- lence are the least researched, despite thefact that the prevalence of obesity and gangviolence is on the rise in many parts of theworld. The paucity of research literatureavailable on these issues could be an indica-tion that insufficient policy work has beendone in these areas, or it could mean thatthe evidence base for \"what works\" in termsof existing policies and laws is still too small. In either case, the resulting gap sug-gests an area for future work by both policy-makers and public health researchers, who,buttressed by a cross-section of interestedstakeholders, might approach this gap uti-lizing community organization strategiessimilar to those described in ChapterTwenty-two of this book.

Summary of Policy and Legislation Effects on Adolescent Lifestyles Price increases have a more pronounced ef- fect on fairly heavy and heavy drinkers thanon light drinkers. Increases in the price of alcohol have alsobeen associated with reductions in thenumber of college students involved in violent acts. Policies designed to reduce alcohol consump-tion by increasing beer taxes have been asso-ciated with a reduced number of suicidesamong males ages 20-24. Increasing the legal minimum drinking agehas been shown to reduce the prevalence ofalcohol consumption among late adolescents,but at the same time it has been associatedwith a mild increase in the prevalence of mar-ijuana use in this age group. Higher fines for marijuana possession and increased probability of arrest have beenshown to be effective policies in decreasingthe probability of marijuana use among young adults. Fear that the information they volunteerduring counseling will not be kept confi-dential and that parents may learn of theirvisit is often cited by adolescents as a reason why they do not seek health ser-vices, especially those related to reproduc-tive health issues. Making family planning services more avail-able can increase contraceptive behavior,particularly among girls during middle and late adolescence. Most high school students in the UnitedStates favor the creation of more restrictivefirearms policies .According to research studies conducted in the United States, the two most effectivepolicy and legislation actions to prevent youthsmoking are the establishment of smoke-freeenvironments and cigarette tax increases.There is also evidence to suggest that highercigarette taxes decrease the intensity ofmarijuana use. Price is not significantly associated with to-bacco experimentation, although it is an im-portant factor for more advanced smokingbehavior among adolescents. Policies aimed at reducing youth access totobacco do not show strong evidence ofeffectiveness. Tobacco advertising increases tobacco con- sumption: a significant portion of youth exper-imentation with smoking can be attributed totobacco marketing campaigns and promo-tional activities, particularly the provision offree tobacco samples, clothing, sportingequipment, and paraphernalia for outdooractivities. Comprehensive bans on tobacco advertisingcan reduce tobacco consumption by approxi-mately 6%, but a limited and selective set ofbans will have little or no effect at all. Adolescents have identified two policies asbeing potentially effective in encouragingthem to stop smoking: a sudden and largeprice increase, and the listing of chemicaladditives on cigarette packaging and ondisplays where tobacco products are sold. U.S. studies have shown an inverse relation-ship between beer consumption, beer price,and the state's minimum legal drinking ageamong young people. Increases in beer taxes and/or state minimumlegal drinking age have been shown to signifi-cantly reduce youth motor vehicle fatalities.Of all the theories and models reviewed in Chapters Twenty-two through Twenty- four to promote change at the community and policy levels, the level of policy and legislation development (Chapter Twenty-four) has been the most utilized to address adolescent behaviors, particularly those involving tobacco, alcohol, and drugprevention efforts, as well as unprotected sex behaviors. Interestingly, even though todaywe are witnessing an emerging epidemic of obesity among children and adolescents insome parts of the world, comparatively little research has been conducted on the promo-tion of physical activity and healthy nutrition at the community and policy and legislationdevelopment levels, despite the fact that studies abound describing the effects of inter-ventions at these two levels designed to achieve the same results among the adult popu-lation. Also of interest is the research gap at these two levels regarding youth violenceprevention, given the fact that the majority of instances of violence reported in the mediaoccur among adolescents and youth. Once again, research studies to date have tended tofocus on the general population, and very few have attempted to address the needs of young people in this area. The significant variance in the number of articles researching the different adolescent behaviors might hopefully serve to raise eyebrows in the public health and social sciencesresearch communities, given the fact that often alcohol use, unprotected sexual activity,and interpersonal violence cluster together, not only among adults, but also among ado-lescents and youth. This worrisome situation may be a sign of ongoing and excessivelyfragmented research, in which experts in the various behavior specializations have failed[Chapter Twenty-five ] At a Glance: The Community and Policy Level Theories and Models for Behavior Change YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE | 245 Community Organization Models 39 76 6 22 143 Diffusion of Innovations Theory, Behavior 39 54 10 2 105 Change Communication Models,and Social Marketing Models of Policy and Legislation 50 153 10 20 233 Development Total 128 283 26 44 481to interact with colleagues focusing on other behaviors and thereby produce moreinterdisciplinary research. At the sametime, many researchers have primarily fo-cused their behavioral change research onadult subjects, and, as we have seenthroughout this book, the approaches thathave proven most effective among one agegroup are not necessarily successfulamong younger cohorts whose physical,cognitive, and socio-emotional develop-ment is still incomplete. Clearly, there is aneed to more closely integrate researchacross behaviors and also heed differencesin expected results between adult and ado-lescent research, including differencesdistinguishing the various developmentalstages within adolescence. This gap pre-sents an important opportunity for ado-lescent health and development expertsthroughout the world to assume a leader-ship role in forming interdisciplinaryresearch teams that can work together toreverse today's current trends of frag- mentation and draw attention to theunique developmental needs and wants ofeach stage of adolescence. Table 25-1. illustrates the ideas presented above and summarizes the number ofstudies using the theories and mod-els discussed in Chapters Twenty-two through Twenty-four according to healthbehaviors. When the community and policy level re- sults shown in Table 25-1. are comparedwith their counterparts in Table 21-1. (in-terpersonal level theories and models) andTable 15-1. (individual level theories and models), it becomes apparent that the dis-proportionate number of studies based onmodels of policy and legislation develop-ment, most notably in the area of tobacco,alcohol, and drug use, is a reflection ofprevention efforts by local and national Number of Articles on Adolescence and Community and Policy Sexual and Tobacco, PhysicalLevel Behavior Change Reproductive Alcohol, and Activity andTheories and Models Health Drug Use Nutrition Violence TotalTable 25-1. Summary of Most Commonly Researched Community and Policy Level Theories and Models for Changing Adolescent BehaviorsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION TWO | 246governments. As we have seen in earlier chapters, these behaviors have also beenresearched far more than sexual and re-productive health, physical activity andnutrition, and violence at the individualand interpersonal levels, as well. These re-sults are shown in Table 25-2. below. Figure 25-1. shows the different emphases placed on research at the different ecolog-ical levels for the four adolescent behav-iors and reveals that most of the researchon one of the lesser-studied behaviorgroups\u2014physical activity and nutrition\u2014has occurred at the individual level. Thisfinding indicates that an increase in phys-ical activity and the adoption of healthiernutrition that adolescents have achievedon an individual basis have received moreresearch attention, and that much less is known and/or has been reported asregards the impact of interactive (i.e., in-terpersonal) health-promoting interven- tions, as well as community-wide initia-tives, policies, and legislation to changethese behaviors. It is also interesting to note that, as shown in Table 25-2. and Figure 25-1., in the areaof sexual and reproductive health, the ma- jority of theories and models studied havebeen at the community and policy levels,while in the area of violence, much of theresearch has focused on the interpersonallevel, and, as earlier stated, tobacco, alco-hol, and drug use by adolescents have re-ceived the most attention at the policy andlegislation development level. Table 25-3. provides a summary of the health promotion and behavior changetheories and models discussed in ChaptersTwenty-two through Twenty-four and the most salient characteristics of each.

Community-building is a newer type of com-munity organization model whoseapproach is considered to bemore strengths- than Community coalitions,also newer long-lasting alliances of individualsrepresenting diverse organiza-tions, factions, or constituencieswithin a community. Several keyconcepts are shared by thesevarious approaches and are cen-tral to effect and measure com-munity level change: empower-ment, critical consciousness,community capacity, communityparticipation, and issue selection.Media advocacy and communica-tion for social change also haveemerged as important tools forfacilitating community organiza-tion towards change. The Diffusion of Innovations The- ory deals with the introduction ofa new idea, practice, method,device, or object and the processby which this innovation is com-municated through specific chan-nels over time to its intended tar-get audience. The theoryfocuses on both the characteris-tics of the particular innovation(e.g., a new school-based to-bacco prevention program) andhow the innovation will be com-municated to its intended audi-ence (e.g., early adolescents).The timeframe and adoption leveltobacco prevention activities, which in turn have encouragedand increased youth empower-ment, positive development, civicinvolvement, and leadership anddecision-making responsibilities.In contrast, most of the interven-tions to date involving youth insexual and reproductive healthprevention programs have limitedtheir participation to use as peereducators or as outreach agentsto provide the prevention ser-vices, while at the same time ex-cluding their involvement in theprograms' assessment and plan-ning phases. Similarly, commu-nity coalitions to prevent teenpregnancy rarely incorporateyouth as active participants inthe project development and im-plementation stages. A series offactors associated with success-ful neighborhood mobilization inthis area, however, include astrong sense of community,consensus on the perceivedneed for the initiative, support by key organizations, sharedleadership, effective group action processes, and a com-petent staff contingent. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory has demonstrated its effi-cacy in scaling up health promo-tion and prevention programs foradolescents. However, most ofits documented applications todate have been in the expansionof tobacco initiation andHIV/AIDS prevention programsas part of a school health cur-riculum. Yet the adoption andimplementation of school healthpromotion curricula by school-teachers have presented chal-lenges of their own. This is par-ticularly the case for sexualinformation could, in turn, pro- vide the backdrop for well-designed interventions and pro-grams that would be responsiveto their problems and goals at theparticular point where they arecurrently in their lives. Commu-nity organization models providea strategy to involve not onlyconcerned adults in the commu-nity in issues of youth develop-ment and potential health-compromising behaviors, but alsothe youth themselves, during theassessment and planningphases. These phases should in-volve not only motivated youthwithout risky behaviors, but alsothose who have already been af-fected by health-compromisingexperiences (e.g., gang mem-bership, pregnancy, addictive behaviors). Concepts such ascommunity-building could also be integrated into the work ofdevelopmental assets (ChapterNineteen), in which youth partici-pation would be essential inidentifying community networksthat could help them strengthenindividual capacity to resisthealth-compromising behaviorsand lifestyles. The Diffusion of Innovations Theory holds great potential inhelping to scale up effective in-terventions that promote theadoption of healthy behaviors orchange of risk behaviors amongadolescents in a variety of set-tings, including not only schools,but also community organiza-tions, sports clubs, and otherplaces where youth frequent andspend their time. As new initia-tives of this type are being devel-oped and their effectivenesstested, followed by plans for ascaling up of programs, those YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE | 249Table 25-3.

Behavior changecommunication is a multi-level in-tervention, using a variety ofcommunication channels, to dis-tribute tailored health messagesto individuals and communities.Social marketing theory predictsthat target market members(e.g., adolescents) will voluntarilyexchange their resources (e.g.,money, time) for a product whenthey become aware that the in-novation offers them attractivebenefits at a reasonable cost orprice and that it is available atthe right place and at the righttime. Diffusion of innovations,behavior change communication,and social marketing are comple-mentary theories and modelswhich serve as instruments toreach different population levels,through various channels, withthe unifying goal of scaling upeffective health promotion andprevention interventions.education, where personal be- liefs may interfere with the fi-delity of the curricula implemen-tation. In contrast to thisapproach, behavior change com-munication and social marketinghave been widely used to diffusehealth messages through multi-media channels that young peo-ple find appealing and to whichthey often turn as a source forreliable information and enter-tainment. Entertainment-education has been identified asan effective behavior changecommunication model. Its effec-tiveness is attributed to its focuson the emotional as well as cog-nitive factors that influence be-havior, and by being closelyaligned with the customs, norms,and narrative forms that are fa-miliar to the target audiences.Research has also shown thatentertainment-education pro-gramming with social changemessages is a cost-effectivemethod for reaching large audi-ences. There is also evidencethat social marketing techniqueshave contributed to the effective-ness of anti-smoking advertisingcampaigns. These have beenshown to have a reliable positiveeffect among pre- and early ado-lescents by preventing smokinginitiation. The evidence alsopoints out that family and peerinteractions play a crucial role inreinforcing, denying, or neutraliz-ing the potential effects of theseanti-smoking campaigns.involved in this process should keep in mind that the degree oflong-term cooperation and cohe-sion among the team that devel-oped the innovation (e.g., de-signers of a health promotionintervention targeting preadoles-cent males through local soccerclubs), the potential user sys-tems (e.g., soccer coaches atlocal clubs in each neighbor-hood), and interactsdirectly with soccer coaches bytraining them in the intervention'sappropriate implementation) will,to a large extent, determine theinitiative's overall effectiveness inachieving the expected results. Although BCC and social mar- keting might appear to be moreattractive strategies to use inscaling up health behavior mes-sages directed toward adoles-cents, it is important to not con-fuse these strategies with thechannels (e.g., media) or set-tings (e.g., schools) that areused most commonly to intro-duce the innovative messages.To date, no magic bullet has emerged that clearly demon-strates its effectiveness in reach-ing a wide range of adolescents,which may consist of differentage groups, genders, and cul-tures, through the use of onlyone strategy applied in only onesetting. A synergistic approachthat integrates effective multi-media social campaigns with thescaling up of evidence-based in-terventions in the school environ-ment and at the community levelholds promise, however, as apossible direction to be exploredand tested in the future.

Community and Policy Level Theories and Models and Their Application to Adolescent Behavioral Change: A Comparison of Conceptual Frameworks, Applications, and Benefits \u2014(continued) Theory/Model Conceptual Framework Application Benefits Models of Policy and LegislationDevelopment(Chapter Twenty-four)Policies are frameworks that guide decision-making in an or-ganization or government, de-scribed in statements of intendedaction and sometimes constitut-ing an element in a network ofinterrelated decisions, which to-gether form a comprehensive ap-proach or strategy in relation topractical issues (e.g., health caredelivery). The stages in the policy-making process include issuedefinition, setting objectives andpriorities, defining options, op-tions appraisal, policy implemen-tation, and policy evaluation. Apolicymaker's freedom to act willbe constrained at various differentstages during the policy-makingprocess, and policy developmentwill be ultimately determined bywho influences whom in themaking of policy, and how thiscomes about. Policies may bedifferentiated between macro policies (high political issues) and micro policies (low political issues). An issue becomes partof the policy agenda only when ithas high legitimacy, feasibility , andsupport. Governments pay attention to policies only when amajor window of opportunityopens up simultaneously in eachof three \"streams\": the problem,the politics, and the policy. Therole of the policy advocate is tocreate, monitor, and capitalize onthese opportunities. There is significant research evi- dence regarding how variouspolicies and types of legislationmay help to prevent tobacco andalcohol initiation, as well as druguse, among adolescents. In theUnited States, the two policy andlegislative actions that have hadthe most decisive and immediateeffects on preventing youthsmoking are the establishmentof smoke-free environments andcigarette tax increases. However,policies aimed at reducing youthaccess to tobacco do not showstrong evidence of effectiveness.Increases in beer taxes and/orstate minimum legal drinking agehave been shown to significantlyreduce youth motor vehicle fatal-ities. There is also evidence thatmaking family planning servicesmore available can increase con-traceptive behavior, particularlyamong girls during middle andlate adolescence.The adoption of evidence-based policies and legislation could sig-nificantly contribute to the pro-motion of healthy behaviorsamong adolescents and the pre-vention of health-compromisinglifestyles. Although ideally behav-ior change should be voluntary,regulatory measures are neces-sary when specific behaviors be-come a threat to the collectivehealth and well-being of thecommunity as a whole. This isthe case with second-handsmoke exposure, excessive alco-hol drinking and its related con-sequences (e.g., reckless driv-ing, interpersonal violence), andavailability of firearms. Policiesare also essential to facilitatevoluntary choices and to over-come potential barriers to be-havior adoption (e.g., throughavailability of condoms and con-traceptives, recreation facilitiesfor increased physical activity,plentiful and affordable healthyfoods). Many health promotersagree that policies, whethercommunity-based or emanatingfrom the national government,are key to instilling positive ado-lescent behavior change, reason-ing that if the policies are wellimplemented, they can pro-foundly influence the way peoplelive, by making healthier choiceseasier and unhealthy choicesmore difficult.[Section Three] Adolescent Developmental Changes and Goals: The Importance of EarlyInterventionYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE | |SECTION THREE | 254Introduction While many of the classical behavioral change and health promotion theories and mod- els presented in the first two sections of this book hold great potential in their applica-bility to adolescent health concerns, they represent only part of the puzzle in designingeffective interventions. Section Three will present a series of other considerations thathave received less attention, yet are critical ingredients that may determine success orfailure in the achievement of the intervention's desired result. These missing pieces in-clude consideration of the various adolescent developmental stages and their accompa-nying physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional changes; the pre- and early adolescent'schanging needs and wants; the impact of early intervention; gender differences within adevelopmental context; and how the achievement of developmental goals contributes tothe adolescent's ability to adopt protective, health-promoting behaviors. Another piece of the puzzle often overlooked by intervention designers is the fact that be- havior change theories have been traditionally developed by behavior learning theoristswho tend to focus more on analyzing cognitive aspects of behaviors rather than the under- lying emotional and developmental processes of behavior. Therefore, as noted in Chapters Six and Sixteen, learning theorists consider the basic processes of human behavior to bethe same during adolescence as they are during other periods of life. Chapter Six pointsout the flaws of a \"theories-only\" approach to adolescent health interventions and dis-cusses the need to link theoretical constructs to the particular developmental stage of the adolescent target group, a strategy whose importance has already been emphasized inhealth promotion literature (Juszczak and Sadler 1999, Dryfoos 1998). Yet for far toolong, this crucial link has been ignored or underutilized\u2014a key message of this book\u2014anda phenomenon also observed by various other authors (Mummery, Spence, and Hudec2000; Bush 1996; Sturges and Rogers 1996; Petosa and Jackson 1991). To understand and be able to influence adolescent behavior, it is important to under- stand the world in which adolescents live and how that world affects their development,behavior, and social relationships. These contexts\u2014family, peer groups, school, work,and leisure settings\u2014are at the same time in a state of constant flux. In Chapter Four, thecomplexity of these multiple levels of influence is highlighted, as is the need to choosetheories that blend individual and environmental approaches, in view of the interactionswithin and between these multiple settings and their continually evolving dynamics. InYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | 255this sense, says Dr. Laurence Steinberg, \"we need to understand how these changes are changing the nature of adolescence\" (Steinberg 1999). Aware of the challenges in developing effective interventions and programs to instill health-promoting behaviors in young people, the Pan American Health Organizationpresents the Youth: Choices and Change Model in Chapter Seven. The framework's com-ponents\u2014a developmental and gender perspective, the identification of adolescentneeds and wants as well as those of other actors, a problem-driven psychological ap-proach to select appropriate theories, intervention at the individual level supported byinputs from other levels of influence, and the development of measurable variables en-abling problem assessment and outcome evaluation\u2014together form a roadmap allowinghealth promotion initiatives to not only target specific adolescent health behavior deter-minants, but also promote the strengthening of developmental capacities, focusing onthe critical preadolescent and early adolescent periods and the development of skills andassets instead of preventing deficits or overcoming problems. The nature of the begin-ning of adolescence and why interventions during this period hold the greatest potentialfor positive and sustained behavior change will be the focus of Section Three. The word adolescence is Latin in origin, derived from the verb adolecere , which means \"to grow into adulthood\" (Steinberg 1999). In all societies, adolescenceis a time of evolution and maturation; of moving from the less developed cogni- tive skills and emotional experiences of childhood toward the\u2014ideally\u2014fully developedcognitive skills and more emotionally balanced experiences of adulthood. Adolescence isa period of transitions: biological, psychological, social, and economic. Although there issignificant literature analyzing this period from different perspectives, there is littleagreement on when adolescence begins and ends, and what the boundaries for this de-termination are (Steinberg 1999). A biologist might place the greatest emphasis on theattainment and completion of puberty; an attorney might look instead at important agebreaks designated by law; an educator might focus on cognitive skills levels among stu-dents in different grades in school. Among adolescents themselves, acquiring such abil-ities as assuming responsibility for their own actions and making their own decisions aregenerally seen as more important considerations distinguishing adulthood from adoles-cence than more role-related transitions (e.g., using public transportation alone, finish-ing high school). Of the role-related transitions, being able to support oneself financiallyis viewed as the most important defining criterion of adulthood by adolescents them-selves (Arnett 1994). Although adolescence may span 10 years or more, most social scientists and practition- ers recognize that, given the significant psychological and social growth that takes placeduring this decade, it makes more sense to view the adolescent years more as a series of[Chapter Twenty-six] A New Approach to Classifying Adolescent Developmental StagesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 258phases than as one homogeneous stage (Steinberg 1999). In this sense, interestsand tastes regarding music, televisionprograms, movies, and magazines read, aswell as the range of problems shared withfriends, will be completely different for an11-year-old than for a 13- or 15-year-old,as we will see in Chapters Twenty-eightand Twenty-nine of this book. Different authors and organizations have proposed different ways of dividing thislong period of adolescence. Furthermore,there is little agreement on this matter.Some sources refer to 11-year-old boys orgirls as callthem \"early adolescents,\" as shown inTable 26-1. The authors and entities depicted in Table 26-1. are merely a small and somewhatrandom sample of those who have pro-duced textbooks and other types of infor-mational resources that are widely con-sulted by professionals working withadolescents. When seen together, thesesources provide a clear illustration of theongoing disagreement that exists regard-ing developmental classifications by age.Dan Acuff is the author of What Kids Buy and Why, an excellent resource for better understanding the marketing strategiesthat the corporate world utilizes to reachthe adolescent consumer population. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preven-tion (CDC) (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services 2004) has developed Table 26-1.

Campaign de-velopers refer to the preadolescent stage as\"tweens,\" a term also used by Acuff. On the other hand, the U.S. National YouthAnti-Drug Media Campaign, in its publi-cation on the scientific and situationalbases for the Campaign's strategy (U.S.Office of National Drug Control Policy2002b) refers to 9-11-year-olds as earlyadolescents. Other sources in Table 26-1. include Lau- rence Steinberg, the Distinguished Uni-versity Professor and Laura H. CarnellProfessor of Psychology at Temple Univer-sity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with aPh.D. in human development and familystudies. Steinberg is the author of Ado- lescence (1999), a very comprehensive textbook on this age group. LawrenceNeinstein is Professor of Pediatrics andMedicine at the University of SouthernCalifornia (USC), with a specialty in ado-lescent medicine. He is also ExecutiveDirector of the USC University Park HealthCenter and author of the excellent text-book Adolescent Health Care: A Practical Guide (Neinstein 2002). Linda Juszczak and Lois Sadler are the authors of \"Ado-lescent Development: Setting the Stage forInfluencing Health Behaviors,\" an out-standing review on this topic published inAdolescent Medicine: State of the Art Reviews (Juszczak and Sadler 1999). All of these in-dividuals are widely recognized and pub-lished research authorities in the area ofadolescent health and development. As noted in this book's Foreword, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)and the World Health Organization havedefined adolescence as the period be-tween 10 and 19 years of age, youth as theperiod between 15 and 24 years of age, andthe young population as the period be-tween 10 and 24 years of age. Traditionalapproaches to dividing adolescent stagescorrespond in general to the way in whichsociety groups young people in educa-tional institutions (i.e., elementary, mid-dle, high school, university, as well as individual school grades). As an exam-ple, the U.S. National Youth Anti-DrugMedia Campaign also refers to its primaryyouth target audience as middle school- aged adolescents (11-13 years old) and to its secondary youth audiences as late ele- mentary school-aged children (9-11 years old) and high school-aged adolescents (14-18 years old) (U.S. Office of NationalDrug of Control Policy 2002c). Neverthe-less, this approach can differ enormouslyfrom culture to culture and country tocountry, and it does not adequately ad-dress the situation of adolescents in manyparts of the world who do not attendschool at all. However, there is agreement on three fea- tures of adolescent development thatoccur universally. These are: YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 260 the onset of puberty; the emergence of more advanced cogni- tive abilities; and the transition into new roles in society. Without exception, all adolescents in every society go through these three stages (Hill1983). These features have been furtherorganized under the categories of the bio-logical, cognitive, and socio-emotionalchanges which accompany each (Steinberg1999). These universal features do not occur at a specific given point in time, thus separat-ing childhood from adolescence, but in-stead introduce themselves gradually overthe continuum of the adolescence period.The accompanying biological, cognitive,and socio-emotional changes also increasein complexity as the adolescent movesfrom one developmental stage to the next. Steinberg and Morris (2001) conducted a literature review for the publications onadolescent development released between 1988 and 2001. The main conclusion thatemerged from this review, according to theauthors, is the need for a comprehensivetheory of both normative and atypical ado-lescent development that would integratethe current collection of \"mini-theories\"that explain only fragments of the largerpuzzle. Traditionally, adolescent development has been divided into three main categories\u2014early, middle, and late adolescence\u2014without a clear understanding of wherethey start and where they end. The mostagreed-upon starting point has been pu-berty age, marked by the menarche mile-stone for girls and full genital develop-ment for boys. Adolescent developmenthas also been described within the frame-work of different theories focusing onspecific areas of development (e.g., psy-chodynamic theories on emotional devel-opment, the work of Harry Stack Sullivanon interpersonal development, Jean Piaget (1) Onset of puberty (2) Emergence of more advanced cognitive abilities (3) Transition into new roles in societyBiological Changes Cognitive Changes Socio-emotional ChangesFigure 26-1. Universal Features of Adolescent DevelopmentYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX | 261on cognitive development, Erik Erickson on psychosocial development, LawrenceKohlberg on moral development, andCarol Gillberg on gender differences andfemale development). In addition, UrieBronfenbrenner's The Ecology of Human Development (1979) has contributed to a better understanding of the impact of theenvironmental context on adolescent de-velopment and behavior. Although each one of these theorists has left a major legacy, development is a com-plex phenomenon, and in the final analy-sis, all elements must be integrated into atheory of the whole person. Furthermore,significant findings have emerged in re-cent years from the impact of the environ-ment, as well as from other studies onsensation-seeking theory, brain develop-ment, information-processing, and neu-ropsychological functioning. There is aparticularly urgent need to integrate thesefragmented findings into a comprehensivemodel of adolescent development. A theoryof the whole person\u2014one that can explain the needed changes and competencies ateach developmental period to successfullynegotiate the challenges of increasinglycomplex social, cultural, and economicenvironments\u2014continues to elude re-searchers. There is a need, then, for morecomprehensive and in-depth research,analysis, and descriptions of the differentstages of adolescence, to enable us to better understand the different needs and wants and developmental goals of adoles- cents, as they progress through this longtransition. Table 26-2. presents a new approach de- veloped by PAHO to classifying adolescentstages. This classification organizes pro-gressive adolescent stages, starting withpreadolescence and ending with youngadulthood, according to the changes thattraditionally occur between 10-24 years ofage, into five domains: body, brain, sexual,emotional, and social development. Thisapproach is a first attempt to integrate themost recent and still somewhat frag-mented contributions of different theoriesin an evolutionary approach which PAHOand the authors of this book hope willstimulate the further refinement of theo-retical constructs promoting the perspec-tive of the whole person and the adoptionof this lens to study adolescents as they navigate through the successive growthand developmental stages. The age range for each of the adolescent de- velopment stages, as shown in Table 26-2.,correlates to the average ages at which thedevelopmental changes occur in these fivedomains, taking also in consideration fre-quently described gender differences forthe earlier stages. However, there will al-ways be exceptions to the age segmentationboundaries, with extremely precociousadolescents at one extreme and their late-maturing counterparts at the other. Partic-ular differences will be found for sexual de-velopment and behaviors, the domain inwhich the environment holds significantimpact. Abma and Sonenstein (2001), forexample, have noted that environmentalfactors such as level of education, income,and access to health care account for manyYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 262 Table 26-2.

The classic example is for conservation of quantity, in which the child is asked to estimate which cylinder has more wa ter, the tallest and thinnest or the shortest and widest (both having the same amount). The concept of weight conservation is acquired at ages 9-12 years (Lewis 1997). 2The described orderly progression of sexual activity varies among races, regional areas, and socioeconomic status (e.g., Africa n-Americans move toward intercourse at an earlier age and without as many intervening steps as their other U.S. counterparts). Boys engage in these activities at a somewhat earlier age than girls. Differences will also be attributable to eth- nic culture, religious beliefs, and other factors that vary around the world.YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 264 Table 26-2.

For the reasons presented in the preceding paragraphs, at the current time, disagree-ment continues among developmental re-searchers about what would constitute adefinitive classification, although mostwould agree that the development of an instrument capable of measuring specific body, brain, social, emotional, sexual, and other similar changes wouldsignify tremendous progress toward beingable to safely and accurately establish agedelineations based on these indicators.This direction for future research will mostlikely yield important baselines uponwhich to construct effectively targeted, de-velopmentally appropriate adolescenthealth promotion interventions. In themeantime, until an instrument of this typeis developed, program designers will needto rely on the current age classifications,which, albeit imperfect and perhaps in-complete, nonetheless provide importanceguidance in planning and implementinginterventions tailored to the different ado-lescent developmental stages. Adolescence is a stage of life when, with the exception of infancy, the body growsand changes more dramatically than at anyother point in life. As adolescents becomebiologically capable of reproduction andsexual arousal, issues related to sexual ori-entation become one of their principalconcerns. Throughout adolescence, rea-soning capabilities rise to new levels ofcomplexity, accompanied by a greater so- phistication in language skills, the possi-bility of more advanced moral develop-ment, and improved abilities in overallorganization, self-regulation, time man-agement, and impulse control. With thesedevelopmental tools, adolescents interactwith others, expose themselves to new ex-periences and lifestyle choices, build theiridentity, and find their role in society,during a period in which parental influ-ence is decreasing and exposure to peer,media, and cultural influences is continu-ally increasing. The stage progression is not simply bio- logically determined, but also depends onthe joint interactive effect of both envi-ronmental experience and endogenousfactors, as shown in Figure 26-2. Further-more, the speed with which an individualprogresses through these stages andachieves certain developmental tasks de-pends upon individual biological differ-ences, cognitive abilities, and educational,emotional, and life experiences, as well asthe cultural and social contexts in whichthe progression occurs. The effect of socialinteractions on cognitive processes anddevelopment has been well delineated byL.S. Vygotsky (1978). He uses the term zone of proximal development to describe the dif- ference between an adolescent's actual de-velopment and his or her level of potentialdevelopment when given the opportunityto engage in problem-solving with theguidance of parents, other adults (e.g.,teachers), or more expert peers (e.g., peereducators). The critical role of positiveYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 266 affect and emotions in these types of social interactions was later introduced byGreenspan (1997a). According to Bronfenbrenner (1979), \"the psychological impact of the biologi-cal, cognitive, and social changes of ado-lescence is shaped by the environment in which the changes take place.\" Psycholog-ical development during adolescence is aproduct of the interplay between the verybasic and universal changes (body, brain,social, emotional, and sexuality) and thecontexts (families, peer groups, school Preadolescence Early adolescence Middle adolescence Late adolescence Youth Young adulthoodSocioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factorsBiological factors Interaction with peers and adults (family, school, neighborhood)Source: adapted with permission from The Functional Emotional Assessment Scale (FEAS): Clinical and Research Appli- cations, by S.I.

Factors in Adolescent Stage ProgressionYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX | 267and work environment, and leisure set- tings) in which these changes take place.The contexts of adolescence are, in turn,themselves shaped and defined by thelarger society in which young people live. Growing up under adversity (e.g., extreme poverty, domestic violence, parental men-tal illness, loss of one or both parents, cat-astrophic events, political violence, civilwar) has been associated with an earliertransition into adult roles and behaviors.However, whether \"earlier\" signifies \"bet-ter\" is a matter of some debate. Growingup in poverty, for example, may pro-foundly impair youngsters' ability to tran- sition easily from adolescence into adult-hood. Poverty is associated with failure inschool, unemployment, and early preg-nancy, all of which contribute to transitiondifficulties (Steinberg 1999). Throughout the various developmental stages, adolescents will not only need toadjust to and assimilate the universalchanges depicted in Table 26-2.; at thesame time they will need to master a seriesof biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional goals . As will be further shown in Chapters Twenty-eight and Twenty-nine of this book, the full attainment of these goals ineach stage will support the development ofnew goals to be achieved during the nextstage. Yet it is important to note that socio-emotional development may not alwayskeep pace with physical and cognitivechanges occurring at the same time. Also,while there may be a biological predisposi-tion for the level of cognitive skills an ado- lescent may achieve, the optimal develop-ment of these abilities requires an interac-tive and stimulating social environmentthat includes parents, teachers, and otheradult actors willing to actively engage theadolescent and challenge his/her thoughtsand feelings in a positive manner. Supportstructures such as these provide a healthybackdrop against which adolescents whosechronological age and physical develop-ment are well synchronized may secure thenecessary stimuli to achieve the corre-sponding levels of cognitive and socio-emotional development for their agegroup. Following the concept of audience seg- mentation introduced by social marketing,increasingly used in the field of publichealth, PAHO and the authors of this bookpropose the differentiation of the transi-tion between childhood and adulthood de-scribing these smaller, more homoge-neous subgroups to which the interventionprograms will be designed and delivered.When designing an intervention it is notonly important to know the 11-year-oldgirl or boy's interests, which can be ob-tained through questionnaires or focusgroups; it is also necessary to be aware ofthe girl or boy's developmental challengesat that age (body, sexuality, cognitive, so-cial, and emotional), so that the interven-tion may be tailored to the developmentallevel and experiences the adolescent isliving at the moment of the intervention.This information is necessary, since, as isshown in Table 26-2., the cognitive skills,YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 268social interests, and biological capabili- ties of a 14-year-old will be significantlydifferent than those of a 10-year-oldadolescent. For many of the reasons already suggested in this chapter, as well as those that will befurther discussed in Chapters Twenty-eight and Twenty-nine, the preadolescenceand early adolescence stages are a strategi-cally critical entryway for interventions en-couraging the adoption and maintenanceof health-promoting lifestyles during ado- lescence, particularly those related tohealthy and safe sex practices. Early inter-vention beginning during the preadoles-cence period allows for greater emphasis to be placed on protecting one's health and preventing the negative consequencesof risky sexual behaviors. By waiting until adolescents grow older, health-compromising practices may already bewell established and thus harder to change. Despite this fact, the preadolescent and early adolescent age groups have been fre-quently overlooked by adolescent healthprograms, particularly in developing coun-tries, where the tendency observed by this book's authors has been to focus princi-pally on adolescents 15 years of age andolder. This is particularly the case for pro-grams which promote safer sex practices.Program developers and facilitators oftenfeel uncomfortable and lack the skills toaddress topics of sexuality developmentwith adolescents younger than 15 years old.Nevertheless, approximately one in everythree to five adolescents worldwide has ex-perienced intercourse by this age, and ahigher percentage has been actively in-volved in sexual exploration. Furthermore,preadolescence and early adolescence arethe stages at which young people are mostsusceptible to sexual coercion and abuse.Despite this situation, most of the infor-mation currently available on the globalstatus of adolescent health and develop-ment focuses on the middle and late ado-lescence periods, and comparatively littleis known about their earlier-stage counter-parts (World Health Organization, UNAIDS2003). Chapters Twenty-eight and Twenty-nine will review in further depth the needsand challenges of these first two stages ofadolescent development.While both girls and boys move through the various developmental stages and experience similar changes, there are significant gender-based differencesthat need to be considered when planning health-promoting interventions among adolescents. Whereas the term sex refers to the biological dimension of being male or female, gender refers to the sociocultural dimension of these differences. Few as- pects of adolescents' development are more central to their identity and their social rela-tionships than gender considerations. A gender role is a set of expectations that prescribes how females or males should think, act, and feel. Biology and sociocultural experiencestogether shape gender development. In his book Boys and Girls Learn Differently! ,Michael Gurian (2001) uses brain-based re- search to explain the origins of gender differences. He points out that, although our cul-tural environment shapes children and adolescents, this culture does not arise in a vac-uum, but is instead the result of a history of neural responses to natural surroundings andprocesses. Biological differences are evident at a very early age. From birth on, the bodymovements of males are more vigorous and less refined than those of females, which aremore precise and accurate and more confined to small muscle groups than those of theirmale counterparts. As males grow, their muscular structure becomes larger and morepowerful, giving them greater physical strength (Acuff 1997). For their part, girls take inmore sensory data than boys. On average, they hear better, smell better, and take in moretactile information through their fingertips and skin. After a few weeks of age, femaleswill pay attention more to sound and tonal patterns than to visual patterns. Throughout[Chapter Twenty-seven ] Gender Differences and Adolescent BehaviorsYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 270life, they are better able to localize sounds and differentiate between their intensi-ties. Females are faster in their processingof verbal information and demonstrate a more accurate understanding of socialclues. Females have better clarity andquality of speech throughout childhoodthan males. By age 3, females are more re-sponsive to new playmates and, in general,they show greater interest in playmatesthan in objects (Acuff 1997). Researchers, such as Ruben Gur (Gur et al. 1995) at the University of Pennsylvania,have discovered functional differencesusing positron-emission tomography(PET) scans. In most cases, and in mostaspects of the developmental chronology,girls' brains mature earlier than those ofboys. Girls, for example, may acquire theircomplex verbal skills as much as a yearearlier than boys. The myelination of thebrain, which enables electrical impulses totravel down a nerve quickly and efficiently,is one of the last steps in the brain's growthinto adulthood. Myelination continues inall brains into the early 20s, but in womenthe process completes itself earlier than inmen. The size of the corpus callosum,which is the bundle of nerves that connectsthe brain's right and left hemispheres, isup to 20% larger in females than in males.Both prefrontal lobes, which are responsi-ble for the development of executive func-tions and self-regulation capacity, and theoccipital lobes, where sensory processingoften occurs, mature earlier and with greater intensity in females than males(Gurian 2001). Males tend to have more development in certain areas of the brain's right hemi-sphere, which provides them with betterspatial abilities for activities such asmeasuring (e.g., mechanical design) andgeographical orientation (e.g., map-reading). After a few weeks of age, boyswill also be more readily attentive to visualpatterns than will girls (Acuff 1997). Themale advantage on many spatial perfor-mance tests emerges before age 10 and re-mains more or less constant during theadolescent years. Casey and colleagues(1995) propose that any observed differ-ences between males and females inmathematical aptitude are entirely due tothis small sexual difference in spatialability. A wide variety of empirical studies show that boys' play is much more physical thanthat of girls. Boys are more physically ag-gressive than girls, though girls showgreater relational aggression. On the otherhand, females often tend to be better thanmales at controlling impulsive behavior(Maccoby 1998). Interestingly, the behaviors and interac- tions of both female and male adults to-ward boys and girls are different, begin-ning at the infancy stage. Male adults aremore physical and aggressive with boy in-fants and children and more cautious andgentle with girls. Female adults are morelikely to react to their sons and physicallypacify them, whereas they spend moretime talking to their daughters (Acuff1997).YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN | 271Despite the gender differences that have been found in brain development, Gurian(2001) proposes that this process is bestunderstood as a spectrum of developmentrather than two poles, female and male.Many girls lean toward the female ex-treme, and many boys lean toward themale, but there are boys and girls who pos-sess nearly equal qualities of both the maleand female brain traits. According toGurian, these boys and girls with the most\"bi-gender\" brains are, in a sense, thebridge between male and female cultures. Despite possible sex differences in mental abilities, boys and girls learn gender rolesthrough imitation and observationallearning by listening to what other peoplesay and watching what they do. Culturalbeliefs and attitudes, as well as those foundin the school environment, and expressedby peers, the media, family members, andparticularly parents, are important influ-ences on gender development. Parents, by action and by example, influ- ence their children and adolescents' gen-der development. Social learning theoreti-cal constructs have been especiallyimportant in understanding social influ-ences on gender, emphasizing that chil-dren and adolescents' gender developmentoccurs through observation and imitationof gender behavior, and through rewards and punishments they experience for whatare considered gender-appropriate and -inappropriate behaviors. By observingparents and other adults, as well as peers\u2014at home, at school, in the neighborhood,and in the media\u2014adolescents are exposed to a myriad of models that display mascu-line and feminine behavior (Santrock1998). Consciously or unconsciously, par-ents often use compliments and repri-mands to teach their daughter traditionalversions of how to be feminine and theirsons how to be masculine. The messages about gender roles carried by the mass media also are important in-fluences on adolescents' gender develop-ment. Early adolescence may be a period of heightened sensitivity to television messages about gender roles. Young ado-lescents increasingly view programs de-signed for adults that include messagesabout what is considered gender-appropriate behavior, especially in het-erosexual relationships. Nevertheless, certain traditional versions of masculinity and femininity by which children and adolescents are socializedcan have harmful consequences for theirhealth and development. Society sendsstrong social messages to girls to stay \"in-nocent and virginal\" and to control theirsexual arousal at the same time that it en-courages boys to seek sexual experiencewith girls and downplays the boys' need toregulate and control sexual arousal. Girlsreport often being pressured by boys tohave sex as a proof of their love and com-mitment to the relationship. In the maleadolescent culture, youths perceive them-selves to be more masculine if they engagein premarital sex, drink alcohol, usedrugs, and participate in delinquent activ-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 272ities (Santrock 1998). Pleck and O'Don- nell (2001) studied the gender attitudesand health risk behaviors among urbanAfrican-American and Latino early ado-lescents. The results showed that aftercontrolling socio-demographic and familyvariables, males' violence-related behav-iors and substance use associatedwith traditional beliefs about masculinity.Among these adolescents, females con-tribute to the traditional version of mas-culinity by positively associating beingsexually active with traditional beliefsabout masculinity. Traditional beliefs about masculinity de- velopment were also explored through aqualitative research study supported bythe Pan American Health Organization(Aguirre and G\u00fcell 2002) in which focusgroups were conducted among 10-24-year-old young boys living in nine LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries (Bra-zil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador,Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico,and Nicaragua). The study concludes thatadolescent boys approach and undergomasculinity development by accepting a series of traditional mandates imposedby male culture organized into fourdomains: (1) Body and character development: Masculine males are expected to bestronger, physically and emotionally, thanwomen and children, so that they will berespected by others. They are also ex-pected to be able to tolerate hard work andbe attractive to women. In the countriesstudied, masculinity was believed to be es- pecially proven on the soccer field, whereone's body and personal character are re-quired to respond to the sport's competi-tive demands of resistance, mental andphysical agility, aggression, and toleranceof aggression in order to win against the opponent. (2) Family relationships: Masculine males are expected to establishphysical and emotional distance fromtheir mothers or else risk the perceptionby others that they might be homosexuals.Soccer, in this context, symbolizes leavingthe mother's world to enter into the fa-ther's world. Masculine males are ex-pected to produce children. Those who donot do so are considered to be incompletemales. Masculine males are expected toprovide financial support for their fami-lies; those who are not financially self-sufficient are considered to be worthless.Because of their ability to provide the fam-ily's income, masculine males are also ex-pected to act as the family's principal au-thority figure. (3) Intimate partner relationships: Masculine males are expected to sexuallypossess, satisfy, and subordinate women.Women's infidelity is not tolerated, since this is viewed as a threat to one's mas-culinity, and as a possible justification forinitiating acts of physical violence againstintimate female partners. On the otherhand, masculine males are considered tohave a heightened sexual arousal level, andmasculinity is gauged by number ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN | 273women that men can sexually seduce and subordinate. (4) Peer relationships: Masculine males are expected to spendtime away from the home, with their peers,beyond the reach of parental protection.Masculinity is developed when males ex-plore, take risks, and accept challengesproposed by their peers. Masculine malesprove their autonomy and capacity byhandling uncertainties without parentalprotection. Rodrigo Aguirre and Pedro G\u00fcell, the au- thors of this study, suggest that the mostimminent risk felt by male adolescentswhen adopting new behaviors is the per-ceived threat to the development of theirmasculinity, which is considered to be ofmuch greater importance than the moredistant consequences of these new behav-iors (e.g., practicing unprotected sex, al-cohol and drug exploration, participationin violent gangs). Given this fact, the au-thors recommend that any interventionthat seeks to reduce risk behaviors amongadolescent males in Latin America and theCaribbean should take into account theneeds related to consolidation of a mas-culinity identity and should propose alter-native behaviors that satisfy these needs inhealthier and more positive ways (e.g., ex-celling in sports, respecting sexual limitsset by girls, striving for economic securityby making plans for the future). While male peer relationships and friend- ships often are based on companionshipand joint activities, girls' peer relation- ships and friendships tend to be charac-terized by high levels of self-disclosure,intimacy, and emotional support. Severallines of research support the proposal thatadolescent girls are at increased risk forstress in their relationships. Adolescentgirls report more interpersonal strain andanxiety, including negative events andproblems that involve family, peer, andintimate relationships than do boys, whoreport finding events of self-relevance(e.g., performing well in a sporting event)more stressful than do girls. Almeida andKessler (1998) support the idea that gen-der differences in stress levels and typesare real and not due to reporting bias. Forexample, adolescent girls have been foundto perceive negative interpersonal eventsas more stressful than do boys. Adolescentgirls are more likely than adolescent boysto be preoccupied with negative thoughtsabout their friends and to experiencenegative affect within peer and familycontexts. Kaplan, in his book Adolescence (2004), observes that women are often socializedto balance their needs against those ofothers and to focus more on others' needsthan on their own, whereas males are oftensocialized to confront issues directly andto fulfill their needs by acting upon them.Women often have to be more empathetic and assume roles that require them to sup-port others, which may increase their ownstress. In this sense, women might feelthey have less control than men over im-portant areas of their lives (Nolen-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 274Hoeksema, Larson, and Grayson 1999). Women are also more likely to use rumina- tion as a coping style, tending to focus onnegative feelings, which prolong the dis-tress (Nolen-Hoeksema 2000). The ten-dency of women to ruminate more thanmen is first observed during early adoles-cence and continues throughout adulthood(Nolen-Hoeksema and Girgus 1994). Lev-els of stress tend to increase from preado-lescence into early adolescence, the stage atwhich gender differences become moreobvious, indicating that this transitionrepresents a period of particular vulnera-bility for girls (Rudolph 2002). The types and patterns of aggression and abuse experienced during the adolescentyears do appear to differ by gender. Ado-lescent girls experience higher rates ofsexually-related and relational manipula-tion and abuse, whereas adolescent boysexperience more overt forms, such as bul-lying and physical aggression. Interest-ingly, this correlates with the differentpatterns by which boys and girls, at ayounger age, express their aggressive feel-ings, in which boys are more physically ag-gressive and girls show greater affectiveaggression. It is not clear if there are gen-der differences in adolescence for total ex-posure to victimization but there are gen- der differences during childhood: sexualabuse is more common in females, andphysical abuse is more common in males.When subjects who have experienced bothsexual and physical childhood abuse arecompared by gender, females outnumbermales by more than two to one (Hayward and Sanborn 2002). Unfortunately, the identification of the particular needs and wants of boys andgirls has been obfuscated by the unre-solved discussion of whether gender dif-ferences are natural or imposed by society.While this debate continues, the most ef-fective way to discover these differenceswill be through focus groups held with theactual adolescents themselves who arebeing targeted. This valuable input willenable program developers to discern notonly gender differences, but within these,variances in the needs and wants by devel-opmental stages, when planning, imple-menting, and monitoring health promo-tion interventions. Girls and boys both share certain particu- lar needs (e.g., love, acceptance, success)during pre- and early adolescence, whichwill be described in the next two chaptersof this book. Both want to have fun and seek novelty and \"grown-up\" experiences.Nevertheless, boys and girls develop dif-ferent interests and ways of having funwith their friends, with similarities anddifferences across cultures. The challengefor parents, teachers, and others who pro- vide support to adolescents is to help themfind out what they need, want, and enjoy,rather than allowing cultural and environ-mental forces to define who they should beand become according to traditional, and,at times, harmful versions of masculinityand femininity. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN | 275Adolescent girls and boys need to be lis- tened to, given opportunities, encouragedto have new experiences, and yet be pro-vided with value systems, guidance, andlimits. What they need, want, and enjoymust be acknowledged and taken seri-ously. They need opportunities to attaintheir needs and most of their wants. Theyneed values and guidance to recognizeharmful temptations and in choosing\"wants\" that are safe and will lead to ahealthy development. They need bound-aries to discourage and/or curb harmfulbehaviors. Girls and boys also need help in mastering gender-specific developmental goals dur-ing pre- and early adolescence that willprotect them from the harmful effects oftraditional and dominant versions of mas-culinity and femininity that, in turn, mayaffect the way they approach sexual activityand relationships. Furthermore, adultsneed to recognize that most adolescentlifestyle decisions (e.g., sexual practices;tobacco, alcohol, and drug use; physicalactivity and nutrition; anger expression)are influenced at least in part by the anxi-eties surrounding male-female interac-tions and gender-related expectations. The Young Men's Sexual and Reproductive Health: Toward a National Strategy, Frame-work, and Recommendations was prepared by an interdisciplinary working group of ex-perts and edited by Freya Sonenstein(2000) for the Urban Institute, a social andeducational research organization. It em-phasizes the importance of forming a new vision of men's sexual health in which \"allmales will grow and develop with a securesense of their sexual identity, an under-standing about the physical and emotionalaspects of sexual intimacy, and attitudesthat lead to responsible behavior.\"Achievement of these developmental goals,the report emphasizes, \"will result in menpostponing sexual intercourse until they areemotionally mature enough to manage thephysical and psychological aspects of sexualintimacy. When they have sexual inter-course, it will occur with as little risk as pos-sible to either themselves or their partner.\" To achieve the described results, the above-mentioned framework proposesthat all young men need access to a rangeof services that, in combination, fulfill five goals: they will promote sexual health anddevelopment; promote healthy intimaterelationships; prevent and control STIs,including HIV; prevent unintended preg-nancy; and promote responsible father-hood. To attain each of these goals, theworking group suggests that a comprehen-sive reproductive health strategy for youngmen should ensure access for them to thenecessary information, foster skills devel-opment, promote self-concept, help mento identify and develop positive values andsufficient motivation to act on those val-ues, and provide access to clinical care, asneeded (Sonenstein 2000). The Pan American Health Organization shares this new vision of male sexual andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 276reproductive health. Yet, at the same time, PAHO considers that the developmental goals proposed by Sonenstein and col-leagues need to be further refined intogender-specific goals for each of the dif-ferent adolescent developmental stages.As will be shown in the next two chapters, this further refinement takes into accountthe differences in how boys and girls ap-proach and adjust to the changes charac-teristic of each successive developmentalstage.In the transition from childhood to adulthood, the stages of preadolescence1and early adolescence2are extremely relevant to our discussion of adopting and maintaining health-promoting lifestyles. As has been previously noted, the Pan American Health Organization considers these two groups to be the most overlooked by adolescent healthprograms, and it emphasizes the importance of early intervention beginning with pread-olescence, instead of waiting until later, when health-compromising behaviors have al-ready begun and may be more difficult to change. This chapter, focusing on preadoles-cence, and Chapter Twenty-nine, focusing on early adolescence, will present an analysisof the needs and wants of each age group, as well as of age-appropriate developmental goals, which can contribute to adolescents' ability to foster and sustain positive and pro-tective health behaviors. By recognizing and understanding the universal biological, cog-nitive, and socio-emotional changes that characterize the two developmental stages, aswell as lifestyle- and gender-specific development goals appropriate for each group,health promotion program developers can set the stage for a respectful intervention that re- sponds to adolescent needs and wants and encourages them to become agents in theirown positive behavioral change. In their award-winning comic strip Zits, Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman chronicle the life of Jeremy Duncan, a 15-year-old aspiring rock musician, \"riddled with angst, boredom, and[Chapter Twenty-eight ] Early Intervention during Adolescence: The PreadolescentPeriod 1 Ages 9-12 (girls) and 10-13 (boys) 2 Ages 12-14 (girls) and 13-15 (boys)YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 278parents who don't understand anything.\" Jeremy must deal with parents trying tofigure out \"the mysterious science of par-enting a teenager\" and live up to the\"dreadfully perfect example\" his \"advanced hangin' out his best friend In oneadventure, Jeremy waxes particularlyphilosophic about the at-times incompat-ible wants and needs of youth and the dif-ficulties in reconciling them when he says:\"Fitting in. Being different. Growing up.Staying a kid. Breaking away. Settling in.Needing help. Wanting out. Adolescencebites. . . .\" Not surprisingly, the response to the comic series by its youthful audience hasbeen overwhelming since its debut in1997. Perhaps its appeal lies in the deftmixture of Jeremy's projection of comedyand irony, understatement and overkill,frustration and indifference, joy and suf-fering\u2014all typical adolescent reactions tothe oftentimes bewildering world that sur-rounds them. And Jeremy feels caught inthe middle of it all. The road to adulthood, from the perspec- tive of those who are just preparing tomake their way onto it, inspires both an-ticipation and apprehension. This periodis the transitional phase from childhoodinto adolescence, which many have cometo call preadolescence \"before preadolescence, and socio-emotionalchanges occur, with a permanent interac- tion between these new aspects, as we sawin Chapter Twenty-six. Physical transfor-mations involve all the bodily changes as-sociated with puberty. Cognitive changesinclude the use of more concrete, logical,reality-based thinking, with a shift fromegocentric to socio-centric thought, whichenables preteens to begin to place them-selves in others' situations and under-stand better the feelings and viewpoints ofother people. Socio-emotional changesare marked by a newly emerging need foran intimate one-to-one relationship witha companion of the same sex (\"bestfriend\"). As preadolescents' bodies startto change, so do their interests, the type offriendships and other relationships theyestablish, the ways in which they choose tohave fun, and their strategies for analyzingnew situations using emerging cognitiveskills. Preteens' physical changes begin with the first signs of a growth spurt and the redis-tribution of body fat, which transform theshape and look of the child's face andbody. Parents become aware of the need tobuy new clothes for their growing chil-dren, while the latter begins to show dis-tinct preferences in what she/he wants towear, choosing popular brands and stylesusually worn by other friends. During thepreteen years, boys and girls realize the ef-fect clothing can have in making themmore attractive and mature-looking.

Girls become more interested in experimenting withmakeup, nail polish, and hair styles, insome cases attempting to imitate oldergirls they know, television and music per-sonalities, fashion magazine role models,and \"popular\" girls at school. Preadoles-cents, particularly girls, will begin to spend more time in the bathroom andtheir bedrooms studying their appearancein the mirror and picking out theirwardrobe. Both males and females will beconcerned about pimples and have mixedfeelings about the emergence of body hair.Table 28-1.

This is theperiod when dentists generally recom-mend braces, if necessary. Preadolescenceis also characterized by the appearance ofsecondary sex characteristics (breast budaround the nipple in girls; larger testeswith redder scrotum in boys). Boys andgirls become aware of how their bodies arechanging, and in many cases wish to com-pare these changes with those experiencedby their friends. The re-proportioning ofbody fat might trigger significant concernin girls (and, to a lesser extent, boys) ifthey feel that their new body shape makesthem look overweight. During this time, girls will discuss with their friends when is the time to beginwearing a bra. They might also show ap-prehension about the beginning of men-struation, especially if they do not feelcomfortable discussing this new experi-ence with their mothers or if much of theirinformation is gleaned from television,magazines, and/or other friends' experi-ences. Girls begin contemplating the ideaof having a romantic relationship with boys and comparing the qualities and de-fects of their male peers among theirsame-sex friends, oftentimes developing asecret classification system for includingor discarding candidates. As part of this,female friends will often confide in eachother about who has a \"crush\" on whom.They also become more keenly aware ofpopular musical lyrics, often relating theseto their own life experiences, whether themessage refers to romantic ideas or the desire for empowerment and more free-dom of expression. Boys begin to use deodorants and will make fun of each other's underwear andother types of clothes. They tend to en-joy informal competitions among theirfriends regarding who is the \"grossest,\"who has the capacity for louder flatulenceand burps, and who possesses the mostnatural talent for incorporating obsceni-ties of a sexual nature in their daily lan-guage. In general, during adolescence, thefemale's interest in the opposite sex is notreciprocated. Instead, boys prefer to trivi-alize and minimize the importance of girlsin their environment by making fun ofthem and avoiding the formation of closecontact and friendships with them. As preadolescents' bodies change, they become aware that they feel, look, andmove differently than before and experi-ence feelings of clumsiness and poormotor planning as their bodies change andbecome bigger. Parents expect preadoles-cents to have greater autonomy with re-spect to aspects of daily living and self-care, such as personal hygiene andgrooming, representing a transitional pe-riod in which preadolescents avoid thesenew responsibilities, particularly washingtheir hair and taking showers. Thesechanges need to be absorbed by the pre-adolescent, so that he/she comes to feelthat this new body is a part of him or her.The glamorous, polished, and self-assuredmale and female body images preadoles-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 281cents see on television and in magazines tend to establish unrealistic and even falseexpectations. In Reviving Ophelia , author Mary Pipher (1994) contends that the preoccupationwith bodies at this age cannot be over-stated. She contends that \"generally girlshave strong bodies when they enter pu-berty. But these bodies soften and spreadout in ways that our culture calls fat. Girlsfeel an enormous pressure to be beautifuland are aware of constant evaluations oftheir appearance.\" Boys, on the otherhand, feel pressured to have a strong bodythat projects their ideals of masculinitydevelopment, and the strength of theirbodies has a direct impact on their self-image. It is therefore essential for parentsto not only have a sufficient grasp of thebiological facts of normal growth and de-velopment, but also to have a clear under-standing and empathy for what thesechanges mean to their preadolescent. Pubertal changes do not happen at the same age in boys and girls. A meta-analysis of U.S. growth statistics indicatesthat puberty now begins at an average ageof 9 years in girls and 11 years in boys (Ab- bassi 1998). A difference among races hasalso been found. Pubertal changes beginby an average age of 10 in white girls,whereas puberty begins between 8-9 yearsof age in black girls (Herman-Giddens et al. 1997). Although subtle body changes start earlier during preadolescence, it is in the middleof this period that growth spurts have the greatest impact. For girls, the average ageat which the growth spurt becomes mostapparent is 10. The average boy experi-ences significant growth at about age 12(Pruitt 1999). They now have bigger bod-ies and more physical strength to carry outstrenuous activities. Nevertheless, physi-cal growth is not necessarily accompaniedby cognitive and socio-emotional growth,as we saw in Chapter well-developed preadolescentsmay have the emotions of children; moreabstract thinkers may have the social skillsof first graders. These differences in de- velopmental levels within the same childconfound adults. Very often, parents andteachers in their lives hold expectationsfor them based on physical appearance, forgetting the child's chronological age and current emotional functioning. Moremature physical appearances make youngadolescents more likely to associate with a chronologically older peer group, re-gardless of whether they possess similarlevels of cognitive and socio-emotionaldevelopment. Because preteens enter and complete the biological changes associated with pubertyat different times, their preparation for,and experiences with, the physical changesof adolescence are highly variable, as well. Early-maturing girls and late-maturingboys are at heightened risk for adjustmentproblems (Graber et al. 1997). Hormonalfluctuations occurring during pubertyhave been associated with mood and be-havior changes. Hormones are instru-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 282mental in altering peripheral systems, such as the sensory system, and in changesrelated to the menstrual cycle that influ-ence vision, smell, and general arousal.Hormonal changes also influence the cen-tral nervous system and neurotransmitteractivity involved in the regulation of emo-tions and affective processing (Killgore,Oki, and Yurgelun-Todd 2001; Buchanan,Eccles, and Becker 1992). Nevertheless,there is evidence that social events andhormonal change together predict nega-tive affect better than hormonal changealone (Brooks-Gunn and Warren 1989). According to Brooks-Gunn and Paikoff (1993), the first developmental challengeconcerning sexuality in adolescence is ac-cepting one's changing body. The preado-lescence years are a stressful time charac-terized by mood swings and a need forprivacy, withdrawal, and confrontation. As they see themselves and their peerschange, preteens start to worry aboutwhether or not they are \"normal\" andwhether they are developing into the per-son they would like to be. As children entertheir preteen years, a necessary but diffi-cult process of defining their own person-ality begins. They look to their peers astheir measure of \"normalcy.\" For the firsttime, preadolescents turn away from theirparents and toward their peers to deter-mine what behaviors and attitudes areacceptable and appropriate (U.S. NationalYouth Anti-Drug Media Campaign 1999). During preadolescence, a new need for in- terpersonal intimacy with a playmate ofthe same sex emerges, as boys and girls move away from the broad need for a largergroup of playmates which prevailed in pre-vious years. There is also a need for the in-timate sharing of thoughts, feelings, andideas with just one playmate. This \"bestfriend,\" who also becomes a confidant, isusually of the same sex and social statusand approximately the same age. Accord-ing to Sullivan and his Interpersonal The-ory of Psychiatry (1953), the preadolescentexperiences, often for the first time, feel-ings of genuine love and loyalty and op-portunities for self-disclosure and inti-macy, but in an atmosphere still relativelyuncomplicated by the sexual arousal thatwill manifest itself with more intensityduring early adolescence. As the preoccu-pation with the \"best friend\" relationshipgains importance, preadolescents tend todistance themselves from the family. Theybegin to look at the family more objec-tively, and often more critically, and sharethese new perceptions with their bestfriend. Preadolescents and their parents often find themselves on unfamiliar terrain, inwhich the issue of trust becomes emo-tionally charged. Preteens are still greatlydependent upon their parents' permis-sion in a variety of aspects. However, thisdependence is in conflict with their de-sire for greater freedom and autonomy.Their need for privacy makes them feel itis no longer acceptable for their parentsto be aware of everything that is happen-ing in their lives. Parents want to trusttheir child, but are reluctant to grantYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 283them the amount of freedom they request. Preadolescents, for their part, feel \"enti-tled\" to the level of trust they are request-ing, and often feel that their parents' for-mer trust in them is waning just at thetime they most need it. These adjust-ments often result in parent-preteeninteractions that are laden with conflict,power struggles, and ambivalence. Theseare the years in which an effective parent-ing style that incorporates the charac-teristics discussed in Chapter Eighteencan have a profound impact on whetheradolescents adopt health-promoting orhealth-compromising lifestyles. Preadolescents' lives are also more stress- ful because of external demands. Aca-demic, social, and athletic competitionbecomes increasingly overwhelming. Inmany developing countries, dropping outof school has already begun among those in this age group, especially boys, with astrong association between those who dropout and subsequently enter the workforce.In Venezuela, 4% of boys fall into this cat-egory by the age of 12. Child labor at age 12reaches almost 10% in Honduras (Fil-gueira, Filgueira, and Fuentes 2001). Inrural areas, the situation is more severe. InBrazil, rural youth average 4.2 years of ed-ucation (with the average dropout agebeing approximately 10.2 years) and 5.3years in Honduras (with the averagedropout age being approximately 11.3years) Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9r-ica Latina y el Caribe 1997). Unfortunately,child labor and dropping out of school arestill a frequent reality for preadolescentsliving in several Latin American and Caribbean countries, although the princi-pal international legal instrument thatrecommends minimum ages for labor, theInternational Labor Organization's Con-vention 138, states that the countries rati-fying the convention should specify a min-imum age for admission to employment orwork, which \"shall not be less than the ageof completion of compulsory schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15years\" (International Labor Organization1973). Peer grouping becomes more defined to- wards the end of preadolescence (11-12years old). By this age, preteens sense thatthey need to make the difficult choice ofeither attaching themselves to a specificgroup or being isolated and socially leftout. This realization may result in a loss ofconfidence regarding social relationshipsand an intense desire to \"fit in\" at all costs.In preteen culture, the process of growinginto adolescence is inextricably linkedwith taking part in risky behaviors, havingsecrets, and testing the limits and rules ofauthority. Peers see a preteen who is un-able to take risks as one who is immature,unwilling, and/or incapable of growing up.These risks can take numerous forms,ranging from the more benign (e.g., mis-chievous pranks, playing jokes on others)to the more dangerous (e.g., physical/sports challenges, sexual adventurism,and/or cigarette, alcohol, or drug experi-mentation). In order to be perceived bythemselves and others as \"growing up,\"preadolescents often feel compelled to ag-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 284gressively \"push away\" from supposedly childish concepts and activities. They mayeven feel the need to make these childishconcepts \"wrong\" in order to establishthemselves as \"beyond them\" (e.g., beingtold by parents what to wear, playing withtoys, watching cartoons on television withyounger siblings, joining in family sports,helping in family chores). It is also easier,at this stage of development, to rationalizebreaking the rules. Along with greaterconcerns about right and wrong comemore sophisticated reasoning powers thatpreteens employ to try to get around rulesthey previously might not have questioned(Acuff 1997). During the preadolescent years, due to their sharpened thinking skills and open-ing to the outside world, boys and girlscrave information. This new information,and the values they will develop based onit, will come not only from their parents,but also from friends, older siblings, othersignificant adults (e.g., teachers, guidancecounselors, friends' parents, church lead-ers), and media messages (e.g., television,radio, magazines, books, Internet). Pre-adolescents are vulnerable to buildingtheir identity by focusing on pleasing oth-ers around them whom they admire in-stead of focusing on discovering their owninner strengths and weaknesses and likesand dislikes. At the same time, they are atrisk of defining themselves through not being someone or something else insteadof being who and what they are. For exam- ple, girls are expected not to be like boys, boys are expected not to be like girls, andboth are expected not to be babyish and to instead become more mature. There isalso a gray area regarding whether it is ac-ceptable to notice and \"like\" members ofone's own gender versus the opposite one.In any case, preteens are expected not to be too different from the rest, but differentfrom their parents. This tendency to buildidentity based on not being versus being leaves them more vulnerable to peer pres-sure once they reach middle adolescence.Therefore, it is crucial that parents andteachers work with preadolescents andhelp them to define themselves by theirown unique characteristics (e.g., sense ofhumor, consideration for others, shy, out-going, smart, need to work harder inschool) and interests (favorite foods, col-ors they like to wear, ideas about and plansfor the future, sports and leisure-time ac- tivities that most appeal to them) insteadof allowing this group to define itself solely through the influence of peer groups andthe media. This support will help boys andgirls create internal standards based on amore stable and secure sense of self andprovide a basis to judge experiences andfurther reflect upon them independently. Peer relationships for both boys and girls intensify with the increasing introductionof sexual interests and behaviors in the last two years of preadolescence. For girls,personal relationships become increas-ingly important, while boys tend to focuson sports and other types of competition(e.g., video games). Talking with and abouteach other's friends and schoolmates onthe phone, online, and in person becomesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 285a favorite activity. As boys measure their physical and intellectual characteristics bytheir performance in sports, video games,and best \"gross\" jokes, girls become fo-cused on virtually every aspect of their ap-pearance, using products such as makeup,skin and nail care items, and hair acces-sories for the first time to bolster theirself-confidence. The telling of dirty jokes;perusal of magazines, books, movies, andInternet sites with explicit sexual content;and increased shyness around the oppo-site sex are all part of the eagerness for,and fear of, the physical and sexualchanges about to occur. During preadoles-cence, girls and boys attempt to differenti-ate themselves from the opposite sex bychoosing different interests (e.g., sportsversus fashion magazines, action moviesversus love stories) and by making fun ofthe other gender's behaviors and physicalappearance. There is a competition forpower and recognition between gendersthat might develop further into disre-spectful sexual advances and even use ofphysical force during the next stages ofadolescence. Despite this new distress and turmoil, preteens reap the benefits of integratingthemselves into a group and definingthemselves as group members. They gainan enormous ability for complex thinking.To negotiate successfully the intricacies of multiple relationships within a group,preteens must learn to reason on a very so-phisticated level. This ability to diagnosegroup dynamics helps preteens to developcognitive and social skills that will be veryvaluable in their immediate school envi- ronment and beyond, since much of theadult world in which they will eventuallyperform will involve many of these samedynamics. By the end of the preadolescentstage, most boys and girls will have begunto embrace their own beliefs and to de-velop their own set of internal values, andthey also start to think about the future.They can now hold on to two realities atonce: their external peer group reality andtheir emerging inner reality of values andattitudes (Greenspan 1993). Within this context, the most successful health promotion and prevention pro-grams will be those that not only tailor theirinterventions to the biological, cognitive,sexual, and socio-emotional changes oc-curring during the preadolescent period,but also motivate this age group to use the pertinent information and services avail-able to achieve the skills and assets theyneed to prepare for the even more complexchanges lying immediately ahead. Bygrasping this idea early, adolescents overtime come to intuitively understand thedesirability of moving away from negativeinfluences and situations and learn to con-fidently make choices of this type as astatement of personal empowerment andself-preservation. The Needs of Preadolescents Different authors (Brazelton and Green-span 2000, Acuff 1997) have identifiedsome fundamental requirements that chil-dren and adolescents need for a healthydevelopment. In many ways they comple-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 286ment and enhance the broad considera- tions first presented in Chapter Five of thisbook. All of these are needs that parents,teachers, and the community at largeshould respond to so that society's youngermembers may grow, learn, and be healthyand productive future adults. Any healthpromotion and prevention interventionaimed at young people\u2014and particularlythose in the first stages of adolescence\u2014should incorporate a targeted response tothese needs in its design. A literaturesearch by the authors of this book revealedseveral overarching needs that are particu-larly important to preadolescents. (Theneeds themselves are very similar for earlyadolescents, as we will see in the followingchapter. Yet in each case, the way in whichthese needs may be met or responded towill take into account distinct develop-mental characteristics.) Love, ongoing nurturing relation- ships, and acceptance: Relationships are essential for regulating human be-havior, moods, and feelings, as well asfor intellectual stimulation and devel- opment. Any effort to promote theadoption of healthy lifestyles requiresthe presence of ongoing nurturing rela-tionships with the actors involved inthis task (e.g., parents, teachers, rolemodels, peer facilitators). The preteen'sneed for acceptance is essentially theneed to feel \"OK\" and approved of by theimportant people in his or her life, in-cluding parents, siblings, and peers.Preadolescents also need reassurancethat they are still going to be loved andaccepted by their parents and other sig- nificant others, even though this is thestage at which disagreements in opin-ions and about likes and dislikes usuallyfirst emerge. This need for continuedacceptance as a human being is particu-larly strong during preadolescence dueto an expanded cognitive awareness(e.g., ability to read nonverbal cues) andthe social sensitivities that accompanythat sharpened awareness. The majorityof these anxieties may occur uncon- sciously and be imperceptible to others,including parents and teachers. Duringthis period, communication with caringadults is essential to bring many of theseformational conclusions about the child's identity to the surface so thatthey may be adequately defined anddealt with (Acuff 1997). Preadolescentsmay pretend to be more emotionally in-dependent, but insecurity nonethelesssurrounds them when confronted withchanges and new decisions to make.They need to know that they can comeback to their secure base (home, par-ents, and involved teachers) and feelprotected, loved, and cared for by sup-portive adults. Even more, they cravepositive reinforcements and the feelingof being admired by their parents and teachers, which is related to the need forsuccess described below. Developmentally appropriate experi- ences and success: During this stage, preteens begin to concern themselves,consciously or unconsciously, with whatconditions and requirements might beYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 287needed to survive on their own and suc- ceed in the real world. To help them dothis, they need to establish a sense of in- dustry ,by learning how to produce things and do a job well, thereby win-ning the recognition and approval ofothers, and gaining a feeling of success.The need for success drives them tosearch for answers to key questions:what are the rules and how can I dealwith them? What is good, bad, right, andwrong? What roles are out there in soci-ety, and which of these do I want to em-ulate? Despite the conclusions theyreach, preteens are still quite malleableand open to influence. They do not yethave the ego strength or sense of self tocompletely \"think for themselves.\"Much of the learning that takes placeduring this period is through experi-ence and emulation of role models inreal life and in entertainment andsports (Acuff 1997). Parents and teach-ers play a crucial role in helping preadolescents acquire the ability to \"think for themselves\" and increasetheir ego strength and sense of self byproviding developmentally appropriateexperiences and challenges that willallow them to successfully master thesechallenges. Opportunities, guidance, limits, val- ues, and expectations: As preadoles- cents explore new behaviors and definetheir identities with new and changingbodies, they need opportunities, guid-ance, clear limits, and expectations.Parents will need to define in whichareas of life preadolescents may make their own decisions, in which they stillneed guidance, and in which they needfirm limits to protect them from harm.Adolescents need to be aware of theirparents' values and expectations. Theyneed opportunities to express theirlikes and dislikes and to be involved inchoosing their own clothes, after-school activities, and ways to have fun.Preadolescents need guidance regard-ing what is socially appropriate, butshould still be able to express theiruniqueness within set social limits.They also need guidance on how to in-teract with other boys and girls; how tobe appropriately empathetic, assertive,and distrustful; how to protect them-selves from temptations and dangers;and how to spend and save moneyaccording to their economic circum-stances. Preadolescents need to experi-ence the consequences for trespassingminor limits. But most importantly,they need firm limits for behaviors thatcan cause them harm. Parents need toenforce these limits by anticipating sit-uations that can expose their children tothe option of trespassing those limitsand helping them avoid these situationsby redirecting their behavior, offeringother alternatives to satisfy the need forexploring risky behaviors, and increas-ing communication with children aboutthe risks involved. Safe and supportive environments at home, school, and in the neighbor- hood: Preadolescents need to feel aYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 288sense of physical safety and security where they live, play, and work. Theyneed to live in a safe and secure housewith safe and secure relationships thatcontribute to their overall sense of well-being. Being a witness to or a victim ofdomestic or neighborhood violence hasdetrimental effects on their develop-ment and health and significantly de-creases the possibilities that they willadopt health-promoting behaviors. Pre-adolescents also need to receive anadequate academic education, whichwill be optimized in a safe, caring, andprotective school climate. Finally,preadolescents need to feel that thehomes of their neighbors, the commer-cial establishments they go to, and thepublic spaces they visit (e.g., play-grounds, parks, beaches, churches) willnot place them in danger or cause themharm. Structures to provide healthy nutri- tion, physical activity, and proper sleep: Preadolescents are growing at a rapid pace, since this is the period whenthe most significant growth spurt occurs.They need to adopt and maintain healthynutrition and physical activity not only toprevent future obesity and heart disease,but also to fuel their body with the nec-essary nutrients to support their currentdevelopment. Preadolescence, alongwith lactation, is the period when thelargest amounts of calcium are requiredby the body. During preadolescence,boys and girls need between 1,200 and1,500 mg of calcium per day. Weight-bearing exercise (i.e., any sport except for swimming or cycling) helps not only to build muscle, but also to build andstrengthen bones. If preadolescents donot receive sufficient supervision andencouragement, their eating, physicalactivity, and sleeping habits will becomeunpredictable and erratic. Their life isnow driven by the search for novelty,fun, and sensation-seeking, which takespriority over eating, sleeping, and exer-cise considerations. At the same time,their appetite, particularly for snackfoods, increases considerably. Preado- lescents enjoy watching late-night tele-vision and no longer go to bed early.They will also tend to sleep in until thelate morning hours, not rising until longafter all the other family members. Par-ents should allow some flexibility inthese areas while at the same time pro-viding structure. Preadolescents needadult help in organizing their schedulesto include not only new age-appropriateexperiences, but also adequate attentionto the body's nutritional, exercise, andsleep requirements. The series of preadolescent needs de- scribed in the preceding paragraphs shouldbe taken into account in the design of allhealth promotion and prevention pro-grams targeted to this group. Wheneverpossible, the parents of preadolescentsshould also be active participants in thehealth-promoting intervention. In deter-mining how best to respond to preadoles-cent needs, the interpersonal level theoriesfor behavior change presented in ChaptersYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 289Sixteen to Twenty, and particularly the Authoritative Parenting Model (ChapterEighteen), can provide much practical in-sight into the necessary components to beincluded in the intervention. The Wants of Preadolescents Preadolescents want to have fun. Almostevery parent of a preteen will have heardtheir son or daughter say on more than oneoccasion: \"I am bored.\" Compared to pre-vious ages, preadolescents now have moredeveloped skills to explore and participatein new experiences, but still not enoughautonomy to do this on their own. Thisstage is also characterized by an increasein high sensation-seeking behaviors, aswe saw in Chapter Fourteen. Preadolescents want to have fun alone and with their friends. In general, the highersensation-seeking preadolescents withwell-coordinated motor skills will want toengage in sports outdoor activities.Less well-coordinated and sensation-seeking preadolescents will prefer indooractivities, such as computer and videogames. Both groups will enjoy differenttypes of media entertainment (e.g., televi-sion, music, magazines, movies, Internet)than in the past. The type of sports, out-door activities, and peer group and mediaentertainment they choose will vary in dif-ferent cultures and countries. Any health promotion and prevention in- tervention that seeks successful resultsshould provide preteens opportunities fornovelty, fun, humor, and social interac-tions. Furthermore, this group is more likely to engage in activities that allowthem to share their interests and likes anddislikes first, before dealing with topicsimposed by an adult agenda (e.g., drug re-sistance skills). Lastly, but equally impor-tant, understanding media preferences ateach adolescent stage will help programdesigners to better analyze existing mediamessages and develop and deliver age-appropriate health messages. The litera-ture shows that there are several wants thatseem to attract preadolescents across theboard, although cultural variations maydetermine the actual way in which thesewants are acted out: Novelty : Preadolescents seek novelty, through new television shows, movies,video games, magazines, leisure activi-ties, sports, music, and new friend-ships. They also explore new ways to\"reinvent\" themselves, to appear uniquein the eyes of their peers. Most preado-lescents also want to change the appear-ance of their rooms and make themmore reflective of their new interests byadding personal touches (e.g., new paintcolor, posters, photos, bedspread andsheets, other mementos they highlyprize). Social interaction : Preadolescents enjoy get-togethers with their best friends.Sleepover birthday parties and spendingthe night at their best friend's house arevery attractive panoramas for mostpreadolescents. At this age, preadoles-cents also begin using the telephoneYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 290more frequently and independently to share experiences with their best friends. \"Grown-up\" experiences: Preadoles- cents want to differentiate themselvesfrom younger children. They also wantto explore new experiences previously\"forbidden\" to them. Most girls want todress like older girls in school and pop-ular television and musical personali-ties, use cosmetics and nail polish, andbe able to spend long periods of timeunsupervised with their best friends intheir room. Most boys want to play moremature (T [teen]-rated) video games,stay up late watching television, and nothave to share in competitive sports(e.g., football, soccer, basketball, base-ball) with younger children. Both want\"grown-up experiences,\" such as drink-ing coffee, earning their own money,buying things with personal earnings,having their own cell phone, and watch-ing PG-13 movies. Television shows and movies : Pre- adolescents want to watch television andbe the first in their peer group to see thelatest popular movie. The types of tele-vision shows and movies that most ap-peal to this age group are essentiallycomedy and action-oriented. Girls willalso be interested in romantic come-dies, while boys will tend to like sportthemes. Both sexes also enjoy light situ-ation comedies and dramas, preferablyfamily- or relationship-based. Preteensare eager to discover and learn the rulesand roles of how to get along in society.They want to identify themselves with characters that are similar to themselvesor have characteristics preteens aspireto emulate. Humor in the media :The ability to un- derstand more abstract humor is fastdeveloping at this age. Preadolescentsbegin to enjoy darker, edgier, \"irrever-ent\" forms of media humor (sarcasm,ridicule) such as gross jokes, the humil-iation of other characters, and depic-tions of the outwitting of authority fig-ures (e.g., parents, teachers, schoolprincipals, police, judges). For boysmore than girls, humor with a dark sideholds significant appeal. \"Gross-out\"humor is also entertaining at this agebecause it is considered a taboo. The ir-reverent actions of certain cartooncharacters, or the latest \"bad-boy/bad-girl\" antics of a rebellious sports hero ormusical star, appeal to the preadoles-cent's desire for independence and forthe freedom to be similarly daring. Ingeneral, however, preteens are still notready to enjoy more sophisticated formsof humor that deal with political issues, ethnicity, or sexuality (Acuff 1997). Magazines and books :There are a num- ber of publications whose contents areoriented toward preteen interests andfeature a variety of role models for themto emulate. Comic books and sports andvideo game magazines are usually tar-geted toward boys. Girls tend to prefermagazines dealing with the latest newsand gossip about their favorite \"teenYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 291idols\" from the worlds of music, televi- sion, and film, as well as teen beautymagazines that provide skin care andmakeup tips and show the latest clothingand hairstyle trends. Many girls at thisage also enjoy how-to magazines orbooks dealing with pet care; principallydogs and cats, but also horses, a particu-lar attraction for preteens. Music :Interest in pop music is increas- ing during this stage, usually occurringin girls earlier than in boys. Girls tendto prefer pop songs with danceablerhythms and simple melodies, whereasboys tend to prefer harder-edged andless mainstream types of music withaction-based lyrics that are laced withblack humor and at times even violentthemes. Video and computer games :Boys are more avid game players than girls, the latter ofwhom account for only about 20% ofelectronic game play (Acuff 1997). Theseelectronic types of entertainment providethe challenge, competition, complexity,stimulation, variety, and rewards boysand girls seek at this age. Sports :Preteens, especially boys, be- come passionate about sports. This ac-tivity offers them the opportunity tochallenge their own abilities and gainskill over time; it enables them to com-pete with others and gauge their relativelevel of physical prowess; and it pro-vides time to just have fun with theirfriends and schoolmates. As profes-sional sports teams (particularly foot- ball, soccer, basketball, and baseball)become a major source of interest, boyswant to acquire all types of sports para-phernalia for their personal use and toshare with their closest friends. Girls'sports involvement increases duringthis period, but remains lower than thatof boys. Sixty-one percent of boys re- ported playing at least one sport on anorganized team, compared to only 38%of girls (U.S. National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign 1999, Sports Illus-trated for Kids 1998). Preadolescents also experience changes in their beliefs and attitudes regarding drugusage while moving into early adolescence.Because a dramatic upswing in drugawareness and experimentation has beenfound in the United States among this group (Partnership for a Drug-Free Amer-ica 1999), it is the primary youth target forthe National Youth Anti-Drug Media Cam-paign. From sixth grade (average age 12years) to eighth grade (average age 14years), a steady erosion of anti-drug feel-ings has been shown, with a clear shift togreater acceptance of illicit substances,particularly marijuana. While three-quarters of fifth graders (i.e., still pre-teens) feel that \"taking drugs scares me,\"less than two-thirds of sixth graders andonly one-third of eighth graders (earlyadolescents) feel that way. The great ma-jority of seventh (80%) and eighth (82%)graders do not perceive any major risk inexperimenting with marijuana. In sixthgrade, about 20% have at least a fewYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 292friends who use marijuana or inhalants. The percentage of preadolescents friends marijuana increasessignificantly, reaching 40% in seventhgrade and 59% in eighth grade. Based on these findings, the U.S. National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has in- corporated into the design of its messagesthe four Sensation-Seeking Targeting(SENTAR) principles described in Chap-ter Fourteen, as well as elements from theSocial Cognitive Theory, the Health BeliefModel, and the Theories of ReasonedAction and Planned Behavior. The mes-sages are particularly geared toward highsensation-seekers, although they have alsobeen proven to be successful with lowsensation-seekers (Palmgreen et al. 2001,1995). The wants of preadolescents described in the previous paragraphs should be given asequally serious consideration as thisgroup's needs when health promotion in- terventions are being developed for them.Given that a general upswing occurs insensation-seeking during preadolescence,the authors of this book recommend thatthose working with this age group gain afull understanding of the principles dis-cussed in Chapter Fourteen and recognizethat while preadolescents need outlets for novelty and fun, they often confuse thiswith wanting to try experiences (e.g., smoking marijuana) that are potentiallyharmful and dangerous to them. By under-standing that increased sensation-seekingamong preadolescents is a normal reflec-tion of their growth and development process, program designers may betterlearn how to provide youth with satisfyingand safe health-promoting alternatives.When planning interventions, the mosteffective way to identify preadolescentwants is to develop questionnaires at thelocal level and encourage the target groupmembers to express their own preferencesregarding media entertainment, social ac-tivities, and types of food, physical activi-ties, and sports they most enjoy. The Health-Promoting Developmental Goals of Preadolescence In developing health promotion and pre- vention programs for this age group, de-signers need to include not only theparticular health goals of their interven-tions (e.g., increase physical activityamong preadolescent girls, improve nu-tritional intake among preadolescent male athletes), but also a series of develop- mental goals that will contribute to the preadolescent's ability to adopt health-promoting behaviors. These goals may bedivided into five categories: (1) biologicalchanges and developmental goals; (2) changes lifestyle-specific devel-opmental goals; and (5) gender-specificdevelopmental goals. The first three basic goals are related to the biological, cognitive, and socio-emotionalchanges universally experienced by pre-adolescents, as discussed in ChapterTwenty-six. Although separated to facili-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 293tate the reader's comprehension, these goals are in reality interrelated and consti-tute the foundation for achieving health-promoting behaviors. The fourth categoryaddresses the specific developmental goalsthat preadolescents should master to helpthem adopt specific health-promotinglifestyle behaviors. These include safer sexpractices, responsible and reasonabledrinking, tobacco and drug resistanceskills, nonviolent anger expression andconflict resolution, and healthy nutritionand adequate physical activity. The fifthcategory identifies gender-specific devel-opmental goals that will help boys and girlsadopt health-promoting lifestyles. Preadolescents need to learn and adopt a series of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviorsthat will protect them from health-compromising behaviors as they growolder. Unfortunately, acquiring these be-liefs, attitudes, and behaviors is not auto-matic; parents, teachers, and other adultsshould not assume that preadolescents willlearn them on their own. Instead, they willneed guidance from caring and supportiveadults and through age-appropriate inter-ventions and programs that appeal topreadolescent needs and wants and ac-tively engage them in the mastery process.This mastery should include the followingstage-specific goals: Biological changes and developmental goals: to accept and enjoy themselves and their changing bodies (Brooks-Gunn et al.1993)to develop the capacity to become awareof, regulate, and satisfy increasing high sensation-seeking needs by identifyingactivities that are fun, yet safe andhealthy, to try to achieve a greater autonomy with re-spect to aspects of daily living and self-care, such as personal hygiene andgrooming to be able to identify a supportive adultwith whom to share their curiosity andquestions about body changes Cognitive changes and developmental goals: to master and apply basic concrete log- ical operations (logic of classes and ofrelations, principle of conservation,and reversibility of thought processes)to actual life situations (e.g., under-standing that while it is normal forpreteens to gain weight, they will also become taller and perhaps lookthinner) to shift from egocentric thought tosocio-centric thought, enabling them toplace themselves in other people's situ-ations and understand their points ofview as well to develop the capacity to engage in self-reflective thinking, or reciprocal perspective-taking , by making inferences about other people's perspectives, thusreflecting on their own behavior andtheir own motivation from the otherperson's point of view (Selman 1977) to begin to develop the ability to accu-rately read nonverbal and verbal cuesthat will help them to decide whom toYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 294trust and whom not to trust (e.g., among peers, older schoolmates, neighbors) to understand the consequences of ac-tions they are frequently involved in atthis age (e.g., body image consequencesof eating impulsively or increasing physical activity; another person's feel-ings after being physically or verballymistreated) to establish a sense of industry, by learn- ing how to produce things and do the jobwell, thereby winning the recognitionand approval of others and gaining afeeling of success (Erikson 1968) to develop more autonomy in organizingtheir daily schedule to responsibly fit in their home and school obligations (e.g.,sports practices, homework, householdchores) and leisure time (getting to-gether with friends, enjoying hobbies) to be aware of how parents earn moneyand to improve impulse control skills tosave and spend money responsibly Socio-emotional changes and developmental goals: to develop the capacity to regulate and appropriately verbalize the moodchanges and intense emotions (e.g.,anger, frustration, fear, envy, disap-pointment) that accompany puberty to be able to identify at least one sup-portive adult with whom to share in-tense feelings (e.g., excitement, anger,sadness, apprehension, jealousy) to develop the capacity to engage in re- flective empathy , or the ability to experi- ence how another person feels andcompare it to one's own feelings. This isthe basis for emotionally understanding the feelings of others and reasoningabout others' feelings in relationship toone's own personal experiences and aninternalized sense of self (Greenspanand Shanker 2003, 2002). to take responsibility for one's own be-havior by learning when and how toapologize and repair damage to be able to define oneself by one'squalities (e.g., nice, cool, smart, strong,considerate, humorous, athletic, goodstudent) and own interests (type offoods preferred, favorite colors and styles of clothing, pastime activitiesenjoyed) rather than seeing oneself only through peer group perceptions(Greenspan 1993). This developmentalgoal facilitates the creation of internalstandards based on a sense of self that ismore stable and provides a basis uponwhich to judge experiences and furtherreflect upon them. to be assertive with parents by express-ing likes and dislikes in appropriateways to be able to identify enjoyable activitiesthey would like to share with parents to develop social skills that allow themto interact and practice the give-and-take process for achieving agreementamong their peers to develop the capacity to establish anintimate one-to-one relationship with aplaymate of the same sex (\"best friend\")(Sullivan 1953) to start developing a strong value for re-specting the trust given by a close friendby being loyal to him or her (e.g., notYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 295telling secrets to another person, caring for her/his safety and well-being) to be able to successfully negotiate the intricacies of multiple relationshipswithin a group and be able to hold on totwo realities at once: the peer group re-ality and their emerging inner reality ofvalues and attitudes, including a stronginternal sense of what is right andwrong, even if this disagrees with thepeer group reality (Greenspan 1993) Lifestyle-specific developmental goals: Safer sex practices:Preadolescents are exposed to sexual coer-cion and media messages that glorify ca-sual and frequent sexual experiences.During this developmental stage, girlsparticularly begin to have romantic ideasand to show interest in the opposite sex.However, preadolescents in general feelembarrassed about discussing sexual is-sues with adults, and preteen girls, in par-ticular, are embarrassed to talk about sexin front of boys. Oftentimes, parents aswell feel uncomfortable talking about sex-ual relations with their children, feelingunsure about how much information toprovide and about their own ability tocompletely and accurately answer ques-tions about the biological and hormonalchanges taking place in their children'sbodies. In this light, the success of thepreadolescent's learning process may per-haps be best ensured by school- and othercommunity-based programs that supple-ment, support, and reinforce parentalmessages and aim for the mastery of thefollowing developmental goals: to be able to read nonverbal and verbal cues that suggest inappropriate sexualintentions from others to be able to anticipate, react to, andprotect themselves from unwanted sex-ual advances and coercion by seekinghelp from one or more supportive adults to be able to identify at least one sup-portive adult with whom to share ques-tions about sexuality development andexperiences to know their parents' values and expec-tations regarding appropriate behaviorswhen interacting with the opposite sex to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze messages about sex and sexuality asdepicted on television and in musicvideos, films, magazines, and books(media literacy skills) to believe that girls and boys should pos-sess equal rights and responsibilities to be empowered to explore sexualityand express affection through behaviorssuch as kissing and holding hands, yetholding a personal conviction about notmoving into sexual relationships untilone feels emotionally ready to demonstrate respect for girls andboys who have interests and manners ofself-expression that are different fromthe ones traditionally expected of therespective genders (i.e., girls who aretomboys, boys who are effeminate) Responsible and reasonable alcohol experimentation:Because their growth and developmentprocess is far from complete, preadoles-cents should not drink alcohol. Neverthe-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 296less, this is a frequent reality in many countries of the Americas at all socioeco-nomic levels and, indeed, around theworld. Given that the use of alcohol iswidespread and enjoys general cultural ac-ceptance in many societies, promotingalcohol abstinence among adolescentsmight not be a realistic goal to set. Yet par-ents, other adults, and health promotionand prevention programs can and shouldwork together to help equip preadoles-cents for how best to approach and handlethemselves in situations where alcohol isavailable. Not only is this age group themost vulnerable to peer pressures; it isalso the most critical point at which inter-ventions should begin preparing adoles-cents to master resistance skills, so that asthey mature they will more easily andreadily adopt safe and responsible drink-ing habits. The developmental goals to beachieved during preadolescence include: if choosing to experiment with alcohol,to be willing to do so only on certainsocial occasions (e.g., New Year's Eve,family celebrations) and under adultsupervision to know their parents' values and expec-tations regarding appropriate behaviorswhen experimenting with alcohol to develop the capacity to identify andadopt safer and healthier alternatives todrinking alcohol when hanging out withfriends to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze messages about alcohol drinking asdepicted on television, in music videosand movies, and in print and electronic advertising (media literacy skills) to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze role model behaviors that includeexcessive and irresponsible alcoholconsumption (including media rolemodels and relatives) to develop the capacity to recognize andcritically analyze social pressures to ini-tiate drinking as a rite of passage, as wellas the skills to resist them to understand the varying alcohol con-tents of beer, wine, and mixed drinks;how varying amounts of alcohol affectthe body and brain; and the commu-nity's social and legal limits associatedwith what is considered \"reasonable andresponsible\" drinking Nonviolent anger expression and conflict resolution:In modern life, forms of random and gangviolence have invaded nearly every com-munity to some extent, while remaining aserious public health problem in theirmost traditional enclave: large poor andurban areas. Not only are children todaymore exposed to violence in their dailylives, but they are also increasingly ex-posed to expressions of explicit violence inmedia programming tailored to the youthmarket. Home, school, and community activities should encourage preadolescents to mas-ter violence prevention skills and under-stand the benefit to their own safety andwell-being, as well as that of others, ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 297learning how to work through situations that provoke anger utilizing peaceful dia-logue and negotiation techniques. Thesepromotion and prevention activitiesshould aim to help preadolescents achievethe following developmental goals: to be able to identify feelings of anger,frustration, jealousy, envy, and othernegative feelings and what causes them,as well as to adopt nonviolent strategiesto express these feelings in socially ac-ceptable ways (e.g., discussing themwith parents, teachers, peers, othertrusted individuals in the community) to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze messages about violence as de-picted on television, and in movies,musical videos, books, and magazines(media literacy skills) to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze role model behaviors that use vio-lence as a strategy to express anger orsolve conflicts (including media rolemodels, peers, and relatives) to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze and apply learned skills to resist so-cial pressures to use violence as an ex-pression of manhood (boys) or strengthand toughness (girls) to be able to identify at least one sup-portive adult with whom one feels com-fortable sharing anger and other intense feelings of distress to know their parents' values and expec-tations regarding appropriate behaviorsfor anger expression and conflict resolutionHealthy nutrition: Weight gain increases and peaks during the adolescent growth spurt. Pubertal weightgain accounts for about 50% of an individ-ual's ideal adult body weight (Neinstein2002). Preadolescents, especially girls,need to accept that weight gain during thisperiod is a normal and necessary part of thegrowth and development process. On theother hand, boys and girls also need to learnhow to maintain a healthy optimal weightthrough increasing physical activity levelsand acquiring a sufficient degree of self-control over impulsive eating behaviors. In order to help preadolescents adopt and maintain healthy eating habits as they ma-ture, the following developmental goalsshould be promoted: to be able to identify foods and foodcombinations they enjoy eating that arenutritionally balanced and accessible,and provide the necessary calories tomaintain a healthy body weight to be able to identify nutritional snacksavailable at home and school that willsatisfy their appetite and serve ashealthier alternatives for foods high insugars, carbohydrates, and/or fats to be able to identify one or more sup-portive adults who can guide them in thechoice of satisfying and healthy mealsand snacks to know their parents' values and expec-tations regarding appropriate behaviorsfor satisfying their appetite and main- taining a healthy weightYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 298to be able to regulate and control daily consumption of sugars, carbohydrates,and fats to understand the growth curve, beaware of the ideal weight for their ageand height, and understand how foodchoices contribute to achieving andmaintaining this ideal weight to be aware of the interrelationship be-tween healthy nutrition and positivebody image to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze messages about impulsive eating,eating disorders, and fast food con-sumption as depicted on television, andin movies, music, magazines, and pro-motional advertising (media literacyskills) Adequate levels of physical activity: The easy access to and appeal of fast food,television viewing, and computer andvideo games, as well as sedentary class-room and/or work-related activities, pro-vide distractions from and even obstaclesto the need for preadolescents to achieveand maintain healthy levels of physicalactivity in their daily lives. As girls andboys progress through the adolescentyears, they experience a steady decline inthe levels of physical activity, coincidingwith an increase in academic and/or jobdemands and a growing focus on othertypes of personal interests. Due to thesignificant weight gain that naturally oc-curs during puberty, it is essential thatparents and the community at large pro-vide appealing incentives for preadoles-cents to achieve and maintain sufficientlevels of physical energy exertion to coun- teract and balance this increase in bodyweight. Girls are particularly affected by the in- evitability of weight gain due to concernsrelated to body image and because teenculture (classmates, fashion magazines,media role models) frowns upon youngbodies that are not thin. The natural ten-dency of preadolescent girls, influencedby traditional messages from society,(e.g., parental chiding and other expres-sions of concern, school nutrition cur-riculum) has been to focus on increasingself-control over caloric intake and diges-tion, instead of increasing physical activ-ity levels, which is more commonly asso-ciated with boys. There is an urgent needfor educational curricula, health promo- tion and prevention interventions, themedia, and even parenting techniques toshift from this classical approach thatplaces preadolescent girls at risk for eat-ing disorders to more evidence-basedstrategies which promote healthy weightmanagement through an emphasis on en-hanced physical activity versus rigid eat-ing behaviors. In order to encourage preadolescents to discover enjoyable activities involvingphysical exercise and sports participation,health promotion and prevention effortsshould help this age group to achieve thefollowing developmental goals: to be able to organize, with their par- ents' support, their after-school timeYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT | 299and determine the optimal amount of physical activity that should occur dur-ing this period of the day to become aware of their natural abili-ties and skill regarding particular sportsor other related activities involvingphysical exercise to be able to identify sports or activitiesthey enjoy that are accessible to themand provide adequate physical exerciseto maintain a healthy weight to be aware of the interrelationship be-tween physical activity and positive bodyimage and of the individual activity levelnecessary to achieve and maintain ahealthy body weight to understand the growth curve, beaware of the ideal weight for their ageand height, and understand how differ-ent types of physical activity enable thebody to burn excess calories to develop the capacity to critically ana-lyze activities (e.g., watching television,doing homework, studying or playing onthe computer) and technologies (e.g.,elevators, escalators, motorized trans-portation) that promote sedentary be-haviors and determine how to alternateor combine these with activities thatpromote physical energy exertion to identify physical activity as a healthy strat-egy for reducing levels of stress and anxiety(Norris, Carrol, and Cochrane 1992) Tobacco/drug resistance skills: At the same time that preadolescents aretargeted by the tobacco industry, they arealso increasingly exposed to illegal drugoffers, especially marijuana. In order tohelp preadolescents adopt strong resistant skills against tobacco and drug use, fami-lies and communities should work to-gether to help this age group master thefollowing development goals: to understand the short- and long-term health consequences of tobacco anddrug use and develop the resistanceskills to refuse them. If preadoles-cents can provide meaningful reasons,related to their actual lives, to refuse in-volvement with these products, they de-velop personal convictions , which last longer than attitudes. Therefore, achange in peer attitudes may cause apreadolescent's negative attitude to-ward tobacco and drugs to change,whereas a personal conviction will bemore resistant to peers' changes inattitudes. to be able to identify at least one sup-portive adult with whom to share ques-tions and concerns about tobacco anddrug use, as well as experiences of hav-ing been offered these products to know their parents' values and expec-tations regarding appropriate behaviorswhen dealing with tobacco and/or drugoffers to develop the capacity to critically analyze tobacco industry promotional messagesin the mass media, as well as depictions oftobacco and drug use on television and infilms, music videos, books, and maga-zines (media literacy skills) to be empowered to exercise their rightto enjoy smoke-free environmentswhere they live, learn, work, and playYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 300Gender-specific developmental goals: In addition to the four groups of develop- mental goals described on the previouspages, preadolescent girls and boys needguidance in mastering gender-specificdevelopmental goals which will raise theirawareness regarding traditional and perva-sive stereotypes of masculinity and femi-ninity and help protect them from theirharmful effects. Preadolescence is a periodof development when boys and girls still tend to spend the majority of their time withsame-sex friends. Opposite-sex interactionsare often loaded with competition and var-ious degrees of anxiety caused by shyness,awkwardness, uncertainty, and inadequatecommunication. These difficulties may betranslated into practical joke-playing andmaking fun of the other sex, which often relyon the perpetuation of unfair, unin-formed, and/or inaccurate beliefs about mas- culinity and femininity and which in turnmay interfere with the development ofhealthy male-female relationships at this andfuture stages. By the end of this period, girlsand boys should have mastered the follow-ing developmental goals: Girls: to develop the ability to quickly identify nonverbal behaviors and social contextsthat might expose them to sexual coer-cion. This requires strengthening girls'visual and spatial skills, which are gen-erally weaker than those of boys, as seenin Chapter Twenty-seven. to develop the ability to be assertivewithout using harmful interpersonalaggressionto identify at least one supportive fe-male adult with whom to critically ana-lyze socially expected gender roles andbehaviors to develop the ability to analyze tradi-tional versions of femininity and reflectupon how they feel about them, withinthe context of their own personal needsand wants to develop media literacy skills thatallow them to critically analyze mediamessages concerning body image andfeminine appearance and reflect uponthem, based on their sense of self andtheir individual needs and wants to develop a high approach coping styleto deal with daily challenges andstresses, and avoidance coping abilitieswhen confronted with uncontrollableand/or overwhelming stressors.

It concludeswith a discussion of the five categories ofhealth-promoting developmental goalsthis group should master before movinginto early adolescence, taking into accountuniversal biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional changes occurring upon enter-ing into adolescence, as well as lifestylebehaviors and gender-specific tasks. The Pan American Health Organization considers preadolescence to be the mostcritical juncture at which health promo-tion and prevention endeavors shouldbegin activities promoting the importanceof healthy lifestyles and environments. If these efforts are postponed until later on,their focus will most likely be less on pre-vention and more on how to controlhealth-compromising behaviors that havealready become well-entrenched and willtherefore present greater challenges. While the initial goal of these health pro- motion and prevention initiatives may be toincrease access to health information andpreadolescents' knowledge about healthrisks, program designers need to be awareof the gap existing between knowledge and behavior change and develop innovative,YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 302creative, and appealing strategies that mo- tivate this age group to master the develop-mental goals presented in this chapter.This mastery, in turn, will help preadoles-cents successfully navigate the increasinglychallenging years of change ahead througha sense of empowerment and the personalconviction that they have the capacity to make conscious choices about their lives,including the desirability of moving awayfrom harmful and negative influences andsituations as a means of achieving their ownself-set goals and life plan.

Early adolescence is a period of new biological, cognitive, sexual, and socio-emotional changes. Early adolescents will be challenged to learn how to dealwith a variety of new experiences related to menstruation, ejaculation, nocturnal emis-sions (\"wet dreams\"), and with regulation of feelings of sexual arousal. It is the stage atwhich understanding and accepting that sexual activity is voluntary, and learning how toreflect this in one's behavior, become crucial. Early adolescents will be developing thepotential for more abstract types of thinking and will begin to look beyond what they havebeen told up to this point by their parents and other adults and start to think for them-selves. Early adolescents also begin to explore the world with more independence andless parental supervision and to spend more time with their friends in small same-sexsubgroups, or cliques , as discussed in Chapter Seventeen. As their bodies continue to change, so will their interests, the type of relationships and friendships they establish,the ways they choose to have fun, and their strategies for analyzing new situations usingemerging cognitive skills. The average age of menarche varies from race to race. Less than 10% of U.S. girls start to menstruate before 11 years, yet 90% are menstruating by 13.75 years of age, with a me-dian age of 12.43 years (Chumlea et al. 2003, Neinstein 2002). African-American girlshave their menarche at an average age of 12.1-12.3 years (Freedman et al. 2002; Wu,Mendola, and Buck 2002; Herman-Giddens et al. 1997). The average age for white girls[Chapter Twenty-nine ] Early Intervention during Adolescence: The Early Adolescent PeriodYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 307in the United States is between 12.6-12.88 years (Freedman et al. 2002, Herman-Giddens et al. 1997), while Mexican-American girls have their menarche at anaverage age of 12.2 years (Chumlea et al.2003; Wu, Mendola, and Buck 2002). Themedian age at menarche found amongItalian girls was 11.9 (range = 11.4 to 12.4 years) (Bona, Castellino, and Petri 2002).The median age at menarche for Braziliangirls ranges between 11 and 12.6 years indifferent studies (Borges and Pires Junior2000, Tavares et al. 2000).

Studies of girls' attitudes and beliefs about menstruation revealed that 40% were bothpleased and scared about what was hap-pening to their bodies and 20% had nega-tive feelings. The girls more likely to havenegative feelings are those who experienceunpleasant physical symptoms duringtheir period, those who begin menstruat-ing relatively early, those who were notsufficiently prepared for the event, orthose who received information about theprocess from a person who expressed neg-ative feelings. During their adolescentyears, three out of four teens develop acne.Girls often notice an aggravation of theiracne condition prior to their menstrualperiod each month, another source of neg-ative feelings (American Academy of Childand Adolescent Psychiatry 1999). During early adolescence, there is also a universal progression into a new dimen-sion of thinking, in which teens begin em-ploying more formal operations (i.e., more abstract reasoning) and less concrete op-erations in their daily routine. They nowturn to manipulating ideas internally,seeking hypotheses, experimenting, andutilizing both deductive and inductive rea-soning. As they achieve increasing auton-omy, they want to begin dating and to ex-plore more in depth their sexuality and\"forbidden\" behaviors (e.g., experimenta-tion with tobacco, alcohol, and/or drugs). Early adolescents who did not develop a strong personal conviction (see Chapter Twenty-eight section on developmental goals) against drug use during preadoles-cence experience a clear shift towardgreater acceptance, starting with tobaccouse. In Chile, the minimum average age forfirst-time smoking is 12.9 years for to-bacco and 14.4 years for marijuana (PanAmerican Health Organization 2002c). Inone study in Argentina, 35% of adoles-cents ages 12 to 15 reported having usedalcohol and tobacco within the past 30 days (Pan American Health Organization2002b). In the United States, 80% of 14-year-olds reported not seeing any greatrisk in trying marijuana (Partnership for aDrug-Free America 1999). The beginning of this adolescent stage also marks the advent of increased independ-ence. Parental supervision and directmonitoring decrease. Early adolescentsoften go unsupervised to the movies, shop on their own more frequently, and maketheir own decisions about item and brandpurchases much more independently thanYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 309ever before. During this time, teens also move rapidly toward adult tastes andchoices. Brand consciousness and dis-cernment increase as a direct result ofgrowing peer influence. Early adolescents are social creatures who tend to gravitate toward friends andsocial-group activities far more than inprevious years. They seek out support fromand affiliation with a social subgroup orclique (e.g., school athletes, student lead-ers, those who rebel against authority,those who are unstylish and sociallyinept). They will gravitate toward the typeof group that best satisfies their own needs for acceptance, self-esteem, and asser- tion. Their choice will be based on match-ing their own emerging sense of self, andtheir abilities and interests, with those ofother individuals they perceive to sharesimilar characteristics. Although identity is being constructed constantly throughout the course of life,early adolescence is a key period of iden-tity formation in terms of teens' futuresexual and intimate relationships andtheir role in society. The importance of thepeer group in helping the early adolescentto answer key identity questions (i.e.,\"Who am I?\" \"How does my backgrounddefine me?\" and \"What I want to be-come in life?\") cannot be underestimated.The answers to these questions depend onsocial feedback from peers who providethe adolescent with their perception andevaluation of him or her. In this sense,identity is based on psychosocial reciprocity .In this process of establishing his/her own separate identity, distinct from estab-lished family and social values, there arethree sets of competencies that are key to a healthy adolescent development. Althoughthese are always evolving competencies,early adolescence is the period when prac-ticing these competencies becomes crucialfor future relationships and behaviors (Greenspan 2002, Steinberg 1999). The first of these sets of competencies is the capacity to develop autonomy and at the same time accept dependency . Early adolescents need to establish a healthy sense of independencefrom their parents and increasingly come todepend upon their peers for approval andsense of identity. At the same time, in manycases, they still depend upon their parents forcomfort even if they consciously resist ac-knowledging this fact. Accepting the need forautonomy and dependency, then, is aprocess fueled with ambivalent feelings oflearning when to ask for autonomy and whento accept dependency. Secondly, early adolescents are confronted with learning the dual capacity for controlling aggression on the one hand, and practicing em- pathy on the other hand. They need to learn how to regulate their intense feelings of angerand yet be assertive in expressing their emo-tions. They also need to practice empathy, acompetency that allows them to better un-derstand and show concern for other peo-ple's strong emotions. Thirdly, early adolescents will develop competencies to gradually explore sexual-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 310ity, together with the capacity for develop- ing respectful intimacy , with other boys and girls. This is the stage when youngpeople start to form close and caring rela-tionships with other people, express sex-ual feelings, and enjoy physical contactwith others. These competencies are extremely rele- vant in our discussion of adopting andmaintaining health-promoting lifestylesduring adolescence, especially as regardsthe development of healthy safe sex prac-tices. Following is an expansion of theseimportant abilities and how they relate tobehavior change. Autonomy and dependency: From the viewpoint of the adolescent, establish-ing a sense of autonomy is a very im-portant part of becoming an adult.From the perspective of human devel- opment, becoming an autonomousperson is one of the fundamental devel-opmental tasks to be mastered duringthe adolescent years. The struggle of ado-lescents to establish themselves as in-dependent, self-governing individuals\u2014in their own eyes and in the eyes ofothers\u2014is a long and occasionallydifficult process, not only for youngpeople themselves, but also for thosearound them, particularly parents,teachers, and other figures of authority.Furthermore, this growth of autonomyduring adolescence is often misunder-stood. Autonomy is often confused withrebellion, and becoming an independ-ent person is often equated with break-ing away from the family (Steinberg 1999). The emergence of expressions of auton- omy by early adolescents often causesgreat anxiety in parents as well, since itforces them to deal with their own feelings of dependency towards their children. During this period, parents begin feeling avague sense of rejection from their earlyadolescents, who show increasingly lessinterest in family activities, a greater ten-dency to make plans for the weekend orvacations that do not involve their parents,and a decided preference for hanging outwith friends instead. Parents find them-selves missing that interaction with theirchildren, and many come to the realizationthat they will have to discover new ways ofengaging their adolescents' attention andinterest. Early adolescence indeed marksthe beginning of a long process of parent-child separation that reaches its peak whenlate adolescents or youth leave home, thuscreating the \"empty nest syndrome\" forthe parents being left behind. Ideally,however, early adolescence should be aperiod of \"mutual letting-go,\" in whichboth child and parent maintain close emo-tional connections that may be easily ac-cessed as needed. Adolescents in today's world probably spend much more time away from the di-rect supervision of adults, either by them-selves or with their peers, than ever in thepast. Therefore, learning how to governone's own behavior in a responsible fash-ion is a crucial task for contemporaryYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 311youth, many of whom feel pressured\u2014by parents, by friends, and by the media\u2014togrow up quickly and to act like adults at anearlier age than ever before. Psychologists generally differentiate three types of autonomy in adolescence: emo- tional autonomy , which refers to emotional independence in relationships with oth-ers, especially parents; behavioral auton- omy , which refers to the development of independent decision-making abilities;and value autonomy , which concerns the development of independent beliefs. Emotional autonomy develops best under circumstances that encourage both indi-viduation and emotional closeness. Ado-lescents whose parents use a great deal ofenabling techniques and relatively fewconstraining techniques are more likely todevelop in healthy ways. They are moreconfident in themselves and score higheron measures of ego development and psy-chosocial competence. This finding coin-cides with other research indicating thathealthy identity development is morelikely to occur within families in whichadolescents are simultaneously encour-aged to be connected to their parents andto express their own individuality. In au-thoritarian households, where rules arerigidly enforced but seldom explained tothe child, adjusting to adolescence is moredifficult for the family as a whole. Author-itarian parents have a greater tendency toview the child's increasing emotional in-dependence as a sign of rebelliousness or alack of respect, and they may resist theiradolescent's growing need for independ- ence, rather than accepting it openly.When closeness is absent as well, theproblems are compounded. In families inwhich excessive parental control is accom-panied by extreme coldness and excessivediscipline, the adolescent may rebel ex-plicitly against parental standards, in anattempt to assert his or her independencein a visible and unequivocal fashion.Fuhrman and Holmbech (1995) have sug-gested that adolescents from particularlyhostile or stressful family environmentsmay do best when they actively detachthemselves from their parents. One of the most tangible ways in which the development during adolescence of behav- ioral autonomy is evident is in the growth of decision-making abilities. As individualsmature, they become better able to seek outand weigh the advice of individuals withdifferent degrees of expertise and to usethis information in making independentdecisions. The prefrontal lobe, as dis-cussed in Chapters Nine, Twelve, and Thir-teen of this book, controls executive cogni-tive functioning, such as increasedproblem-solving capacity, ability to planfor the future, and impulse control. Studies of the development of executive functions in children and adolescents illustrate theprobable differential timing for the matu-ration of these functions. Levin et al. (1991)found significant increases in a number of executive function measures as a functionof age. Differences in sensitivity to feed- back, problem-solving, concept formation,and impulse control between 7-to-8-year-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 312old and 9-to-12-year-old age groups of de- velopmentally normal children werefound. Further significant developmental advances were noted in memory strategies,memory efficiency, planning of time,problem-solving, and hypothesis-seekingbetween 9-to-12-year-old and 13-to-15-year-old age groups. The final develop-ment of prefrontal lobe occurs duringlate adolescence, reflected as in-creased and synaptic density of maturefrontal lobe gray matter (Sowell et al.2001). Consequently, even though by early ado- lescence the development of executivefunctions is underway, this group will stillcontinue to need effective supervision andguidance in learning how to organize itselfin issues related to time, space, problem-solving, and decision-making, since finalprefrontal lobe maturation will not occuruntil several years later. At the same time, genuine increases in be- havioral autonomy occur only in middleand late adolescence (between ages 15 and18), when conformity both to parents andto peers declines even though peer pres-sure continues to increase (Steinberg1999). During early adolescence, peerpressure is particularly high in a variety ofissues related to day-to-day activities.This susceptibility achieves its peakaround 14 years of age and then falls dur-ing middle and late adolescence . Percep-tions of the strength of peer pressure in- crease throughout the early adolescenceperiod, while susceptibility to parental pressure decreases. Adolescents whoseparents are extremely authoritarian or ex-tremely permissive are the most easily in-fluenced by their friends, especially in an-tisocial situations. Erickson (1982) described a particular strength of early adolescents, fidelity , the search for something and somebody to betrue to. Fidelity can only emerge throughthe interplay of social experiences in theindividual's development and incarnatesthe capacity to sustain freely given loyal-ties even when confronted with inevitablecontradictions between one's own andother people's value systems. In thissense, fidelity can become a dimension ofadolescent ego strength. It defines whatwe are faithful to, what we identify with,and what in turn we are identified by. Itimplies having strong personal convic-tions about different behaviors (e.g., druguse, early sexual experimentation, physi-cal aggression). Fidelity is essential forthe development of autonomous behavior(Muss 1996). Early adolescents whose sense of self has enabled them to develop internal stan-dards and strong personal convictions willnonetheless find themselves challenged toassess their standards and convictions asthe world around them begins to openeven further (Greenspan and Shanker2003). They will judge new experiencesYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 313and further reflect on them. They will use abilities of multiple-cause thinking, whichis the ability to give multiple reasons for abehavior or feeling and set up multiple hy-potheses for it. Early adolescents will havethe ability to identify multiple angles toproblem-solving. Gray-area thinkingability will also help early adolescents torealize that there exist different degrees ofemotions within the realm of anger, love,excitement, and disappointment, and todescribe their own feelings in terms ofthese degrees. They will begin to reflect onmomentary feelings or experiences and, atthe same time, compare these to a morelong-term view of themselves and theirexperiences, values, and goals or ideals.Early adolescents will need to develop ef-fective coping skills to deal with the anxi-ety that can accompany these new experi-ences, in order to counteract feelings ofintimidation, insecurity, and rigidity intheir response to the events. According to Lawrence Kohlberg's devel- opment of moral reasoning theory (Kohl-berg 1976), adolescence is a time of poten-tially internalizing right and wrong on thebasis of one's own basic moral principlesand not only in terms of society's rules andconsequences. This shift traditionallydoes not tend to occur until late in adoles-cents who have not previously developedinternal standards and strong personalconvictions, suggesting that unfortunately,the development of value autonomy occurs later than the development of either emo-tional or behavioral autonomy.Aggression and empathy: Aggressive behavior is generally learned at homefrom an early age but is often enhancedby the sociocultural environment. Teenswhose parents used corporal punish-ment may be more likely to resolve con-flicts with aggression, too. Many moviesand television programs feature vio-lence in casual and even humorous situ-ations, inferring that violence is normalbehavior\u2014an idea that is particularlydangerous for children already predis-posed to aggression. The American Psy-chological Association has estimatedthat the average child or teenager in theUnited States views 10,000 murders,rapes, and aggravated assaults per yearon television alone, or approximately200,000 by the time the person reachesadulthood (Huston et al. 1992). Newtechnology capabilities enable cabletelevision to reach the farthest edges ofthe earth, bringing this content to newviewing audiences and cultures. Physicalaggressiveness is also praised and re-warded in many sports, at all levels, be-ginning on the practice fields of schoolsand extending all the way up to profes-sional sports. Violence is also an unfor-tunate reality in many neighborhoodswhere poverty is a factor. Children whogrow up with these messages from fam-ily, coaches, the media, and the streetsmay have greater difficulties controllingtheir aggressive or violent impulses thanthose who are less exposed to these fac-tors (American Academy of Child andAdolescent Psychiatry 1999).YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 314Anger, aggression, rivalry, and competi- tion are not necessarily unhealthy emo-tions. As long as they are balanced withfeelings of warmth and empathy, angerand rivalry can have a positive effect, byenergizing children and providing themotivation to perform better than wasthought possible. They even help to definethe sense of self, differentiating childrenfrom their parents, siblings, and friends(Greenspan 1993). A growing number ofhealth promotion and violence preventionprograms have been devised for use in theschoolroom that teach children and ado-lescents nonviolent conflict resolutionskills. These strategies, despite their posi-tive intentions, may not be effective in thelong term, however, if they are taught onlyin hypothetical or role-playing situationswith the automatic assumption that thetechniques learned will be practiced out-side the context of real emotions. Theseprograms, when not successful, are also aclassic example of how information provi-sion and knowledge-gaining may not beenough to assure actual behavioral change.Early adolescents need to learn to identifytheir real-life feelings of anger and frus-tration, create an emotional idea of them,and then express these feelings in play or through words in non-hurtful ways,balanced with feelings of warmth andempathy. Intimacy and sexuality: A half century ago, H.S. Sullivan (Muss 1996) pro-posed that a need emerges in the normalpattern of social development that re-quires a shift in the object of intimacyduring this period. For the preadoles- cent, that object or \"best friend\" issomeone quite like oneself. Duringearly adolescence, the need for a \"bestfriend\" changes, leading teens to choosesomeone who, in very significant ways,is quite different from oneself. Thisneed spurs girls to show increased in-terest in boys and boys to turn to girlswith new curiosity. However, the movetoward opposite-sex intimacy initiallyinvolves a great deal of insecurity, fum-bling, and unrealistic wishful thinking.It is complicated not only by adolescentanxieties about rejection by the oppositesex, but also by preconceived andstereotypical views of the opposite sexacquired during earlier periods of de-velopment. Gilligan, as well as othercolleagues (Gilligan et al. 1992, Gilligan1982), states that the intimate friend-ship between girls in early adolescenceis a better preparation for love and het-erosexuality than too-early and oftenshallow involvement with boys, in whichthere is less communication and emo-tional sharing. The capacity for intimacy, which initially develops out of same-sex friendships,eventually is brought into cross-sex rela-tionships. Today, adolescent girls begindating around 12 or 13, and most boys be-tween ages 13 and 14. The transitionalperiod\u2014between same-sex nonsexual re-lationships and opposite-sex sexual ones\u2014oftentimes is a trying time for adolescents. This period usually begins with the peergroup's gradual shift from same-sexYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 315cliques and one-on-one boy-girl rela-tionships during later adolescent periods.The interpersonal strains and anxietiesinherent in the transition show up in thehigh levels of teasing, joking around, andovert discomfort young adolescents sooften display in situations that veer toward being romantic or sexual (Steinberg1999). For Sullivan (Muss 1996), earlyadolescence ends when interest and actual intimacy shift from a person of one's own sex to one of the opposite sex. During the next stage (middle adoles- cence), girls may be more adept than boysat displaying certain types of intimacy,such as self-disclosure and interpersonalunderstanding. Studies describing theneurobiological correlates of emotionalprocessing have found that during adoles-cence, males and females demonstratedifferent strategies in the processing of fa-cial affect (Killgore, Oki, and Yurgelun-Todd 2001). Girls' cross-sex relationships may provide a context for further expres- sion of intimacy, while for boys they may provide a context for the further develop- ment of intimacy. Brooks-Gunn and Paikoff (1993) describe four developmental challenges of adoles- cent sexuality: (1) accepting one's chang-ing body; (2) accepting one's feelings ofsexual arousal; (3) understanding that sex-ual activity is voluntary; and (4) practicingsafe sex with pleasure. Accepting one'schanging body is a challenge that startsduring preadolescence and continuesthrough early adolescence, when the next two challenges, accepting one's feelings ofsexual arousal and understanding that sex-ual activity is voluntary, become crucial. Bythe age of 15 (middle adolescence) manyteens are beginning to engage in someform of sexual experimentation, which may include petting, oral-genital contacts,mutual masturbation, and even inter-course (American Academy of Child andAdolescent Psychiatry 1999). Unfortunately, the reality in many soci- eties today threatens the ability of earlyadolescents to address sexuality-relateddevelopmental needs at their own pace be-cause of the prevalence of sexual coercion.Defined as physical or verbal pressure toengage in sexual activity, sexual coercion isa serious problem in many areas through-out the world. There is growing publicawareness that a large proportion ofteenagers are sexually harassed and that asignificant minority are forced to have sexagainst their will (Lee et al. 1996). Esti-mates that include all forms of nonvolun-tary sex suggest that about 25% of all fe-males and close to 10% of all males havebeen victimized sexually before reachingadulthood. Adolescents as victims of dat-ing violence reach similar rates in theUnited States (Foshee et al. 1998). C\u00e1ceres, Vanoss, and Sid Hudes (2000) determined the prevalence and correlatesof sexual coercion in adolescents and young adults in Lima, Peru. Over 40% ofyoung women reported that their first het-erosexual encounter occurred under pres-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 316sure, and lifetime experiences of coercion were even higher. In multiple logistic re-gression analyses, men and women whoreported having been coerced at hetero-sexual initiation also reported more sexu-ally transmitted diseases in their lifetimeand a lower age at first sex than those notreporting coercion. Age at first heterosex-ual encounter was not associated with sex-ual coercion for men, but for women, 62%of those who reported sexual initiation be- fore age 15 reported coercion, compared with 28% of those reporting sexual initia-tion after age 22. In this survey, 11% of themales reported coercion at heterosexualinitiation, and this group reported lowersocial economical status than those not co-erced. For an adolescent girl, \"a coerciveinitiation may disempower her, leavingher without the skills to resist pressurefrom partners or negotiate condom use. Inmany parts of the world, once a woman hashad her first sexual experience, her repu-tation may make it difficult for her to re-fuse future sexual advances from the sameor other partners. The term 'easy,' whichrefers to some men's sexual partners (butnot women's), suggests this shift in repu-tation\" (C\u00e1ceres, Vanoss, and Sid Hudes2000). Adolescents who have been sexually abused show higher-than-average rates ofpoor self-esteem, academic difficulties,anxiety, fear, and depression, and aremore likely to engage in risky behavior(Biglan et. al 1995) and to become preg-nant as teenagers. Kenney, Reinholtz, andAngelini (1997) examined the effect ofadolescent sexual abuse on teenage preg- nancy rates in the United States. In a sam-ple of 1,900 women, twice as many womenwho were coerced into sex or raped alsoexperienced a teenage pregnancy, com-pared with their non-abused peers. Unfortunately, sexual coercion and abuse are not the only causes that threaten theability of early adolescents to address thedevelopmental needs of sexuality at theirown pace. Early adolescents want more in-dependence, autonomy, and money.Those living in extreme poverty desper-ately need to earn money, whether to sup-port their families or because they live onthe streets and/or are orphaned. For thisreason, the exchange of money, favors, orgifts (clothing, food, electronic items) forsexual encounters is common in manycountries. In recent years, the Internet hasbecome a leading source for the advertise-ment of exchanges of this sort, with earlyadolescents\u2014both boys and girls\u2014being aprincipal target of adults seeking to initi-ate sexual activity, either through invita-tion and mutual consent or coercion andaggression. Social pressure that encourages boys to engage in sexual activity early to provetheir masculinity is also a frequent realityin many parts of the world. In Latin Amer-ica, for example, the average age of firstsexual intercourse is approximately 14-15for boys (Camacho-Hubner 2000). The mixed messages regarding sexual activitythat society imparts to early adolescentsmay be symbolized in the marked differ-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 317ences that are found between how the sexes feel after their first experience ofsexual intercourse. A study, which in-volved more than 1,000 U.S. teens, foundthat boys were more likely to describetheir first sexual partner in casual terms,and the majority said they were glad theyhad had sexual intercourse. Among thegirls surveyed, 75% said their partner wastheir boyfriend, 61% said they had con-flicted feelings after the experience, and11% said they were sorry it happened(American Academy of Child and Adoles-cent Psychiatry 1999). The media, throughnewspapers, magazines, musical videos,and movies, also profit from the naturalinterest of human beings in sexuality byprojecting a variety of messages that bothimplicitly and explicitly encourage theadoption of health-compromising behav-iors (Strasburger and Wilson 2002). The Needs of Early Adolescents Just as in the case of preadolescents, earlyadolescents have a series of needs to whichparents, teachers, and the community at largeshould respond in order to better ensure thehealthy transitioning of young people frompreadolescence into early adolescence andon into the next stage of middle adolescence.Any health promotion and prevention in-tervention aimed at early adolescentsshould incorporate a targeted response to theneeds specific to this age group in its design.Research shows the following needs are ofparticular importance: Love in an ongoing nurturing relation- ship: A warm relationship between earlyadolescents and parents is crucial for behavior and mood regulation duringthese years. A stable emotional climatein the family and a significant amount ofleisure time spent together will improvethe chances that adolescents will posi-tively interact with their parents andconsider their input regarding the adop-tion of healthy lifestyles. Nevertheless,since early adolescents need to differen-tiate themselves from their parents, inmany cases they will practice some formof rebellion in order to secure their new identity. Parents will need to discovernew ways to interact and communicatepositively with early adolescents, re-specting their growing need for more\"grown-up\" activities. The need for parental love remains constant through early adolescence, although it may ap-pear to \"go underground\" due to press-ing peer acceptance and identity issues.That is, at this age, the teen will still needand want love from his/her parents, butmay see as socially undesirable the dis-play or acceptance of that love in public.Still, teens need to know that they areloved. Greenspan (2002) notes that \"oneof the key challenges for parents at this time is to sneak in the dependency (orthe need for love) without embarrassingthe teenager. The key is to provide thedependency on the child's terms. It iscritical that dependency gets slipped inwith respect.\" Receiving this love as aconstant from their parents and familyprovides a solid emotional base andhelps teens feel good about themselvesand who they are. YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 318Self-esteem and acceptance: Adoles- cents most dramatically feel the need for acceptance during this period .They need this acceptance from peers, par-ents, and teachers, and\u2014most impor-tantly\u2014from themselves. It is thisstrong drive toward acceptance fromtheir peers, as well as the drive to estab-lish their own identity separate fromtheir parents, that often propels theadolescent toward \"desirable\" or \"un-desirable\" subgroups. Early adolescentswho are encouraged by their families toboth be connected to their parents andto express their own individuality willhave a greater ability to successfully ne-gotiate the intricacies of multiple rela-tionships within a group without losingtheir individuality. Developmentally appropriate experi- ences and success: While in many cases their need for acceptance may predom-inate, early adolescents also experiencethe need to succeed , although not as deeply or urgently as when they enterthe late adolescent stage. Contemporarytheories tend to stress the interactionbetween motives, beliefs, attributions,and goals as influencing adolescents'achievement orientation. Adolescentswho believe that ability is malleable(rather than fixed), who are motivatedby intrinsic (rather than extrinsic) re-wards, who are confident about theirabilities, and who attribute their suc-cesses and failures to effort (rather thanto ability or luck) achieve more inschool than their peers without thesequalities. Early adolescents need devel- opmentally appropriate experiencesand challenges that allow them to put inplace all their learned skills to success-fully solve new problems and make ap-propriate decisions. Sexuality: There is an increased sexual awareness, arousal, and interest duringearly adolescence that demands to bedealt with during the coming years.Peer, parental, and religious beliefs, at- titudes, and behaviors are some of thefactors that will play a role in how theearly adolescent will explore sexualityissues. Most schools today provide someform of sex education, but parents should not assume that all the questionstheir children have will be answered inthe classroom. Furthermore, as seen inChapter Twenty-three, teachers gener-ally are not well prepared to provideeffective sex education and often fail to fully implement sexual educationcurricula (Buston et al. 2002, Hallforsand Godette 2002). Students are alsoshy and embarrassed about address-ing these topics with teachers, and their comfort level does not increaseover time (Evans et al. 2002). Parentalwillingness and preparedness to dis-cuss sexuality with early adolescents are therefore crucial. This discussionshould include not only the risks ofHIV/AIDS and other STIs and preg-nancy prevention, but also the emo-tional aspects of physically intimate be-havior, how to deal with natural sexualarousal, the advantages and limits ofYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 319masturbation, the importance of re- specting that sexual activity is voluntary,how to react and respond in situationsof sexual coercion, and parents' per- sonal feelings and values regardingearly sex and casual sex. Identity: Adolescents' search for an identity involves the establishment of ameaningful self-concept in which past,present, and future are brought togetherto form a unified whole. During adoles-cence, young people will need to de-velop a commitment to a system of val-ues\u2014moral and religious beliefs, careerand relationship goals, a general philos-ophy of life\u2014and accept and understandtheir sexuality. Early adolescence fallsin the middle of this process, where ac-cepting one's own sexuality takes prior-ity, while at the same time the individualis constructing the beliefs and valuesthat will support his or her behaviorsand goals in life. Conforming to the ex-pectations of peers helps adolescentsdiscover how certain roles fit them, butpeer group conformity can also create anew kind of dependency, whereby theindividual accepts the beliefs and valuesof others too easily without addressing the identity issue of how well these fit inwith his or her own long-term goals.Eventually, adolescents must freethemselves from their dependency onpeers, which has just replaced their de-pendency on parents, in order to findtheir own selves. Healthy identity devel-opment is more likely to occur whenparents encourage early adolescents toexpress their own individuality and strengthen their fidelity to themselves while maintaining closeness and con-nectedness within the family. Closenessand connectedness are vital for givingadolescents the emotional space andfreedom to experiment, while at thesame time, parents need to define thelimits of acceptable behaviors and teachyoung people about accountability fortheir actions and decisions. Opportunities, guidance, limits, val- ues, and expectations: In order for early adolescents to learn how to makeresponsible decisions, they need op-portunities to make new decisions ontheir own with parental guidance,knowledge of their parents' values, clearexpectations, and firm limitations. Theystill need guidance on how to interactwith the opposite sex; how to be alter-nately empathetic, assertive, and/orsuspicious as needed; how to protectthemselves from temptations and dan-gers; and how to spend and save moneyaccording to their reality and that oftheir family. They need firm limits re-garding behaviors that are potentiallyharmful or infringe upon the rights ofparents, siblings, peers, and others. Inorder for limit-setting to be effective,parents need to maintain closeness,connectedness, and the capacity to havefun together. Having this basic emo-tional connection, parents need to makethe rules clear, teach responsibility,demonstrate a willingness to negotiatewhen appropriate, avoid negative criti-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 320cism of their children, and maintain self-control. Safe and supportive environments at home, school, and in the neighbor- hood: Early adolescents also need to have a sense of connectedness with theircommunity and its leaders, to have thenecessary supporting environments(e.g., home, school, church), publicspaces (e.g., playgrounds, parks, otherplaces they frequent alone and withfriends), and freedom to safely explorethe outside world with social regulationsthat protect them from potentiallyharmful behaviors. Safe and supportiveneighborhoods will provide secure so-cial networks that will contribute to theiropportunities for adopting and main-taining health-promoting behaviors. Structures to provide healthy nutri- tion, physical activity, and proper sleep: Early adolescents' lives continue to be driven by novelty and having funwhile hanging out with friends, whichtake priority over eating and sleeping.Interacting with their peers might notnecessarily include activities that in-volve physical exercise. This is espe-cially true in the case of girls, whose in-volvement in sports tends to be lessthan that of their male counterparts.Early adolescents find their lives full ofsocial activity, spend more time awayfrom home and unsupervised, andcome home later than during theirpreadolescent years. Since they go tobed later, they will tend to sleep induring the morning. Parents will need to allow some flexibility in leisure time and sleeping patterns, while at the same time providing sufficientstructure to help ensure that early ado-lescents balance the need for age-appropriate social experiences withadequate attention to nutritional, exer-cise, and sleep requirements. The series of early adolescent needs de- scribed in the preceding paragraphsshould be taken into account in the designof all health promotion and prevention programs targeted to this group. When-ever possible, parents should also be ac-tively involved in these interventions. Indetermining how best to respond to theneeds of early adolescents, the inter-personal level theories for behaviorchange presented in Chapters Sixteen toTwenty, and particularly the Authoritative Parenting Model (Chapter Eighteen), can provide practical insight into the neces-sary components to be included in theintervention. The Wants of Early Adolescence Early adolescents want to have fun, be ac-cepted and loved by others, and enjoy suc-cess in their endeavors. They want to moveaway from childhood activities and inter-ests of the past, and oftentimes will makethis change clear to everyone around themby choosing new interests and behaviors.Those interests will involve larger chal-lenges than in previous stages of their lifeas they explore novel and seemingly funthings to do with their friends. They mightYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 321try their first cigarette or first beer, sneak into the girls' or boys' showers at school,or play a prank with the group on a neigh-bor, teacher, or other authority figure.Early adolescents will demand more au-tonomy from their parents to make deci-sions regarding the clothes they wear, thefood they eat, the sports they play, the tel- evision programs they watch, and theleisure-time activities they participate inwith their friends. The type of sports, out-door activities, and peer group and mediaentertainment they choose will vary in dif-ferent cultures and countries. Keeping inmind that cultural differences still remain,despite an increasingly globalized mediaindustry, the main interests that attractearly adolescents' attention and motiva-tion at this age include: Novelty : Early adolescents are eager to use their growing independence to ex-plore new experiences on their own andwith their friends. New options that at-tract their attention will be those thathelp them to distance themselves fromchildhood activities; involve larger cog-nitive, motor, and/or social challenges;provide high sensations; and which canbe done with their friends. They are alsostill exploring new ways to be seen asunique by their peers and thereby in-crease their acceptance in the group. Social interaction : Early adolescents like to hang out with their friends atfast-food restaurants, at the shoppingmall, at the movies, or at get-togethersat peers' homes to watch rented videosor play video games. They spend less time with best friends and same-sexcliques, steadily moving on to biggergroups comprised of both sexes. Earlyadolescents increase the use of the tele-phone to stay in touch with theirfriends, relying on this form of commu-nication even more than during thepreadolescent years. \"Grown-up\" experiences : Early ado- lescents want to differentiate them-selves from preadolescents. They arepassing the barrier of the early teenyears and feel socially entitled to domany more \"grown-up\" things than be-fore. They also want to explore new ex- periences previously \"forbidden\" tothem, including out-of-limit behaviors.They want to go to places alone, usepublic transportation on their own, andmanage money independently. Earlyadolescence is also the stage at whichmany teens living in poor families insome Latin America and Caribbeancountries assume new responsibilitiestowards their families, contributingwith income obtained from formal typesof employment, even though some of the poorest work for minimal pay in theinformal sector in unhygienic and/orhazardous environments. Television shows and movies :Early adolescents are moving rapidly towardadult television programs. Especiallyattractive to the early adolescent are sit-uation comedies that provide humor, aswell as comedies and dramas that dealYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 322with adolescent and young adult issues. They now prefer television shows andmovies that have adolescent and youngadult stars and in which the charactersand situations are more complex over-all. Early adolescents are more capableof going beyond polarized, black-and- white thinking and are able to identifyand appreciate the gray areas in betweenthe two extremes. They are learning toprocess visual and auditory stimulifaster (Hale 1990) and more efficientlyand are demanding greater levels of in-formation to keep their attention. These newly acquired capabilities, combinedwith the fact that today's population ofearly adolescents has grown up exposedto highly compressed visual and audi-tory images and stimuli displays in themedia\u2014products of advances over thepast decade in electronic digitalizationtechnologies\u2014have conditioned this agegroup to expect high-paced stimulationfrom all its information and entertain-ment sources (Acuff 1997). Humor in the media :Early adolescents will increase their capacity to under-stand and appreciate more subtle formsof humor such as sarcasm, innuendo, and irony. They will lose interest inmedia programming that is too simpleand does not deliver sufficiently com-plex characters, content, and humor.Boys in particular tend to prefer humorthat is edgy and/or dark-sided, leans to-ward sexual and other taboos, and con-tains violent themes.Reading :Early adolescents prefer read- ing magazines and newspapers to books.They are rapidly acquiring more adulttastes and choices in reading materialand tend to prefer adult-marketeditems. Early adolescents read fewerbooks than preadolescents but whenthey do read, their tastes gravitate reality-based publications (e.g.,newspapers, sports and entertainmentmagazines). Newspaper readership in-creases substantially during the earlyadolescent years. Music: Music preferences reflect, per- haps more than any other medium, thesplintering of the early adolescent cul-ture into different subgroups, each withdistinct tastes. Early adolescents con-nect to messages in their favorite music,not just to the song's rhythm or melody. Video and computer games :Males continue to enjoy electronic games dur-ing early adolescence, but the amount oftime spent at individual play decreases.They tend to prefer multiplayer games,or at least two-player games (i.e., carracing), in which they may competeagainst each other. There is also a shiftin the types of games preferred, with agrowing preference for sports-related,reality-based games and challengingrole-playing games. The electronic in-dustry has also profited from early ado-lescent males' interest in sex, by incor-porating subtle sexual innuendos insome of their products. Teen-rated (T)YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 323games tend to include more violence and stronger language. Sports: Boys, more than girls, continue to participate in organized sports (e.g.,football, soccer, basketball, baseball). Independent or alternative sports thatare chosen by early adolescents includerollerblading and skateboarding. The Health-Promoting Developmental Goals of Early Adolescence The ability of early adolescents to master the developmental goals presented in thissection is directly related to the degree ofsuccess this group achieved as preadoles-cents in mastering the corresponding set ofdevelopment goals for that stage, as de-scribed in Chapter Twenty-eight. As in thecase of preadolescents, the goals for earlyadolescents are divided into five cate-gories: (1) biological changes and develop-mental goals; (2) cognitive changes and de-velopmental goals; (4)lifestyle-specific developmental goals; and(5) gender-specific developmental goals. After identifying the target group of the intervention, health promotion develop-ers should first determine to what extentits early adolescent members have not yetmastered the developmental goals ofpreadolescence and establish this objec-tive as the program's initial priority. Theprogram should then segue into mastery ofthe early adolescent goals, incorporatingage-appropriate interventions that appealto early adolescent needs and wants and actively engage the target group in master-ing the following goals: Biological changes and developmental goals: to accept positively and learn to manage new bodily changes (e.g., menstruation,ejaculation, voice changes) to learn how to regulate new eating andsleeping patterns in healthy ways to master healthy coping mechanismsfor dealing with the increased anxiety levels characteristic of the early adoles-cence years to have learned how to satisfy increasingsensation-seeking needs in healthy andsafe ways to continue to be able to identify at leastone supportive adult with whom theyfeel comfortable sharing curiosity andquestions about menstruation, ejacula-tion, wet dreams, and other new physi-cal capabilities Cognitive changes and developmental goals: to develop a preparatory stage of partial formal operations capacity (i.e., Piaget, stage III A), whereby the early adoles-cent is able to make correct conclusionsand handle certain formal operations,even if not yet able to provide systematicand rigorous proof for his/her assertions to be able to adopt a third-person or mu- tual perspective (i.e., the capacity to ab- stractly step outside an interpersonalinteraction and simultaneously andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 324mutually coordinate and consider the perspectives of self and others) (Selman1977) to have developed the ability to accuratelyread nonverbal and verbal cues that willhelp them to determine whom to trust andwhom not to trust (e.g., among peers, olderschoolmates, neighbors) to be able to give reasons for trusting ornot trusting a particular person to recognize frequent temptations atthis age and be able to understand theconsequences of new actions in whichthey might be involved (e.g., flirting,having early sex, becoming pregnant,having unprotected sex, becoming in-fected with HIV/STIs) to develop increasing autonomy in or-ganizing their daily schedule to respon-sibly fit in and balance their home,school, and work obligations (e.g.,homework and special projects, house-hold chores, sports practices, extracur-ricular activities, part-time job) andleisure time (hanging out with friends,enjoying hobbies) Socio-emotional changes and developmental goals: to gradually shift interest from a person of one's own sex and same interests to one of the opposite sex and/or who isdifferent from oneself (Sullivan 1953) to be able to identify and create a mentalimage of angry feelings and then ex-press these angry feelings in play orthrough words in non-hurtful ways,balanced with feelings of warmth andempathy (Greenspan 1993)to continue to be able to identify at leastone supportive adult with whom onemay share intense feelings (e.g., excite-ment, anger, sadness, apprehension,jealousy) to be able to identify enjoyable activities,in keeping with new interests they have ac-quired during this stage, that they wouldlike to share with their parents to establish a sense of personal identityin which the early adolescent is increas-ingly able to assess strengths and weak-nesses and determine best how to dealwith them (Erikson 1968) to achieve a greater behavioral autonomy (independent decision-making abili-ties), shown by going out with friendswithout parental supervision and bymaking safe and healthy choices in theirabsence to develop an \"ego ideal\" on which tomodel and evaluate oneself and be ableto picture oneself in the future. The \"egoideal\" permits early adolescents to en-vision themselves over time instead ofsimply living in the present\u2014in whichthey react to daily events, respond to theneeds of the moment (e.g., pleasure, af-filiation, acceptance), and feel increas-ingly vulnerable to peer pressure(Greenspan 1993). Lifestyle-specific developmental goals: Safer sex practices: to learn to regulate and control feelings of sexual arousal (Brooks-Gunn and Paikoff1993) by respecting and not forcing oth-ers into unwanted sexual experiences YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE | 325to be able to distinguish between feel- ings of sexual attraction, love, andintimacy to continue to be able to identify

developmental goals: Girls and boys need help in masteringgender-specific developmental goals duringearly adolescence, which will help protectthem from the social pressures of blindly ac-cepting traditional and pervasive stereotypesof femininity and masculinity. This is a pe- riod when girls and boys are increasinglyspending more time together. Sexualarousal, awareness, and exploration rise sig-nificantly in a period when adolescents arealso most vulnerable to peer pressure. Thedevelopmental goals described belowevolve naturally from the preadolescentgender-specific developmental goals de-scribed in the corresponding section ofChapter Twenty-eight. It is recommendedthat program designers determine thelevel of mastery by early adolescents of thepreadolescence goals, and, if necessary, in-clude these in their programs targetingearly adolescents. By the end of this period,boys and girls should have mastered the fol-lowing developmental tasks: Girls: to strengthen their ability to identify not only their present needs and wants butalso their future, long-term goals, sothat they may envision themselves over time instead of simply responding to theneeds and wants of the moment (e.g.,pleasure, affiliation, acceptance) to practice the previously developedability to be assertive in expressing theirneeds and wants to practice their developing capacity fordealing with anxiety through a high ap-proach coping style for daily challengesand stresses, and avoidance copingabilities when confronted with uncon-trollable or overwhelming stressors.(For more information on these styles,see Chapter Twenty of this book.) to continue to identify at least one sup-portive female adult with whom theymay critically analyze socially expectedgender roles and behaviors and discussissues related to safe sex practices to have developed a heightened aware-ness regarding the inherent dangers ofaccepting traditional versions of femi-ninity, which implicitly or explicitly en-courage women to remain silent victimsof verbal, emotional, and/or physical vi- olence; sexual ignorance; and passivity;and, in some areas of the world, extendto the trafficking of young females for purposes of pornography, prostitu- tion, sexual tourism, and other relatedcriminal activities between and withincountries Boys: to understand and respect that sexual activity is voluntary to strengthen their ability to self-regulate and control sexual arousalYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION THREE | 328to practice the ability, developed during preadolescence, to listen to girls' needsand wants to strengthen self-disclosure and inter-personal understanding abilities to continue to identify at least one sup-portive male adult with whom they maycritically analyze socially expected gen-der roles and behaviors and discuss is-sues related to safe sex practices to have developed a heightened aware-ness regarding the inherent dangers ofaccepting traditional versions of mas-culinity, which implicitly or explicitly encourage early intercourse; sexualcoercion; tobacco, alcohol, and drug ex-perimentation; and displays of aggres-sive physical behavior, including vio-lence, as a confirmation of manhood to practice their developing ability forimpulse control and regulation of be-haviors involving sensation-seeking,sexual and alcohol exploration, angerexpression, conflict resolution, anxiety-coping, food cravings, and offers to trytobacco and drugs Box 29-1.

By providing evidence-based examples of what works and what appears to haveworked less well (or not at all), Youth: Choices and Change aims to provide cost-effective tools to those who are called upon to guide adolescent health policy and program devel-opment in order to ensure that finite economic resources yield the highest possible re-turn on the investment made. The theories and models presented in Section Two of this book have been utilized for sev- eral decades by social science researchers to study behavior change. However, their spe-cific application to adolescent behaviors has received less attention than that accorded toother older age groups (e.g., the adult population). At the same time, as gleaned from thereference list accompanying this book, the findings of these theories-based applicationsto adolescents have, until now, been reported only in a rather disparate and fragmentedfashion in journal articles, textbooks, and other forms of scientific literature. In thissense, Youth: Choices and Change represents a significant milestone: it presents a compi- lation of the current knowledge base on adolescent behavior change theories and practiceand a systemized approach to the effective use of this comprehensive body of lessonslearned and best practices. By incorporating this information in the choice of theoreticalconcepts and the construction of theoretical frameworks, developers of health promotionand prevention interventions will be able to achieve greater programmatic successstrengthened by a more meaningful evaluation process. As this book has shown, behavior change and health promotion theories and models need additionally to be applied within the appropriate context of adolescent development.Section Three presents a detailed discussion of the progression of adolescent develop-mental stages and their accompanying physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional changes,focusing in particular on the changing needs and wants characterizing the preadolescent and early adolescent years, gender differences as seen from a developmental perspective,and how the achievement of developmental goals contributes to the adolescent's ability toadopt protective, health-promoting behaviors. Much of the information regarding criti-cal developmental distinctions between the preadolescent and early adolescent stageshas been observed and shared informally by clinicians through years of working withthese age groups, yet this book marks the first attempt to capture and compare these dis-tinctions in a published source. This type of analysis allows those who work with adoles-cents to correctly identify and appropriately address differences in behavioral and socio-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |INTRODUCTION | 335emotional capabilities between 12-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds, and 18-year- olds, for example, and be able to confidently and conscientiously design programs andinterventions that effectively respond to the needs and wants of each specific targetgroup. One of this book's central lessons is that the foundation for successfully instilling life- long healthy behaviors among adolescents is early intervention, beginning in the pread-olescence period, before health-compromising behaviors have become deeply rooted. Acontinuous approach, targeting key areas (e.g., physical activity and nutrition, sexual andreproductive health, and prevention of violence and of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use),should ideally begin during the early childhood years, mediated by the influence of pos-itive role models whose presence remains palpable during the middle childhood periodand particularly vigilant throughout adolescence and youth. This type of approach allowsyoung people to practice skills learned during each successive development phase withgreater feelings of self-efficacy and supportiveness, while at the same time increasingbehavioral independence to positively confront peer, social, and media pressures. Pipher (1994) has characterized adolescence as a critical period of marked internal de- velopment and massive cultural indoctrination. It is for this reason that PAHO sostrongly urges early intervention, in contrast to the more prevalent current practice offocusing health promotion interventions on the 15- to 19-year-old age group. By follow- ing the suggested steps in this book, adolescent health program developers can provide acontinuum of comprehensive support for young people through the provision of inter-ventions at the individual, interpersonal, community, and policy levels and guidance inthe mastery of developmental goals appropriate for each age group. Once young peoplelearn how to protect and nurture their bodies and minds, and are sufficiently motivatedto make conscious and independent decisions for healthy lifestyles and behaviors, theycan confidently proceed toward their self-set goals for the future. Chapter Thirty explores the current socioeconomic challenges and advantages facing youth in Latin America and the Caribbean, the principal focus of PAHO's technical coop-eration efforts. This book's final chapter also presents a review of international commit-ments undertaken by the member countries of the United Nations designed tostrengthen the health and development of young people in the Region of the Americas. Itconcludes with a series of recommendations for improving health and development op-portunities for this group over the next decade.The health of adolescents (10-19 years old) and youth (15-24 years old) is a key el- ement for the social, economic, and political progress of all the countries andterritories in the Americas. The future of the Region depends in great part on the participation of a healthy, educated, and economically productive population. Far toooften, however, a consideration of adolescent needs and rights is absent from public policies and from the health sector agenda, except when adolescents behave in troublingways. One contributing factor is that, compared to very young children and the elderly,adolescents suffer from few life-threatening conditions. Furthermore, most of the un-healthy habits learned during adolescence do not produce morbidity or mortality duringthe period of adolescence itself (Pan American Health Organization 1998). Nonetheless, costs to governments and individuals are substantial when youth fail to ob- serve healthy lifestyles prior to reaching adulthood. Cost analysis from the United Statesfound that the country spends roughly $20 billion annually in payments for income maintenance, health care, and nutrition to support families created as a result of adoles-cent pregnancies (Schutt-Aine and Maddaleno 2003, Burt 1998). The World Bank (2002)estimates that a 1% reduction in juvenile crime would increase income from tourism by4% in Jamaica and 2.3% in Barbados. Furthermore, it is estimated that the indirect costsof deaths from AIDS contracted during adolescence constitute 0.01% of the gross do- mestic product of Antigua and Barbuda and of Suriname, and 0.17% in the Bahamas alonein year 2000 (Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud 2003b). [Chapter Thirty ] The Next Decade: Perspectives for Improving Adolescent Health andDevelopmentYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION FOUR | 338Thus, adolescence is a crucial stage in the life cycle and has a decisive impact on thehealth of present and future populations.The process of growth and development iscumulative as well as intergenerational:the successes or losses in each stage of lifeaffect the future health of people and havean impact on the health of the next gener-ation. It is during this stage of adoles-cence that human capital is developed;new understandings are acquired as wellas new abilities and essential competen-cies to function in society. Adolescentsprogressively develop a coherent self-identity by internalizing values and atti-tudes and establishing commitments withthe community. Adolescence is also a timewhen adolescents and those who supportthem should be attentive to the develop-ment of sexuality and the accompanyingreproductive capacities. It is important,therefore, that adolescents learn how toidentify and adopt health-promoting be-haviors and consciously choose to avoidhealth-compromising behaviors, sincethe majority of harmful health habits areacquired during this stage of life (Organi- zaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud 2003b). Various countries in the Region of the Americas are faced with an opportunity foreconomic growth, known as the \"demo-graphic gift,\" thanks to the composition oftheir populations (Schutt-Aine and Mad-daleno 2003, Bloom 2001). A cohort ofyoung people ages 15 to 24 is entering thelabor force in these countries without thepressure of a large cohort of children tofollow it, nor an older population to main-tain fiscally. However, in order to take ad- vantage of this opportunity, young peoplewill need to be healthy, acquire a good ed-ucation, and have access to employment,as was the experience of Asian countriesduring the 1990s. With adequate supportand appropriate investments by govern-ments, this economically active youngpopulation will be able to become themotor for economic growth and an agentfor positive social change in the Region (Schutt-Aine and Maddaleno 2003, Bloom et al. 1999, Jacinto et al. 1998).Developing effective interventions andprograms to spur positive growth anddevelopment among the 15- to 24-year-old segment of the population, now andover the coming years, will therefore becrucial. Given the importance of investing in ado- lescent and youth health and developmentin the Region, the member countries of theUnited Nations have signed a series of in-ternational agreements that have priori-tized this topic to facilitate the allocationof resources and the elaboration of plans and programs for improving health anddevelopment opportunities for young peo-ple around the world. These include thefollowing targets: United Nations General Assembly Spe- cial Session on HIV/AIDS (June 2001) by the year 2005, reduce the preva-lence of HIV infection in young menand women aged 15 to 24 by 25% United Nations General Assembly Spe-cial Session on Children (May 2002)YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTY | 339by the year 2010, develop and imple- ment national policies and programsfor adolescent health United Nations Millennium Summit/ U.N. Millennium Declaration/U.N.Millennium Development Goals (Sep-tember 2000) by the year 2015, reduce maternalmortality rate by 75% by the year 2015, halt and begin to re-verse the spread of HIV/AIDS In addition to committing themselves to reducing the prevalence of HIV infectionsin young people by 25%, the countrieshave agreed to ensure that at least 90% ofyoung men and women between the ages of15 and 24 have access to the necessary in-formation, education\u2014including peer ed- ucation and youth-specific HIV educa-tion\u2014and services to develop the life skillsrequired to reduce their vulnerability toHIV infection; this process is be carriedout in full partnership with youth, parents,families, educators, and health careproviders (Joint United Nations Pro-gramme on HIV/AIDS/World HealthOrganization/Pan American Health Orga-nization 2001). The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which focus on society's poorestsegments and whose overarching goal is anextreme reduction of poverty, wereadopted by 189 U.N. member nations andconsist of an indivisible package of meas-urable goals and targets to be achieved by2015. Four of the eight MDGs include in-dicators and targets for the 15-to-24-year-old age group, calling for universal education and a literate population, thepromotion of gender equality and empow-erment of women, and improvingHIV/AIDS prevention strategies and so-cioeconomic opportunities for youth at thebeginning of their economically produc-tive years. MDG-1, the reduction of maternal mortal- ity by 75%, is particularly relevant to theglobal situation of young people, since thematernal mortality rate increases as theage of the pregnant woman decreases.Similarly, MDG-6, regarding the halt ofthe HIV/AIDS epidemic, will be achievedonly through the development of more ef-fective prevention strategies, since 50% ofall new HIV infections occur between theages of 15 and 24 (Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS 1998). Eachyear, an estimated 2 million young peoplecontinue to become infected with HIV,with women comprising two-thirds of thisnumber. Young people form a large per-centage of groups particularly vulnerableto infection, such as intravenous drugusers and sexual workers. Likewise, youngpeople represent a significant proportionof the parents of the estimated 2,000 chil- dren who become infected every day withHIV through vertical transmission. Fi-nally, a large percentage of AIDS orphansare adolescents themselves (World HealthOrganization 2004a). In addition to health, the MDGs include numerous references to the right of allchildren to have access to education andYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION FOUR | 340the need for regular school attendance. These, in turn, provide the basic founda-tion for opportunities later on for suitableemployment and the ability of young peo-ple to economically support themselvesand the families they create. Although theeducational status of young people in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean has improvedsignificantly over the last decades, therecontinue to be geographical and socioeco-nomic inequalities. It is estimated that50% of 20-year-olds living in urban areasand 75% of those living in rural areas dropout of school before completing their sec-ondary education (Pan American HealthOrganization 2002b). The educationallevel of women has a great deal of influ-ence on the number of children they have.Women with 10 or more years of education are four times less likely to initiate sexualactivity before the age of 20 than womenwith fewer years of education (Schutt-Aineand Maddaleno 2003). Adolescent malesages 15 to 24 represent between 44% and71% of the economically active population.However, economic conditions for youngpeople are not optimal. It is estimated that10 million children under the age of 14work illegally, without social security ben-efits, receiving very low salaries, and fre-quently working under dangerous condi-tions. The official rate of unemploymentfor young people in Latin America is 16% and varies from approximately 35% inColombia to 6% in Mexico. The most vul-nerable groups are those young peoplewho neither study nor work (World Bank2002). It is estimated that between 12%and 40% of the poor families in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean have adoles- cent children who do not study or work(Pan American Health Organization2002b). In several countries, up to 25% ofyoung people grow up in homes headed bysingle mothers and frequently character-ized as poor. PAHO is working on a number of fronts in support of MDG-2, the achievement ofuniversal education, and MDG-3, regard-ing gender equality and the empowermentof women, in the belief that education is particularly important for young girls: itwill help them to learn how to make betterdecisions regarding their health, theirbody, and the number and spacing of thechildren they have later on. At the sametime, it will better protect them againstpartner abuse, improve opportunities foremployment and remuneration equal withthat of men, and increase their participa-tion in decision-making roles at the com-munity, national, and international levels. \"The health and development of adoles- cents and youth, and their active inclusionin daily life, are key elements for the so-cial, economic, and political progress ofthe countries of the Americas,\" notedPAHO Director Dr. Mirta Roses at the XII Conference of First Ladies, Spouses, andRepresentatives of Heads of State andGovernment of the Americas, held inSanto Domingo, the Dominican Republic,in October 2003. At this meeting, whosefocus was \"Youth and Poverty,\" Roses also stated that special attention should be ac-corded to youth in special and/or precari-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTY | 341ous situations, such as the handicapped, the homeless, those who are wards of theState, and those who participate in gangviolence and/or are involved in prostitu-tion. \"We must strengthen self-esteemand identity through harmonious and pos-itive peer relations,\" she said, as she em-phasized the importance of \"buildingnetworks; creating spaces that facilitateand encourage creativity, originality, mul-ticultural contribu-tions, 2003b). Partnerships for Progress: Sharing What Works Within the spirit of MDG-8, which calls for the creation of a global partnership for de-velopment, one of PAHO's objectives inpublishing this book is to share best prac-tices and lessons learned and to stimulatecross-country dialogues on how the publichealth sector, including community healthpromoters and practitioners, can designeffective, well-targeted interventions,services, and programs to support the pos-itive development of young people. As wehave seen throughout this book, however,the health sector cannot work in isolation;actions must occur in much broader part-nerships with the educational, economic,and political segments of society, as well.At the same time, as PAHO's Directornoted at the Santo Domingo summit, themost effective interventions for improvinghealth, education, and socioeconomic op-portunities are those that \"recognize theneed to ensure full youth participation in defining policies, programs, and activitiesthat affect and involve them\" (Organi-zaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud 2003b). An excellent example of how this combi- nation of strategies can bear positive fruitis happening in Canada, where Aboriginalpeoples are one of the fastest growing seg-ments of the population and more thanhalf of this group is under the age of 24(Pan American Health Organization2002c). Although health and developmentindicators for Aboriginal people still re-veal considerable gaps and inadequacies,as compared to the Canadian population asa whole, recognition is growing amongleaders and decision-makers at all levelsthat creating socioeconomic opportuni-ties for youth\u2014particularly those whocome from disadvantaged circumstances\u2014contributes to the reduction of poverty andthe creation of sustainable development,the essence of MDG-1 and MDG-8. \"Our youth are a large and dynamic popu- lation,\" First Nations National Chief PhilFontaine told an Assembly of First Nations citizens in 2003. \"They will be driving theeconomic and political life of this countryin the coming years. We must harness thatenergy and provide education, employ-ment, and hope. This makes for strongerFirst Nations and a stronger country foreveryone\" (Canada NewsWire 2003). In recognition of the sizeable First Nations population under 24 years of age, in 2002the Assembly established a National YouthYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION FOUR | 342Council. When the Canadian Govern- ment's Standing Senate Committee onAboriginal Peoples recently prepared a re-port on the health and educational statusof First Nations youth living in urban cen- ters, National Youth Council representa-tives from across the country providedinput. Ginger Gosnell, Council represen-tative from the province of British Colum-bia, told the 2003 Assembly: \"Experienceshows that the key factor for success in anyinitiative aimed at First Nations youth isthat we be involved from the very begin-ning in the design, development, and de-livery of these initiatives.\" Gosnell furtherindicated that the Council's coordinatedand proactive response resulted in con-crete improvements in the documentwhen she observed that \"the Senate reportclearly benefited from the recommenda-tions of First Nations youth, and we have toremain involved to make sure the follow-through is successful as well\" (CanadaNewsWire 2003). The Canadian experience just described encompasses many of the values of thecommunity organization models pre-sented in Chapter Twenty-two of thisbook. By involving the target group in thedevelopment of interventions affectingtheir future and spurring the participationof First Nations youth across the country, the process of true community participa-tion and positive change begins. Theyoung members of this coalition gain em-powerment, a critical consciousness of theroot causes of their problems, collectiveself-efficacy, and the ability to select is- sues for political attention of most impor-tance to them; in this case, health and ed-ucation. The future of this group, to thedegree that its individual members con-tinue to believe in and practice the princi-ples they are lobbying for today, holdsgreat potential. They are coming to masterthe life skills that will transform them intoagents for their own positive change. Recommended Actions to Improve the Health of the Adolescent andYouth Population over the Next Decade Adolescent health programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, as in manyother parts of the world, have traditionallybeen geared toward specific negative be-haviors and feature a problem-orientedapproach that focuses on single issues,such as early maternity, drug abuse, or ju-venile crime, in isolation. Such approachesfocus on the individual and do not take into account other possibly related unhealthybehaviors or the broad social contextwithin which the problem first arose. Norare other actors in the adolescent's socialenvironment (e.g., parents, siblings, otherrelatives, teachers, peers) normally calledupon to provide input into the design or toparticipate in the intervention's execution.Furthermore, the interventions are usuallycurative in nature, and specific to theproblem at hand, with relatively limitedemphasis on positive health promotionand prevention principles. Such interven-tions are generally not coordinated (e.g.,YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTY | 343between health services, schools, and the family), causing costly duplication of ef-forts, even though numerous studies\u2014 a variety of them cited in this book\u2014haveshown that many adolescent behavioralproblems have common origins and areinterrelated. Finally, the needs, concerns,and rights of the adolescents themselvesare often overlooked, as are gender- andculture-related considerations and thechanging developmental needs of youngpeople at different ages. On the basis of these facts, PAHO proposes a new conceptual framework, in which ap-proaches are based on prevention andhealth promotion, instead of the reductionof problems and their impact. This new health paradigm would focus on positivehuman development at the individual,family, and community levels, and en-courage full participation by young peoplein the social, political, and economic lifeof their communities. Community health services can play a pivotal role in this em-powerment process: by actively respond-ing to the needs of adolescents and youthand forming effective linkages with otherappropriate public and private local insti-tutions, they can provide valuable supportfor the adoption of healthy behaviors and lifestyles, thereby preparing young peopleto become healthy, educated, and eco-nomically productive adults. In summary, the new health paradigm should focus on the following compo-nents, with a view toward improving thehealth and development of young people over the next decade: disease prevention and health pro-motion principles early and integrated interventions strengthening of the individual-family-community series of relationships promotion of the political and socialparticipation of young people in ad-dressing their health and developmentneeds The following actions are crucial for creat- ing a new paradigm of health and develop-ment for young people in the Americas andworldwide: (1) Improve the environment where young people live through the formu- lation of broad-based, comprehensivepolicies addressing the determinantsof good health and positive well-being for this group. At the national and community level, political leaders anddecision-makers should preserve,support, strengthen, and empowerfamilies and communities by design-ing policies and laws that improve eco-nomic status, strengthen communityservices and resources, decrease expo-sure to violence and other unhealthybehaviors and conditions, foster posi-tive social standards, and, above all,demonstrate a sustained commitmentto health promotion. The mass mediashould be incorporated as a full part-ner in the promotion of positive, so-YOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION FOUR | 344cially responsible health promotion messages targeted to the adolescentand youth consumer markets. (2) Collect data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the health situation of adolescents as a basis for policy forma-tion and program development, bothlocally and nationally. (3) Improve access to health services . Countries that are reforming theirhealth sector should ensure the equi-table access of all adolescents to a basicpackage of comprehensive health ser-vices that includes a component ofhealth promotion and disease preven-tion. Furthermore, these servicesshould ensure the legal right to confi-dentiality and to private care, based onindividualized needs, that includes thetarget group's participation in the de-sign and delivery of these services. (4) Improve access to education and strengthen the role of schools in ado-lescent health promotion . Given that adolescents spend a majority of theirtime in the classroom and in school-related activities, the educational sys-tem can play a central role in helping toshape the attitudes of young people to-ward life and the future they envisionfor themselves. As we saw in Chapter Nineteen of this book, schools, alongwith parents and the family, can pro-vide a key social environment whereadolescents receive support and em-powerment and learn boundaries andexpectations and how to use their time constructively (external assets), at thesame time that they develop a commit-ment to learning, positive values, so-cial competencies, and a positive iden-tity (internal assets). As earlier stated,it is the right of all children to have ac-cess to education, and there is a needfor regular school attendance. Schools and the educational system can play ameaningful role in fostering the devel-opment of positive behaviors amongchildren and adolescents by providingthem with opportunities to learn whatadults and society in general expectfrom them as they grow up and to prac-tice adult roles in a positive learningenvironment. In this sense, schoolsprovide a vital gateway not only to theadoption of strengths-based, protec-tive behaviors but also to the achieve-ment of the necessary academic, voca-tional, social, and emotional skills to become economically productiveadults in an increasingly competitiveworld. (5) Design effective, evidence-based, developmentally and culturally ap-propriate interventions for adoles-cents of different ages and genders.As has been noted and discussedthroughout this book, adolescenthealth interventions and programs willbe more effective if they are tailored tothe different developmental stages(beginning with early interventionduring preadolescence and early ado-lescence), instead of being targeted toYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |CHAPTER THIRTY | 345the entire adolescent age spectrum as a homogeneous group. Developmentallydifferentiated interventions and pro-grams further require a gender per-spective which takes into account thedistinct wants and needs of girls andboys and the different rates at whicheach progress from one developmentalstage to the next. Program designersalso must be aware that adolescentneeds and wants will vary in differentgeographical contexts and cultures,and that interventions succeed to thedegree that they are locally based andresponsive to their actual (versus theo-retical) target group. Finally, effectiveinterventions and programs will facili-tate the learning and mastery of a se-ries of developmental goals and growthcompetencies, described in ChaptersTwenty-eight and Twenty-nine, that in turn strengthen the adolescent'sability to adopt protective, health-promoting behaviors. (6) Create intersectoral partnerships at the grass roots, regional, and nationallevels, ensuring an appropriate andequitable distribution of roles andfunctions, for a well-coordinated, in-tegrated response to adolescent healthand development issues. The commu-nity organization models described inChapter Twenty-two may be adaptedfor use at all levels of society and en- able alliance members to collectivelyidentify needs, problems, and goals;mobilize resources; and develop andimplement strategies for reachingtheir mutually agreed-upon objec- tives. All of these stages should includethe input and participation of adoles-cents and youth, in interaction with allalliances, coalitions, and networkswhose members represent interestswith a direct influence on the lives ofyoung people, such as health, educa-tion, legislative, juridical, judicial, re-ligious, community safety, the massmedia, and others. (7) Develop an evidence base on the ef- fects of globalization and new infor-mation technologies on youth andadolescent health and incorporate ef- fective responses to this issue in be-havioral change interventions andprograms. Today's generation of youngpeople are the very first to experiencethe full impact of the numerous com-munication tools made possible by theInternet and globalized mass mediacapabilities. At the same time thatthese advances have made the worldappear smaller and within reach ofeveryone, they have also created a\"digital divide\" between the world'swealthiest and poorest countries, re-sulting in new inequities for those in-dividuals whose socioeconomic statusprevents them from enjoying the ben-efits of these technologies. Also, as noted in this book, youth are the pri- mary market targeted by producers ofemerging electronic and digital entertain-ment products, whether computer games,musical videos, or \"reality television.\" TheYOUTH: CHOICES AND CHANGE |SECTION FOUR | 346products' appeal to this age market results from their effectiveness in providing a satisfying response to youths' need forsensation-seeking and their ability to keepapace even as market tastes and expectationschange. Oftentimes, however, the resultingmessages promote and glamorize risk-taking behaviors, either implicitly or ex-plicitly, thereby luring youth to move beyondboundaries that are safe and healthy. Clearly, more research is needed to deter- mine the ultimate extent to which the newglobal communication technologies influ-ence youth's ability to make healthychoices and how the negative effects onadolescent health of these trends may be counteracted and even reversed withfront-line, timely responses by healthpromotion advocates and public healthpolicymakers. The building of an evidencebase on how the information and enter-tainment needs of the youth market maybe satisfied in healthier, more socially re-sponsible ways will enable caring commu-nities to secure better and more protectiveopportunities for self-empowerment oftheir young people and motivate them toconfidently and consciously make per-sonal choices that strengthen their physi-cal, emotional, and socioeconomic well-being today and throughout adulthood. Afterword Throughout history, the world's greatest thinkers have mused on the mystique and powers of youth. \"We have two lives,\" U.S. author Bernard Malamud once said.\"The one we learn with, and the life we live after that.\" Clearly, adolescence is a period of learning, of trying out new experiences in life for size, fit, comfort, appeal. \"The fortune of our lives . . . depends on employing well the short period of our youth,\" Thomas Jefferson wrote in a 1787 letter to his daughter, suggesting that the adolescent years pro-vide a brief window of opportunity for self-examination and the development of sufficientself-determination to carry us through to the eventual completion of our goals and dreams. Ralph Waldo Emerson waxed philosophic when he wrote in 1870: \"The youth suffers not only from ungratified desires, but from powers untried. . . . He is tormented with thewant of correspondence between things and thoughts.\" Emerson's contemporary, Britishpoet Mary Elizabeth Coleridge, wrote, on a lighter note: \"We were young, we were merry,we were very, very wise; and the door stood open to our feast.\" The juxtaposition of thesetwo very different views highlights the alternating feelings of turmoil and triumph everyadolescent experiences. The depth of each emotion will remain etched in memory for-ever. That they stand at opposite poles as markers of human self-confidence testifies tothe gamut and complexity of human emotions that characterize this time in life. \"To become aware in time when young of the advantages of age; to maintain the advan- tages of youth in old age: both are pure fortune,\" German poet and dramatist JohannWolfgang Von Goethe wrote some two centuries ago. His message attests to the \"useful- ness\" of that challenging period lying midway between childhood and adulthood. He andhis other colleagues above, in essence, are saying that adolescence is a period to savor andenjoy, and at the same time till and cultivate sufficiently to provide fruit for life. It is our job\u2014as parents, teachers, faith leaders, health promoters, clinicians, policy- makers, and politicians\u2014to help and encourage youth to strike this critical balance dur-ing life's most self-defining juncture.
