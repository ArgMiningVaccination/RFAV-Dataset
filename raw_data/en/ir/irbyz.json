Cross- Setting Measures Development Work: An Introduction The Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act), enacted October 6, 2014, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"specify quality measures on which post-acute c are (PAC) providers are required under the applicable reporting provisions to submit standardized patient assessment data\" in several quality measure domains, including incidence of major falls, skin integrity and changes in skin integrity, medication reconciliation, function al status, transfer of health information and care preferences when an individual transitions , and resource use and other measures. The IMPACT Act requires the implementation of quality measures to address these measure domains in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), s killed n ursing facilities (SNFs), l ong-term care hospitals (LTCHs), and h ome health agencies (HHAs). The IMPACT Act also requires, to the extent possible, the submission of such quality measure data through the use of a PAC assessment instrument and the modification of the instrument as necessary to enable such use. This requirement refers to the collection of such data by means of the IRF Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF -PAI) for IRFs, the LTCH Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation Data Set (LTCH CARE Data Set or LCDS) for LTCHs, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 for SNFs, and the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS ) for HHAs. For more information on the statutory history of the IRF, LTCH, or SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), please refer to the Fiscal Year ( FY) 2016 final rules, and for the HH QRP, please refer to the Calendar Year (CY) 2016 final rule. More information on the IMPACT Act is available at https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4994 . In this document, we present specifications for the standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) and two measures finalized for adoption for the LTCH QRP through the FY 2020 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)/ LTCH PPS final rule. The Transfer of Health Information measure concept consists of two companion measures: 1.Transfer of Health Information to the Provider -Post-Acute Care Measur e 2.T ransfer of Health Information to the Patient- Post-Acute Care Measur e W e also provide updated specifications for the previously adopted Discharge to Communit y m easure. 2 Section 2. Cross- Setting Measure: Transfer of Health Information to the Provider -Post - Acute Care Measure Measure Description This measure, the Transfer of Health Information to the Provider, assesses for and reports on the timely transfer of health information, specifically transfer of a reconciled medication list. This measure evaluates for the transfer of information when a patient/resident is transferred or discharged from their current setting to a subsequent provider. For this measure, the subsequent provider is defined as a short - term general hospital, a SNF, intermediate care, home under care of an organized home health service organization or hospice, hospice in an institutional facility, an IRF, a n LTCH, a Medicaid nursing facility, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or a critical access hospital. This measure, developed under the IMPACT Act, has been developed conceptually for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This measure is calculated by one standardized data element that asks, \"at the time of discharge, did the facility provide the patient's /resident's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider ?\" It also includes one data element that asks the route of transmission of the reconciled medication list (Appendix A). In order to track discharge to a subsequent provider, th e LCDS will be used to track discharge location status. Guidance for what is considered a reconciled medication list is discussed in greater detail in the section below. The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF -PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patients, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, and the OASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to the standardized data element used to calculate this measure are described in Appendix A . The Reconciled Medication List The Transfer of Health Information measures serve as a check to ensure that a reconciled medication list is provided as the patient changes care settings at d ischarge. Defining the completeness of that medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient who are coordinating this care . An example of items that could be on a reconciled medication list can be but are not limited to a list of th e current prescribed and over -the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and/or homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route at the time of discharge or transfer . A reconciled medication could also include important information about : (1) the patient/resident, including their name, date of birth, active diagnoses, known medication and other allergies, and known drug sensitivities and reactions; and (2) each medication, including the name , strength , dose, route of medication adm inistration, frequency or timing, purpose/indication, and/or any special instructions. However, this information serves as guidance and as stated prior, the completeness of th e medication list is left to the discret ion of the providers and patient. Documentation sources for reconciled medication list information include electronic and/or paper records. Some examples of such records are discharge summary records, a Medication Administration Record, an Intravenous Medication Administration Record, a home medication list, and physician orders. The guidance on what to include in a reconciled medication list is aligned to the provisions in the proposed Discharge Planning for Hospitals, Critical Access Hospital, and HHAs regulation, which outlines discharge planning and the documentation of medications ( https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/03/2015-27840/medicare -and-medicaid -programs - revisions -to-requirements-for -discharge-planning-for -hospitals ). In addition, this guidance follows the requirements finalized in the Reform of Requirements fo r Long -Term Care Facilities (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/04/2016-23503 for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharg ed to home under the care of a home health agency (HHA) , and 9 percent who were discharged to SNFs.1 The proportion of patients being discharged from an acute care hospital to a PAC setting was greater among beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare. Among FFS patients discharged from an acute hospital, 42 percent went directly to PAC settings. Of those , 20 percent were discharged to a SNF, 18 percent were discharged to an HHA, 3 percent were discharged to an IRF, and 1 percent were discharged to an LTCH.2 Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with an LTCH stay in FYs 2016 and 2017, an estimated nine percent were discharged or transferred to an acute care hospital, 18 percent were discharged home with home health services, 38 percent were discharged or transferred to a SNF, and 10 percent were discharged or transferred to another PAC setting (e.g., IRF, hospice or another LTCH) .3 The transfer and/or exchange of health information from one provider to another takes several forms, including verbal (e.g. , clinician-to -clinician communication by telephone or in-person), paper - based (e.g. , faxed or printed copies of records) , and electronic communication (e.g. , via health information exc hange network, using an electronic health/medical record, secure messaging). Health information, such as medication information, that is incomplete or missing increases the likelihood of a patient/resident safety risk, often life -threatening.4 Poor communi cation and coordination across health care settings contributes to patient complications, hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, 1 Tian, W.

However, there is limited information about the route or mode (for example, paper -based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers to transfer health information. PAC provider health information exchange supports the goals of high-quality, personalized, and efficient health care; care coordination and person-centered care; and real -time, data -driven clinical decision making. PAC patients often have complicated medication regimens and require efficient and effective com munication and coordination of care between settings, including transfer of detailed medication 5 Barnsteiner, J.

Consequently, PAC providers regularly are in the position of starting complex new medication regimens with little knowledge of the patient or their medication history upon admission. Furthermore, inter -facility communication barriers delay resolving medication discrepancies during transitions of care.12 The transfer of a medication list between providers is necessary for medication reconciliation interventions, which have been shown to be a cost -effective way to avoid ADEs by reducing errors,13 especially when medications are reviewed by a pharmacist and when it is done in conjunction with the use of electronic medical records.14 Denominator The denominator is the number of LTCH patient stays, regardless of payer, ending in discharge to a short -term general hospital, a SNF, intermediate care, home under care of an organized home health service organization or hospice, hospice in an institutional facility, a swing bed, an IRF, another LTCH , a Medicaid nursing facility, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or a critical access hospital. Discharge to one of these providers is based on response to the discharge location item, A2105, of the LCDS assessment, shown below: 9 Starmer, A. J., Spector, N. D., Srivastava, R., West, D.

Measure Time Window The measure will be calculated quarterly. All LTCH stays during the quarter will be included in the denominator and are eligible for inclusion in the numerator. For patients with multiple stays during the quarter, each stay is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Items Included in the Quality Measure One data element will be included to calculate the measure. One data element will be collected to inform internal measure consistency logic.

Paper -based (e.g., fax, copies, printouts) E.Other Methods (e.g., texting, email, CDs) Risk Adjustment This measure is not risk -adjusted or stratified. Quality Measure Calculation Steps The following steps are used to calculate the measure: Step 1. Calculate the denominator count Calculate the total number of patient stays with discharge to a subsequent provider based on discharge location item A2105. Step 2. Calculate the numerator count Calculate the total number of stays where a reconciled medication list was transferred: A2121=[1] Step 3 . Calculate the facility observed score Divide the facility's numerator count by its denominator count; in other words, divide the results of Step 2 by the results of Step 1. Multiply by 100. Quality Measure Coding Steps The following steps are used to code the measure: 1.At discharge, code for the patient's discharge location. Identify discharge location with item A 2105. 2.At discharge, code for whether the facility provided the reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider. A valid response for item A2105 would trigger the coder to complete item A2121.8 3.At discharge, code for the route of transmission. A valid response for item A2121 [A2121=1] would s end the coder into item A2122. This item is used for internal measure consistency logic.9 Section 3. Cross- Setting Measure: Transfer of Health Information to the Patient -Post- Acute Care Measure Measure Description This measur e, the Transfer of Health Information to the Patient, assesses for and reports on the timely transfer of health information, specifically transfer of a reconciled medication list. This measure evaluates for the transfer of information when a patient/resident is discharged from their current setting of PAC to a private home/apartment, board and care home, assisted living, group home, transitional living, or home under the care of an organized home health service organization or hospice. This measure, developed under the IMPACT Act, has been developed concep tually for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This measure is calculated by one standard ized data element that asks, \"at the time of discharge, d id the facility provide the patient's /resident's current reconciled medication list to the patient/resident, family, and/or caregiver ?\" It also includes one data element that asks the route of transmission of the reconciled medication list (Appendix A). T he LCDS, which track s discharge location status, will be used to track discharge to home . The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF -PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patients, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, and the OASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to the standardized data element used to calculate this measure are in Appendix A. The Reconciled Medication List Discussion related to what is a reconciled medication list is located in Chapter 1, Section 2. The Transfer of Health Information measures serve as a check to ensure that a reconciled medication list is provided as the patient changes care settings at discharge . Defining the completeness of that medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient who are coordinating this care . Purpose/Rationale for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharged to home under the care of a n HHA .15 Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with an LTCH stay in FY s 2016 and 2017 an estimated 18 percent were discharged home with home health services, 9 percent were discharged home with self -care, and 2 percent were discharged with home hospice services.16 The communication of health information, such as a reconciled medication list, is critical to ensuring safe and effective patient transitions from health care settings to home and other community settings. Incomplete or missing health information, such as medication information, increases the likelihood of a patient safety risk, oft en life -threatening. 17 Individuals who use PAC settings are particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes because of their higher likelihood of multiple comorbid chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and complicated transitions between care settings.18 Upon discharge to home, individuals in PAC settings may be faced with numerous medication changes, new 15 Tian, 2016. 16 RTI International analysis of Medicare claims data for index stays in LTCH 2016/2017.

Chhabra et al., 2012. 10 medication regimes, and follow -up details.19 The efficient and effective communication and coordination of medication information may be critical to prevent potentially deadly adverse effects. When care coordination activities enhance care transitions, these activities can reduce duplication of care services and costs of care, resolve conflicting care plans, and prevent medical errors.20 The transfer of a patient's medication information to the patient , family, or caregiver is common practice and supported by discharge planning requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. 21 However, there is limited information about the route or mode (for example, paper -based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers to transfer health information. PAC provider health information exchange with patients, families , and caregivers supports the goals of high- quality, personalized, and efficient health care; care coordination and person -centered care; and real -time, data-driven clinical decision making. Most PAC electronic health record systems generate a discharge medication list. I nte rventions to promote patient participation in medication management have been shown to be acceptable and potentially useful for improving patient outcomes and reducing cost s.22 Furthermore, provision of a reconciled medication list to patients/residents and their caregivers can improve transitional care.23 Some clinical practice guidelines state the importance of medication safety and communicating accurate medication inform ation to the patient. For example, The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals #4 and #5 for Home Care Accreditation (NPSG.03.06.01) are as follows:24 4.Provide the patient (or family as needed) with written information on the medications the patient should be taking when leaving the organization's care (for example, name, dose, route, frequency, purpose). 5.Explain the importance of managing medication information to the patient. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Project Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit includes several medication -related strategies (e.g., active medication reconciliation, 19 Brody et al., 2016.

Update to the Discharge to Community -Post Acute Care (PAC) Long -Term Care Hospital (LTCH) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) Measure Measure Update The Discharge to Community -Post Acute Care (PAC) LTCH Quality Reporting Program (QRP) measure was adopted for the LTCH QRP in the FY 2017 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (81 FR 57207 through 57215) to meet the requirement of the IMPACT Act. Measure specifications were first published in July 2016.26 These draft specifications include a new measure exclusion for baseline nursing facility (NF) residents; there are no other changes to measure specifications. Measure Description This measure assesses successful discharge to the community from a PAC setting, with successful discharge to the community including no unplanned rehospitalizations and no death in the 31 days following discharge. Specifically, this measure reports an LTCH 's risk -standardized rate of Medicare fee- for-service (FFS) patients who are discharged to the community after an LTCH stay, do not have an unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31 days following discharge to community, and remain alive during the 31 days following discharge to community. Community, for this measure, is defined as home/self -care, with or without home health services, based on Patient Discharge Status Codes 01, 06, 81, and 86 on the Medicare FFS claim. 27,28,29 We adopted four discharge to community measures for IRF, LTCH, SNF, and home health (HH ) settings, respectively. These measures are conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings in terms of the definition of the discharge to community outcome, the approach to r isk adjustment, and the measure calculation, with some differences where needed due to setting -specific considerations. It is important to note that each measure is specific to the particular PAC setting (i.e., IRF, LTCH, SNF, or HH); we do not pool PAC pa tients/residents across settings in the measure development and calculation. Purpose/Rationale for the Measure Discharge to a community setting is an important health care outcome for many patients/residents for whom the overall goals of PAC include optimizing functional improvement, returning to a previous level of independence, and avoiding institutionalization. Returning to the community is also an important outcome for many patients/residents who are not expected to make functional improvement during t heir PAC stay, and for patients/residents who may be expected to decline functionally because of their medical condition. By assessing whether patients remain alive in the community without acute complications for 31 days following discharge, the Discharge to Community- PAC LTCH QRP measure is a meaningful patient - and family -centered measure of successful community discharge. 26 The original measure specifications are available at (2017). National Uniform Billing Committee Official UB-04 Data Specifications Manual 2018 (Version 12). Chicago, IL: Author. 28 Patient discharge status codes 81 and 86 are intended for use on acute care claims only. However, because these codes have sometimes been reported on PAC claims, we include them in our definition of community to credit the PAC provider for discharging the patient to a community setting. This definition is not intended to suggest that group homes, foster care, or other residential care settings included in the definition of \"community\" for the purpose of this measure are the most integrated setting for any particular individual or group of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504. 29 This definition is not intended to suggest that group homes, foster care, or other residential care settings included in the definition of \"co mmunity\" for the purpose of this measure are the most integrated setting for any particular individual or group of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504.15 In addition to being an important outcome from a patient/resident and family perspective, patients/residents discharged to community settings, on average, incur lower costs over the recovery episode, compared with those discharged to institutional settings.30 Given the high costs of care in institutional settings, encouraging PACs to prepare patients for discharge to community, when clinically appropriate, may have cost -saving implications for the Medicare program. 31 Also, providers have found that successful discharge to community was a major driver of their ability to achieve savings, where capitated payments for PAC were in place. 32 For patients/residents who require long -term care due to persistent disability, discharge to community could result in lower long-term care costs for Medicaid and for patients'/residents' out -of-pocket expenditures. 33 Analyses conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) using 2013 PAC data demonstrate the substantially higher costs of institutional PAC stays compared with home health ( HH) stays. 34 Average costs of HH stays ranged from $1,790 to $2,699 depending on the position of the HH stay in a sequence of PAC care. Average costs of institutional PAC stays (including IRF, LTCH, and SNF stays) ranged from $13,948 to $17,506, depending on the position of the institutional PAC stay in a sequence of PAC care.35 Analyses conducted for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on PAC episodes, using a 5 percent sample of 2006 Medicare claims, revealed that relatively high average, unadjusted Medicare payments are associated with discharge to institutional settings from IRFs, SNFs, LTCHs , or HHAs, as compared with payments associated with discharge to community settings. 36 Average, unadjusted Medicare payments associated with discharge to community settings ranged from $0 to $4,017 for IRF discharges, $0 discharges, and $0 to $992 for HHA discharges. In contrast, payments associated with discharge to non -community settings were considerably higher, ranging from $11,847 to $25,364 for IRF discharges, $9,305 $7,981 to $35,192 for HHA discharges.37 These expenditure estimates only include Medicare expenditures related to the immediate discharge destination following SNF, LTCH, IRF or HH care, and not expenditures related to any subsequent discharge destinations. Measuring and comparing facility-level discharge-to -community rates is expected to help differentiate among facilities with varying performance in this important domain and to help avoid disparities in care across patient/resident groups. Variation in discharge-to -community rates has been reported within and across post -acute settings; across a variety of facility -level characteristics, such as 30 Dobrez, D., Heinemann, A.

One study noted that 64 percent of beneficiaries who were discharged from the HH episode did not use any other acute or post -acute services paid by Medicare in the 30 days after discharge.44 However, significant numbers of patients were admitted to hospitals (29 percent) and lesser numbers to SNF s (7.6 percent), IRF s (1.5 percent) , HHAs (7.2 percent) , or hospice s (3.3 percent).45 Discharge to community is an actionable health care outcome, as targeted interventions have been shown to successfully increase discharge-to -community rates in a variety of post -acute settings.46 Many of these interventions involve discharge planning ; communication and care coordination; specific rehabilitation strategies, such as addressing discharge barriers and improving medical and functional status; or community-based transitional care services and supp orts.47 The effectiveness of these 42 Scheinhorn, D.

This estimate includes risk adjustment for patient characteristics with the facility effect removed. The \"expected\" number of discharges to community is the predicted number of risk-adjusted discharges to community if the same patients were treated at the average facility appropriate to the measure. The regression model used to calculate the denominator is developed using all non-excluded facility stays in the national data. The denominator is computed in the same way as the numerator, but the facility effect is set at the average. The descriptions of the discharge to community outcome, patient stays included in the measure, and numerator calculation are below. Numerator The measure does not have a simple form for the numerator and denominator \u2014that is, the risk adjustment method does not make the observed number of community discharges the numerator, and a predicted number the denominator. The measure numerator i s the risk-adjusted estimate of the number of patients who are discharged to the community, do not have an unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31 -day post -discharge observation window, and remain alive during the post - discharge observation window. This estimate starts with the observed discharges to community and is risk-adjusted for patient characteristics and a statistical estimate of the facility effect beyond case mix. The numerator uses a model estimated on full national dat a specific to the LTCH setting; it is applied to the facility's patient stays included in the measure and includes the estimated effect of that facility. The prediction equation is based on a logistic statistical model with a two -level hierarchical structure. The patient stays in the model have an indicator of the facility they are discharged from; the effect of the facility is measured as a positive or negative shift in the intercept term of the equation. The facility effects are modeled as belonging to a normal (Gaussian) distribution centered at 0 and are estimated along with the effects of patient characteristics in the model. Numerator details are provided below. Numerator details: discharge to community Discharge to community is based on the Patient Discharge Status Code fr om the LTCH claim. Discharge to community is defined as discharge to home/self -care with or without home health services. 48 Table 1 lists the Patient Discharge Status Codes used to define community. Table 1 Patient Discharge Status Codes Used to Determine Discharge to a Community Setting Discharge Status Codes Indicating Discharge to a Community Setting 01 Discharged to home/self -care (routine discharge) 06 Discharged/transferred to home under care of organized home health service organization 81 Discharged to home or self -care with a planned acute care hospital readmission 86 Discharged/transferred to home under care of organized home health service organization with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission 48 American Hospital Association, 2017. 19 Patient discharge status codes 81 and 86 are intended for use on acute care claims only. However, because these codes have sometimes been reported on PAC claims, we include them in our definition of community to credit the PAC provider for discharging the patient to a community set ting. Numerator details: unplanned readmissions in the 31 -day post -discharge observation window A patient who is discharged to the community is not considered to have a successful discharge to community outcome for this measure if they have a subsequent u nplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the post -discharge observation window, which includes the day of discharge and the 31 days following day of discharge. We only assess the first readmission encountered in the post - discharge window. Our definition of acute care hospital includes hospitals paid under the Inpatient PPS (IPPS), critical access hospitals (CAH), and psychiatric hospitals or units. Using acute care and LTCH claims, we identify unplanned readmissions based on the CMS planned readmissions algorithm 49 used in the following PAC readmission measures, endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and used in several CMS programs: ( 1) NQF #2510: Skilled Nursing Facility ( 2) NQF #2502: All -Cause Readmission Measure 30 Days from Rehabilitation Facilities; ( 3) NQF #2512: All-Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Long -Term Care Hospitals; and ( 4) NQF #2380: Rehospitalization During the First 30 Days of Home Health.50 These readmission measures are based on the -Cause Readmission Measure (HWR) (CMS/Yale) for the SNF, IRF, and LTCH setting measures .52 The CM S planned readmission definition is based on the claim from the readmission having a code for a diagnosis or procedure that is considered planned; however, if a planned procedure is accompanied by a principal diagnosis in a specified list of acute diagnoses, the readmission is reclassified as unplanned. Readmissions to psychiatric hospitals or units are classified as planned readmissions. We use the most current available version of the CMS planned readmission algorithm from the HWR measure specifications for measure calculation and make necessary updates to the additions made for PAC settings to ensure the algorithm corresponds to our measurement period. This measure was developed with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM) procedure and diagnosis codes, and it has been transitioned using the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM crosswalk. Numerator details: death in the 31- day post -discharge observation window Patients who are discharged to the community are not consider ed to have a successful discharge to community outcome for this measure if they die in the post -discharge window, which includes the day 49 Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation - Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (YNHHSC/CORE).

Death in the post -discharge window is identified using date of death from Medicare eligibility files. Target Population and Measure Exclusions The target population for the measure is the group of Medicare FFS patients who are not excluded for the reasons listed below. Measure exclusions Exclusions for the discharge to community measure are listed below, along with the rationale and data source for each exclusion. Baseline long-term nursing facility residence is based on data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). All other measure exclusion criteria are determined by processing Medicare claims and eligibility data to determine whether the individual exclusion criteria are met. Only LTCH stays that are preceded by a short -term acute care stay in the 30 days before the LTCH admission date are included in the measure. Stays ending in transfers to the same level of care are excluded. 1)Age under 18 years Rationale: a.There is limited literature on discharge destination outcomes in this age group . b.Patients in this age group represent a different cohort, likely living with their parents, and may be expected to have higher discharge -to-community rates than the rest of the Medicare population . c.Patients in this age group represent a small proportion of the post -acute Medicare FFS population . D ata source: Birth date and LTCH admission date from Inpatient Standard Analytic File (SAF) . 2)No short -term acute care stay within the 30 days preceding LTCH admissi on Ra tionale: Acute care claims from the 30 days before LTCH admission provide the principal diagnosis and other important patient data for risk adjustment. Patients without a short-term acut e car e discharge within the 30 days before PAC admission are excluded from the measure, becau se i mportant risk adjustment data are missing. Data source: Hospital d ischarge date in Inpatient SAF acute care claims in the 30 days before LTCH admission . 3)Discharges to psychiatric hospital Rationale: Patients discharged to psychiatric hospital are excluded from the measure becau se c ommunity living at the time of discharge may be potentially inappropriate or unsafe for them because of their mental health or psychiatric condition. Data source: Patient discharge status code from Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 4)Discharges against medical adviceRationale: Patients who discharge themselves against medical advice are excluded because their car e pl an may not have been fully implemented, and the discharge destination may not reflect the facility's discharge recommendation. Additionally, patients discharged against medical advice may be at higher risk of post -discharge readmissions or death, depending on their medical condition or because of potential nonadherence or noncompliance with care recommendations. Data source: Patient discharge status code from Inpatient SAF LTCH claim .21 5)Discharges to disaster alternative care sites or federal hospital s Ra tionale: Patients discharged to disaster alternative care sites are excluded because these discharg es a re likely influenced by external emergency conditions and may not represent discretionar y disch arges by the LTCH provider. Discharges to federal hospitals are also excluded. Data source: Patient discharge status code from Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 6)Discharges to court/law enforcement Rationale: Patients who are discharged to court or law enforcement are likely ineligible for discharge to the community because of legal restrictions. Data source: Patient discharge status code from Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 7)Patients discharged to hospice or those with a hospice benefit in the 31-day post-discharge window Rationale:a.Patients discharged to hospice care and those with a hospice benefit in the post -discharg e o bservation window are terminally ill and have very different goals of care than non-hospice patients. For non -hospice patients, the primary goal of PAC is to return to baseline, independent living in the community; death is an undesirable outcome in the non -hospice population. For patients on hospice, the goal is to give them the opportunity to die comfortably, at home or in a facility . b.A large proportion of patient s on hospice care die in the 31 -day window following discharge from the post -acute setting. c.The hospice agency, not the PAC setting , makes the final decision of discharge to hospice-home or hospice -facility . Da ta source: Discharge to hospice is on the Inpatient SAF LTCH claim. Post -discharge hospice benefit is based on hospice enrollment dates (start and termination dates) in the Enrollment Database (EDB). 8)Patients not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months before LTCH admissi on dat e, and at least 31 days after LTCH discharge date Rationale: Patients not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months before the LTC H admission date are excluded because risk adjustment for certain comorbidities requir es inf ormation on acute inpatient bills for one year before LTCH admission. Patients not continuousl y en rolled in Part A FFS Medicare for at least 31 days after LTCH discharge are excluded becau se r eadmissions and death must be observable in the 31- day post -discharge period. Patients without Par t A co verage or those who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans will not have complete inpatient claims in the system. Data source: EDB and Denominator Files . 9)Patients whose prior short -term acute care stay was for non -surgical treatment of can cer Ra tionale: Patients whose prior short -term acute care stay was for non -surgical treatment of cancer are excluded because they have a different trajectory for recovery after discharge, with a high22 mortality rate.53 Exclusion of these patients is consistent with the HWR and PAC readmission measures. Data source: Diagnosis codes from the Inpatient SAF prior acute claim . 10) LTCH stays that end in transfer to the same level of care Rationale : LTCH stays that end in transfer to the same level of care are excluded because their LTCH episode has not ended. For an LTCH episode that involves transfer to the same level of care, only th e f inal LTCH provider is included in the measure. Data source: Patient discharge status code from Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 11)LTCH stays with claims data that are problematic (e.g., anomalous records for stays that overlap wholly or in part, or are otherwise erroneous or contradictory; stays not matched to the denominator or EDB files ; claims not paid) Rationale : This measure requires accurate information from the LTCH stay and prior short -term acut e car e stay in the elements used for risk adjustment. No -pay LTCH stays involving exhaust ion of Part A benefits are also excluded. Data source: Inpatient SAF claims, EDB and denominator files . 12) Planned discharges to an acute setting Rationale : Planned discharges to an acute care hospital are excluded because these patients had a pl anned return to higher level of care , and discharge to community is not appropriate for these patients.Data source: The planned readmission algorithm is applied to diagnosis and procedure codes found on the first acute care claim, if any, on the day of or day after index LTCH discharge. 13)Medicare Part A benefits exhausted Rationale : Patients who have exhausted their Medicare Part A coverage during the LTCH stay ar e e xcluded because the discharge destination decision may be related to exhaustion of benefits. Data source: Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 14)Patients who received care from a facility located outside of the United States, Puerto Rico , or a U.S. territoryRationale : Patients who received care from foreign facilities may not have complete inpatient claim s i n the system, and these facilities may not be subject to policy decisions related to this quality measure. Data source: CMS Certification Number from the Inpatient SAF LTCH claim . 15)New exclusion: Patients who had a long -term NF stay in the 180 days preceding their hospitalizati on and LTC H stay, with no intervening community discharge between the long -term NF stay and quali fying hospitalization for measure inclusion (i.e., baseline NF residents) Rationale : Baseline long-term NF residents did not live in the community before their LTCH stay, and discharge to a community setting may not be a safe or expected outcome for these residents. 53 NQF #1789: Hospital -Wide All- Cause Readmission Measure 23 Data source: We examine historical MDS data in the 180 days preceding the qualifying prior acute care admission and index LTCH stay. Presence of an Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( OBRA)- only assessment ( i.e., a no n SNF PPS assessment) with no intervening community discharge between the OBRA assessment and acute care admission date flags the index LTCH stay as a baseline long- term NF resident. Data Sources This measure is based on Medicare FFS administrative c laims and uses data in the Medicare eligibility files, inpatient claims, and MDS. The eligibility files provide information such as date of birth, date of death, sex, reasons for Medicare eligibility, periods of Part A coverage, and periods in the Medicare FFS program. The data elements from the Medicare FFS claims are those basic to the operation of the Medicare payment systems and include data such as date of admission, date of discharge, diagnoses, procedures, indicators for use of dialysis services, and indicators of whether the Part A benefit was exhausted. The inpatient claims data files contain patient-level PAC and other hospital records. Historical MDS data are used to identify baseline NF residents. No data beyond those submitted in the normal course of business are required from LTCH providers for the calculation of this measure. The following are the specific files used for measure calculation with links to their documentation: Medicare Inpatient Claims (SAF), Index PAC Claims : Documentation for the Medicare claims data is provided online by Research Data Assistance Center. The following web page includesdata dictionaries for the Inpatient SAF (Inpatient Research Identifiable -documentation Medicare Enrollment Database: Information about the EDB may be found at http://aspe.hhs.gov/datacncl/datadir/cms.htm Medicare Denominator File: Information and documentation Documentation available at https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/files/mds-3.0 Measure Time Window The measure is calculated using two years of data. All LTCH stays during the two -year time wind ow, except those that meet the exclusion criteria, are included in the measure. For patients with multiple stays during the two-year time window, each stay is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Data from calendar y ear (CY) 2012- 2013 were used to develop this measure. The analyses in this document are based on CY 2015- 2016 data. Statistical Risk Model and Risk Adjustment Covariates We used a hierarchical logistic regression method to predict the probability of discharge to community. Patient characteristics related to discharge and a marker for the specific discharging facility are included in the equation. The equation is hierarchical in that both individual patient characteristics are accounted for, as well as the clustering of patient characteristics b y facility. The statistical model estimates both the average predictive effect of the patient characteristics across all facilities, and the degree to which each facility has an effect on discharge to community that differs from that of the average facility. The facility effects are assumed to be randomly distributed around the average (according to a normal distribution). When computing the facility effect, hierarchical modeling accounts for the known predictors of discharge to community, on average, such as patient characteristics, the observed facility rate, and the number of facility stays eligible for inclusion in the measure. The estimated facility effect is determined mostly by the facility's own data if the number of patient discharges is relatively large (as the 24 estimate would be relatively precise), but is adjusted toward the average if the number of patient discharges is small (as that would yield a less-precise estimate). We used the following model: Let Y ij, denote the outcome (equal to 1 if patient i is discharged to community, 0 otherwise) for a patient i at facility j; Zij denotes a set of risk adjustment variables. We assume the outcome is related to the risk adjusters via a logit function with dispersion: ij=(Z 1, Z2, ... Z k) is a set of k patient -level risk adjustment variables; j represents the facility- specific intercept; \u00b5 is the adjusted average outcome across all facilities; 2 is the between -facility variance component; and ~N(0,2) is the error term. The hierarchical logistic regression model is estimated using SAS software (PROC GLIMMIX: SAS/STAT User's Guide, SAS Institute Inc.). The estimated equation is used twice in the measure. The sum of the probabilities of discharge to community of all patients in the facility measure, including both the effects of patient characteristics and the facility, is the \"predicted number\" of discharges to community after adjusting for the facility's case mix. The same equation is used without the facility effect to compute the expected number of discharges to community for the same patients at the average facility. The ratio of the predicted to expected number of discharges to community is a measure of the degree to which discharges to community are higher or lower than what would otherwise be expected. This standardized risk ratio (SRR) is then multiplied by the mean discharge-to -community rate for all facility stays for the measure, yielding the risk -standardized discharge-to -community rate for each facility. Please note that the estimation procedure is recalculated for each measurement period. Re-estimating the models for each measurement period allows the estimatedeffects of the patient characteristics to vary over time as patient case mix and medical treatm ent patterns change. Risk adjustment variable descriptions are below. See Appendix B, Table B -1, for the full list of variables in the risk adjustment models. 1.Age and sex groups. 2.End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or disability as original reason for entitlement. 3.Principal diagnosis (Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) groups) from the prior acute stay inthe past 30 days.

Measure Calculation Algorithm The following steps describe the calculation algorithm/measure logic for the discharge-to - community measures: Step 1: Identify patients meeting the criteria for the target population, after applying measure exclusions. Step 2: Identify patients meeting the numerator criteria (i.e., discharge to community, no unplanned readmissions on the day of discharge or in the 31 days following discharge, and no death on the day of discharge or in the 31 days following discharge). Step 3: Identify presence or absence of risk adjustment variables for each patient. Step 4: Calculate the predicted and expected number of discharges to community for each facility using the hierarchical logistic regression model. The predicted number of discharges to community for each facility is calculated as the sum of the predicted probability of discharge to community for each patient discharged from the facility and included in the measure, including the facility-s pecific effect. To calculate the predicted number of discharges to community, pred j, for index facility stays at facility j, we used the following equation: =1(++\u00d7 (2) wh ere the sum is over all stays in facility j, and i is the random intercept. To calculate the expected number , exp j, we used the following equation: =1(+\u00d7 (3) St ep 5: Calculate the SRR for each facility as the ratio of the predicted to expected number of discharges to community. 56 CMS -HCC Mappings of ICD -9 and ICD -10 Codes are included in the software at the following website: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health -Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Risk -Adjustors.html 26 To calculate the facility SRR j, we used the following equation: =\u00f7 (4) Ste p 6: Calculate the risk-standardized discharge -to-community rate for each facility. To aid interpretation, the facility-wide SRR j, obtained from equation (4) , is then multiplied by the overall national raw discharge -to-community rate for all facility stays, , to produce the facility -wide risk -standardized discharge-to-community rate (RSR j). To calculate the risk -standardized discharge-to-community rate for each facility, we used the following equation: =\u00d7 Y (5) NOTE : Because the statistic described in Step 6 is a complex function of parameter estimates, re- sampling using bootstrapping may be necessary to derive a confidence interval estimate for the final risk- standardized rate to characterize the uncertainty of the estimate. See Appendix B for risk adjustment model results and providers' observed and risk-standardized score distributions. 27 Chapter 2 Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements Section 1: Introduction The Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) requires CMS to develop, implement, and maintain standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) for PAC settings. The four PAC settings specified in the IMPACT Act are HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs. The goals of implementing cross -setting SPADEs are to facilitate care coordination and interoperability and to improve Medicare beneficiary outcomes. Existing PAC assessment instruments (i.e., OASIS for HHAs, IRF -PAI for IRFs, LCDS for LTCHs, and the MDS for SNFs) often collect data elements pertaining to similar concepts, but the individual data elements \u2014questions and response options \u2014vary by assessment instrument. With a few exceptions, the data elements collected in these assessment instruments are not currently standardized or interoperable ; therefore, patient responses across the assessment instruments cannot be compared easily. The IMPACT Act further requires that the assessment instruments described above be modified to inclu de core data elements on health assessment categories and that such data be standardized and interoperable. Implementation of a core set of standardized assessment items across PAC settings has important implications for Medicare beneficiaries, families, providers, and policymakers. CMS is adopting SPADEs for six categories specified in the IMPACT Act: 1.Functional status, such as mobility and self-care 2.Cognitive function (e.g., able to express ideas and to understand normal speech) and mental status(e.g., depression and dementia) 3.Special services, treatments, and interventions (e.g., need for ventilator, dialysis, chemotherapy,and total parenteral nutrition) 4.Medical conditions and co morbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart failure, and pressure ulcers) 5.Impairments (e.g., incontinence; impaired ability to hear, see, or swallow) 6.Other categories as deemed necessary by the Secretary Background In the following sections, we present additional information on the SPADEs finalized in the FY 2020 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)/LTCH PPS final r ule. We outline how each SPADE is relevant to the care of patients in the LTCH , review its current use in existing PAC assessment item sets, and summarize any prior testing of the data elements. For SPADEs that were included in the National Beta Test, which was conducted by RAND between November 2017 and August 2018, we present detailed information on data element performance. Evidence supporting the se SPADEs comes from several sources, including the Post -Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD), MDS 3.0 testing, and the National Beta Test. The most relevant metrics for evaluation of SPADE p erformance (i.e., feasibility and reliability) include the amount of missing data, time to administer the data element, and interrater reliability (IRR) . IRR is the level of agreement between two raters; that is, the extent to which two different individuals would code the same response when presented with the same information. Typically, percent agreement and the kappa statistic \u2014or weighted kappas, for ordina l data \u2014are used to represent IRR. The kappa statistic is preferred in most cases because there are agreed -upon conventions for its interpretation and it corrects for chance agreement between raters. However, kappa is sensitive to prevalence rates; when prevalence rates are 28 extremely high or low, the resulting kappa statistic does not accurately convey the level of agreement.57 In those cases, percent agreement is preferred. The evidence offered for the SPADEs in the sections below follow standard conventions in reporting both percent agreement and kappas or weighted kappas to describe IRR. Post-Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD) Some prior evidence for the se SPADEs comes from the PAC PRD. The PAC PRD was mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to examine the relative costliness and outcomes of similar types of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to different PAC settings (i.e., HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs). To meet these aims, the study collected standardized assessment data, using the Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) across PAC settings to measure patient severity and case mix across settings at more than 200 providers in 11 geographically diverse markets. The standardized assessment data allowed cross-setting comparisons of the factors associated with costs and outcomes, as well as service substitution among post -acute providers, all else being equal about the patient. Further information on the design and methods of the PAC PRD can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Research - Statistics -Data-and -Systems/Statistics -Trends -and-Reports/Reports/Research -Reports - Testing of the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS 3.0) Additional testing information comes from the national testing of the MDS 3.0.58 During a 6-year period starting in 2003, CMS engaged in a national project to create an improved version of the MDS 2.0. A joint RAND/Harvard team employed an iterative development process that culminated in the national testing of the MDS 3.0 in 2006 and 2007. The national validation and evaluation testing of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (3,822 residents) and 19 Veterans Health Administration nursing homes (764 residents), distributed throughout the regions of the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze IRR, validity of key items, response rates for int erview items, feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment. In addition, the national test design allowed comparison of item distributions between MDS 3.0 and MDS 2.0. Further information on the design and methods of MDS 3.0 testing can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality - Initiatives -Patient-Assessment - Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/downloads/MDS30FinalReport.pdf . National Beta Test Purpose and goals The National Beta Test was conducted to evaluate the reliability and validity of candidate SPADEs and to support the identification of data elements for standardization across PAC settings, in accordance with the mandates of the IMPACT Act. To test SPADE performance within each setting, sufficient numbers of patients/residents needed to be included in each of the four settings to enable setting -specific performance estimates. Further, the participating patients/residents needed to represent adequate coverage of the clinical range of patients/residents receiving care nationally in each of the four 57 Cicchetti, D.

Retrieved from https://www.cms.hhs.gov/NursingHomeQualityInits/Downloads/MDS30FinalReport.pdf 29 PAC settings. To evaluate the suitability of the SPADEs for cross -setting use, sufficient numbers of facilities/agencies of each setting type needed to be included in the test. These facilities/agencies needed to reflect a reasonable range of geographic diversity relative to PAC settings nationally. Many large national studies of patients and health conditions are designed to generate estimates and make comparisons of rates of conditions or severity of patients on one or more clinical characteristics (e.g., cognitive status). To do this, these studies seek to recruit a proportionally balanced representative sample, and employ case- mix models and/or sampling weights to the data. In contrast, the National Beta Test was designed to generate valid and robust national SPADE performance estimates (i.e., time to complete and IRR), which fundamentally requires acceptable geographic diversity, sufficient sample size, and reasonable coverage of the range of clinical characteristics. To meet these requirements, the National Beta Test was carefully designed so data could be collected from a wide range of environments, allowing for thorough evaluation of candidate SPADE performance in all PAC settings. These analyses included extensive checks on the sampling design (e.g., generating results by market and by urbanicity) to identify possible limitations to the generalizability of results. Results of these sensitivity analyses are not included in this document, but will b e described in detail in the forthcoming volumes of the National Beta Test Final Report (see help readers interpret evidence from the National Beta Test that is included for some SPADEs, we include an abridged description of the National Beta Test design and methods below. An in -depth technical discussion of the design and methods of the National Beta Test can be found in the document titled \" Develo pment and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: Findings from the National Beta Test (Volume 2),\" available https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality and s ampling The National Beta Test included PAC providers in 14 geographic/metropolitan areas , or \"markets,\" across the country. This number was chosen to be similar to the design used for the PAC PRD. A multistage stratified random sampling plan was used t o obtain the sample of 14markets in the United States, and then a sample of eligible PAC facilities was compiled from those markets. To be eligible for selection, markets had to meet the following criteria: Sampled markets would yield a predefined number of PAC facilities/agencies of each type for th e sam ple (12 SNFs, 10 HHAs, at least four LTCHs or IRFs, and at least one LTCH) The predefined number of facilities/agencies within the markets were expected to have flow rat es l arge enough to obtain the targete d number of assessments per facility The predefined number of facilities/agencies had to be located within 2 hours of one another t o f acilitate completion of assessments in a timely manner Of 306 markets in the United States, 64 were deemed eligible. The random sampling of the 14 markets was stratified by U.S. Census division to enhance geographic representation, yielding the following 14 markets: Boston, MA ; Chicago, IL ; Dallas, TX; Durham, NC ; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Harrisburg, VA; Houston, TX ; Kansas City, MO; Los Angeles, CA; Nashville, TN ; Philadelphia, PA ; Phoenix, AZ ; St. Louis, MO ; and San Diego, CA. Because these markets are a random sample, they are expected to be representative of the set of 64 eligible facilities and findings are therefore generalizable to the set of eligible facilities. The target numbers of providers by setting within these 14 markets were 28 IRFs, 28 LTCHs, 84 SNFs, and 70 HHAs, totaling 210 PAC providers. The number of settings was determined based on 30 standard sample size calculations, which included the numbers of facilities and patients rather than the proportions of the populations they represented. The power calculations indicated that 28 providers per setting type (two in each market) would yield enough admissions during the field period to obtain robust estimates of candidate SPADE performance. This minimum number was adopted as the recruitment target for IRFs and LTCHs; additional SNFs and HHAs were targeted to enhance sample diversity in light of the larger proportion of these setting types nationally. A total of 143 PAC facilities (35 HHAs, 22 IRFs, 26 LTCHs, 60 SNFs) were successfully recruited across 14 U.S. markets to participate in the National Beta Test. Although this number falls short of targets both overall and by setting, this shortfall was offset by extending the field period, allowing for the accrual of more eligible patient/resident admissions and discharges. Eligibility The National Beta Test SPADEs were evaluated for performance among a sample of communicative patients/residents (who could make themselves understood through any means). All communicative patients/residents who were admitted to a participating provider site during the field period and were Medicare beneficiaries covered under one of the PAC PPSs were eligible for the admission assessment, and all those who completed an admission assessment and were di scharged during the field period were eligible for the discharge assessment. National Beta Test enrollment of non-communicative patients/residents was not tied to an admission date so as to ensure availability of sufficient numbers within the field period for evaluation of three data elements developed specifically for non-communicative patients/residents (observational assessments of cognitive status, mood, and pain). Although this ensured availability of sufficient numbers of non-communicative patients/residents for testing of the non-communicative data elements, it precluded assessing these patients/residents with non - interview SPADEs at admission. The three data elements developed specifically for non -communicative patients/residents are not included in this rule ; thus, the non-communicative sample from the National Beta Test is not described further here. Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act states that facilities that deliver PAC services under Medicare are required to provide qualified interpreters to their patients/residents with limited English proficiency. 59 Facilities have discretion in how they furnish qualified interpreters, including the use of remote interpreters (i.e., high -quality telephone or video services). As descr ibed above, the focus of the National Beta Test was to establish the feasibility and validity of the data elements within and across PAC settings. Including limited English proficiency patients/residents in the sample would have required facilities in the National Beta Test to engage or involve translators during the test assessments. In planning the National Beta Test, we anticipated that this would have added undue complexity to what facilities/agencies were being asked to do, and would have undermined th e ability of facility/agency staff to complete the requested number of assessments within the assessment window (e.g., Admission Days 3 -7) and within the study field period. In light of the strong existing evidence for the feasibility of all patient/resident interview SPADEs included in this rule (B rief Interview for Mental Status [BIMS], Pain Interference, Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]) when administered in other languages, either through standard PAC workflow (e.g., as tested and currently collected in the MDS 3.0) and/or through rigorous translation and testing (e.g., PHQ), the performance of translated versions of these patient/resident interview SPADEs did not need to be further evaluated. In addition, because their exclusion did not threaten our a bility to achieve acceptable geographic diversity, sufficient sample size, and reasonable coverage of the range of PAC patient/resident clinical characteristics, t he exclusion of limited English proficiency patients/residents was not considered a limitatio n to interpretation of the National Beta Test results. 59 For more information, see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html 31 Data collection Admission assessments were completed between admission days 3 -7; discharge assessments could be completed from 2 days before discharge through the discharge date. Trained research nurses and staff at participating PAC facilities /agencies administered all assessments. A subset of the admission assessments was completed by research nurse/facility staff assessor pairs to allow for evaluation of IRR. Power analyses indicated that reliability estimates required a minimum of 194 paired assessments, time to complete estimates could be compared across settings for detection of small effect sizes with a minimum of 274 assessments per setting, and as few as 460 assessments would be sufficient to evaluate aspects of validity (e.g., group differences, associations with other clinical variables, etc.) with small to moderate effect sizes. Therefore, average assessment contributions per participating facility/agency were calculated for each of these goals (i.e., paired assessments, assessments completed by facility/agency staff, total admission assessments) and communicated throughout the study period to guide the data collection and track progress. These minimums were more easily attainable in SNFs and HHAs because of the larger number of participating facilities/agencies. However, participating LTCHs and IRFs also were able to collectively meet these targets by the end of the field period. The total number of admission assessments is shown in Appendix C, Table 1.1. This table also shows the number of assessments from which completion t imes were estimated, and the number of assessments that were conducted by paired raters and contributed to evaluation of IRR. In addition to meeting the minimum sample size requirements, the data collection yielded very small rates of missing data, speakin g to the overall feasibility of the SPADEs. Table 1.2 in Appendix C shows completion rates by National Beta Test protocol module. Module completion rates ranged from 93.8 to 98.2 percent, and nearly 90 percent of the communicative admission sample completed all assessment modules. More information on the design and methods of the National Beta Test can be found in the document \"Development and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: Findings from the National Beta Test (Volume 2: Functional Status Data We are adopting six functional status data elements as SPADEs under the category of functional status under section 1899B(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act (the Act) . These six data elements are Car transfer , Walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces , 1 step (curb) , 4 steps, 12 steps , and Picking up object. We are adding these to the LCDS as SPADEs under section 1899B(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. We adopted these six mobility data elements into the SNF, IRF, and HH QRPs as SPADEs under their respective patient/resident assessment instruments. The data elements listed above were implemented in the IRF QRP and SNF QRP when we adopted the quality measures Change in Mobility Score (NQF #2634) and Discharge Mobility Score (NQF #2636) into the IRF QRP in the FY PPS final FR 47111 through and the SNF QRP in final rule (82 FR 36577 through 36593) . In addition, we implemented these six mobility data elements in the home health ( HH) setting . The CY 2018 HH PPS final rule (82 FR 51733 through 51734) finalized that these six mobility data elements meet the definition of standardized patient assessment data for functional status under section 1899B(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act .

Cognitive impairment that manifests with behavioral symptoms \u2014or that impairs a patient's ability to communicate, prompting behavioral disturbances \u2014may put the patient or resident or others in the care setting at risk for injury or assault, or may signal unmet patient or resident needs (e.g., pain management). Screening for the presence of impairment can help ensure appropriate and timely intervention. A substantial proportion of PAC patients and residents experience cognitive impairment, delirium, communication impairment, or behavioral distress. Testing from the PAC PRD found that about one-third of patients and residents in PAC settings were classified as having moderately or severely impaired cognitive function. 61 About one -third exhibited disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness, and about one -half exhibited inattention. Fewer than 7 percent of patients and residents exhibited signs and symptoms of behavioral distress in the PA C PRD. Therapeutic interventions can improve patient outcomes, and evidence suggests that treatment (e.g., drugs, physical activity) can stabilize or delay symptom progression in some patients, thereby improving quality of life.62, In addition, assessments help PAC providers better understand the needs of their patients by establishing a baseline for identifying changes in cognitive function and mental status (e.g., delirium), elucidating the patient's ability to understand and participate in treatments during their stay, highlighting safety needs (e.g., to prevent falls), and identifying appropriate support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of patient or resident cognition supports clinical decision making, early clinical intervention, person-centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, enabling the transfer of accurate health information. CMS has identified several data elements as applicable for cross-setting use in standardized assessment of cognitive impairment. 1.The BIMS 2.The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) The data elements involve different aspects of cognition (e.g., short-term memory, comprehension) and types of data (e.g., interview, performance-based) . They are collected by various modes (e.g., clinician assessed, patient reported). 60 National Institute on Aging. (2013). Assessing cognitive impairment in older patients .

The BIMS evaluates repetition, recall with and without prompting, and temporal orientation. Relevance to LTCHs In older adults, dementia and cognitive impairment are associated with long -term functional dependence and, consequently, poor quality of life and increased health care costs and mortality.63 Therefore, assessment of mental status and early detection of cognitive decline or impairment is critical in the LTCH setting. The burden of cognitive impairment in LTCHs is high. The PAC PRD found that 16.8 percent of LTCH patients are moderately cognitively impaired and 15.5 percent are severely cognitively impaired when assessed by the BIMS. 64 The intensity of routine nur sing care is higher for LTCH patients with cognitive impairment than those without, and dementia is a significant variable in predicting readmission after discharge to the community from LTCHs. 65 The BIMS data elements comprehensively assess cognitive functioning in greater detail than existing data elements in the LCDS. Assessing cognitive function using the BIMS would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, patient safety, and resource use in LTCHs.

Prior evidence supporting use of the BIMS The BIMS data elements were tested in the PAC PRD, where they showed substantial to almost perfect reliability of 0.71 to 0.91 (weighted kappas ) when used across all four PAC settings. The lowest agreement was on the \"repetition of three words\" memory data element, with a kappa of 0.71, which still falls within the range of substantial agreement. PAC PRD testing also demonstrated the feasibility of the BIMS for use in LTCHs and found evidence of strong reliability of the BIMS data elements in the LTCH 37 setting. In addition, the BIMS data elements were found to be predictive of higher patient cost.66 The BIMS data elements were also included in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes and showed almost perfect reliability.67 Agreement ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (standard kappa). The BIMS data elements were found to be highly correlated (0.906) with a gold-standard measure of cognitive function, the Modified Mini-Mental Status (3MS) exam. 68 Evidence supporting use of the BIMS from the National Beta Test Assessing impairment: In the National Beta Test, the BIMS was administered at admission to 646 patients/residents in HHAs , 786 in s, and 1,134 in SNF s (n=3,062 overall). Overall, 5 percent of patients/residents met criteria for being severely impaired, 18 percent for being moderately impaired, and 76 percent for being intact. In the LTCH setting, 7 percent were severely impaired, 19 percent were moderately impaired, and 73 percent were intact. Patients in the LTCH setting showed similar impairment levels to those in a SNF and somewhat greater impairment than those in an IRF or HHA. Setting -specific admission frequencies for BIMS data elements and the overall impairment category at admission are shown in Appendix C, Table 2.1.1. Missing data: In general, there were low rates of missing data for BIMS items. Item -level missing data ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 percent overall and ranged from 0.6 to 2.8 percent in the LTCH setting. For all settings, missing data rates were slightly higher for recall of current day of the week. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration . Time to complete: To assess feasibility of administration, the length of time to administer the BIMS was assessed among 445 patients/residents in HHAs , 537 in IRF s, s, and 494 in SNF s (n=1,808 overall). Overall mean time to complete the BIMS was 2.2 minutes ( standard deviation [SD]=1.2 minutes). Time to complete in the LTCH setting was 2.3 minutes (SD = 1.2 minutes ). Interrater reliability: The IRR was excellent for the BIMS , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters (n =966 paired assessments across settings; n =238 paired assessments in LTCH ). Across all settings, the kappa for the BIMS Impairment Category classification (based on the BIMS total score) was 0.91; in the LTCH setting, the kappa was also 0.91. The kappas for individual items within the BIMS ranged from 0.83 to 0.93 across all settings and ranged from 0.87 to 0.93 in the LTCH setting. Kappa was not estimated for two items within the BIMS because the proportion of patients across settings with correct responses was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the BIMS Impairment Category classification was 96 percent across all settings and 95 percent in the LTCH setting. Percent agreement for the individual items ranged from 94 to 98 percent across settings and from 93 to 97 percent in LTCHs.

The Short CAM contains only four items (i.e., items 1 to 4) from the original CAM (Long CAM). These items focus on an acute change in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Relevance to LTCHs The CAM data elements would provide important information about delirium in patients in the LTCH setting if added to the LCDS. Because patients with multiple comorbidities are hospitalized in LTCHs for long periods of time, it is important to assess delirium , as this condition is associated with a high mortality rate and prolonged duration of stay in hospitalized older adults ; 71 a higher risk of falls in a subacute geriatric ward ;72 and higher rates of 30- day readmission, lower rates of discharge to home, and less functional improvement among nursing home admissions.73 The prevalence of signs and symptoms of delirium in LTCH patients is high. As assessed in the PAC PRD using the CAM, 48 percent of patients in LTCHs exhibited inattention, 35.6 percent had disorganized thinking , and 31.7 percent had an altered level of consciousness. 74 Assessing certain types of cognitive impairment, including delirium and reversible confusion using the Short CAM , would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, patient safety, and resource use in LTCHs. 69 De, J., & Wand, A.

Current use The Short CAM data elements are currently collected in the MDS and the LCDS, and the scoring is based on staff observations of signs and symptoms of delirium. Although the Short CAM data elements are used in both assessment tools, the response options curr ently differ. The current version of the LCDS includes two response options (yes/no, indicating that the behavior is present or not present), whereas the MDS offers three response options (behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate; behavior present , fluctuates; behavior not present). The LCDS and MDS versions of the CAM also differ slightly in wording and criteria for the \"Altered Level of Consciousness\" item. Prior evidence supporting use of the CAM A version of the CAM with an item added to assess psychomotor retardation was tested in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes. Reliabilities were substantial or almost perfect. Overall average kappa ranged from 0.85 to 0.89, and items ranged from 0.78 to 0.90 (standard kappa). 75 Based on a meta- analysis of diagnostic accuracy in nine studies, the CAM demonstrated moderate sensitivity (82 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: 69- 91 percent) and high specificity (99 percent, 95 percent confidence 75 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b.

The CAM was administered at admission to 630 patients/residents in HHA, 771 (n=2,973 overall). Overall, 5 percent of patients/residents had evidence of mental status change from baseline, 12 percent had difficulty focusing (3 percent continuously), 6 percent had disorganized thinking (1 percent continuously), and 4 percent had altered consciousness (1 percent continuously). In the LTCH setting specifically, 5 percent of patients/residents had evidence of mental status change from baseline, 11 percent had difficulty focusing (3 percent continuously), 6 percent had disorganized thinking (2 percent continuously), and 5 percent had altered consciousness (2 percent continuously). Setting -specific frequencies for CAM data elements at admission are shown in Appendix C, Table 2.2.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing data for the CAM. Across all settings, item-level missing data did not exceed 0.4 percent for any of the four CAM items. Similarly, in the LTCH setting , item-level missing data did not exceed 0.4 percent. For all settings, missing data rates were slightly higher for the change in mental status from baseline item (0.4 percent missing). In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: To assess feasibility of administration, time to complete was assessed for 375 patients/residents in HHAs , 472 in IRF s, 284 in LTCH s, and 405 in SNF s (n=1,536 overall). Overall the mean time to complete the CAM was 1.4 minutes (SD = 0.7 minutes). In the LTCH setting, the mean time to complete the CAM was 1.5 minutes (SD = 0.7 minutes). Interrater reliability: The IRR was good for the CAM , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters (n =914 paired assessments across settings; n = 223 paired assessments in LTCH s). Across all settings, the kappa for the focusing attention item was good both overall (0.66) in the LTCH setting ( 0.75). Kappa was not estimated for the other three items within the CAM because the proportion of patients across settings within LTCHs with correct responses were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the CAM across settings was high for all four CAM items: evidence of change of mental status from baseline (96 percent) and whether the patient had difficulty focusing attention (91 percent), had disorganized thinking (94 percent), and had altered consciousness (96 percent). Percent agreement in the LTCH setting was similarly high for the four CAM items ( 98 percent, 93 percent, 96 percent, and 95 percent, respectively). Please refer to Table 2.2.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all CAM items. Mental Status (Depressed Mood) Depression is the most common mental health condition in older adults, yet underrecognized and thus undertreated. Existing data show that depressed mood is relatively common in patients and residents receiving PAC serv ices. The PAC PRD found that about 9 percent of individuals in PAC were classified as likely to have depression.77 The prevalence varied from a low of 7 percent of beneficiaries in SNFs to a high of 11 percent of patients in IRFs.78 Almost half of nursing home residents in the United States with 76 Shi, Q., Warren, L., Saposnik, G., & Macdermid, J. C. (2013). Confus ion assessment method: A systematic review and meta - analysis of diagnostic accuracy. Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment , 9, 1359 -1370. https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S49520 77 This estimate is based on patient responses to a question about being sad in the two weeks before the assessment interview in a study of patient/residents in the PAC PRD (Gage et al., 2012a). If they responded \"often\" or \"always,\" they were considered to have depression. 78 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012a. 41 an active diagnosis of depression at the time of admission are not receiving psychiatric treatment (medication or psychological therapy) for the condition.79 Older adults with depression may exhibit different symptoms than younger adults, including fatigue, insomnia, irritable mood, confusion, and lack of focus.80 Some medications and medical conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer, may also cause depressive symptoms in older adults.26 Diagnosis and treatment of depression can lead to significant improvement of symptoms, as measured on depression assessment scales. Depressive symptoms improve in 60 to 80 percent of elderly patients taking an antidepressant medication.81 Psychosocial t reatments of depression in older adults have been shown to be more effective than no treatment, according to self-rated and clinician -rated measures of depression.82 Assessments of the signs and symptoms of depression help PAC providers better understand t he needs of their patients and residents by prompting further evaluation (i.e., to establish a diagnosis of depression); elucidating the patient's or resident's ability to participate in therapies for conditions other than depression during their stay; and identifying appropriate ongoing treatment and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of depression among PAC patients and residents supports clinical decision making, early clinical intervention, person-centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate health information. Standardized Data Elements to Assess Depressed Mood CMS has identified the Patient Health Questionnaire -2 to 9 (PHQ -2 to 9) data elements for standardized assessment of depressed mood. Patient Health Questionnaire -2 to 9 (PHQ -2 to 9) The PHQ-2 to 9 data elements use a summed -item s coring approach to first screen for signs and symptoms of depressed mood in patients and residents by assessing the two cardinal criteria for depression: depressed mood and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure).83 At least one of the two must be present for a determination of probable depression, which signals the need for continued assessment of the additional seven PHQ symptoms. The interview is concluded if a respondent screens negative for the first two symptoms. Relevance to LTCHs Major depressive disorder is common in LTCH patients, with a prevalence of 8.2 percent for LTCHs, as assessed in the PAC PRD.84 In addition to quality of life detriments associated with depression, the somatic, cognitive, and emotional symptoms of depression have important implications in the LTCH setting. Depression is associated with increased symptoms of comorbid conditions and 79 Ulbricht, C. M., Rothschild, A. J., Hunnicutt, J. N., & Lapane, K. L. (2017).

Cognitive effects may interfere with patients' ability to evaluate and communicate their care preferences. The affective and emotional effects of depression can contribute to social isolation from staff, other patients, and family members. Finally, because other treatments and medications can cause depressive symptoms, the assessment of depressive symptoms may identify undesirable side effects, and this information can inform treatment decision -making. Screening for the signs and symptoms of depression using the PHQ -2 and following up with the full PHQ -9 for those with a positive screen would provide important information about the need for specialty providers and specialty care, care planning, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs. 85 Un\u00fctzer, J., Patrick, D.

The PHQ-9 data elements, which include the two questions used in the PHQ -2 plus additional items, are in use in MDS. Prior evidence supporting use of PHQ-2 and PHQ -9 The PHQ-2 is a brief, reliable screening tool for assessing signs and symptoms of depression. Among studies conducted in primary care centers with large samples of adults, the PHQ-2 has performed well as both a screening tool for identifying depression and an assessment of depression severity. 87 It has also been shown to be sensitive to changes in a pati ent's mood. Across 15 studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-2 against a recognized gold-standard instrument for the diagnosis of major depression in adults, sensitivity estimates (based on the summed -item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of 3) have varied, ranging between 39 percent and 97 percent (median value = 77 percent); specificity estimates (based on the summed -item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of 3) have been higher and more stable, ranging between 74 percent and 97 percent (median value = 90 percent).88 89 90 91 87 L\u00f6we, B., Kroenke, K., & Gr\u00e4fe, K.

The PHQ-9 was also tested in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes. For the two presence items in the PHQ -2 (little interest in doing things; feeling down, depressed, or hopeless), kappa statistics were almost perfect and ranged from 0.98 to 0.99.103 The PHQ-9 was also found to have agreement with the Modified Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (m -SADS), a gold -standard measure for mood disorder, in residents without severe cognitive impairment (weighted kappa =0.69) and with the Cornell Depression Scale, a gold -stand ard measure for mood disorder, in residents with severe cognitive impairment (correlation =0.63).104 In addition, the Staff Time and Resource Intensity Verification (STRIVE) study , conducted in a national sample of nursing homes by CMS , concluded that the P HQ-9 used in the MDS 3.0 was the \"best measure\" for identifying individuals with higher wage - weighted staff time, defined as the time that nursing home staff spent caring for residents.105 Evidence supporting use of PHQ -2 to 9 from the National Beta Test Assessing depressed mood: The PHQ-2 to 9 was administered to assess depressed mood in the National Beta T est. As a hybrid measure, the PHQ-2 to 9 uses the first two elements (PHQ-2) as a gateway item for the longer PHQ-9. The assessor only administers the ful l PHQ -9 if the initial score on the PHQ-2 passes a threshold indicating possible depression. A patient/resident who did not show signs of depression in the PHQ-2 would not receive the seven additional elements contained in the PHQ -9.

Across settings, 38 percent of patients/residents reported having little interest in doing things and 43 percent reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless at some point in the last 14 days. Among LTCH patients, 44 percent reported having little interest in doing things, and 51 percent reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. For each of these two symptoms, about 1 in 6 LTCH patients had experienced them nearly every day over the past 2 weeks. More than 1 in 4 experienced these symptoms on half or more of the days. More than one in four patients/residents (28 percent) across settings passed the PHQ-2 to 9 threshold based on one or both of these symptoms, and continued to complete the remaining seven data elements. This positive screen rate was higher in the LTCH setting ( 38 percent). Detailed symptom endorsement and frequency for the PHQ -2 to 9 is shown in Appendix C , Table 3.1.1. The average PHQ-2 only score was 2.4 across settings (SD=1.7) and 2.7 (SD = 1.8) in the LTCH setting . The average full PHQ-9 score across settings was 11.9 (SD =5.3), and the average score in the LTCH setting was 13.0 (SD = 5.8) . The PHQ-9 has thresholds to indicate the severity of probable depression.106 Across settings, the largest group s of patients/residents screening positive on the PHQ-2 and continuing on to complete the full PHQ -9 were the mild (31 percent) and moderate (32 percent) severity group; among LTCH patients, the distribution was more even across three severity groups: mild (27 percent), moderate (25 percent), or moderately severe (28 per cent). The mean scores and severity threshold proportions are shown in Table 3.1.1 of Appendix C. Missing data: Overall, there were low rates of missing data for the PHQ-2 to 9. Across all settings, item -level missing data did not exceed 5.2 percent for an y of the items. Similarly, in the LTCH setting, item -level missing data did not exceed 5.5 percent for any of the items. Missing data rates overall were greatest for the moving and speaking slowly item ; however, for the LTCH setting, the poor appetite or overeating item had the greatest amount of missing data. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration . Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 428 assessments in HHA s, 515 in IRFs , 305 in LTCH s, and 479 in S NFs (n=1,727 overall). Among patients/residents who only received the PHQ-2, time to complete was an average of 1.7 minutes (SD=1.1). The average time to complete the PHQ-2 in the LTCH setting was 1.9 minutes (SD = 1.3 ). Among patients receiving the full PHQ -9, the time to complete was an average of 4.0 minutes (SD=1.2). In the LTCH setting, the time to complete the PHQ-9 was 4.1 minutes on average (SD = 1.3 ). Without regard for PHQ -2 versus PHQ-9 stratification, the mood data elements took an average of 2.3 minutes (SD =1.5) to complete across settings, and 2.6 minutes (SD = 1.6 ) in the LTCH setting. Interrater 254 in IRF s, 231 in LTCH s, and 267 in SNF s (n=948 overall). IRR for all symptom presence and frequency items was excellent: kappas ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 overall and from 0. 90 to 1.00 in LTCH s. IRR regarding eligibility for the full PHQ -9 based on PHQ -2 responses was nearly perfect: kappa for whether to continue from the PHQ -2 to the full PHQ -9 was 0.98 across settings and in LTCH s. Finally, for communicative patients/residents who received the full PHQ-9, the IRR for sum of symptom frequencies was nearly perfect (0.96 overall and 0.95 in LTC Hs). Percent agreement was also nearly perfect, ranging from 97 percent to 100 percent overall and 94 percent to 100 percent in LTCH s. For eligibility to complete the full PHQ -9, percent agreement was 99 percent across settings and in LTCH s. For the sum o f symptom frequencies, percent agreement was 95 106 Kroenke, K., Spitzer, R., & Williams, J. (2001). The P HQ-9 validity of a brief depression severity measure.

Please refer to Table 3.1.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all PHQ items. 48 Section 4: Special Services, Treatments, and Interven tions (Including Nutritional Approaches) Some medical conditions require complex clinical care, consisting of special services, treatments, and interventions. The implementation of these interventions typically indicates conditions of a more serious nature and can be life-sustaining. Patients and residents who need them may have few clinical alternatives. Conditions requiring the use of special services, treatments, and interventions can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self -image, and quality of life. Providers should be aware of the patient or resident's clinical needs to plan the provision of these important therapies , ensure the continued appropriateness of care, and support care transitions. The assessment of special services, treatments, and interventions may also help identify resource use intensity by capturing the medical complexity of patients/residents. Standardized Data Elements to Assess for Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions CMS has identified data elements for cross-setting standardization of assessment for special services, treatments, and interventions in the areas of cancer, respiratory, and other treatments, as well as nutritional approaches and high -risk medications. 1.Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) 2.Radiation 3.Oxygen therapy (Intermittent, Continuous, High-concentration oxygen delivery system) 4.Suctioning (Scheduled, As needed) 5.Tracheostomy Care 6.Non-invasive mechanical ventilator (bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]; continuou s p ositive airway [CPAP]) 7.Invasive mechanical ventilator 8.IV medications (antibiotics, anticoagulation, vasoactive medications, 9.

Feeding tube 14.Mechanically a ltered d iet 15.Therapeutic d iet 16.High -risk drug classes: use and indication Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses medications to destroy cancer cells. Receipt of this treatment indicates that a patient has a malignancy (cancer) and therefore has a serious, often life- threatening or life -limiting condition. Both IV and oral chemotherapy have serious side effects, including nausea/vomiting, extreme fatigue, risk of infection (due to a suppressed immune system), anemia, and an increased risk of bleeding (due to low platelet counts). Oral chemotherapy can be as potent as chemotherapy given by IV but can be significantly more convenient and less resource intensive to administer. Because of the toxicity of these agents, special care must be exercised in handling and transporting chemotherapy drugs. IV chemotherapy may be given by peripheral IV but is more commonly 49 given via an indw elling central line, which raises the risk of bloodstream infections. The need for chemotherapy predicts resource intensity, both because of the complexity of administering these potent, because of toxic drug combinations following specific protocols , and because of what the need for chemotherapy signals about the patient's underlying medical condition. Furthermore, the resource intensity of IV chemotherapy is higher than for oral chemotherapy, as the protocols for administration and the care of the central line (if present) require significant resources. Relevance to LTCHs In one study of inpatient survival in four LTCH settings, which reviewed approximately 300 medical records, the prevalence of malignancy was 16 percent. 107 Given the significant burden of malignancy in LTCH patients, the resource intensity of administering chemotherapy, and the side effects and potential complications of these highly-toxic medications, assessing whether the patient is receiving Chemotherapy would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, and resource use in LTCHs.

The MDS data element does not assess the route of chemotherapy. 107 D'Amico, J. E. D., Donnelly, H. K., Mutlu, G. M., Feinglass, J., Jovanovic, B. D., & Ndukwu, I. M. (2003).

CHEST Journal, 124(3), 1039-1045. 50 Prior evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) An IV Chemotherapy data element was found to be feasible for cross-setting use in the PAC PRD.108 In nursing homes, a checkbox for chemotherapy during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.109 Evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) from the National Beta Test Assessing Chemotherapy: One item assessed whether c hemotherapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow-up items assessed whether the c hemotherapy was administered intravenous ly, oral ly, or by an other route. In the National Beta Test, the data elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in IRF s, LTCH s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, the overwhelming majority of patients/residents (99 percent) did not receive c hemotherapy. In the LTCH specifically, only two patients (zero percent after rounding) had chemotherapy treatment noted. More -detailed rates of c hemotherapy implementation across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.1.1. Missing data: Overall, rates of missing responses for the Chemotherapy items were very low. Across all settings, missingness did not exceed 0.7 percent for each of the four items. In the LTCH setting , missingness was 0. 2 percent for each of the four items. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Chemotherapy items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: The IRR was excellent for the Chemotherapy data element as measured by percent agreement of paired raters (n =882 paired assessments across settings; n =203 paired assessments in LTCH ). Kappas were not estimated for the Chemotherapy sub -elements because the proportion of patients and residents receiving chemotherapy was out of range for stable kappa estimates. Percent agreement was perfect (100 percent) for all four Chemotherapy items across settings and in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 4.1.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Chemotherapy items. Radiation Radiation is a type of cancer treatment that uses high -energy radiation to shrink tumors and kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. However, it can also damage normal cells, leading to side effects such as fatigue, skin irritation or damage, hair loss , nausea, and delayed side effects such as fibrosis (scar tissue formation), damage to the bowels if radiation was delivered to the abdominal region, memory loss, and, infrequently, a second cancer due to radiation exposure. Radiation is a mainstay of cancer treatment; about half to two-thirds of all patients with cancer receive radiation therapy at some point in their 108 Gage, B, Constantine, R, Aggarwal, J, Morley, M, Kurlantzick, VG, Bernard, S, ...Ehrlich-Jones, L.

Research Triangle Park, NC: RTI International. 2012. treatment course.110 The indications range from early -stage cancer treated with curative intent to palliative radiation therapy, such as to tr eat metastatic cancer; tumors that are pressing on the spine or growing within bones, causing severe pain; or shrinking a tumor near the esophagus, which can inhibit swallowing. There are many types of radiation, such as external -beam radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy that is delivered from sources placed inside or on the body), and systemic radiation therapy (in which the patient swallows or receives an injection of a radioactive substance). Relevance to LTCHs As mentioned in the discussion of Chemotherapy, one study of inpatient survival in four LTCH settings found that the prevalence of malignancy was 16 percent. 111 Radiation is an important therapy for particular types of cancer , and the resource utilization is high ; frequent rad iation sessions are required, often daily for a period of several weeks. Assessing whether a patient is receiving radiation therapy is important to determine resource utilization . LTCH patients will need to be transported to and from radiation treatments, as well as monitored and treated for side effects after receiving this intervention. Therefore, assessing whether the patient is receiving radiation would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, and resource use in LTCHs.

Across settings, only three patients/residents ( one in SNF, two in HHA; 0 percent after rounding) received radiation. Detailed radiation data are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.2.1. 110 Yamada, Y.

Across all settings, missingness was 0.7 percent. Similarly, in the LTCH setting , missingness was 0.2 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 i n LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the Radiation item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1). and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 i n IRF s, 203 in and 256 in SNF s (n=882 ). Kappas are not reported for the Radiation data element because its proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the Radiation data element was perfect, both across settings and in the LTCH specifically. Please refer to Table 4.2.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Radiation items. Oxygen Therapy (Intermittent, Continuous, High-C oncentration O xygen Delivery S ystem) Oxygen therapy provides a patient/resident with supplemental oxygen when medical conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, severe asthma) prevent the patient or resident from adequately oxygenating their bloodstream. Oxygen administration is a resource- intensive intervention, as it requires specialized equipment: a reliable source of oxygen, various delivery systems (e.g., oxygen concentrator, liquid oxygen containers, and high-pressure systems), and the patient interface (e.g., nasal cannula, various types of masks). Accessories are also required (regulators, filters, tubing, etc.). The equipment is generally the same for both sub-elements of this data element (continuous vs. intermittent) . The main differences between deliv ering oxygen intermittently versus continuously are the severity of the underlying illness (which often requires more hours per day of oxygen therapy) and the bedside nursing care to set up the oxygen delivery system if the patient is unable (whether physi cally or cognitively) to do so independently. Relevance to LTCHs In a small study of LTCH patients, the prevalence of respiratory failure was 45 percent, so continuous oxygen therapy is likely a part of the treatment plan for many LTCH patients. 113 Although continuous and intermittent oxygen therapy both require resources ( medical equipment, clinical monitoring, and staff resources), distinguishing between oxygen delivered intermittently and continuously provides information on the severity of the underlying illness (which is related to the number of hours of oxygen therapy per day) and the level of monitoring and bedside care required. Assessing whether a patient is receiving oxygen therapy would provide important information for care planning, clinical deci sion making, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs. 113 D'Amico e t al., 2003. 53 Data Element for the Assessment of Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions: Oxygen Therapy O0110.

Oxygen Therapy C2. Continuous C3. Intermittent C4. High -concentration Current use Oxygen t herapy is currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received oxygen therapy while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident has received oxygen therapy while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess the type of oxygen therapy. Prior evidence supporting use of Oxygen Therapy (Continuous, Intermittent, High -Concentration Oxygen D elivery S ystem) A related data element on high -concentration oxygen use (FiO2> 40 percent) was u sed and found feasible for cross-setting use in the PAC PRD. 114 In nursing homes, a checkbox for oxygen therapy during the last 5 days was shown to have reliability ranging from 0.93 to 0.96 (kappas) in the national MDS 3.0 test.115 Evidence supporting use of Oxygen Therapy from the National Beta Test Assessing Oxygen Therapy: One item assessed whether o xygen t herapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow-up items assessed therapy type: intermittent, c ontinuous, and use of a h igh-concentration d elivery system. In the National Beta T est, the data element Oxygen Therapy (Intermittent, Continuous, High -Concentration Delivery System) w as administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, one in five patients/residents (20 percent), received o xygen t herapy . Oxygen therapy was more common in the LTCH setting, with nearly half (44 percent) indicating o xygen t herapy. Across settings, the most common type of o xygen t herapy was intermittent t herapy (14 percent). Only 6 percent of patients/residents had c ontinuous t herapy, and 1 percent of patients/residents had a high-concentration delivery system, respectively. This pattern was similar in the LTCH setting, where intermittent therapy was the most common ( 37 percent). Continuous therapy ( 5 percent) and high- concentration delivery ( 6 percent) were less common. Detailed oxygen therapy implementation data are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.3.1. 114 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 115 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 54 Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Oxygen Therapy items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was less than 1.8 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the Oxygen Therapy data element was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1). The a verage time to complete the data element in the LTCH setting was 0.25 minutes (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). T he kappa for implementation of o xygen t herapy was substantial/good both overall (0.82) and slightly higher in the LTCH setting (0.86) . The k appa for the intermittent t herapy sub - element was 0.81 overall and 0. 82 in the LTCH setting, and the kappa for the continuous therapy sub - element was 0.55 overall and 0.35 in the LTCH setting. Kappas are not reported for the high-concentration therapy sub -element because its proportions were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the data elements was excellent/almost perfect. Across settings, percent agreement ranged from 93 to 99 percent. Percent agreement in the LTCH setting was also excellent/almost perfect , ranging from 92 to 97 percent . Please refer to Table 4.3.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all oxygen therapy items. Suctio ning (Scheduled, As Needed) Suctioning is used to clear secretions from the airway when a person cannot clear those secretions on his or her own for a variety of reasons, including excess production of secretions from a pulmonary infectious process or neur ological deficits that inhibit the ability to cough, swallow, and so on. Suction is done by aspirating secretions through a catheter connected to a suction source. Types of suctioning include oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning; nasotracheal sucti oning; and through artificial airway such as a tracheostomy tube. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning are a key part of many patients' care plans, both to prevent the accumulation of secretions that can lead to aspiration pneumonias (a common condition in patients with inadequate gag reflexes) and to relieve obstructions from mucus plugging during an acute or chronic respiratory infection, which often lead to desaturations and increased respiratory effort. Suctioning can be done on a scheduled basis, if the patient is judged to clinically benefit from regular interventions , or can be done as needed, such as when secretions become so prominent that gurgling or choking is noted, or a sudden desaturation occurs from a mucus plug. As sucti oning is generally performed by a care provider rather than independently, this intervention can be quite resource intensive if it occurs every hour, for example, rather than once a shift. It also signifies an underlying medical condition that prevents pat ients from clearing their secretions effectively, which also means they need increased nursing care more generally (such as after a stroke or during an acute respiratory infection). Relevance to LTCHs Suctioning clears excessive airway sections in LTCH pat ients, which not only improves patient comfort but also improves oxygenation and serves a preventive purpose, in that excess secretions can be aspirated and cause aspiration pneumonia. Pneumonia itself is also a cause of excess secretions and is particularly common in the LTCH setting. The reported annual incidence of pneumonia in long-term care residents ranges from 99 to 912 per 1,000 persons, with a median reported incidence of 365 per 1,000 persons. Furthermore, between 9 percent and 51 percent of patients acquiring pneumonia in long-term care facilities are transferred to acute hospitals, representing worsening in clinical status. 116 Pneumonia is one of several reasons patients may not be able to handle their secretions. In a small study of inpatient 116 Muder, R. R. (1998). Pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities: epidemiology, etiology, management, and prevention. American Journal of Medicine, 105(4) , 319-330. 55 survival in LTCHs, the prevalence of pneumonia among LTCH patients was 13 percent , the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was 13 percent, and the prevalence of a primary cerebral insult was 8 percent.117 Each of these conditions may requi re frequent suctioning as part of the patient care routine, while taking care to minimize airway trauma and thereby increase the production of secretions. Finally, suctioning of excess secretions is important in patients with tracheostomies to ensure the tracheostomy remains unobstructed and the patient can adequately oxygenate. Assessing whether Suctioning is being performed for a patient would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

Suctioning D2. Scheduled D3. As Needed Current use Suctioning is currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received suctioning while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received suctioning while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess whether the suctioning is scheduled or as needed. Prior evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) In the PAC PRD, suctioning was assessed as part of the Trach Tube with Suctioning data element, which evaluated whether patient s or residents had a tracheostomy tube or needed suctioning. This related data element was found feasible for cross-setting use in the PAC PRD. 118 In nursing homes, a checkbox for suctioning during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.119 Evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) from the National Beta Test Assessing Suctioning: One item assessed whether suctioning was provided during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow -up items assessed therapy type: scheduled or as needed. In the National Beta Test, the data element Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in IRF s, and 1,087 s in SNFs (n =2,926 overall). Across settings, most patients/residents (99 percent) did not have s uctioning noted, and those that did noted \" as needed \" suctioning (1 percent). Suctioning was more common in the LTCH sett ing (5 117 D'Amico et al., 2003. 118 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 119 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 56 percent) , where it was also most often noted \"a s needed \" (5 percent), but 1 percent were noted as \"scheduled. \" Detailed s uctioning findings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.4.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses f or the Suctioning items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness for any Suctioning item was less than 1.8 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Suctioning items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). The IRR was excellent for the Suctioning data element , as measured by percent agreement of paired raters. Kappas were not estimated for the Suctioning data element because the proportion of patients and residents receiving suctioning was out of range for stable kappa estimates. Percent agreement for the data elements ranged from 98 to 99 percent across settings and in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 4.4.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all suctioning items. Tracheostomy Care A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure that consists of making a direct airway opening (tracheostomy) into the trachea (windpipe). Tracheostomies are created primarily to bypass an obstructed upper airway; in chronic cases, to enable the removal of secretions from the airway; and to deliver oxygen to the patient's lungs. For example, some indications for tracheostomy include a need for long -term ventilation (such as those in a persistent vegetative state or those who require long -term ventilator weaning but are alert and oriented); tumors of the upper airway; severe neck, mouth, or chest wall injuries; degenerative neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord injuries; and airway burns. Generally, suctioning is necessary to ensure that the tracheostomy is clear of secretions, which can inhibit successful oxygenation. Often, individuals with tracheostomies also receive supplemental oxygenation. The presence of a tracheostomy, permanent or temporary, warrants careful monitoring and immediate intervention if the tracheostomy becomes occluded or , in the case of a temporary tracheostomy, if the devices used become dislodged. For patients with a tracheostomy, tracheostomy care, which primarily consists of cleaning , dressing changes, and replacement of the tracheostomy cannula (tube), is a critical part of their care plans. Regular cleaning is important to prevent infection, such as pneumonia, and to prevent any occlusions , which create the risk of inadequate oxygenation. Although in rare cases, the presence of a tracheostomy is not associated with increased care demands (and in some of those instances, the care of the tracheostomy is performed by the patient), in general , the presence of such a device is associated with increased patient risk, and clinical care services will necessarily include close monitoring to ensure that no life-threatening events occur because of the tracheostomy. Relevance to LTCHs Although individuals with tracheostomies represent only three percent of LTCH patients overall, having a tra cheostomy is the clinical characteristic most strongly associated with discharge to an LTCH among Medicare beneficiaries being discharged from acute care settings. 120 Further, patients with tracheostomies are at relatively high risk of hospital-acquired infections or other complications, and require close monitoring to ensure that their tracheostomy is open and unobstructed, enabling the patient 120 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.

Washington, DC: Author. http://www.medpac.gov/docs/default-source/reports/June04_Entire_Report.pdf . 57 to breathe or be mechanically ventilated through the tracheostomy. Among patients with tracheostomies, total episod e spending was lower for those who used an LTCH than for those who did not, making assessment of this clinical characteristic very important in the LTCH setting to facilitate cross -setting comparisons of case mix, resource intensity, and total Medicare spending per episode of care.121 Assessing whether Tracheostomy Care is being performed for a patient would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

Prior evidence supporting use of Tracheostomy Care In nursing homes, a checkbox for tracheostomy care during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.122 Evidence supporting use of Tracheos tomy Care from the National Beta Test Assessing Tracheostomy Care: One item assessed whether tracheostomy care was performed during the assessment period. In the National Beta T est, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA setting s, 762 in IRF s, in LTCH s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, 1 percent of patients received t racheostomy care. In the LTCH setting specifically, tracheostomy care was more common (5 percent). Detail ed tracheostomy care findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.5.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Tracheostomy Care item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent. Similarly, in the LTCH setting , missingness was 0.4 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration.

Percent agreement for the data element was 100 percent across settings and 99 percent in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 4.5.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Tracheostomy Care item. Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure [BiPAP], Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [CPAP]) BiPAP and CPAP are respiratory support devices that prevent the airways from closing by delivering slightly pressurized air through a mask continuously or via electronic cycling throughout the breathing cycle. A BiPAP/CPAP mask supports breathing by providing positive airway pressure that prevents airways from collapsing during the respiratory cycle . Non -invasive mechanical ventilation differs from invasive mechanical ventilation because the interface with the patient is a mask rather than an endotracheal tube in the windpipe. BiPAP and CPAP have a variety of clinical indications, from obstructive sl eep apnea, to acute respiratory infections, to progressive neuromuscular decline leading to respiratory failure. The key difference between BiPAP and CPAP is that BiPAP, as the name implies, delivers two different pressure levels (a higher pressure to support inhalation and a lower pressure to prevent the airways from collapsing during exhalation ), whereas CPAP delivers the same amount of positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. These interventions signify underlying medical conditions in the patient who requires their use. Relevance to LTCHs LTCH patients have a high prevalence of respiratory insufficiency, which may be managed by invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In a survey of respiratory care directors at 17 long-term acute-care hospitals in Massachusetts and Rhode Island with more than 2,000 beds (unpublished data), of 180 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time (2003), 24 percent received non-invasive ventilation. Of those, 74 percent had COPD, 20 pe rcent had restrictive processes (including neuromuscular diseases), and 6 percent had other conditions. 123 Assessment of n on-invasive m echanical ventilation, including CPAP and BiPAP, would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, a nd resource use in LTCHs. Particularly when used in the context of acute illness or progressive respiratory decline, additional staff (e.g., respiratory therapists) are required to monitor and adjust the CPAP and BiPAP settings , and the patient may require more nursing resources.

The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item asking whether the patient has non-invasive ventilator (B iPAP, CPAP) treatment at admission. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received non-invasive mechanical ventilation while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received non -invasive mechanical ventilation while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS data elements do not assess whether the non -invasive mechanical ventilation is BiPAP or CPAP. Prior evidence supporting use of Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) A checkbox item for n on-invasive v entilation (CPAP) was tested in the PAC PRD and was found to be feasible for cross-setting use.124 Evidence supporting use of Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) from the National Beta Test Assessing Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilation: One item assessed whether a n on-invasive mechanical v entilator was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow -up items assessed whether this n on-invasive m echanical v entilator was Bi PAP or CPAP . In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in IRF LTCH s, and 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, 5 percent of assessments noted use of a n on-invasive mechanical v entilator . In the LTCH setting specifically, a n on-invasive mechanical v entilator was more common, noted in 9 percent of assessments. With regard to specific n on-invasive m echanical v entilator, 2 percent of assessments across settings noted BiPAP. BiPAP was noted more commonly in the LTCH (7 percent). CPAP was noted slightly more often across settings (3 percent). In the LTCH, CPAP was less common (2 percent). Detailed findings regarding non -invasive mechanical ventilators are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.7.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilator items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1.2 percent. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was 0.7 percent or less. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Non - invasive Mechanical Ventilator items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in I RFs, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Most kappas for the Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilator items are not reported because their proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimates. However, the kappa for whether a non-invasive m echanical ventilator was noted was 0.77 in LTCH. Percent agreement for the data elements ranged from 97 to 98 percent across settings and from 96 to 98 percent in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 4.7.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement s tatistics for all Non - invasive Mechanical Ventilator items across settings. Invasive Mechanical Ventilator Invasive mechanical ventilator includes any type of electrically or pneumatically powered closed - system mechanical support devices to ensure adequate ventilation of patients who are unable to support their own respiration. Patients receiving closed -system ventilation include those receiving ventilation via a tracheostomy and patients with an endotracheal tube (i.e., nasally or orally intubated). Depend ing on the 124 Gage, Constantine , et al., 2012. 60 patient's underlying diagnosis, clinical condition, and prognosis, the patient may not be a candidate for weaning off the ventilator. For instance, certain medical conditions such as lung infections are expected to improve or resolve to a point where patient s can support their own respiration, whereas chronic neurodegenerative diseases are likely to progress over time and therefore preclude patient s from weaning and eventually having the tube removed. Ventilation in this manner is a resource-int ensive therapy associated with life-threatening conditions in which the patient would not survive without invasive ventilation . However, ventilator use has inherent risks requiring close monitoring, and failure to adequately care for ventilator -dependent patient s can lead to death, pneumonia, sepsis, and other iatrogenic events . Mechanical ventilation further signifies the complexity of the patient's underlying medical and/or surgical condition. Relevance to LTCHs Invasive mechanical ventilator is common in the LTCH setting. About 22 percent of LTCH patients in the PAC PRD used an invasive mechanical ventilator, compared with less than 1 percent of patients and residents in home health and SNFs.125 Of note, invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with h igh daily and aggregate costs. In a national study of mechanical ventilation use in the United States, the estimated aggregated costs were $27 billion, 12 percent of all hospital costs.126 The daily incremental cost of mechanical ventilation for intensive care unit (ICU) patients was estimated at between $600 and $1,500 per day. Although this study was of acute care hospitals, the costliness of this intervention can be extrapolated to LTCHs as well. Assessment of whether the patient is on i nvasive mechanical v entilator would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in IRF s, 448 in LTCH s, and 1, 087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, only 13 assessments ( 0 percent after rounding) noted use of an invasive m echanical v entilator. Twelve of these 13 patients were in the LTCH setting (the other was in an IRF) yielding a total of 3 percent indicating use of an invasive m echanical v entilator in the LTCH. Detailed i nvasive m echanical v entilator findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.6.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent for the item. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was 0.4 per cent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). The IRR was excellent for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator data element, as measured by percent agreement of paired raters. The kappa was not estimated for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator data element because the proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate.

IV Medications (Antibiotics, Anticoagulation, Vasoactive Medications, Other) IV medications are drugs or biologics that are administered via intravenous push (bolus), single, intermittent, or continuous infusion through a tube placed into the vein, including one that allows the fluids to enter the circulation through one of the larger heart vessels or more peripherally through a vein, e.g., commonly referred to as central midline, or peripheral ports. This data element is important to collect, as IV medications are more resource intensive to administer than oral medications and signify a higher patient complexity (and often higher severity of illness). The clinical indications for each of the sub types of IV medications (antibiotics, anticoagulants, vasoactive, and other) are very different. IV antibiotics are used for severe infections when (1 ) the bioavailability of the oral form of the medication would be inadequate to kill the pathogen, (2) an oral form of the medication does not exist , or (3) the patient is unable to take the medication by mouth. Because of growing concern about antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic stewardship initiatives are aimed at increasing evidence-based antibiotic prescribing and decreasing antibiotic overuse. Although data on which antibiotic s are used would not be collected, collecting data on the use of IV antibiotics overall in the four PAC settings would assist with monitoring the implementation of evidence -based prescribing guidelines moving forward. 127 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 128 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 62 IV anticoagulants refer to anti -clotting medications (\"blood thinners\") often used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and other thromboembolic complications. IV anticoagulants are commonly used in patients with limited mobility (either chronically or acutely, in the post-operative setting), who are therefore at risk of deep vein thrombosis, or patients with certain cardiac arrhythmias , such as atrial fibrillation. When a patient is on an IV anticoagulant, they require frequent monitoring of laboratory values to ensure appropriate anticoagulation status. Vasoactive medications affect blood pressure and/or heart rate by causing dilation or constricting of the blood vessels. Vasoactive medications are used to treat septic shock, cardiac arrest, and other cardiac function issues. Continuous infusions of vasoactive medications require close observation of the patient, including constant monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, in order to respond quickly to any changes. Relevance to LTCHs Intravenous me dications are a common and important part of clinical care for patients in LTCHs. For instance, in a study of LTCHs, 41 percent of patients had an active infection, defined by receiving antibiotics and having a high white blood cell count , fever, or sepsis, with a mortality of 78 percent. 129 Furthermore, in the same study, 18 percent of LTCH patients were requiring vasopressors or had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35 percent or NYHA class III/IV, with a mortality of 80.4 percent. The indications, risks, and benefits of each of these classes of IV medications are distinct, making it important to assess each separately in PAC; k nowing not only whether patients are receiving IV medication but also the type of medication will be helpful in the LTC H setting. Given the clinical complexity of patients in LTCHs, it is likely that they are receiving one or more medications intravenously. Assessing IV m edications, including the type of medications, would provide important information for care planning, c linical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item at admission asking whether the patient is receiving any IV m edications. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received IV medications while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received IV medications while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess the type of IV medications. Prior evidence supporting use of IV Medications A similar but more focused data element, IV Vasoactive Medications, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. This data element was specific to the IV administration of vasoactive drugs (e.g., pressors, dilators, continuous medication for pulmonary edema) that increase or decrease blood pressure and/or heart rate. In nursing homes, a checkbox for IV medications during the last 5 days was shown to have reliability of 0.95 (kappa) in the national MDS 3.0 test. 130 Evidence supporting use of IV Medications from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Medications : One item assessed whether IV m edications were noted during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow-up items assessed specific types of IV medications (antibiotics, a nticoagulation, or other). In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, one in four assess ments (25 percent) had IV m edications noted. For specific types of IV medication, 16 percent had a ntibiotics noted, 8 percent had a nticoagulation noted, and 7 percent had other IV m edications noted. IV medications were much more common in the LTCH (77 percent). For the specific types of IV m edication, 64 percent had antibiotics noted, 17 percent had anticoagulation noted, and 20 percent had other IV m edications noted. Detailed IV m edications findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.8.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the IV Medications items. Across all settings - that is, when looking across respondent from all PAC providers -- missingness was le ss than 0.9 percent. In the LTCH setting, missingness for the IV Medication items did not exceed 1.6 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHAs , 457 in IRFs , LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the IV Medications items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs, 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). With the exception of the a nticoagulation sub -element, the IRRs were fair to good for the IV Medications data element , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters. The kappa for the overarching IV Medications data element was 0.70 across settings and 0.68 in the LTCH setting. The kappa for the Antibiotics sub -element was 0.88 across settings and 0.84 in the LTCH setting . The kappa for the Anticoagulation sub -element was 0.13 both across settings and in the LTCH setting , placing it in the \"slight/poor\" range. Consultation with assessors suggested that this low kappa was likely caused by inconsistent interpretation of the coding instructions, which will be improved in the future with more -comprehensive guidance. The kappa for the Other sub -element was 0.46 both across settings and in the LTCH setting. Percent agreement for the data element ranged from 88 to 96 percent across settings and from 79 to 93 percent in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 4.8.2 in Appendix C for IRR statistics for all IV Medications items. 130 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 64 Transfusions Transfusions are the administration of blood or blood products (e.g., platelets, synthetic blood products) into the bloodstream. Blood transfusions are highly protocolized, with multiple safety checks and monitoring required during and after the infusion to avoid adverse events. Coordination with the facility's blood bank is necessary, as well as documentation by clinical staff to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the need for transfusions signifies underlying patient complexity that is likely to require additional nursing staff and care coordination, and affects planning for transitions of care, as transfusions are not performed in all PAC settings. Receipt of transfusions is also important to assess for case mix adjustment because of the need for added resources and to the extent that receipt of transfusions indicates a more medically complex patient. Relevance to LTCHs In the clinically complex LTCH population, there may be many underlying reasons that a patient requires a transfusion of blood or blood products. In fact, unpublished data show that transfusions are the second -most common LTCH procedure, occurring in 18.4 percent of LTCH admissions from 2007 to 2012. 131 Transfusions are resource-intensive, requiring coordination among the blood bank and bedside care staff, and close monitoring is necessary given the incidence of adverse reactions, which may range from mild to severe. Assessing whether the patient requires t ransfusions would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 1,087 in SNF (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, only 14 patient/resident assessments ( 0 percent after rounding) noted t ransfusions. Eight of these 14 patients were 131 Einav, L., Finkelstein, A., & Mahoney, N. (2017).

Detailed t ransfusion findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4. 9.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Transfusions item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.0 percent for the item. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was 1.8 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the Transfusion item was 0.22 minutes ov erall (SD = 0.1). and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the Transfusions data element because the proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the Transfusions data element was perfect overall (100 percent) and nearly perfect in the LTCH (99 percent). Please refer to Table 4.9.2 in Appendix C for setting-s pecific percent agreement statistics for the Transfusion item. Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) Dialysis is used primarily in the case of end -stage kidney failure. It is a process by which waste, salt, and excess water are removed from the body and key electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate are maintained at a safe level. Hemodialysis is conducted using an artificial kidney, an external hemodialyzer, which filters the blood. During peritoneal dialysis, the dialysate is injected into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity, excess fluid and waste products are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysate, and the fluid is then drained. Hemodialysis sessions are typically performed three times a week and last up to 4 hours each. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed continuously overnight or intermittently during the day. Both forms of dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) are resource intensive, not only during the actual dialysis process but before, during, and after . Patients who need and undergo dialysis procedures are at high risk for physiologic and hemodynamic instability from fluid shifts and electrolyte disturbances, as well as infections that can lead to sepsis. Further, patients receiving hemodialysis are often transported to a different facility, or, at a minimum, to a different part of the hospital if the LTCH is adjacent to a dialysis center. Close monitoring for fluid shifts, blood pressure abnormalities, and other adverse effects is required before , during, and after each dialysis session. Nursing staff typically perform peritoneal dialysis at the bedside, and, as with hemodialysis, close monitoring is required. Relevance to LTCHs In the LTCH setting, 15 percent of patients in one study were hemodialysis -dependent, with a mortality of 77.8 percent. 133 Importantly, receipt of dialysis has implications for discharge destination of LTCH patients. In a study of 206 dialysis patients admitted to an LTCH, 63 (31 percent) were discharged to home, 11 (5.4 percent) died or transferred to hospice, 81 (40 percent) went to a nursing home, and 49 (24 percent) were re- admitted to an acute hospital. Mortality after re -admission to the acute hospital was high, at 32 percent.134 Furthermore, 12.2 percent of LTCH patients have hemodialysis indicated on their admission assessment , and 10.4 percent have hemodialysis indicated on their discharge assessment.135 Given how common this resource -intensive service is in the LTCH setting, it is important to assess for 133 D'Amico et al., 2003. 134 Thakar, Quate -Operacz, Leonard, & Eckman, 2010. 135 Dalton, K., Kandilov, A.

Hemodialysis J3. Peritoneal dialysis Current use The data element Dialysis is currently assessed in the LCDS and MDS. The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item asking whether the patient receives dialysis as part of the patient's treatment plan. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received dialysis while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received dialysis while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS data elements do not assess the type of dialysis. Prior evidence supporting use of Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) In nursing homes, a data element assessing dialysis in the past 5 days was tested in the national MDS 3.0 test and shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappas of 0.91 to 0.93). 136 Evidence supporting use of Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) from the National Beta Test Assessing Dialysis: One item assessed whether d ialysis was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow -up items assessed whether the d ialysis was hemodialysis or p eritoneal dialysis . In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs setting, 762 in IRF s, LTCH s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, 5 percent of assessments noted use of dialysis. In the LTCH setting specifically, d ialysis was more common (15 percent) . With regard to specific forms of d ialysis, the vast majority of noted d ialysis was h emodialysi s. Only seven assessments overall and two in LTCH (both 0 percent after rounding) indicated p eritoneal dialysis. Detailed findings regarding d ialysis are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.10.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Dialysis items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1 percent. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was less than 1.8 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to c omplete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Dialysis item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). 136 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 67 Interrat er reliability: IRR was for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Most kappas are not reported for the Dialysis data element because the proportions both overall and for each setting were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. However, kappas were calculable for the d ialysis indicator and for hemodialysis in the LTCH, and both were excellent (0.92 and 0.90 , respectively). Percent agreement for d ialysis was nearly perfect overall and in the LTCH specifically (98 percent). The same was true for the two types of dialysis across settings (98 percent and 100 percent, respectively) and in the LTCH setting (97 percent and 100 percent, respectively). Please refer to Table 4.10.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for all Dialysis items. IV Access (Peripheral IV, Midline, Central line) IV access refers to a catheter inserted into a vein for a variety of clinical reasons, including long - term medication treatment; hemodialysis ; large volumes of blood or fluid; frequent access for blood samples; IV fluid administration; total parenteral nutrition; or, in some in stances, the measurement of central venous pressure. The sub -elements associated with IV a ccess distinguish between peripheral access and central access. In addition, different types of central access are specified. The rationale for distinguishing between a peripheral IV and central IV access is that central lines confer higher risks associated with life- threatening events such as pulmonary embolism, infection, and bleeding. Patients with central lines, including those peripherally inserted or who have sub cutaneous central line \"port\" access, always require vigilant nursing care to ensure patency of the lines and , importantly , to ensure that such invasive lines are free from any potentially life -threatening events such as infection, air embolism, and bleedi ng from an open lumen. Relevance to LTCHs Clinically complex patients in the LTCH setting are likely to be receiving medications or nutrition intravenously. Assessing IV a ccess would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

Evidence supporting use of IV Access from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Access: One item assessed whether IV a ccess was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, four follow -up items assessed whether the IV was a p eripheral l ine, midline c atheter, central l ine, or o ther form of IV. In the National Beta Test, the data elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, 24 percent of assessments noted use of IV a ccess. The rate in the LTCH setting was much higher (91 percent). For the specific type of IV ac cess noted, a c entral l ine was most common across settings (13 percent) , followed closely by p eripheral IV (11 percent). Midline c atheter (2 percent) and o ther (1 percent) were less common. In the LTCH setting, a c entral l ine was also most common (54 percent), followed by peripheral IV (40 percent), midline catheter (13 percent), and o ther IV (3 percent). Detailed findings regarding IV a ccess are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.11.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the IV Access items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1.4 percent. In the LTCH setting specifically, missingness was less than 2.2 percent. The low rates of missing data indicate feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the IV Access item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in LTCH s (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). IRR was excellent across settings for the IV Access item (kappa =0.90) and the peripheral and c entral types of access (kappa=0.81 and kappa =0.85, respectively ). Similarly, IRR was substantial/good the LTCH specifically for p eripheral (kappa =0.77), midline (kappa = 0.75), and c entral access (kappa =0.78). Percent agreement for the data element was almost perfect. Across settings, percent agreement was 96 percent for IV a ccess generally and the types of IV access (96 to 98 percent). In the LTCH specifically, percent agreement was 99 percent for the general IV Access item, and the subsequent types were also excellent or almost perfect ( 89 to 95 percent ). Please refer to Table 4.11.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all IV Access items. Parenteral/IV Feeding Patients can be fed parenterally (i.e., intravenously) to bypass the usual process of eating and digestion. The person receives nutritional formulas containing salts, glucose, amino acids, lipids, and added vitamins. Parenteral/IV feeding is often used after surgery, when feeding by mouth or digestive system is not possible, when a patient's digestive system cannot absorb nutrients because of chronic disease, or if a patient's nutritional requirement cannot be met by tube feeding and supplementation. The need for parenteral/IV feeding indicates a clinical complexity that prevents the patient from meeting nutritional needs enterally. Overall, parenteral/IV feeding is a form of nutritional support that can be used to prevent or address malnutrition.137 Without treatment, malnutrition c an lead to a host of negative consequences, including a decline in health, poorer physical and cognitive function, increased use of health care services, earlier institutionalization, and increased risk of death. 138 137 National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care (UK).

The Permane nte Journal , 9(3), 38-41. https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/05-056 69 Malnutrition is prevalent among older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study showed that 58.3 percent of hospitalized patients diagnosed with malnutrition in the U.S. in 2010 were more than 65 years of age.139 Additionally, as mentioned above, parenteral/IV feeding is often us ed to provide nutrition for patients with specific diseases. For example, parenteral/IV feeding can be used for individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, a condition that is common in older adults.140 Parenteral/IV feeding is more resource intensive than other forms of nutrition, as it often involves monitoring of blood chemistries and maintenance of a central line. Therefore, assessing a patient's need for parenteral feeding is important for care planning and case mix adjustment. In addition to the risks associated with central and peripheral IV access, parenteral/IV feeding is associated with significant risks, such as embolism and sepsis. Relevance to LTCHs The need for parenteral/IV feeding in LTCHs is common: 8.5 percent of LTCH patients have total pa renteral nutrition (TPN) indicated on their admission assessment , and 5.2 percent have TPN indicated on their discharge assessment.141 As mentioned above, the need for TPN indicates a level of clinical complexity that prevents patients from meeting their nutritional needs enterally.142 Assessing parenteral/IV feeding would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

The MDS first assesses whether the patient received parenter al/IV feeding while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 7 days, and then whether the patient received parent eral/IV feeding while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding A similar data element, Total Parenteral Nutrition, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. Parent eral/IV feeding in the last 5 days was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappa of 0.95) in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes.143 Evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding from the National Beta Test Assessing Parenteral/IV Feeding: The Parenteral/IV Feeding data element was included in the National Beta Test. This data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, only 1 percent of assessments indicated parenteral/IV feeding. In the LTCH setting, 4 percent of assessments noted parenteral/IV feeding. Detailed p arenteral/IV feeding implementation is shown in Appendix C, Table 5.1.1, fo r all four settings. Missing data: Low levels of missing data (1.3 percent for this data element across settings and in LTCHs) inform the feasibility of administering this data element across PAC provider settings. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the Parenteral/IV Feeding item was 0.22 minutes overall and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting . Interrater reliability: IRR was , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the parenteral/IV feeding data element because its proportion was too low for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement was perfect at 100 percent for the Parenteral/IV feeding data element in the four settings combined and close to perfect at 99 percent in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 5.1.2 in Appendix C for setting -specific percent agreement statistics for the Paren teral/IV Feeding item. Feeding Tube The Feeding Tube data element refers to enteral nutrition, which is the delivery of a nutritionally complete diet containing protein, carbohydrate, fat, water, minerals, and vitamins directly into the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum. It is typically used for patients/residents who have a functional gastrointestinal tract but are unable to maintain an adequate or safe oral intake. This data element assesses whether the patient/resident received enteral nutrition during the a ssessment period. Enteral nutrition is a form of nutritional support that can be used to prevent or address malnutrition. 144 Without treatment, malnutrition can lead to a host of negative consequences, including a decline in health, poorer physical and cogni tive function, increased use of health care services, earlier institutionalization, and increased risk of death.145 Malnutrition is prevalent among older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study showed that 58.3 percent of hospitalized patients diagnosed with malnutrition in the U.S. in 2010 were over 65 years of age.146 Additionally, enteral nutrition can be used to provide nutrition for patients 143 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 144 National Alliance for Infusion Therapy and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Public Policy Committee and Board of Directors.

For example, tube feeding can be used for individuals with stroke147 and those with head and neck cancer,148 conditions that are common in older adults.149 Assessing use of a feeding tube can inform resource use, care planning, and care transitions. Relevance to LTCHs Patients with severe malnutrition are at higher risk for a variety of complications.150 In the LTCH setting, there are a variety of reasons why patients may not be able to eat orally (including clinical or cognitive status). Most patients admitted to acute care hospitals experience deterioration of their nutritiona l status during their hospital stay, making assessment of nutritional status and method of feeding if unable to eat orally very important in the LTCH setting.151 Additionally, this information is useful for care planning, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs, as enteral nutrition is most often used in medically complex patients and is a relatively resource-intensive feeding method, requiring frequent monitoring and administration.

Nutritional Approaches Check all of the following nutritional approaches that apply on admission. 1. On Admission Check all that apply B. Feeding tube (e.g., nasogastric or abdominal (PEG)) Current use A version of the Feeding Tube data element is currently assessed in three existing PAC assessments. The data element Enteral Nutrition is currently collected in the OASIS, with a question asking whether the patient is receiving enteral nutrition at home. I n the IRF -PAI, a Swallowing Status data element captures some information related to enteral nutrition through the response option \"Tube/Parenteral Feeding.\" The MDS data element, Feeding T ube - Nasogastric or A bdominal (PEG), first assesses whether a resident used a feeding tube while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 7 days and then whether the resident used a feeding tube while a resident and within the last 7 days. 147 Corrigan, M.

This data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 762 in s, and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, 3 percent of assessments indicated use of a feeding tube. In the LTCH setting, 8 percent of assessments noted use of a feeding tube. Detailed feeding tube implementation is shown in Appendix C, Table 5.2.1, for all four settings. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing data for the Feeding Tube data element both overall (1.3 percent) and in the LTCH setting ( 1.1 percent). Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The average time to complete the Feeding Tube item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the LTCH setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the Feeding Tube data element because its proportion was too low for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement was 100 percent across settings and close to perfect at 98 percent in the LTCH setting . Please refer to Table 5.2.2 in Appendix C for setting -specific percent agreement statistics for the Feeding Tube item. Mechanically Altered Diet A mechanically altered diet is one that is specifically prepared to alter the texture or consistency of food to facilitate oral intake. Examples include soft solids, pur eed foods, ground meat, and thickened liquids. A mechanically altered diet should not automatically be considered a therapeutic diet. The provision of a mechanically altered diet is resource intensive, as it signifies difficulty swallowing/eating safely (dysphagia). Often, nurses are required to slowly feed patients meals consisting of a mechanically altered diet rather than having them eat independently. Dysphagia is frequently associated with various health conditions, including nervous system -related diseases (e.g., cerebral palsy and Parkinson's disease); stroke; head injury; head, neck, and esophagus cancers; head, neck, and chest injuries; and dementia. 153 In the absence of treatment, swallowing disorders can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, poor overall health, chronic lung disease, choking, and death.154 Other consequences can include lack of interest and enjoyment related to eating or drinking, and embarrassme nt or isolation tied to social situations involving eating.155 Dysphagia is highly prevalent in older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study of a geriatric population living independently found that the lifetime prevalence of a swallow ing disorder was 38 percent, and current prevalence of a swallowing disorder was 33 percent.156 Additionally, increasing age has been shown to be associated with a higher likelihood of swallowing problems in the 152 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 153 National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

A study examining burden among inpatients diagnosed with dysphagia found that individuals with dysphagia had a 33.2 percent higher likelihood of being discharged to a PAC facili ty than patients without dysphagia.160 Assessing whether a patient requires a mechanically altered diet is important in ensuring patient safety and can inform care planning, care transitions, and resource utilization. Relevance to LTCHs Patients with severe malnutrition are at higher risk for a variety of complications.161 In the LTCH setting, there are a variety of reasons why patients may have impairments related to oral feedings, including clinical or cognitive status. Specifically, 15 percent to 26 percent of residents in LTCHs require a pureed diet.162 Most patients admitted to acute care hospitals experience deterioration of their nutritional status during their hospital stay,163 making assessment of nutritional status and method of feeding if unable to eat a regular diet very important in the LTCH setting. In a Canadian study involving 93 LTCH patients, a diversified , texture -modified food diet improved patients' nutritional status and slowed weight loss in older adults with dysphagia.164 Low interest in , and reduced consumption of, pureed food may increase the risk of malnutrition and dehydration and decrease the quality of life for older adults with dysphagia.165 Assessing whether an LTCH patient requires a mechanically altered diet would provide importan t information for care planning, care transitions, patient safety, and resource use in LTCHs. 157 Bhattacharyya, N.

Mechanically altered diet - r equ ire change in texture of food or liquids (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids) Current use Mechanically Altered Diet is currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while not a resident and within the last 7 days, and then whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Mechanically Altered Diet In the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes, the Mechanically Altered Diet data element was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappas from 0.90 to 0.96).166 Evidence su pporting use of Mechanically Altered Diet from the National Beta Test Assessing Mechanically Altered Diet: The Mechanically Altered Diet data element was included in the National Beta Test. The data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, 10 percent of assessments indicated m echanically a ltered d iet. In the LTCH setting, 14 percent of assessments noted m echanically altered d iet. Detailed rates are shown in Appendix C, Table 5.3.1 , for all four settings. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing data for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element both overall (1.2 percent) and in the LTCH setting ( 1.1 percent ). Time to complete: Time to c omplete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs , 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554, overall). The average time to complete the Mechanically Altered Diet item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.25 minutes in LTCH s (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 236 in IRF s, 203 in LTCH s, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). IRR for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element was substantial/good both overall and in the LTCH specifically (kappa = 0.65 across settings and 0.69 in the LTCH setting). Percent agreement for the data element was 93 percent across settings and 92 percent in the LTCH setting. Please refer to Table 5.3.2 in Appendix C for setting -specific kappa and percent agreement statistics for the Mechanically Altered Diet item. Therapeutic Diet A therapeutic diet is a diet intervention ordered by a health care practitioner as part of the treatment for a disease or clinical condition manifesting an altered nutritional status. to the purpose of a therapeutic diet is to eliminate, decrease, or increase certain substances in the diet (e.g., sodium or 166 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 75 potassium). Therapeutic diets can include low cholesterol, renal, diabetic, and low salt diets,167 the latter of which are most commonly used.168 Certain conditions, including diabetes,169 chronic kidney disease,170 hypertension,171 and heart disease172 are highly prevalent among older adults who may receive services in a PAC setting. For example, the percentage of adults with diabetes is 25.2 percent among individuals 65 years of age or older.173 Additionally, 61.7 percent of adults 65 years of age or older have hypertension.174 These conditions may be treated with a therapeutic diet. The Therapeutic Diet data element is important to collect in the LTCH setting to distinguish therapeutic diet from various other nutritional approaches. It is less resource intensive from the bedside nursing perspective but does signify one or more underlying clinical conditions that preclude the patient from eating a regular d iet. Communication among PAC settings on whether a patient is receiving a particular therapeutic diet is critical to ensure safe transitions of care. Relevance to LTCHs Data are lacking on the prevalence of therapeutic diets among patients in LTCHs. However, given the clinical complexity of these patients and the multiple comorbidities, it is likely that therapeutic diets are common. Assessing whether a patient requires a therapeutic d iet would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs.

High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication Most patients receiving PAC services depend on short - and long-term medications to manage their medical conditions. However, medications are a leading cause of adverse events. A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that 31 percent of adverse events in 2008 among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries were related to medication.176 Adverse drug events (ADEs) may be caused by medication errors such as drug omissions, errors in dosage, and errors in dosi ng frequency.177 In addition, approximately half of all hospital -related medication errors and 20 percent of ADEs occur during transitions within, admission to, transfer to, or discharge from a hospital.178 ADEs are 175 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 176 Levinson, D.

The rate of emergency department visits for ADEs is three times higher among adults 65 years of age and older than that among those younger than age 65.179 Some classes of drugs are associated with more risk than others.180 The six medication class response options in the High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication data element are anticoagulants, antiplatelets , hypoglycemics (including insulin) , opioids , These drug classes are considered hig h-risk because of the adverse effects that may result from use. In particular, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are associated with bleeding risk;181 hypoglycemics are associated with fluid retention, heart failure, and lactic acidosis;182 opioids are associated with misuse;183 antipsychotics are associated with fractures and strokes;184 and antimicrobials, the category of medications that includes antibiotics, are associated with various adverse events, such as central nervous systems effects and gastrointestinal intolerance.185 Moreover, some medications in the six drug classes in this group of data elements are included in the 201 9 Updated Beers Criteria\u00ae list as potentially inappropriate medications for use in older adults.186 Although a complet e medication list should record several important attributes of each medication (e.g., dosage, route, stop date), recording an indication for the drug is crucial.187 Relevance to LTCHs Many patients treated in the LTCH setting have one or more conditions that require treatment with a medication in a high -risk drug class. In a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries in LTCHs in 2014, about 6 percent experienced some type of medication -related adverse event over a 1-month period, ranging in severity from a longer LTCH stay to death ; 31 percent of all adverse events were related to medication.188 In the same study, 12 percent of patients in IRFs experienced a medication -related \"temporary harm event\" during the 1-month period, defined as requiri ng medical intervention but not causing lasting harm; about half of all temporary harm events were 179 Shehab, N., Lovegrove, M.

The LCDS does not currently contain data elements that document the use of any medication or the indication or reason for the patient taking the medication. The standardized assessment of high -risk medication use and ensuring that indications are noted in the medical record are important steps toward overall medication safety within and between PAC provider settings.

However, the use of similar data elements in the MDS 3.0 speak to t he feasibility of collecting data on patient medications in a standardized assessment. 189 Ibid. 190 Ibid. 79 Evidence supporting use of High-Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication from the National Beta Test Assessing High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication: As part of the assessment of the medication reconciliation process, the National Beta Test included a data element that assesses whether the patient/resident was taking any medications in each of the six high -risk drug classes, and for each medication, wh ether there was a corresponding indication noted. The six classes are anticoagulants, antiplatelets (excluding low -dose aspirin), hypoglycemics (including insulin), opioids, antipsychotics, and antimicrobials (excluding topicals). In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 627 patients/residents in HHAs , 769 in s, and 1,096 in SNF s (n=2,951 overall). In the four settings combined, the percent age of patients/residents taking medications in each of the six classes ranged from 12 percent ( antipsychotics) to 51 percent ( opioids). In the LTCH setting, these percentages ranged from 14 percent (a ntipsychotics) to 73 percent (antimicrobials ). The presence of indications for noted medications in the various classes ranged from 45 percent ( anticoagulants and antiplatelets) to 92 percent ( opioids) in the four settings combined, and in the LTCH setting , the indication percentages ranged from 10 percent ( antiplatelets ) to 90 percent ( opioids). The overall and setting -specific findings for each high -risk drug class are detailed in Table 6.1.1 in Appendix C. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing responses for the medication use items. In the four settings combined, missingness rates did not exceed 4.2 percent for any of th e six drug class items. Similarly, in the LTCH setting , missingness rates did not exceed 3.1 percent for the six drug class items. Missing data was also very low for indication items. Missingness rates did not exceed 1.2 percent in the four settings combined and did not exceed 1.4 percent in the LTCH setting. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 406 assessments in HHA s, 446 in IRFs , 271 in LTCH s, and 421 in SNFs (n=1,544 overall). Average time to complete the H igh-Risk Drug Classes: U se and Indication item was approximately 1.0 minute (SD =0.6 minutes) in the four settings combined and 1.1 minutes (SD =0.6 minutes) in the LTCH setting. Interrater reliabi lity: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs , 240 in IRF s, 212 in LTCH s, and 261 in SNF s (n=900 overall). Kappas were not estimated within or across settings for items assessing antipsychotic use and indication of opioids and, in the LTCH setting, indication of antiplatelets because the proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimates. In the four settings combined, IRRs across settings ranged from substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect (kappas=0.72 to 0.89) for medication use items . In the LTCH setting, kappas for medication use were generally higher and in the excellent/almost perfect range (kappas = 0.83 to 0.97). For indication items, kappas ranged from substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect, both in the four settings combi ned (kappa =0.65 to 0.87) and in the LTCH setting ( 0.70 to 0.88). Percent agreement was very high for the medication use items, both in the four settings combined (92 to 95 percent) and in the LTCH setting ( 94 to 99 percent ). Similarly, percent agreement was generally high for indication items, both in the four settings combined (82 to 94 percent) and in the LTCH setting (85 to 100 percent). More -detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 6.1.2. 80 Section 5: Medical Conditions and Co -Morbidities Pain Interference Pain is a highly prevalent medical condition in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis of 2016 National Health Interview Study data found that 8 percent of Americans report high -impact chronic pain, that is, pain that limits life or work activities on most days o r every day in the past 6 months.191 Pain in older adults occurs in conjunction with many acute and chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis, leg pain during the night, cancer and associated treatment, neuralgia from diabetes mellitus, infections such as herpes zoster/shingles, and peripheral vascular disease.192 Conditions causing pain in older adults may be associated with depression,193 sleep disturbance,194 and lower participation in rehabilitation activities. 195 A substantial percentage of older adults receiving services in a PAC setting experience pain. According to assessment testing performed in the PAC PRD, more than half of patients in the PAC settings reported having experienced \"pain or hurting at any time during the last two days ,\" with 55 percent in LTCHs, 65 percent in SNFs, 68 per cent in IRFs, and 70 percent of patients in HHA s responding \"yes\" to this question.196 According to the 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the prevalence of moderate-to -severe pain197 among residents of skilled and non-skilled nursing facilities was 22 percent, and the prevalence of persistent pain \u2014defined as the same or worse pain over time\u2014was 65 percent.198 Pain in older adults can be treated with medications, complementary and alternative approaches, or physical therapy.199 Treatment of pain in older adu lts may be complicated by factors such as dementia; 191 Dahlhamer, J., Lucas, J., Zelaya, C., S., DeBar, L., . . .

From the 2018 National Beta Test, 77 percent of patients in the LTCH setting reported having \"pain or hurt ing.\" Of those who reported pain, 68 percent experienced pain \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Pain among LTCH patients can interfere with rehabilitation and has potential secondary complications associated with immobility, such as skin breakdown and infection . The potential effects of pain on patient health are myriad, and it is critical to assess pain during hospitalization and after discharge. Assessing pain in LTCH patients during their stay can lead to appropriate treatment and improved quality of life, reduce complications associated with immobility such as skin breakdown and infection, and facilitate rehabilitation efforts and return ing to community settings. Pain assessment post - discharge can also be used to plan appropriate treatment and may re duce readmissions. 200 Molton, I. R., & Terrill, A. L. (2014). Overview of persistent pain in older adults.

The OASIS assesses the frequency of pain interfering with patient's activity or movement. A pain assessment interview is included in MDS and has questions on whether pain has made it hard for the resident to sleep at night and whether pain has limited day -to-day activities. Prior evidence supporting use of Pain Interference data elements Two interview -based data elements, pain effect on sleep and pain effect on activities, were included in the PAC PRD testing of IRR and showed strong IRR (weighted kappas of 0.836 and 0.789, respectively).202 202 Gage, B., Smith, L., et al., 2012. 83 In a national test to develop and validate the MDS 3.0, two items (pain made it hard to sleep, pain limited day -to-day activities) were validated for measuring the effect of pain on function.203 Evidence supporting use of Pain from the National Beta Test A ssessing Pain: In the National Beta Test, three pain interference data elements were assessed : Effect of Pain on Sleep, Pain Interference with Rehabilitation Therapies (If Applicable), and Pain Interference with Daily Activities. A total of 489 patients/residents in HHAs, 618 in IRF s, 375 in LTCHs , and 872 in SNF s (n=2,354 overall) reported experiencing any pain and were administered the three pa in interference items. Setting -specific frequencies are shown in Appendix C, Table 7.1.1. Across settings, among the 78 percent of patients/residents who reported experiencing any pain, pain interfered with sleep more often than \" rarely \" for two of three patients/residents (65 percent); 37 percent of patients/residents with pain had pain that made it difficult to sleep \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" In the LTCH setting, among the 77 percent of patients who reported experiencing any pain, pain interfered with sleep more than rarely for two of three patients (71 percent); 46 percent of patients with pain in the LTCH experienced pain that interfered with sleep \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Among the patients/residents who reported expe riencing any pain, most had been offered rehabilitation therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), both across settings (89 percent) and in the LTCH (81 percent). A cross settings, among these patients/residents, 73 percent reported that pain \"rarely \" interfered with rehabilitation. Within the LTCH setting, 62 percent of these patients reported that pain rarely interfered with rehabilitation; about one in five (21 percent) of LTCH patients who had pain and were offered therapy had pain that interfered with therapy \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Across settings, among those who reported experiencing any pain, 55 percent of patients/residents reported pain limiting their daily activities (not including rehabilitation) more often than \"rarely or not at all.\" About one in three of these patients/residents (33 percent) had pain that limited activities \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" In the LTCH setting, 58 percent of patients with pain had pain that interfered more often t han \"rarely. \" About two of five LTCH patients with pain (39 percent) had pain that limited activities \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly .\" Missing data: Overall, there were low rates of missing data for pain data elements. Across all settings, missing data did not exceed 2.4 percent for any data element. Similarly, in the LTCH setting, missing data did not exceed 2.7 percent for any data element. Missing data rates, overall and in the LTCH setting, were greatest for the data elements asking about how often daily activities were limited because of pain and how often rehab was limited because of pain. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: The length of time to administer the pain data elements was examined as another indicator of feasibility among 440 patients/residents in HHA s, 533 in IRF s, 321 in LTCH s, and 483 in SNF s (n=1,777 overall). Across settings, the average time to complete the three interference items was 1.3 minutes (SD=0.6). In the LTCH setting, time to complete was similar , at 1.4 minutes (SD = 0.6). Interrater reliability: IRR was assessed for 197 patients/residents in HHAs , 256 in IRF s, 232 in LTCH s, and 268 in SNF s (n=953 overall). IRR statistics were generally ex cellent/perfect, indicating high levels of agreement in responses to the data elements across assessment staff. For the pain interference data elements across settings, kappas were excellent/almost perfect, with values of either 0.97 or 0.98. The same was true in the LTCH setting, where excellent/almost perfect kappas ranged from 0.98 to 0.99. Percent agreement was similarly high, with nearly perfect or perfect agreement (98 percent for all 203 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008a. 84 items in the four settings combined and from 98 to 99 percent in th e LTCH ). More -detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 7.1.2. 85 Section 6: Impairments Hearing and Vision Impairments Hearing and vision impairments are common conditions that, if unaddressed, affect patients' and residents' activities of daily living, communication, physical functioning, rehabilitation outcomes, and overall quality of life. Sensory limitations can lead to confusion in new settings, increase isolation, contribute to mood disorders, and impede accurate assessment of other medical conditions , such as cognition. Hearing impairments may cause difficulty in communication of important information concerning the patient's or resident's condition, preferences, and care transitions; vision impairments have been associated with increased risk of falls. Both types of impairment can also interfere with comprehension of and adherence to discharge plans. Onset of hearing and vision impairments can be gradual, so accurate screening tools and follow-up evaluations are essential to determining which patients and residents need hearing - or vision-specific medical attention or assistive devices, and to ensuring that person -directed care plans are developed to accommodate patient s' and residents ' needs during PAC and at discharge. Assessments pertaining to sensory status aid PAC providers in understanding the needs of their patients and residents by establishing a diagnosis of hearing or vision impairment, elucidating the patients' and residents' ability and willingness to participa te in treatments or use assistive devices during their stay s, and identifying appropriate ongoing therapy and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of vision impairment among PAC patients and residents supports clinical decisi on making, early clinical intervention, person-centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate health information. Standardized Data Elements to Assess Hearing and Vision Impairments CMS has identified two data elements for cross-setting standardized assessment of hearing and vision impairment. 1.Hearing 2.Vision Hearing Hearing impairment is one of the most common complaints in adults over the age of 60 and is a major contributor to di fficulties in speech comprehension.204 Causes of hearing loss can include noise, earwax or fluid buildup, a punctured ear drum, viruses and bacteria, certain health conditions (e.g., stroke, cardiac conditions, and brain injury), medications, heredity, and a ging.205 Age-related hearing loss is caused by presbycusis and occurs gradually over time as an individual ages. It is typically hereditary and usually affects both ears. Hearing impairment in older adults has been associated with a myriad of 204 Peelle, J. E., Troiani, V., Grossman, M., & Wingfield, A. (2011).

About 51 percent of nursing facility patients and residents are estimated to have moderate to severe hearing impairment. 213 Data from the PAC PRD suggest that severe hearing impairment affects 1 to 2 percent of Medicare FFS beneficiaries in the four types of PAC.214 Among older adults more generally, reports on the prevalence of hearing loss vary. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has stated that one -third of people between ages 65 and 74 have hearing loss and roughly half of those older than 75 are hearing-impaired.215 Additionally, a study found that two- thirds of individuals aged 70 years or older have bilateral hearing loss and approximately three -quarters have hearing loss in at least one ear.216 Assessing hearing impairment is critical to improving patient outcomes, safety, and quality of life. In addition, assessment can inform future care planning and care transitions. Relevance to LTCHs In LTCHs, 1.7 percent of pa tients have severe hearing impairment.217 Assessing LTCH patients' ability to hear is important for patient quality of life and safety while hospitalized and post-discharge. Assessment of hearing also facilitates care planning for the inpatient stay and post -discharge care. 206 Contrera, K. J., Wallhagen, M. I., Mamo, S. K., Oh, E. S., & Lin, F. R. (2016).

Data Element for the Assessment of Impairments: Hearing Current use The Hearing data element is currently collected in the MDS, and is assessed with the use of a hearing aid, if applicable. Prior evidence supporting use of Hearing The Hearing data element tested in the PAC PRD includes one question regarding hearing ability, which showed high reliability across PAC settings (unweighted kappa=0.78). The MDS 3.0 version of the Hearing data element also had almost perfect agreement in the MDS 3.0 national test in nursing homes (weighted kappas=0.94 and 0.89).218 Evidence supporting use of Hearing from the National Beta Test Assessing Hearing: In the National Beta T est, a Hearing assessment item (with hearing aids, when applicable) was administered to 643 patients/residents in HHAs, 783 in IRF s, s, and 1,141 in SNF s (n=3,065 overall). Overall, 74 percent of patients/residents had adequate hearing, 17 percent had minimal difficulty hearing, 8 percent had moderate difficulty hearing, and 1 percent were highly impaired. In the LTCH setting, 81 percent of patients had adequate hearing, 13 percent had minimal difficulty hearing, 4 percent had mode rate difficulty hearing , and 1 percent were highly impaired. See Appendix C, Table 8.1.1 , for setting -specific response frequencies for the Hearing data element. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing responses for the Hearing data element both overall (0.3 percent ) and in the LTCH setting (0.4 percent ), indicating feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was assessed among 396 patients/residents in HHAs , 499 in IRFs , s, and 456 in SNF s (n=1,652 overall). Across all settings and in the LTCH setting specifically, the mean time to complete the Hearing item was 0 .4 minutes (SD=0.2 minutes). Interrater reliability: IRR was assessed for the Hearing item for 197 patients/residents in HHAs , 258 in IRF s, 237 in LTCH s, and 268 in SNF s (n=960 overall). Across all settings, kappa for the Hearing item was substantial/good (0.65). In the LTCH setting, kappa for the Hearing item also was moderate (0.58). Percent agreement was high for the Hearing item both across settings (84 percent) and in the LTCH setting ( 84 percent). More-detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 8.1.2. 218 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. B0200. Hearing Enter Code Ability to hear (with hearing aid or hearing appliances if normally used) 0.Adequate - no difficulty in normal conversation, social interaction, listening to TV 1.Minimal difficulty - difficulty in some environments (e.g., when person sp eaks softly or setting is noisy) 2.Moderate difficulty - speaker has to increase volume and speak distinctly 3.Highly impaired - absence of useful hearing88 Vision Visual impairment can be caused by not only age -related diseases (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, cataract s, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) but also nearsightedness, farsightedness, loss of near vision with age, and/or untreated disease.219 In addition to conditions affecting the eye itself, visual deficits can be caused by other conditions , such as stroke an d traumatic brain injury. Visual impairment in older adults has been associated with depression and anxiety,220 lower cognitive function,221 and poorer quality of life.222 The PAC PRD study found that between 1 and 3 percent of Medicare FFS beneficiaries among the four types of PAC providers had the most extreme category of visual impairment assessed, \"No vision or object identification questionable.\" 223 Although most patients and residents in the PAC settings do not exhibit severely impaired vision, visual impairment affects a substantial proportion of older adults and is predicted to increase substantially over time. A study examining visual impairment among adults in the United States found that in 2015, among the 3.22 million persons in the United States who were visually impaired, the largest proportions comprised those in older age categories: 80 years of age and older (50 percent), 70 -79 years (24 percent), and 60- 69 years (16 percent).224 By 2050, the proportion of adults with visual impairment will inc rease to 64 percent among individuals aged 80 years and older. 225 Assessing visual impairment is critical to improving patient outcomes, safety, and quality of life. Additionally, assessment can inform future care planning and care transitions. Relevance to LTCHs In LTCHs studied in the PAC PRD, 2.8 percent of patients had severe vision impairment.226 Assessing visual impairment in LTCHs is important for patient quality of life, as well as care planning for LTCH discharge. Additionally, assessment of this information is useful for ensuring safety in the LTCH setting, as impaired vision increases the risk of falls. 227 Assessing vision in a patient would provide important information for patient safety, communication, care planning, care transitions, and resource use in LTCHs. 219 Cimarolli, V.

Vision Enter Code Ability to see in adequate light (with glasses or other visual appliances) 0.Adequate - sees fine detail, such as regular print in newspapers/books 1.Impaired - sees large print, but not regular print in newspapers/books 2.Moderately impaired - limited vision; not able to see newspaper headlines but can identify objects 3.Highly impaired - object identification in question, but eyes appear to follow objects 4.Severely impaired - no vision or sees only light, colors , or shapes; eyes do not ap pear to follow objects Current use Vision is currently assessed in the OASIS and MDS, with corrective lenses when applicable. Vision is assessed in OASIS with three response options ranging from 0 (normal vision) to 2 (severely impaired). The Vision data element (Ability to See in Adequate Light) in the MDS contains five response options ranging from 0 (adequate) to 4 (severely impaired). Prior evidence supporting use of Vision The MDS 3.0 Vision data element has been shown to perform reliably in screeni ng for vision impairment (weighted kappa =0.917) in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes.228 The Vision data element is also linked to performance with readily available materials (i.e., newspaper). In addition, the Vision data element was tested in the PAC PRD assessment. The PAC PRD found substantial agreement for IRR across settings for this data element (kappa of 0.74). 229 Evidence supporting use of Vision from the National Beta Test Assessing Vision: In the National Beta Test, the Vision assessment item (with corrective lenses when applicable) was administered to 643 patients/residents in HHAs, 783 in IRF s, s, and 1,141 in SNF s (n=3,065 overall). Overall, 78 percent of patients/residents had adequate vision, 16 percent had impaired vision , and 6 percent had moderately to severely impaired vision. In the LTCH setting, 76 percent of patients/residents had adequate vision, 16 percent had impaired vision and 8 percent had moderately to severely impaired vision. Setting -specific frequencies are shown in Appendix C, Table 9.2.1. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing responses for the Vision item both overall (0.6 percent) and in the LTCH setting (0.8 percent), indicating feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was assessed among 396 patients/residents in HHAs , 499 in IRFs , s, and 456 in SNF s (n=1,652 overall). Across all settings, the mean time to complete the Vision item was 0.3 minutes (SD =0.2 minutes ). In the LTCH setting, me an time to complete the Vision item was 0. 4 minutes (SD = 0 .2 minutes) . Interrater reliability: IRR was assessed for the Vision item for 197 patients/residents in HHAs , 258 in IRF s, 237 in LTCH s, and 268 in SNF s (n=960). Across all settings, kappa for the Vision item was moderate (0.56). In the LTCH setting, kappa for the Vision item was also moderate ( 0.47). Percent agreement was high for the Vision item across settings (83 percent). Agreement for the Vision items in the LTCH setting was slightly lower ( 75 percent). More detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 9.2.2. 228 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 229 Gage, Smith, et al., 2012. 90 Section 7: New Category: Social Determinants of Health Standardized Data Elements to Assess for Social Determinants of Health CMS has identified data elements for cross-setting standardization of assessment for seven social determinants of health (SDOH). The data elements are as follows: 4.Interpreter Services 5.Health Liter 7.Social Isolation Race and Ethnicity Relevance to LTCHs The persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care is widely documented, including in PAC settings.230 Although racial and ethnic disparities decrease when social factors are controlled for, they often remain. The root causes of these disparities are not always clear because data on many SDOH are not collected. Measuring SDOH in LTCH settings is an important step to addressing these avoidable differences in healt h outcomes. Collecting data on race and ethnicity supports patient - centered care and informs understanding of patient complexity and risk factors that may affect payment, quality measurement, and care outcomes for LTCHs . Improving how race and ethnicity da ta are collected is an important component of improving quality by identifying and addressing health disparities that affect Medicare beneficiaries. 230 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The data element consists of a single question, which aligns with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) minimum data standards for federal data collection efforts.231 The 1997 OMB Standard lists five minimum categories of race: (1) American Indian or Alaska Native, (2) Asian, (3) Black or African American, (4) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and (5) White. The 1997 231 Office of Management and Budget. (1997, October 30). Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and E thnicity (Notice of Decision).

Retrieved from https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-10-30/pdf/97-28653.pdf 92 OMB Standard also lists two minimum categories of ethnicity: (1) Hispanic or Latino, and (2) Not Hispanic or Latino.232 The current version uses a \"Mark all that apply\" response option. Evidence supporting use of Race and Ethnicity The modification will result in two separate data elements, one for race and one for ethnicity, that will conform with the 2011 HHS Data Standards for person -level data collection and the 1997 OMB Standards. The 2011 HHS Data Standards p ermit the collection of more -detailed information on population groups provided additional categories can be aggregated into the OMB minimum standard set of categories. The 2011 HHS Data Standards require a two -question format when self -identification is used to collect data on race and ethnicity. Large federal surveys, such as the National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, have implemented the 2011 HHS Data Standards. CMS has similarly updated the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, and the Health Insurance Marketplace Application for Health Coverage with the 2011 HHS data standards. Preferred Language and Interpreter Services Releva nce to LTCHs More than 64 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home, and nearly 40 million of those individuals have limited English proficiency (LEP).233 Individuals with LEP have been shown to receive worse care and have poorer health outcomes, including higher readmission rates. 234 Communication with individuals with LEP is an important component of quality health care, which starts by understanding the population in need of language services. Unaddressed language barrie rs between a patient and provider care team negatively affects the ability to identify and address individual medical and non-medical care needs, to convey and understand clinical information, and to convey and understand discharge and follow -up instructio ns, all of which are necessary for providing high-quality care. Understanding the communication assistance needs of residents and patients with LEP, including individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, is critical for ensuring good outcomes.

Accounting for social risk factors in Medicare payment: Identifying social risk factors . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. 93 Current use The preferred language of residents and patients and the need for interpreter services are assessed in two PAC assessment tools. The LCDS and the MDS use the same two data elements to assess preferred language and whether a patient or resident needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with health care staff. The current preferred language data element in LCDS and MDS is open -ended, allowing the patient or resident to identify their preferred language, including American Sign Language. The MDS initially implemented preferred language and interpreter services data elements to assess the needs of SNF residents and patients and inform care planning. For alignment purposes, the LCDS later adopted the same data elements for LTCHs. Evidence supporting use of Pr eferred Language and Interpreter Services The 2009 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on standardizing data for health care quality improvement emphasizes that language and communication needs should be assessed as a standard part of health care delivery and quality improvement strategies. 235 Although the 2011 HHS Primary Language Data Standard recommends a two -part question to assess spoken language, the need to improve the assessment of language preferences and communication needs across PAC settings should be balanced with the provider and patient assessment burden. In addition, preferred spoken language would not allow information to be collected on American Sign Language, as is accounted for by the preferred language and interpreter services data elements currently in the MDS and LCDS. Health Literacy Relevance to LTCHs Similar to language barriers, low health literacy can interfere with communication between the provider and resident or patient and the ability for residents and patients or their caregivers to understand and follow treatment plans, including medication management. Poor health literacy is linked to lower levels of knowledge about health, worse health outcomes, receipt of fewer preventive services, higher medical costs, and higher rates of emergency department use. 236 Data Element for the Assessment of SDOH: Health Literacy B1300.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. 94 Current use A health literacy data element is not currently used in any of the PAC assessment tools. Evidence supporting use of Health Literacy Health literacy is prioritized by Healthy People 2020 as an SDOH.237 NASEM's 2016 report on accounting for social risk factors in Medicare payment considers health literacy an individual risk factor affected by other social risk factors.238 The Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS) question, which assesses reading ability (a primary component of health literacy), tested reasonably well against the 36- item Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), a thoroughly vetted and widely adopted health literacy test, in assessing the likelihood of low health literacy in an adult sample from primary care practices participating in the Vermont Diabetes Information System .239 SILS is publicly available, and shorter and easier to administer than the S -TOFHLA. Research found that a positive result on the SILS demonstrates an increased likelihood that an individual has low health literacy.240 Transportation Relevance to LTCHs Transportation barriers can affect access to needed health care, causing missed appointments, delayed care, and unfilled prescriptions, all of which can have a negative impact on health outcomes.241 Access to transportation for ongoing health care and medication access needs, particularly for those with chronic diseases, is essential to successful chronic disease management. Adopting a data element to collect and analyze information regarding transportation needs across PAC settings will facilitate the connection to programs that can address identified needs.

Evidence supporting use of Transportation The data element uses the Transportation item from the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) tool and is reflective of research on the importance of addressing transportation as a critical SDOH. The national PRAPARE SDOH assessment protocol is developed and owned by the National Association of Community Health Centers, in partnership with the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organization, the Oregon Primary Care Association, and the Institute for Alternative Futures. More information about development of the PRAPARE tool can be found at http://www.nachc.org/research -and-data/prapare . Items in the assessment tool are consistent with Healthy People 2020 priorities and ICD -10 coding.242 Social Isolation Relevance to LTCHs Distinct from loneliness, social isolation refers to an actual or perceived lack of contact with other people, such as living alone or residing in a remote area. 243 Social isolation tends to increase with age, is a risk factor for physical and mental illness, and is a predictor of mortality. 244 PAC providers are well - suited to design and implement programs to increase social engagement of patients and residents while accounting for individual needs and preferences. Adopting a data element to collect and analyze information about social isolation in IRFs and across PAC settings would facilitate the identification of residents and patients who are socially isolated and who may benefit from engagement efforts.
