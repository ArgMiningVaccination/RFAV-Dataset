The vaccines help protect you from serious illness. - COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for everyone age 6 months and older, including those who are pregnant, postpartum, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy. - Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines. Get vaccines when they are recommended. Related Resources Overview [Expand All](#) - COVID-19 is an illness that affects the lungs and breathing. It is caused by a [coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html). Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and trouble breathing. COVID-19 may also cause stomach problems, such as nausea and diarrhea, and a loss of your sense of smell or taste. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. - Yes, you are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated. Vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [recommends](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care)vaccination if you are pregnant, postpartum, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy. Find out how to get a COVID-19 vaccine near you through [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/How-Do-I-Get-a-COVID-19-Vaccine.html). For information about vaccines for children 11 and under, visit the American Academy of Pediatrics website [healthychildren.org](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx). - Yes, studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective. The COVID-19 vaccines can prevent infection, severe illness, and death from COVID-19, including from [new variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html). Before vaccines are given to the public, vaccines go through [many layers of testing and reviews](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html). The COVID-19 vaccines meet strict safety standards required by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines). Millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. Getting a Vaccine [Expand All](#) - There are three COVID-19 vaccines in the United States: Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax. The current Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are called \"bivalent\" or \"updated\" vaccines. These bivalent vaccines protect against the original coronavirus and new variants. Learn more from the CDC about [the different vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html). - A bivalent Pfizer or Moderna vaccine is recommended for everyone, including anyone who is pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding. Learn more from the CDC about [current vaccine recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). - Right now, only one bivalent vaccine dose is recommended for everyone age 6 to 64. More doses are recommended only for certain groups of people: - If you are 65 or older\u2014You can get one extra dose if it has been at least 4 months since your first bivalent vaccine. - If you have a [weakened immune system](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#immunocompromised)\u2014You can get one or more extra doses if it has been at least 2 months since your last bivalent vaccine. There are also different recommendations for children who are 6 months to 5 years old. Learn more from the CDC about [current vaccine recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). - - It's common to feel [side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html)after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. There are different types of COVID-19 vaccines that have varying side effects. Side effects also vary from person to person. Some vaccines may make you feel like you have the flu for a few days. This is normal. It's also normal to have short-term arm pain in the area where you got the shot. If you have a fever or other side effects after getting the vaccine, you can take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief medication. If you are pregnant, the OTC medication acetaminophen is safe to take during pregnancy. If you are worried about your side effects or they last more than a few days, talk with your health care professional. - Yes, you still need a vaccine even if you have had COVID-19 in the past. There is no way to tell how protected you are from COVID-19 after infection. Your level of protection may vary based on how severe your illness was, how long it has been since you were sick, and how old you are. Research shows that the COVID-19 vaccine gives more protection against future illness than the protection you might have after getting the virus. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help prevent you from getting COVID-19 again and strengthen your protection against severe illness. Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Fertility [Expand All](#) - Yes, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. ACOG strongly recommends that all pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19. Getting a vaccine could help both you and your [fetus]. Remember that during pregnancy, you have a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 than people who aren't pregnant. The vaccines are very effective at preventing infection, severe illness, and death from COVID-19. When you get vaccinated, the [antibodies]made by your body may be passed to your fetus. These antibodies may help protect your baby from the virus after birth. How much protection your antibodies may provide is not yet known. [[Infographic: Why Should I Get the COVID-19 Vaccine While I'm Pregnant?]](/womens-health/infographics/why-should-i-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-while-im-pregnant) - Yes, research confirms that COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Scientists have compared the pregnancies of women who have received COVID-19 vaccines and women who have not. The reports show that these women have had similar pregnancy outcomes. Data do not show any safety concerns. If you are pregnant and want to know more about the vaccines, you can talk with your [obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn)]. This conversation is not required to get a vaccine, though it may be helpful. Learn more from the CDC about [COVID-19 vaccines, pregnancy, and breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html). - Yes, ACOG strongly recommends that breastfeeding women get a COVID-19 vaccine. Breastfeeding after vaccination is safe for the baby. There is no need to stop breastfeeding if you want to get a vaccine. When you get vaccinated, the antibodies made by your body may be passed through breast milk and may help protect your child from the virus. - Yes, if you are planning or trying to get pregnant, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility, and a growing amount of data confirms this. You also do not need to delay getting pregnant after you get a vaccine. Learn more from the CDC about [COVID-19 vaccines for people who would like to have a baby](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html). Other Questions [Expand All](#) - A study of nearly 4,000 people found there was a very small, temporary change in [menstrual cycle]length after vaccination. Periods were late by less than 1 day on average and returned to normal within 1 or 2 months. Another study of nearly 10,000 people found a small increase in the chances of heavier bleeding after the first vaccine dose. This returned to normal with the next menstrual period. Menstrual cycles often change a small amount from month to month. Temporary changes can be caused by many factors, including stress, lifestyle changes, and some underlying health conditions. Small changes in cycle length and the amount of bleeding are normal and do not affect health or fertility. More research is needed on this topic and in more diverse groups of people, but the results of this study are reassuring. This is good evidence that any effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on periods is temporary, small, and no cause for concern. - Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine while you have your [menstrual period]. There is no need to reschedule. - There have been reports of COVID-19 vaccines causing swollen lymph nodes in underarms. This is a temporary side effect, but the swelling can make mammograms hard to read correctly. Because of this side effect, routine mammograms may be postponed for 4 to 6 weeks after you get a COVID-19 vaccine. If you have any problems with your breasts or if you are at high risk for breast cancer, you should not delay your mammogram. If you do have a mammogram fewer than 4 to 6 weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, tell the health care staff when you got your vaccine, which type of vaccine you had, and which arm the shot went in. Remember, breast cancer screening is important health care that you should not skip. Read [Mammography and Other Screening Tests for Breast Problems](/womens-health/faqs/mammography-and-other-screening-tests-for-breast-problems)to learn more. - There have been rare reports of temporary inflammation in or around the heart muscle after vaccination with the Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax vaccines. These conditions are called [myocarditis and pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html). These cases have been seen mostly in male teens and young adults. Most patients do well with treatment and quickly feel better. The risk of illness and death from COVID-19 is far greater than the rare risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. The CDC continues to recommend everyone 6 months and older get a COVID-19 vaccine. - COVID-19 vaccines [work in different ways](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html), and all of them are proven to be safe. It is important to know that: - The vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. None of the vaccines uses the live virus that causes COVID-19. - The vaccines do not affect your genes or DNA. - There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility. ACOG recommends vaccination for anyone who may consider getting pregnant in the future.
