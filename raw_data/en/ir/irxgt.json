Introduction 1.1. Description of the herbal substanc e(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof Herbal substance(s) The herbal substance consists of whole or cut dried leaf of Mentha x piperita L. Peppermint is a perennial plant native to Europe, highly aromatic, which may grow as tall as 90 cm. According to the European Pharmacopoeia, it contai ns a minimum of 12 ml/kg of essential oil for the whole drug and a minimum of 9 ml/kg of essential oil for the cut drug (Ph. Eur. Ref.: 0406). Mentha x piperita L. is believed to be a hybrid of spearmint ( Mentha spicata L) and water mint ( Mentha aquatica L.) (Murray et al., 1972), and belongs to the family Labiatae (Lamiaceae). Chemical constituents of peppermint leaves The chemical components of peppermint leaves vary with plant maturity, variety, geographical region and processing conditions. The fatty acid composition of the non-polar lipid fracti on of peppermint leaves is dominated by palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids (Mckay, Blumberg, 2006). Various flavonoids are present including luteolin an d acids and small amounts of triterpenes (ESCOP 2003, Julien et al., 1 984, Litvinenko et al., 1975, Croteau and Loomis 1973). In a study of 40 clones of Mentha piperita (Gu\u00e9don et al., 1994), eriocitrin, with a concentration range of 6.6-15.0%, is the dominant phenolic secondary metabolite (mainly flavonoid glycosides), is accompanied by luteolin 7- 0-rutinoside, hesperidin and phenolic acid derivatives such as rosmarinic acid. Chemical composition of the essential oil. Its major constituents are menthol (30-55%) ratio of 1,8-cineole content to limonene content is at minimum 2 (Ph. Eur. Ref.: 0405). Herbal preparation(s) a) Comminuted herbal substance About 75% of the polyphenolic compounds present in the leaves are extracted in an infusion (Mckay, Blumberg 2006). An infusion of dried leaves is reported to contain 21% of the original essential oil (25 mg/l) (Duband et al., 1992), while in another study by Niesel (1992) peppermint leaves shown that 20-25% of the essential oil could be found in the preparation after 10 minutes (tea preparation with boiling water). In a publication of Wi niewski (1962), the content of essential oil determined in Menthae folium (the herbal substance) was 1.5%. In decoctions, using the modified method described in the Suppl II of the Farmakopea Polska (1959) the content of the oil wa s 26.6%. The authors observed that in a case of Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page folium the extraction of essential oil by decoction was not influenced by an addition of emulgators; however, the prolonged heating caused a loss of the oil. Volatiles from aqueous extract of peppermint co mmercial sachets were investigated through gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (GC/FI D) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS). Samples were prepared under similar conditions as in homemade teas. Volatiles were isolated using solid phase extraction method (SPE) with Porapak Q trap followe d by desorption with acetone. The major volatiles were terpenes (275-382 \u00b5g/kg) that reached 89% of the total composition. A total of 16 compounds, among them dodecane, acetoin, acetol, citral, geraniol and octanoic acid have been described for the first time in peppermint tea. These findings could be attributed to the different analytical approach employed, mainly the use of different extraction/p re-concentration techniques. Given the apparently lower proportion of terpenes in the aqueous extract it may be that the chemical properties of the peppermint essential oil are not entirely reproduced with homemade tea (Riachi et al., 2012). b) Tincture (ratio of herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:5), extraction solvent ethanol 45% (V/V) c) Tincture (ratio of herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:5), extraction solvent ethanol 70% (V/V) The European Pharmacopoeia describes the dry extract produced from Peppermint leaf (0406). It contains a minimum 0.5 per cent of rosmarinic acid (C 18H16O8; Mr 360.33) (dry extract), produced from the herbal drug by a suitable procedure using etha nol (30-50 per cent V/V) or water of (Ph. Eur. ref.: 2382). d) Menthae piperita aetheroleum Peppermint oil is obtained by steam distillation from the fresh aerial parts of the flowering plant of Mentha x piperita L. It is a colourless, pale yellow or pale greenish- yellow liquid with a characteristic odour and taste followed by a cold sensation. Major chemical constituents To comply with the European Pharmacopoeia, the ma jor constituents exactly as described previously are: The ratio of 1,8- cineole content to limonene content is at minimum 2 (Ph. Eur. Ref.: 0405). Combinations of herbal substance(s) and/or he rbal preparation(s) including a description of vitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) as ingredients of traditional combination herbal medicinal products assessed, where applicable.

Information on documented medicina l use and historical data from literature Peppermint is widely known to relieve digestive ailm ents, being a popular remedy for at least the last two centuries. It is available in most parts of the world for flavouring, cosmetic and medicinal uses. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 16/101 In Antiquity the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans knew it as flavouring for food as well as for its medical purposes. It was first cultivated in England commercially around 1750. For medicinal effects, the aerial portion of the plant is the most widely used (Murray et al., 1972). At the herbarium of the English botanist John Ray (1628-1705) one of the oldest specimens of hybrid of peppermint (between spearmint ( Mentha spicata L) and water mint ( Mentha aquatica L.) can be found. The English Dictionary of Medicinal and Surgical Knowledge, in 1800, already considered peppermint oil as \"an aromatic stimulant to allay nausea, relieve spasmodic pain to the stomach and the bowels, expel flatus or cover the taste or the quality of gripping effects of other medicine\" (Jones, 1981 cited by Kline et al., 2001) Table 2a: Overview of historical data - peppermint leaves Herbal preparation Documented use / Traditional use Pharmaceutical form Strength, Posology Duration of use Reference Infusion of dried peppermint leaves Tincture (1:5, 45% ethanol) Dyspepsia, flatulence, intestinal colic, biliary disorders Oral use Usually prepared with one or two teaspoons (1.5 to 3.0 g) of the dried leaves per 8 ounces of water, 3 times daily 2 to 3 ml, three times daily Bradley 1992 British Herbal Compendium Infusion of dried peppermint leaves Tincture (1:5, 45% ethanol) Used in the symptomatic treatment of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia, flatulence and gastritis Oral use Adult As an infusion, 1.5-3 g of the drug to 150 ml of water, three times daily Children from 4 years of age, daily dose as infusions only: 4-10 years, 3-5 g 10-16 years, 3-6 g ml, three times daily ESCOP, 2nd edition, 2003, Wichtl (2002) and Bradley 1992 (adults) Dorsch et al., 2 002 (children) Tincture (1:5, 70% ethanol) Herbal tea Spastic complaints of the gastrointestinal tract as well as gallbladder and bile ducts.

Overview of available pharmacolo gical data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal pre paration(s) and relevant constituents thereof 3.1.1. Primary pharmacodynamics Antispasmodic action and choleretic activity Peppermint leaves In vitro Among other studies, alcoholic extracts of peppermin t leaf have showed antispasmodic effects on the isolated guinea pig ileum. 2.5 and 10.0 ml/l of a peppermint leaf extract (1:3.5, ethanol 31% w/w) were tested using acetylcholine and histamine as spasmodic agents. Both doses produced a significant increase of the ED 50, for acetylcholine and histamine-induced contractions and a significant decrease of the maximum possible contractility. The effect obtained with 10.0 ml/litre corresponded to that of 0.13 mg atropine (effective dose of atropine in the treatment of abdominal spasms: 0.5-1.0 mg) (Forster et al., 1983; Forster 1980). Flavonoids isolated from peppermint leaf and di ssolved in water so that 1 ml corresponded to approximately 0.5 g of dried leaf, inhibited muscula r contraction of the guinea pig ileum induced by barium chloride (Lallement-Guilbert et al., 1970). Assessment on L., folium extracts of Mentha piperita showed a significant, dose depend ent relaxation effect on isolated rabbit duodenum. The dried leaf extract was more effective than the fresh one (Mahmood et al., 2003). The mode of action on gastric motility of the muscle strip preparations from the entire guinea pig of a combination and its individual components (hydroethanolic herbal were studied. Peppermint leaf extract did not show consistent responses in the prox imal stomach, inducing relaxation and contraction (Schemann et al., 2006). In another in vitro study, the same product as described above (Schermann et al., 2006) and some of its isolated compounds were used. The study was perf ormed to test their activity on histamine-induced contractions and spontaneous motility, of intestinal samples from guinea pig. Mentha piperita leaves, as Iberis amara, and Melissa folium had significant effects on decreasing the contraction amplitude (Heinle et al., 2006). In vivo In vivo experiments with cannulated dogs peppermint tea (0.4 g/kg body weight) increased the secretion of bile. Both flavonoids, as well as the e ssential oil, seemed to contribute to this action (Steinegger et al., 1992, Pasechnik, 1966). Mixed flavonoids from peppermint leaf (optimum dose 2 mg/kg,), showed choleretic activity in dogs. Flavomentin, a flavonoid preparation from peppermint leaf, stimulated bile secretion and of bile acid synthesis in dogs at doses of 0.5-6 mg/kg (optimum 2 mg/kg) (Pasechnik, cannulated rats, intravenous inje ction of 0.5 ml of a peppermint tea (1:5) per rat or a flavonoid preparation (dosage corresponding to 3.3 g of peppermint leaf per kg) proved effective in increasing the amount of bile acids (Lallement-Guilbert et al., 1970). In a study published by Ando et al., 2003, in Holstein steers fed with peppermint, there were lower concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and reduction of the numbers of protozoa in the rumen. The potential antiulcerogenic, antisecretory and cy toprotective activity of the combination and its individual components (hydroethanolic in ma le Wistar rats. A modified formulation of the combination taking out three components was also tested. Gastric ulcers were induced acutely by indometacin and cimetidine was used as a referenc e anti-ulcerogenic. The parameters used were the free acidity, mucin and pepsin concentrations in the gastric juice, and the prostaglandin and leukotriene levels in the gastric mucosa. The stomach was histologically examined. Both preparations and their individual components protect the stomach from the ulcerative damage caused by indometacin, inhibiting the release of aggressive factors like acid and leukotrienes, promoting the production of mucin and prostaglandins. This effect could be attributed, according to the authors, to the presence of flavonoids (Khayyal et al., 2001). Peppermint oil In vitro In order to investigate the effects of peppermint oil and its most abundant metabolite and active constituent ((-) menthol) on 5-HT 3 receptors (serotonin receptor subtype) three different in vitro models were used : [14C]guanidinium influx into N1E-115 cells which express 5-HT3 receptors, isotonic contractions of the isolated rat ileum and equilibrium competition binding studies using a Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium inhibited [14C] guanidinium influx through 5-HT 3 receptor channels as well as serotonin induced contractions of the ileum. Neither the peppermint oil nor (-)-menthol, however, was able to displace [3H] GR65630 from 5-HT 3 binding sites. It may be concluded that peppermint oil an d (-)-menthol exert their antiemetic effect at least partly by acting on the 5-HT 3 receptor ion-channel complex, probably by binding to a modulatory site distinct from the serotonin binding site (Heimes et al., 2011). In vivo/Ex vivo Peppermint oil as a 1% emulsion exhibited relaxant effects on tracheal smooth muscle of the guinea pig: the I 50 was 83-91 mg/l (Reiter and Brandt, 1985). Peppermint oil emulsified with tween, 1% in aqueous solution, relaxed chemically contracted guinea pig taenia coli (I 50: 22.1 \u00b5g/ml) and inhibited spontaneous activity in the guinea pig colon (I 50: 25.9 \u00b5g/ml) and rabbit jejunum (I 50: 15.2 \u00b5g/ml). Using whole cell clamp configuration in these jejunal muscle cells, the potential-dependent calcium currents were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by peppermint oil. Peppermint oil reduced the peak current amplitude and increased the rate of current decay, indicating a reduction of calcium influx si milar to that caused by dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Peppermint oil demonstrated non-comp etitive inhibition 5-hydroxytriptamine (serotonin) and the substance P induced smooth muscle contraction (Hills et al., 1991). Both menthol and peppermint oil inhibited specific [3H] nitrendipine and [3H] PN 200-110 binding to smooth and cardiac muscle and neuronal preparations with potencies comparable to, but slightly lower than those measured in the pharmacological and 45Ca2+ uptake experiments. Binding of menthol and peppermint oil, studied at 78 \u00b5g/ml, was competitiv e against [3H] nitrendipine in both smooth muscle and synaptosome preparations. The data indicate that both menthol and peppermint oil exert Ca2+ channel blocking properties which may underlie their use in irritable bowel syndrome. The authors conclude that Ca2+ channel antagonism may not be the only pharmacological effect of menthol and peppermint oil contributing to intestinal smooth muscle relaxation (Hawthorn et al., 1988). Peppermint oil and menthol administered i.v have shown the stimulation of the choleretic activity (bile flow) in rats at doses of 25-50 mg/kg (Trabace et al., 1992). In another study, the pharmacological activity of esse ntial oils on Oddi's sphincter was studied in male guinea pigs. The authors reported that the Oddi's sphincter prolapses through i.v. injection of Mentha piperita essential oil (Anon, 1990). Peppermint oil appears to enhance production of bile. In experiments where bile flowed out of a cannula from an anaesthetised dog, an infusion of peppermint leaves (0.4 g/kg) enhanced bile production. Menthol also produced an enhancement of production: 0.06 g/kg in 1 dog and 0.1-1.0 g/kg in rats. In others experimental studies in an imals, menthol and peppermint oil induced a marked and dose related choleresis (Siegers et al., 1991). Anti-nociceptive effect Peppermint leaves In vivo The aqueous extract of Mentha piperita leaf, at the i.p. doses 200 and 400 mg/kg, showed significant analgesic effects against both acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate induced thermal stimulation in Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 29/101 mice, with protection values of 51.79% and 20.21% respectively. Mice (n=8 each group) were placed in an observation box, and the number of writhing movements (constriction of the abdominal muscles together with stretching of the hind limbs) was counted for each mouse for a period of 20 minutes after acetic acid injection. Anti-nociceptive ac tivity was expressed as the number of abdominal constrictions between saline treated control and animals pre-treated with M. piperita leaf aqueous extracts or acetyl salicylic acid. In contrast, the present study showed that the aqueous extract of M. piperita leaf failed to exert anti-oedematogenic effect on the increase in paw thickness induced by carrageenan injection indicating a lack of peripheral anti-phlogistic activity (Taher, 2012). Peppermint oil In vivo A study to characterise the effects of peppermint and caraway oil individually and in combination on the visceral nociception in a rat model of post-inflammatory hyperalgesia, was performed. 28 male Lewis rats were randomised to treatment with a rect al administration of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol or physiological saline solution. Af ter 14 days of treatment with peppermint and/or caraway oil, a reduced visceromotor response of up to 50% was found compared to placebo. Individually both oils had no significant effect on post-inflammatory visceral hyperalgesia (Adam et al., 2006). Menthol In another study in identified Helix neurons, the authors indicated a modulating action of external menthol on Ca inactivation (Hawthorn et al., 1988). Anti-carminative activity Peppermint oil In vitro Peppermint oil has showed antifoaming and carminative activity in vitro . Reductions in gastric and intestinal foam volume were observed in vitro studies with peppermint oil. The carminative effect results from a combination of actions. Antifoaming activity associated with the relaxation of the oesophageal sphincter may release the gastric gas. The antimicrobial activity helps to reduce the intestinal gas (Harries et al., 1978). Bronchomucotropic activity Peppermint oil In several old studies, peppermint oil was reported to depress ciliary activity, while in some other studies peppermint oil markedly stimulated it (Das et al., 1 970). Menthol In vivo Menthol (1 mg of menthol/kg added to the water va porizer, corresponding to systemic absorption of not over 20 g/kg body weight) was given to rabbits anesthetised with urethane. It augmented the soluble mucus content and lowered the specific gravit y of respiratory tract fluid. The author concludes that the bronchomucotropic effects were due to direct local stimulation of mucus secreting cells in the respiratory tract. Inhalation of larger amounts of menthol depressed the volume output and mucus content of respiratory tract fluid (Boyd and Sheppard, 1969). Assessment report on Mentha x piperita Antioxidant activity Peppermint leaves The antioxidant capacity of peppermint has been determined using of different assay methods. Among some medicinal herbs, Mentha piperita leaves showed a high oxygen radical absorbance capacity. Water-soluble extracts from the Mentha species among which M. piperita was screened for potential antioxidative properties. These properties on(III) reduction, iron(II) chelation, hydroxyl radical-mediated brain phospholipid peroxidation. All the extracts demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy within each antioxidant assay. The cultivar M. x piperita \"Frantsila\" appeared to be a good source of natural antioxidants, but not better than the other extracts for ferrous iron chelation. It contained the highest levels of total phenols as de termined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and by HPLC, due to the high levels of eriocitrin and rosmarinic acid (Dorman et al., 2003). Antimicrobial, antiplasmid and antiviral activity Peppermint leaves Antiviral activity was reported of aqueou s extracts of peppermint leaves towards Influenza A, Newcastle disease virus, Herpes simplex virus and Vaccinia virus, in egg and cell culture systems (Herrmann and Kucera, 1967). The antibacterial and antifungicidal activity was reported in several studies, especially with peppermint oil. The inhibition of the growth of Salmonella typhimurium , Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were achieved with addition of ground le aves to the agar medium at concentrations of 0.1-2.0% (w/v) (Aktug and Karapinar, 1986). In another study, the reduction of the number of plaques of the rinderpest virus with aqueous and ethanol extracts of the leaves of Mentha piperita , at concentrations of 4-8 mg/ml was observed (Alwan et al., 1988). The in vitro susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to botanical extracts used traditionally for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders was screened. Mentha piperita (leaves) were among the extracts with a MIC 50\u00b1100 \u00b5g/ml (Mahady et al., 2005). In a study by Blaszczyk et al. (2000), extracts of 56 widely used dried Chinese medical plants or their parts were screened for their antimycotic properties moderate antimycotic properties against all screened fungi strains. Peppermint oil The virucidal effect in vitro was assessed on a study, where the inhibitory activity against herpes simplex (HSV, type 1 and type 2) was tested. A pl aque reduction assay was used with RC-37 cells, where the HSV-1 and 2 were grown. Peppermint oil was dissolved in ethanol (1% final concentration of ethanol) and added to the cell culture medium, at the non-toxic concentration of 0.01%. To determine the antiviral action, cells were pre-treated with peppermint oil before the infection, viruses were incubated with peppermint oil before infection and cells and viruses were incubated together during adsorption or after penetration of the virus into th e host cells. All these experiments were performed in parallel with acyclovir to test the suitability of th e assay and were compared to untreated controls. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 31/101 Ethanol had no effect on virus titters and did not ex hibit any toxic effect on the cells. At non-cytotoxic concentration of the oil, 0.01% peppermint oil, the titres of HSV-1 and 2 were reduced by 82% and 92% respectively. Higher concentrations reduced virus titters for more than 90%. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of peppermint oil was determined at 0.002% and 0.0008% for HSV-1 and 2. The peppermint oil affected the virus before adsorption ex erting a direct effect on the virus, but not after penetration into the host cell (Schuhmacher et al., 2003). Peppermint oil showed antimicrobial and antiplasmi d activity, demonstrating a synergistic additive interaction with oxytetracycline (Schelz et al., 2 006). In a study by Mimica-Dukic et al., (2003), the antimicrobial activity and free radical scavenging capacity (RSC) of essential oils from Mentha piperita L. as well as M aquatica L., and M longifolia L have been described. The percentage content of essential oils were 0.69% for M. aquatica , 3.73% for M. piperita and 3.21% for M. longifolia . The chemical profile of each essential oil was checked by TLC and derermined by GC-MS. The most powerful antibacterial activity was demonstrated by M. piperita , in particular flavus ATTC tested oils showed significant fungistatic and fung icidal activity, considered higher than those of Bifonazole. Antiallergic action Peppermint leaves A study was performed to clarify the effects of extracts of the leaves and stems of Mentha piperita L. on experimental allergic rhinitis. The extraction pr ocess includes the removal of essential oil, fat, followed by fractionation. This 50% ethanol extract had a dose-dependent effect, on the inhibition of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. The compound 48/80 induced this reaction and the inhibition was observed at a concentration of 3 \u00b5g/ml. The water, 50% ethanol eluate, separated by column chromatography also shows a similar effect at a dose of 1 \u00b5g/ml. The oral administration of 50% EtOH inhibited sneezing and nasal rubbing indu ced by antigen-antibody reaction. The repeated administration was more effective th an a single administration (Innoue et al., 2001). Following these results, the same authors further studied the antiallergic effect of the flavonoid glycosides obtained from Mentha piperita L. Among the flavonoids isolated from the aerial part of M. piperita L., luteolin-7-0-rutinoside showed a dose-related inhibitory effect of an antigen induced nasal response at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. CNS action Peppermint leaves An aqueous extract of peppermint leaf (50 g of drie d leaf infused for 10 minutes in 500 ml hot water, then spray-dried) administered orally in 2 single doses of 300 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg in 16 mice showed a weak sedative action in several tests: hexobarbital-induced sleep, exploratory behaviour, spontaneous motility and motor coordination (Della Loggia et al., 1990). The peppermint extract at a dose of 1000 mg/kg causes a biphasic effect with initial stimulation followed by depression, in the behavioural tests in rats. It seems that the effect observed is due to the oil contained in the extract. At a lower dose, 300 mg/kg, the excitatory response is too weak and transient, and only the depressive effect is recorded (Della Loggia et al., 1990). Anticonvulsivant effect Peppermint oil Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 32/101 The effect of pre-treatment with essencial oils administered 60 minutes prior to intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of pentylenetetraol-(PTZ) on the seizure latency and severity, to eight groups of Balb-c mice was assessed. Control grou p received only one i.p. PTZ injection. M. piperita essential oil (EO) was the most effective from all with no seiz ures observed after the administration of PTZ. The survival of animals after the treatment was 100%, showing that it is extremely tolerable by the animals and has the best anticonvulsant results (Koutroumanidou et al., 2013). Diuretic effect Peppermint leaves The effect of peppermint on diuresis is weak. The ef fective dose is about 30 times higher than that of aminophylline. At 1000 mg/kg oliguria was observed (Della Loggia et al., 1990). Chemopreventive effects Peppermint leaves In studies where some agents induced carcinogenic ity, peppermint showed a preventive and reduction effect. A study was performed comparing a powdered tobacco mixture (15 g) with and without 15 g of peppermint leaves, on the induction of morphological changes and tumors. These mixtures were painted onto the cheek pouches of Syrian golden hamsters 3 times per week for 20 weeks. The non- mint tobacco mixture increased mucosal thickening (n=20/22 in non-peppermint groups vs 9/15 in peppermint containing group), leukoplasia (20/22 vs 3/15) and frank tumors (19/22 vs 0/15) in the oral cavity. 86.3% of the animals in the group with out peppermint present tumor bearing at week 30, while the group with peppermint had 0% of tumors (Samman et al., 1998). The results of the study performed by Sameena and Ashok (2001), on the papillomagenesis of the skin induced by 7,12-dimetylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) in mice, suggest that there is a chemopreventive effect of peppermint on the development of sk in papillomas, being most effective during the promotional stage of carcinogenesis. An aqueous extract of Mentha piperitae leaves was evaluated using 9-week medium term model of benzo [a]pyrene (BP)-induced lung tumors in newborn Swiss albino mice. The number of lung tumors was reduced after oral administration of Mentha extract, in an inhibition rate of 61.26% in the Mentha treated group with respect to the reference group. Mentha extract reduced the frequency of BP induced chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in bone marrow cells and decreased the levels of lipoperoxides and increased sulfhydryl groups in liver and lung (Samarth et al., 2006). The effects of peppermint extracts against sublethal and lethal doses of gamma radiation in Swiss albino mice were tested in several studies. Pre-tr eatment with an aqueous extract of peppermint prior to the radiation (whole body), 1 g/kg administered 3 days before the irradiation with 8 Gy, increased the hematological parameters. The survival rate was also better on the pretreatment group compared with the irradiated control, 10 days post-irradiation (Samarth et al., 2004). The serum alkaline phosphatase was increased and the acid phosphatas e decreased, using the same protocol, compared with the control, after irradiation, retu rning to normal after 5 days (Samarth et al., 2002). The intestinal mucosa of mice suffered increased villus height, total number of mitotic cells, and decreased the number of goblet and dead cells after taking 1 g/Kg peppermint extract, within 20 days post-irradiation at 8 Gy (Mckay and Blumberg, 2006). A study was held to investigate the protective and anticancer effect of Mentha leaves aqueous extract on oral epithelium of mice tongues. A total of 80 Eg yptian albino mice were divided into three groups. Group I served as control (not subjected to any kind of treatment), and groups II and III were subjected to two-stage chemical carcinogenesis through topical application of Assessment report on Mentha x formaldehyde on dorsal and ventral surfaces of tongues for 9 weeks. Peppermint leaves extract was administrated to group III at the time of cancer induction. Histological changes were assessed in H&E sections at 3-week intervals. The anticarcinogenic effect of M piperita was tested using immunostain with anticaspase antibody. The authors report that oral administration of peppe rmint leaves extract redu ced the appearance of dysplastic cellular changes with 61% and inhibited tumor incidence with 100%. Group I showed moderate-to-strong cytoplasmic caspase expression . At 6-week interval, group II showed weak-to- moderate caspase expression, while sections from group III showed moderate-to-strong caspase expression. The authors also report highly significan t statistical difference in the total score of caspase 3 expression between specimens obtained from animal s sacrificed at 6 weeks in groups I, II, and III (p=0.001**) and conclude that Mentha piperita has inhibited the initiation and promotion of oral dysplastic lesions (Kasem et al., 2014). The possible molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity and anticarcinogenic potential of Mentha leaf extracts (petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts) lines were studied. Of all the extracts tested, chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts of M. piperita showed significant dose-and time-dependent anti carcinogenic activity leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, perturbation of oxidative balance, upregulation of Bax gene, elevated expression of p53 and p21 in the tr eated cells, acquisition of senescence phenotype, while inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines response. The authors stated that the exhibited results provide the first evidence of direct anticarcinog enic activity of Mint's leaf extracts (Jain et al., 2011). A chemopreventive action and an antigenotoxic effe ct were observed in an evaluation of aqueous extracts of Mentha piperita leaves, administrated after an initial dose of benzo[a]pyrene (0.5 mg) in newborn Swiss albino mice (Akdogan et al. 2004a, Samarth et SMART test in Drasophila melanogaster . Hydrogen peroxidase was used as an oxidative genotoxicant. The infusion of M. pulegium is desmutagenic in the SMART when assayed with hydrogen peroxide in combined treatments. Both M. piperita and M. pulegium infusions showed similar levels of anti-genotoxicity (141 and 134%, respectively). The authors conclude that the results of inhibition obtained for M. chamomilla , T. officinalis surpassing 100% (ranging from 125 to 141%), can only be explained by a synergism be tween their phenolic contents and the hydrogen peroxide, due to the known ability of phenols to sc avenge reactive oxygen species such as those generated by hydrogen peroxide (Romero-Jimenez et al., 2 005). Menthol After 20 weeks of oral dosing with 1% (-) a significant (p<0.001) was reported (Russin et al., 1989). Renoprotective effects Peppermint leaves A study was carried out to evaluate the renoprotective effect of Mentha piperita against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity. Fresh plant leaves of M. piperita were collected from Pakistan. Extraction was done with ethanol after drying the leaves under shade. A total of 24 male rabbits were divided into four groups of 6 each and each group was treated inde pendently, group C with 0.9% saline only 2 ml/kg (i.m) for 21 days, group G with gentamicin 80 mg/kg (i.m) for 21 days, group (i.m)+ M. piperita 200 mg/kg (p.o) for 21 days and the group M-pi with M. piperita 200 Assessment report on Mentha aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 34/101 mg/kg (p.o) for 21 days. Three rabbits in each group were sacrificed on day 21 of study period for examination of the kidneys. Histological examinat ion of the kidneys of Group G showed proximal tubular necrosis with loss of cellular pattern. Glomer ular atrophy and ruptured tubules with hydropic changes were also observed while in case of Grou p C animals' normal tubules with no evidence of necrosis and normal glomeruli or hydropic chan ges were observed. Groups GM-pi and M-pi also showed normal histology with no common abnormalit y or significant toxicity. Significant rise in the serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and serum ur ic acid with fall in creatinine clearance were observed in Group G animals when compared with control, which was reversed to almost control values in the extract treated animals. The authors report that it showed the protective role of M. piperita against toxic effects of gentamicin on kidney. They concluded that concurrent administration M. piperita successfully prevented renal damage associated with gentamicin, explored by various biochemical and histological examinations. Furthermore, the study also shows that concomitant use of M. piperita does not decline the efficacy of gentamicin with respect to its antibacterial activities (Naveed et al., 2014). Hepatoprotective effect Peppermint leaves A study to evaluate the protective activity of leaves of Mentha piperita L (Mentha leaves water extract) in adult Swiss mice against arsenic-induced hepatopathy was performed by Sharma et al., (2007). Pre and post treatment of Mentha with arsenic alters the biochemica l parameters in the liver, reducing ACP, ALP, SGOT, SGTP and LPO content. A significan t increase in body and liver weight, GSH content and LDH activity in liver was estimated. The au thors concluded that the results indicate that Mentha extract may be useful in reducing the side effects of arsenic-induced hepatopathy (Sharma et al., 2007). 3.1.3. Safety pharmacology These data are included in other chapters. 3.1.4. Pharmacodynamic interactions Peppermint oil Peppermint oil has been reported to demonstrated competitive antagonism on calcium channels in animals ( in vivo ) and in vitro . From a theoretical point of view, the calcium channels blockers effectiveness may be modified (Hawthorn, 1988). In a study using excised rat skin (Abdullah et al., 1 996), peppermint oil demonstrated a 46-fold increase in the penetration of 5-fluorouracil. In another study, the influence of acute and chronic intake of peppermint oil (Peppermint oil - Mentha piperita L., Lamiaceae; prepared as emulsion for oral use) on pentobarbitone-i nduced sleeping time, analgesic effect of codeine and impairment of motor coordination caused by midazolam in mice were observed. Applied doses of peppermint oil were 0.1 and 0.2 ml/kg. The authors report that chronic peppermint oil intake (in both doses) led to signif icant decrease of analgesic effect of codeine, while acute intake of peppermint oil did not change this effect. Acute peppermint oil pretreatment in higher dose caused significant prolongation of pentobarbito ne-induced sleeping time, while it was significantly shortened by chronic peppermint oil pretreatment at the same dose. Midazolam effect was enhanced and prolonged significantly by chronic peppermint oil intake at higher dose, while acute intake of peppermint oil did not change this effect. Gut motility was increased only by acute intake of higher peppermint oil dose. Regarding the fact that peppermint oil produces changes in tested drug effects, Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 35/101 the authors concluded that the interaction between drugs and phytopreparations containing peppermint oil should be additionally followed/confirmed in humans (Samojlik et al., 2012). 3.1.5. Conclusions Peppermint leaves The antispasmodic effects on gastrointestinal tissue and the antinociceptive effect on animal models were reported in the non-clinical studies. They are specially attributed to the content in essential oil. Stimulation of bile secretion in dogs has been re ported. Nevertheless, the flavonoids's content of peppermint leaves have also been reported to inhi bit contraction of guinea pig ileum and to stimulate bile secretion in vivo in dogs. The non-clinical data support the traditional use of peppermint leaf preparations, for the symptomatic relief of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia and flatulence. Peppermint oil In non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies, antispasmodic activity on the gastrointestinal smooth muscle has been reported. The mechanism seems to be related to the reduction of the calcium influx and the block of non-competitive contraction induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine. Cholagogic activity in vivo has also been reported and could possible contribute to the carminative activity. The antimicrobial activity combined with reduction in gastric and intestinal foam volume, as well the relaxation of the oesophageal sphincter could potentially contribute to the carminative activity. The competitive antagonism at calcium channels in animals and in vitro raises the possibility of interaction with other calcium blockers. The bronchomucotropic effects were contradictory, with depressing and stimulatory action of mucus secreting cells in the respiratory tract. 3.2. Overview of available pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal pre paration(s) and relevant constituents thereof Peppermint leaves Maliakal and Wanwimolruk, (2001) reported modulatory effects of peppermint tea on selected hepatic phase I metabolising enzymes in a study on female Wistar rats. According to the authors, after pre- treatment with a 2% solution for 4 weeks ( n=5), the and CYP2E (48%) were significantly reduced, compared with a control group. Peppermint oil Dermal absorption The absorption rate for peppermint oil was measured after the application of eserine in a peppermint oil vehicle, to a 2.2 cm 2 shaved area on the abdomen of mice. The latent period between application and the eserine-induced signs, gave the absorption rate of peppermint oil, which was of 58 minutes (Nair, 2001). Inhalation Menthol Assessment report on folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 36/101 Pulmonary absorption depends on various factors, like the kind of compound and the breathing mechanics of the subjects. In one study, it was demonstrated that the release of compounds from water into the headspace depended on water temperature. Elimination half-lives for inhaled menthol and camphor were 35.5 and 39.9 minutes respectively. This indicates that there should be no accumulation during long-term application (Kohlert et al., 2000). Oral absorption and metabolism The major biliary metabolite is menthol glucuronide, which undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Metabolism of l-menthol in rats was investigated both in vivo and in vitro . The following were metabolites isolated and characterised from the urine of rats after oral administration (800 mg/kg of body weight per day) of l-menthol: p-menthane-3, 8-diol (II), p-menthane-3, 9-diol (IV), and 3, 8-dihyro xy-p-menthane-7-carboxylic acid (V). Compounds II and V were the major urinary metabolites in vivo . Repeated oral administration (800 mg/kg of body weight/day) of l-menthol to rats for 3 days resulted in the increase of both liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 content and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity by nearly 80%. Further treatment (for 7 days total) considerably reduced their levels, although the levels were still higher than the control values. Both cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome c reductase levels were not changed during the 7 days of treatment. Rat liver microsomes readily converted l-menthol to p-menthane-3, 8- diol (II) in the presence of NADPH and O2. This activity was significantly higher in microsomes obtained from phenobarbital (PB)-induced rats than from control microsomal preparations, whereas 3- methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-induced microsomes fail ed to convert l-menthol to compound II in the presence of NADPH and O2. L-Menthol elicited a type I (Ks=60.6 microM) and PB-induced (Ks=32.3 microM) microsomes whereas it type I spectrum with 3MC-induced microsomes (Madyastha and Srivatsan, 1988). One randomised 4-way crossover study was designed to determine the effect of peppermint oil and ascorbylpalmitate on cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) activity in vitro and oral bioavailability of felodipine in humans. The method was the study of the reversible mechanism-based inhibitions of nifedipine oxidation in human liver microsomes. Oral administration of 10-mg extended-release tablet of felodipine with grapefruit juice (300 ml), peppermint oil (600 mg), ascorbyl palmitate (500 mg), or water, were given to 12 healthy volunteers, and the pharmacokinetics of felodipine and dehydrofelodipine were determined. The authors concluded that peppermint oil, menthol, menthyl acetate, and ascorbyl palmitate were moderately potent reversible inhibitors of in vitro CYP3A4 activity. Nevertheless further invest igation should be done (Dresser et al., 2002). A study compared the effects of peppermint oil with ketoconazole and D-alpha-tocopheryl poly (ethylene glycol 1000) succinate (TPGS), on the inhibi tion of cyclosporine oral bioavailability in rats. Peppermint oil (100 mg/kg) tripled the mean cyclosporine maximum concentration. The author suggests that inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A is not the only mean by which peppermint oil enhances cyclosporine bioavailability (Wacher et al., 2002). Excretion The urinary metabolites result from hydroxylation at the C-7 group at C-8 and C-9 of the isopropyl moiety, forming a series of mono-and di hydroxymenthols and carboxylic acids, some of which are excreted in part as glucuronic acid co njugates. Studies with tritiated I-menthol in rats indicated about equal excretion in faeces and urine. The main metabolite to pulegone and menthofuran are summarised in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). Assessor's overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics The studies on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability are few and contradictory. According to existing studies, in animals, peppermint is rapidly absorbed. The major biliary metabolite is menthol glucuronide, which undergoes enterohe patic circulation. After inhalation, pulmonary absorption depends on various factors and the rapid elimination indicates that there should be no accumulation during long-term application. The urinary metabolites are excreted in part as glucuronic acid conjugates. Studies in rats indicated equal excretion of essential oil compounds in faeces and urine. The main metabolite identified was menthol-glucuronide. Pharmacokinetic data related to pulegone and menthofuran are summarised in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). 3.3. Overview of available toxicolo gical data regarding the herbal substance(s)/herbal preparation (s) and constituents thereof 3.3.1. Single dose toxicity Peppermint leaf extract A dry peppermint leaf water extract, was given to 12 mice as a single dose at 4000 mg/kg body weight. None of the animals died or showed macroscopic signs of toxicity over a 7-day period (Della Logia et al., 1990). Peppermint oil The oral LD 50 of peppermint oil U.S.P. in fasted Wistar male rats was found to be 4441\u00b1653 mg/kg after 24 hours and 2426 mg/kg after 48 hours (Nair, 2001). 3.3.2. Repeat dose toxicity Peppermint leaves 20 g/l of M. piperita tea was given to 48 rats during 30 days; serum iron and ferritin levels were reduced (p<0.05), and increased unsaturated iron-bindi ng capacity (p<0.01) were observed in a study of Akdogan et al., ( 2004a). In another study, the biochemical histopathological effects of Mentha piperitae L. and Mentha spicata L on liver tissue of rats were investigated. AST and ALT activities were increased, but not statistically significantly in the group with 20 g/l of M. piperita tea, daily, during 30 days, and minimal hepatocyte degeneration was found in the histopathological evaluation. The damage seems to be dose dependent, according to the author (Akdogan et al., 2004b). A similar study on the kidney of Wistar albino rats found no evidence of nephrotoxicity on the group drinking 20 g/l of M. piperita tea, daily, during 30 days. Slight histopathological changes were observed, in the group of M. piperita compared with the group of M. spicata . They consist of hydropic Assessment report on piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 38/101 degeneration of tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cells with picnotic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlargement of bowman capsules (Akdogan et al., 2003). Pulegone/menthofuran Repeat-dose toxicity studies of pulegone and ment hofuran are summarised in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). Menthone In a 28 days study rats were orally dosed with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg menthone/kg bw per day, respectively. The decrease in plasma creatinine and the increase in phosphatase alkaline and bilirubin were dose dependent. Relative we ights of liver and spleen were increased. Cyst-like spaces were histopathologically seen in the white matter of th e cerebellum of the two highest dose groups. The non-observed effect level (NOEL) was lower th an 200 mg/kg bw per day (HED=<32 mg/kg) (Madsen et strains TA1537, TA98, TA1535 and TA100 were used to test peppermint oil at concentrations of 800, 160, 32 and 6.4 \u00b5g per plate. No mutagenic properties were observed until 160 \u00b5g per plate. 800 \u00b5g peppermint oil/plate displayed cytotoxicity. Menthol and pulegone were also negative at the same concentrations. Peppermint oil was negative at a dose of 150 g/ml, in a mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK\u00b1cell mutagenesis assay and at a concentration of 155 g/ml, in an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, on rat hepatocytes (Nair, 2001). The genotoxic activity of dill, peppermint and pi ne essential oils were studied using chromosome aberration (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests in human lymphocytes in vitro and Drosophila melanogaster somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in vivo . The essential oil of M. piperita was shown to weakly induce SCE in a dose independent manner and to be genotoxic in the wing somatic mutation and recombination tests (SMA RT). Peppermint oil was the most cytotoxic and inhibited mitotic activity of human lymphocytes (Lazukta et al., 2001). Peppermint oil was negative in the in vivo combined micronucleus/Comet assay (liver, kidney and bladder mucosa cells) in female rats (up to 750 mg/kg). Further evaluation of the genotoxicity of peppermint oil, related to pulegone and menthofura n, are summarised in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pu legone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2015 Rev. 1). Menthol The mutagenic potential of natural Brazilian menthol was tested in the cytogenetic assay (rats), the host-mediated assay (mice), and the dominant lethal assay (rats). The assays were done with menthol doses of 1.45, 14.5, and 145.0 mg/kg and in some in stances, subacute and acute studies were done with doses of 500, 1150, and 3000, or 5000 mg/kg. In the host-mediated assay, a weakly positive but significant response was noted with the acute high dose against Salmonella typhimurium TA1530, and elevated recombinant frequencies were noted with the subacute doses against Saccharomyces D3. All other assays were negative (Nair, 2001 citing Litton Bionetics, Inc. 1975). Menthone Assessment report on Mentha EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 exhibited mutagenic responses in several Salmonella tester strains, although responses were rather inconsistent in terms of concentration and requirement of S9. It was also positive in the wing somatic mutation and recombination tests (SMART) and genotoxic in D. melanogaster (Lazukta et al., 2001). It was weakly positive in the host-mediated assay (mice), but not in cytogenetic or dominant lethal assays (rats) (Nair, 2001). Pulegone and Menthofuran The genotoxicity of pulegone and menthofuran are evaluated in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). 3.3.4. Carcinogenicity Peppermint oil The Final report on the Safety Assessment of Mentha piperita (2001) presents a carcinogenicity study of toothpaste and its components, where groups of 52 male pathogen-free CFLP (ICI-rede. ned) mice were dosed by gavage with 4 or 16 mg peppermint oil/kg per day, 6 days a week for 80 weeks. A 16- to 24-week observation period followed treatment. An untreated group of 52 male mice and a vehicle group of 260 male mice that received the toothpaste base (which did not contain chloroform, eucalyptol, or peppermint oil) were maintained as controls. Body weight gain was initially reduced in animals of the 16-mg/kg per day group. At least on e neoplasm at any site was observed in 73%, 69%, 65%, and 71% of mice of the low dose, high-dose, untreated-control, and vehicle-control groups, respectively. Malignant neoplasms were noted in 39 %, 35%, 23%, and 31% of mice of the low-dose, high-dose, untreated control, and vehicle-control gr oups, respectively. The incidence of neoplasms of the lungs and kidneys were comparable among mice of the treated and non-treated groups. This report mentioned also the study by Roe et al., ( 1979), where hepatic cell tumor incidence for peppermint oil-dosed mice (25%) was comparable to the incidence for mice of the vehicle-control group (27%); the incidence for the untreated group was 19%. Malignant lymphoma was found in 25%, 21%, 10%, and of mice of the low-dose, high-dose, untreated, and vehicle-control groups, respectively. The researchers did not discuss if the difference in the incidence rate was significant. (Nair, 2001) A review of the study by the British Industrial Biological Research Association (1992) noted that it was not designed to examine the carcinogenic potential of peppermint oil and thus \"would have had only a very limited sensitivity to this particular component\" (Nair, 2001). Menthol The National Cancer Institute found no evidence of carcinogenicity after dosing Fisher 344 rats with 3750 or 7500 ppm oral dose, or B6C3F 1 mice with 2000 or 4000 ppm d, l-menthol, in a two year study, in 1979. In female mice, dose related in creased deaths were noted (US National Cancer Institute, 1979). Pulegone/Menthofuran The carcinogenicity of pulegone and menthofuran are evaluated in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). 3.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity Peppermint leaves Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum Mentha spicata herbal teas on plasma total testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels and te sticular histologic features were evaluated. The rats (200-250 g) were randomised in four groups of 12 each. The experimental group was given 20 g/l M. piperita tea, or 20 g/l M. spicata tea or 40g/l M. spicata tea. The control group control had commercial drinking water. The follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone had increased and total testosterone had decreased levels, compared with the control group, being statistically significant. The Johnsen testicular biopsy scores were different but not statistically significantly (Akdogan et al., 2004c). Menthol No clear discernible effect on nidation (or on ma ternal or fetal survival was observed after oral administration of up to 185 mg/kg (body weight ) of Brazilian menthol to pregnant mice for 10 consecutive days. The number of abnormalities seen in the test group didn't differ from the sham- treated controls. No teratogenic effects were note d after oral intubations of Brazilian menthol on pregnant mice, rats, hamsters and rabbits (Food and Drug Research Labs, 1973). For maximum oral doses of 190, 220, 400, and 430 mg/kg per day, respectively, teratogenic effects in mice, rats and hamsters were not observed (FAO/WHO expert on Food Additives, 2000). 3.3.6. Local tolerance Poppermint oil is recognised to produce immediate contact reactions (urticaria) (Nair, 2001, citing DeGroot, 1994). 5% and 10% menthol a strong burning sensat ion but 0.2% and 2% of menthol is reported to have a coolant action (Nair, 2001, citing Eccles, 1994). The local tolerance depends on the concentration of peppermint oil as well on the excipients used in the final product. 3.3.7. Other special studies Immunotoxicity At very high dose levels (1250 mg/kg per day), peppermint did increase mortality and reduce survival time in the host resistance assay, in the rapid screening protocol, to evaluate humoral and cell- mediated immune responses (Gaworsky et al., 1994). Phototoxicity No effects were produced after the application of 100% peppermint oil on the back of hairless mice, irradiated with light from a fluore scent black light at an integrated UVA. The same result was obtained on a second experiment using the same protocol with two miniature swine (Nair, 2001, citing Research Institute for Fragance Materials, 1996). 3.3.8. Conclusions Toxicological studies on peppermint leaves and peppermint oil are scarce. The oral LD 50 of peppermint oil U.S.P. in fasted Wistar male rats after 24 hours was found to be 4441\u00b1653 mg/kg and after 48 hours 2426 mg/kg. Peppermint oil was negative in the Ames test (up to 160 \u00b5g per plate), the mouse lymphoma assay (up to 150 \u00b5g/ml), and in the in vivo combined micronucleus/Comet assay (liver, kidney and bladder Assessment report on Mentha piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 41/101 mucosa cells) in female rats (up to 750 mg/kg). We ak and inconsistent genotoxic responses in other non-validated tests are probably toxicologically inconsequential. There is more evidence for genotoxicity potential of menthol or menthone and there seems to be a discrepancy between peppermint oil and its most important constituent me nthol. However, the present evidence points to a very weak or totally absent genotoxicity of peppermint oil. Tests on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity do not exist for peppermint oil or for preparations from peppermint leaves. No photosensitivity of peppermint oil was found. Pulegone/Menthofuran The toxicity of pulegone and menthofuran have been evaluated by HMPC and presented in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). In brief, based on a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, the NOAEL was taken as 37.5 mg/kg bw, due to liver and kidney toxicity. A plausible mechanism for toxicity is the formation of reactive metabolites when cellular levels of glutathione are depleted. Based on the results from this study, and considering an uncertainty factor of 50, an intake of pulegone+menthofuran up to 37.5 mg/person per day, for an adult of 50 kg body weight, can be accepted for herbal medicinal products as a lifetime intake. For children, the daily amount of pulegone + menthofuran has to be adjusted to the body weight of the age group: e.g. body weight of 20 kg would lead to an acceptable daily intake of 15 mg per day. Furthermore, on the basis of results from several in-vitro and in-vivo genotoxicity studies, pulegone and menthofuran are considered non- genotoxic. a 2 year study with orally admi nistrated pulegone there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats up to 75 mg/kg (HED= 12 mg/kg). In female rats there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity at the dosage of 37.5 mg/kg (HED=6 mg/kg), as well as in male and female mice, at the lowest dosage of 37.5 mg /kg per day (HED=3 mg/kg). The mechanism is considered to be related to the formation of reactive metabolites and sustai ned cytotoxicity. These findings require a long-term exposure to pulegone and/or menthofuran at doses, which are not relevant in the human situation. Menthol No evidence of carcinogenicity was found for d,l-menthol in a carcinogenicity study in rats with 3750 or 7500 ppm oral dose, or B6C3F 1 mice with 2000 or 4000 ppm. No teratogenic effects were noted in the studies performed on oral doses of 190, 220, 400, and 430 mg/kg per day. Menthone The oral toxicity of menthone was evaluated in an animal model. The decrease in plasma creatinine and the increase in phosphatase alkaline and bilirrubin were dose dependent, after levels of 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg bw per day. The non-observable- effect-level (NOEL) for menthone in this study was lower than 200 mg/kg bw per day. A NOEL of 400 mg/kg bw per day was reported in a 28 day toxicity study in rats. 3.4. Overall conclusions on non-clinical data Peppermint leaves The antispasmodic effects on gastrointestinal tissue and the antinociceptive effect on animal models were reported in the non-clinical studies. They are specially attributed to their essential oil content. Stimulation of bile secretion in dogs have been reported. Nevertheless, the flavonoids present in the leaves have also been reported to inhibit contraction of guinea pig ileum and to stimulate bile secretion in vivo in dogs. Assessment report on Mentha x pipe rita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 42/101 These pharmacological actions support the traditiona l use in digestive disorders and the therapeutic indication proposed in this assessment report for the monograph-symptomatic relief of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia and flatulence. Specific data on pharmacokinetics is not available. Adequate tests on reproductive toxicity, genotoxici ty and carcinogenicity have not been performed. As there is no adequate information on reproductive and developmental toxicity, the use during pregnancy and lactation cannot be recommended. Peppermint oil In non-clinical studies, antispasmodic activity on the gastrointestinal smooth muscle has been reported. The mechanism seems to be related to the reduction of the calcium influx and the block of non-competitive contraction induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine. Cholagogic activity in vivo has also been reported and could possibly contribute to the carminative activity. Peppermint oil was negative in two in vitro genotoxicity tests, the mouse lymphoma assay and in the in combined micronucleus/Comet assay (liver, kidn ey and bladder mucosa cells) in female rats. Tests on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity have not been performed. Pulegone/Menthofuran Among the components of peppermint oil, pulegone and menthofuran raise concerns from a toxicological point of view. The toxicity of pulego ne and menthofuran have been evaluated by HMPC and presented in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). The highest daily dosage of peppermint oil is 1.2 ml i.e. 1080-1099 mg (based on relative density 0.9- 0.916 g/cm3 according Ph. Eur. 8.1 (2014)), which contains maximum 32.4-32.97 mg pulegone and 86.4-87.92 mg menthofuran (according to Ph. Eur. 8.1 limits for pulegone and menthofuran in peppermint oil). For a 50 kg person this would correspond to a daily intake of 0.540-0.549 mg/kg bw of all together 99-100.45mg per day. Based on the results from toxicity studies summarised in this public statement, the HMPC concludes that an intake of pulegone+menthofuran up to 37.5 mg per person per day, for an adult of 50 kg body weight, can be accepted for herbal medicinal prod ucts as a lifetime intake. For children, the daily amount of pulegone+menthofuran has to be adjusted to the body weight of the age group: e.g. body weight of 20 kg would lead to an acceptable daily intake of 15 mg/day, (life-long exposure) or 30 mg per day for a short-term exposure (less than 1 year). For treatment durations of less than 1 year an intake (pulegone+menthofuran) of 75.0 mg per day for an adult of 50 Kg body weight (e .g. for children with a body weight of 20 kg 30mg per day) can be accepted. In the case of intermittent dosing, the a cceptable daily intake should be based on the total number of dosing days instead of the time interval over which the doses are administered. For example, a drug administered once per week for 5 years (i.e., 260 dosing days) would have an acceptable intake per dose of 75.0 mg. No quantitative data concerning absorption of pulegone and menthofuran through the skin exist although it is known that pulegone has been used as a \"penetration enhancer\". It is to ensure that the sum of pulegone and menthofuran within the daily dose is <37.5 mg for adults. The short-term use (maximum 14 days) is restricted to intact skin (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 43/101 Higher contents within the products would be possib le if low absorption rates for the relevant product can be shown (implying the relevant matrix, becaus e absorption might be greatly influenced by the excipients, for instance essential oils as enhancers), not exceeding the daily intake of 37.5 mg for adults (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). To reach the limits, peppermint oil with adequate qu ality (specification of adequate limits of pulegone and menthofuran) are required. 4. Clinical Data 4.1. Clinical pharmacology 4.1.1. Overview of pharmacodynamic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) includin g data on relevant constituents Peppermint leaves No data available. Peppermint oil Peppermint oil relaxes the oesophageal sphincter when administered orally (15 drops of oil suspended in 30 ml of water), eliminating the pressure di fferential between the stomach and oesophagus and allowing reflux to occur (Sigmund and McNally, 1969). Another study documents the relaxation of the musc les around the border from oesophagus to the stomach through peppermint oil (Anon, 1990). In other study peppermint oil reduced colonic spasms during endoscopy in 20 patients. Peppermint oil was injected along the biopsy channel of the colonoscope. Colonic spasm was relieved within 30 s (Sigmund and McNally, 1969). An aqueous suspension of peppermint oil injected along the biopsy tract in 20 patients prevented the colonic spasms that would otherwise occur in endoscopic examinations (Leicester, 1982). A randomised double-blind, double dummy, controlled trial was conducted in 100 patients to compare the antispasmodic effects of hyoscine-N-butylbrom ide i.m. and a placebo solution intraluminally administered by the endoscope. Also, the effects of a placebo solution i.m. were compared with those of a peppermint oil solution intraluminally adminisetr ed. The percent change in diameter of the pyloric ring before and after the administrations was defined as the opening ratio, and the percent change in diameter between the maximally and minimally opened pyloric ring states was defined as the contraction ratio. Time until disappearance of the contraction ring(s) in the gastric antrum and side effects of the drugs were also determined. The openin g ratio was significantly higher in the peppermint oil administration group than in the hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection group. The contraction ratio was lower in the peppermint group. The time required for the disappearance of the antral contraction was shorter in the peppermint oil group (97.1\u00b111.4) than in the hyoscine-N-butylbromide group (185.9\u00b110.1 s; p<0.0001). No significant side effects were associated with peppermint oil, whereas such as hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection produced si de effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and urinary retention (Hiki et al., 2003). In nine (9) studies, 269 healthy subjects or patients were exposed to peppermint oil by either topical intraluminal (stomach or colon) or oral administration of single doses or 2 weeks treatment (n=19). Methods used to detect effects were oro-ceca l transit time by hydrogen expiration, total gastrointestinal transit time by carmine red method, gastric emptying time by radiolabelled test meal Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum sonography, direct observation of colonic motility or indirect recording through pressure changes or relieve of colonic spasms during barium enema exam ination. The dose range covered in single dose studies is 0.1-0.24 ml of peppermint oil per subjec t. With one exception, which show an unexplained potentiation of neostigmine stimulated colon activity ; all other studies result in effects, indicating a substantial spasmolytic effect of peppermint oil of the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. This effect commences as early as 0.5 minutes after topical (intestinal tract) application and may last up to 23 minutes. This is evidently a very short time period to treat e. g. IBS. To expose the target organ, i.e. the large bowel to a constant concentration of peppermint oil to maintain the short-lasting effect a sustained release formulation is needed to secure constant ex posure of the organ to constant concentrations of peppermint oil (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005a) Heartburn, one of the major adverse events of oral peppermint oil may be caused to a large extent by inappropriate release of the oil in the upper GI tract (Grigoleitb, 2005 citing Sigmund and McNally, 1969) resulting in relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter thus facilitating reflux. To minimize these adverse events an appropriate delayed release formulation may be useful (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005a). The effectiveness of peppermint oil added to barium sulphate suspension in relieving colonic muscle spasm during contrast barium enema examination was assessed in a double blind study with 141 patients. No residual spasm was evident in a signif icant proportion of patients in the treated group (60%) compared with the control group (35%). There were no adverse effects. (Sparks et al., 1995). Another comparative study, with 383 patients on DCBE (double-contrast barium contrast), with positive results from occult blood tests were performed. The patients were divided into 4 groups, peppermint in barium, peppermint in tube, Buscopan or no treatment. In the group using peppermint oil or buscopan, the rate of patients with non spasm examination was higher than that in no-treatment group ( p<0.0005 ). Peppermint oil had the same spasmolytic effect as the systemic administration of Buscopan (n-butylscopolamine.) in the transverse and descending colon (Asao et al., 2003). A pharmacodynamic study on the effect of peppermint oil (90 mg) and caraway oil on gastrointestinal motility in healthy volunteers was performed, using simultaneous determination of gastric and gall- bladder emptying and orocecal time, in comparison with placebo, cisapride and n-butylscopolamine. Peppermint oil shows a relaxing effect on the gallbladder ( p=0.04 ) and slows p=0.004 ) (Goerg and Spilker, 2003). 160 patients scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy were randomised in a double blind design. The objective was to determine the efficacy of peppermint oil versus placebo instillation over the ileocecal valve in the cecum, on the success rate and the durati on of time required for terminal ileum intubation. The time required for TI intubation was shorter in peppermint oil group (102 seconds) than the control group (137 seconds)- p=0.045 (Sanaka Madhusudhan et al., 2004). The effect of acute peppermint oil administration on intragastric pressure (IGP) profiles and gastric sensorimotor functions was investigated. Healthy volunteers underwent IGP measurement before and during continuous intragastric infusion of a nutrient drink (n=13), and gastric barostat studies (n=13). A single capsule of peppermint oil (182 mg) or placebo was administered during the studies in a randomised controlled crossover design. Throughout the studies, healthy volunteers scored 11 epigastric symptoms on a visual analogue scale (V AS); satiation was scored on a 6-point Likert scale during intragastric infusion. During fasting, IG P and motility index (MI) of the proximal stomach significantly decreased after peppermint oil administration compared with placebo (p<0.0001 and <0.05, respectively). In contrast, during intragastr ic infusion of the nutrient drink, no significant differences were detected between peppermint oil and placebo in IGP profiles, MI, satiation scores, and Assessment report on Mentha piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 45/101 epigastric symptoms. The maximum infused volume , gastric compliance or sensitivity to balloon distension did not differ between both treatment arms. However, reduced appetite scores were seen during fasting after peppermint oil treatment, as compared with placebo (p=0.01). Postprandial VAS scores were similar between peppermint oil and placebo. Peppermint oil reduces IGP, proximal phasic contractility, and appetite, with negligible effect s on gastric sensitivity, tone, accommodation, and nutrient tolerance in health (Papathanasopoulos et al., 2013). Respiratory action The inhalation of the peppermint essential oil for treating congestion due to common cold is believed to ease congestion, aiding respiration, by stimulatin g cold receptors in the respiratory tract (Eccles, 2003). A secretolytic action in the bronchi (ESCOP monographs, 2003, citing Hansel R et al., 1984, 1999, Haen 1989, Schilcher H 1986) and decongestant in the nose (ESCOP monographs, 2003 citing Reiter et al., 1985) were reported in several publications. Menthol The effects of inhalation of L-menthol, D-isomen thol and D-neomenthol, upon nasal resistance and sensation to airflow were investigated in 40 su bjects. L-menthol caused a highly significant enhancement of nasal sensation of airflow but despit e their great similarity in structure and a similar peppermint smell the isomers D-isomenthol and D-neomenthol had no effect on nasal sensation of airflow. These findings show that L-menthol has a specific pharmacological action on nasal sensory nerve endings which is not related to its peppermint smell. It seems that menthol acts upon trigeminal sensory nerve endings within the nose (Eccles et al., 1988). Lindemann et al., showed that menthol inhalation does not have an effect on nasal mucosal temperature and nasal patency with anterior rhinom anometry. They reported that menthol leads to a direct stimulation of cold receptors modulating the cool sensation, entailing the subjective feeling of a clear and wide nose in healthy subjects (Lindeman 2008 cited by Demirbas et al., 2 011). On other study by Pereira et al., (2013) the effects of menthol (L-menthol) inhalation were evaluated on upper airway resistance (UAR) in healthy hum an participants, without nasal congestion, while awake during quiet breathing. Menthol inhalation wa s not associated with any change in ventilation and UAR, suggesting that cold receptor stimulation does not modulate UAR in awake human subjects. Exercise performance An experiment with 12 healthy male students, consuming 500 ml bottle of mineral water containing 0.05 ml of peppermint oil for ten days effected changes in physiological parameters (spirometry and gas analysis) and functional indicators of exer cise performance. There was improvement in the spirometric measurements [forced vital capacity (FCV ), peak expiratory flow (PEF), peak inspiratory flow (PIF)] and ventilation during treadmill exercise, as well as an increase in the maximum chest circumferences. Also significant changes in the gas analysis after 10 days of the experiment were observed (Meamarbashi and Rajabi, 2013). Sleep/alertness action Twenty-one (21) healthy sleepers (11 women and 10 men) completed three consecutive laboratory sessions, to study the peppermint oil odour effect on polysomnographic sleep, alertness and mood, when presented before bedtime. Polysomnographic recordings, mood questionnaires like the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and the Profile of Mood States Questionnaire, and also Liker scales for stimulus perception, were performed. Peppermint reduced fatigue and improved mood. The subjects who rated peppermint as very intense had more total sleep than those rating it as moderately intense, showing Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 46/101 more slow-wave sleep then in the control session. It increased NREM sleep in women, but this was not true in men, where alertness was more evident than in women. So, there are individual factors influencing the results on the physiological sleep, self-rated mood and alertness (Adam et al., 2006). Another study examined the influence of essential oils and components (peppermint, jasmine, ylang- ylang, 1, 8-cineole and menthol) on core attentio n function. Six experimental groups were compared with corresponding control groups receiving wa ter (n=20-4 groups; n=30-2 groups). The results did not reach statistical significance. The authors indicate complex correlations between subjective evaluations of substances and objective performa nce, concluding that the effects are mainly psychological (Ilmberger et al., 2001). External use effects The topical application of peppermint oil produces a prolonged cold sensation at the site of application, by the stimulation of the cold-sensitive receptors, vi a a reversible, steric change, thus blocking voltage dependent type L (long lasting) calcium channels. This is going to depolarize the cold -sensitive receptors, transmitting more electrical charge possib ly responsible for the analgesic effect. Cold stimuli may exert a segmental inhibition of pain stimuli along the conduction pathways, and if the pain originates in the scalp or in the face it can be inhibited in the brain stem (Fachinfo Euminz, 1997). The application of peppermint oil plus ethanol (10% peppermint oil in ethanol 90%) to the foreheadshowed a significant reduction of the M temporalis waveand a pronounced increase in blood flow through the capillaries of the skin, as compared to the ethanol solution in the study on the EMG activity by Gobel et al., ( 1995) in 32 healthy subjects. Also the significant reduction of 7% (p<0.5) in the duration of late exteroceptive suppression (ES2) was achieved. Pain sensitivity to experimental ischaemia of the pericraneal musculature was significantly reduced by 27% (p<0.1) by the combination of peppermint oil plus ethanol (10% peppermint oil in ethanol 90%). Peppermint oil may act locally at the origin of the pain by modifying pain receptor sensitivity, giving an analgesic activity. Assessor's comment: Digestive action The principal pharmacodynamic effect of peppermint oil relevant to the gastrointestinal tract is a dose- related antispasmodic effect on the smooth musculatu re, due to the interference of menthol with the movement of calcium across the cell membrane. An appropriate delayed release formulation may be important to expose the colon to a constant concentration of peppermint oil to get a prolonged e ffect and avoid the inappropriate release of the oil in the upper GI tract, causing adverse effects like heartburn. The choleretic, cholagogic and antifoaming effects of peppermint oil may potentially play an additional role in its medicinal use. Respiratory action Various studies did not demonstrate a change on inspiratory or expiratory nasal airway resistance, but there was an enhancing of the sensation of nasal airway produced by the inhalation of menthol. External use effects The topical application of peppermint oil stimulates the cold sensitive receptors, exerting a local and a probably segmental inhibition of pain, producing an analgesic effect. The experimental laboratory findings point to the possible mechanism of action in tension headache. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) includin g data on relevant constituents Peppermint leaves Hurrell et al., (1999), observed that different polyphenol containing beverages reduce the bioavailability of non-heme iron. Herb from L. or complex polyphenol polymerization products (black tea and cocoa) were potent dose dependent inhibitors of Fe absorption and reduced absorption of a bread meal, depending on the content of total polyphenols. Eight separate Fe absorption studies were performed in a total of seventy seven healthy volunteer subjects, measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled Fe ( 55Fe or 59Fe) into erythrocytes. Compared with a water control meal, inhibition by black tea was 79-94%, peppermint tea 47%. At higher polyphenol concentrations (about 200mg per serving), black tea and peppermint tea were equally inhibitory, higher than the other beverages. Peppermint oil Oral administration Peppermint oil is relatively rapidly absorbed after or al administration and eliminated mainly via the bile (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005a). Menthol To determine the disposition kinetics and to examine subjective and cardiovascular effects of menthol, a crossover placebo-controlled study that compared pure menthol versus placebo, along with an uncontrolled exposure to menthol in food or bevera ge was conducted. Twelve subjects were studied; each received a 100 mg l-menthol capsule, a placebo capsule, and 10 mg menthol in mint candy or mint tea on three different occasions. Plasma an d urine levels of menthol and conjugated menthol (glucuronide), cardiovascular measurements, and su bjective effects were measured at frequent intervals. Menthol was rapidly metabolised, and only menthol glucuronide could be measured in plasma or urine. The plasma half-life of menthol glucuronid e averaged 56.2 minutes (95% [CI], 51.0 to 61.5) and 42.6 minutes (95% CI, 32.5 to 52.7) in menthol capsule and mint candy/mint tea conditions, respectively (p<0.05). The plasma area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios for menthol capsule to mint candy/mint tea treatment averaged 9.2 (95% CI, 8.2 to 10.1) (Hadley and Gaarder, 2005). In a randomised placebo-controlled study performe d, 2 4 healthy male Japanese volunteers were randomly assigned an L-menthol preparation (NPO-11) directly sprayed onto gastric mucosa which was assessed for tolerability and pharmacokinetics during gastrointestinal endoscopy. It was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations within 1 hour after administration. Single doses of NPO-11 up to 320 mg were well tolerated. 70% of the metabolites were excreted in the urine, the principal as menthol glucoronide and the others as mono or hydroxylated menthol derivatives. The treatment tended to decrease the occurrence of gastric perist alsis in relation with the period before (Hiki et al., 2011). In one randomised, double blind, two-way crossove r study with eleven (11) subjects, comparing the kinetics and effects of a single oral dose of felodipine ER tablet (Plendil 10 mg), with menthol (test) or placebo (reference), the effect of menthol on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of felodipine was studied in healthy subjects. The results concluded that the pharmacokinetics parameters of felodipine and dehydrofelodipine were not mark edly different during the measurements (Gelal, 2004). Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 48/101 After ingestion of enteric coated peppermint oil a patient suffering from achlorhydria described by Rhodes (1976), (cited by Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005a) complained of heartburn and eructation; investigations demonstrated that the capsule disintegrated in the stomach due to the high pH. Dermal Using sensitive and selective gas-chromatographic methods the systemic absorption was examined after skin application of camphor, menthol and me thyl salicylate. Concentration time profiles were erratic and variable and the half-lives relatively shorts (Martin et al., 2004). Excretion In a cross over study, excretion of menthol (as gluc uronide derivative) from orally ingested peppermint oil contained in enteric coated capsules was compared with oil contained in two soft gelatine capsules without enteric coating, each containing a total of 0.4 ml of peppermint oil. Urine was collected in 2-hourly intervals up to 14 hours plus one 10 hours sample up to 24 hours. Total 24 hours urinary excretion of menthol was similar in the two formulations in 6 healthy volunteers, but peak menthol excretion levels were lower and excretion delayed with enteric coated capsules. Menthol excretion was reduced in 6 ileostomy patients who took enteric coated capsules and moderate amounts of unmetabolised menthol were recovered from the ile ostomy effluent. This is consistent with the delayed-release form of peppermint oil. These results demonstrate that in a delayed-release form peppermint oil is released to a significant extent in the lower digestive tract and in the colon, where the antispasmodic effects are expected. The gelantine capsule release pattern does not meet the therapeutic requirements. (Somerville, 1984). Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that fractionated urin ary recovery of menthol is dependent on the kind of formulation used for the application of peppermint oil. Optimal pH triggered enteric coated formulations start releasing peppermint oil in the small intestine extending release over 10-12 hours thus providing peppermint oil to the target organ in irritable bowel syndrome, i.e. the colon. The hypothesis is supported by anecdotal observations in patients with achlorhydria or ileostoma, respectively (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005a) It is unknown if peppermint oil constituents are excreted in human breast milk. 4.2. Clinical efficacy 4.2.1. Dose response studies There are no dose-finding studies available. The recommended dosage of 0.2 ml-0.4ml of peppermint oil for adolescents, adults, elderly (2-3 times daily) and 0.2 ml of peppermint oil for children over 8 years (3 times daily) are supported by clinical investigations as cited below, for the trea tment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 4.2.2. Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials) Peppermint oil Oral administration A - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Controlled studies Multiple controlled clinical studies were performed us ing several diagnostic criteria, some predating the Rome process and including small groups, not adequate to demonstrate statistical significance versus Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 49/101 placebo, as it is expressed in table 4. The studies cited in text below have the most significant number of patients and are more eligible for conclusions. Liu et al., (1997) conducted a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in one hundred ten (110) outpatients (66 men/44 wome n; 18-70 years of age) with symptoms of IBS. Fifty-two patients on peppermint oil (one capsule containing 187 mg of peppermint oil) and 49 on placebo completed the study three to four times daily, 15-30 minutes before meals, for one month. Forty-one patients on peppermint oil (79%) experienced an alleviation of the severity of abdominal pain (29 were pain-free); 43 (83%) had less abdominal distension, 43 (83%) had reduced stool frequency, 38 (73%) had borborygmi, and 41 ( 79%) less flatulence. Co rresponding figures for the placebo group were: 21 patients (43%) with reduced pain (4 were pain-free), 14 (29%) with reduced distension, 16 (32%) with reduced stool frequency, 15 (31%) with fewer borborygmi, and 11 (22%) with less flatulence. Symptom improvements af ter peppermint oil were significantly better than after placebo (p<0.05; Mann-Whitney U-test). One patient on peppermint oil experienced heartburn (because of chewing the capsules) and one develo ped a mild transient skin rash. There were no significant changes in liver function test results. 3 patients on peppermint oil and 6 on placebo dropped-out. The random sequence generation on this study was not described. The expected outcomes were reported. Capanni et al., (2005) included one hundred seventy eight (178) consecutive patients with IBS in a randomised, double blind controlled trial, using the Ro me II diagnostic criteria, to evaluate the efficacy of peppermint oil formulation. The randomisation was by computer generated lists. The outcome was measured by a validated questionnaire every 3 weeks. The test group (91 patients (22 M, 69 F), mean age 41 years old; range 18-72 years old) received enteric coated capsules of 225 mg 2 capsules, 3 times a day, before meals for 3 months and the placebo group (87 patients (23 M, 64 F; mean age 44 years old; range 21-74 years old) received 225 mg of maltodextrin with mint flavour. 3 dropouts due to other diseases and 2 due to pyrosis. Peppermint oil, improved IBS overall symptoms [73/91 (80%) (43%) patien ts.(p<0.04). The authors found a statistically significant benefit for peppermint oil relative to placebo for global improvement in IBS symptoms. All expected outcomes were described and the meth ods used for randomization were reported. Cappello et al., ( 2007) performed a study with 57 patients with IBS, without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance and celiac disease randomisation computer generated) according to Rome II criteria using two enteric-coated capsules (225 mg each capsule) twice per day or placebo 1 hour before meals for 4 weeks in a double blind study. The patients of age under 18 and over 80 years, previous surgery on the abdomen except appendectomy, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic diverticular disease, intestinal neoplasia, systemic disease, thyroid disease and chronic assumption of medication that could interfere with intestinal mo tility, secretion and sensation were excluded. The symptoms were assessed before therapy (T(0)), af ter the first 4 weeks of therapy (T(4)) and 4 weeks after the end of therapy (T(8)). The symptoms eval uated were: abdominal bloating, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea, constipation, feeling of inco mplete evacuation, pain at defecation, passage of gas or mucus and urgency at defecation. A score from 0 to 4was used for each symptom intensity and frequency. The total irritable bowel syndrome sympto ms score was also calculated as the mean value of the sum of the average of the intensity and frequency scores of each symptom. The data from fifty patients, were available for comparison. 7 dropou ts, 1 due to pyrosis occured. Twenty-four (24) patients were in the peppermint oil group (18 women, 6 men; mean age 42, range 22-58) and 26 patients (20 women and 6 men; mean age 40, range 20-60) in the placebo group. At T(4), 75% of the patients in the peppermint oil group showed a>50% reduction of basal (T(0)) total irritable bowel syndrome symptoms score compared with 38% in the placebo group (p<0.009). A statistically Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 50/101 significant reduction of the total irritable bowel syndrome symptoms score was found with peppermint oil at T(4) and at no change was found with the placebo. (* 2-test). The authors concluded that there is a stastically significant benefit for peppermint oil relative to placebo for global improvement in IBS symptoms. The methods of randomization were described and all expected outcomes were reported. Merat et al., (2010) conducted a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study on ninety (90) outpatients with IBS (Rome II criteria). The symptoms and quality of life was evaluated after the first, fourth, and eighth weeks. Patients were randomised into study or placebo groups using a computer-generated randomization table. Patients in the study group took one capsule containing 187 mg or 0.2 ml of peppermint oil, three times daily 30 minutes before each meal for 8 weeks. The placebo group received an identical looking placebo. Ninety patients were included, 45 in each group. Sixty patients completed the study. The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain in 53 (88.3%) followed by distension in 52 (86.7%) and flatulence in 50 (83.3%). The number of subjects free from abdominal pain or discomfort changed from 0 at week 0 to 14 at week 8 in the peppermint oil group and from 0 to 6 in controls (p<0.001). The severity of abdominal pain was also reduced significantly in the peppermint oil group as compared to controls. Quality of life in the two groups did not differ significantly at th e beginning of the trial but after eight weeks, the patients on peppermint oil showed statistically sign ificant improvement in the SF-36 domains of bodily pain, general health, social functioning, and role lim itations due to emotional problems as compared to controls. The summary scores, however, were not significantly different. The authors point some limitations to the study. The major is the number of participants who were lost to follow-up (30%) and another limitation was related with the fact that the researcher and patient questionnaires were not validated. Alam et al., ( 2013, abstract), observed the efficacy of peppermint oil for relieving the symptoms and changes of QoL in diarrhoea predominant IBS, thro ugh a prospective double blind randomised placebo- controlled study from July 2008 to September 2009. Patients who fulfilled ROME II were initially selected with exclusion of those presenting signs or any organic disease. Seventy four (74) patients were enrolled in the study and randomly allocated to receive either peppermint oil (unspecified) or placebo three times daily for six weeks. The symptoms were assessed on a three week interval during treatment and two weeks after the end of treatment. Sixty five (65) patients completed the trial. It was observed that, at six weeks of therapy abdominal pain is markedly improved (mean\u00b1SD) 4.94\u00b11.30 in peppermint oil group compared with 6.15\u00b11.24 in placebo group and the difference was highly statistically significant (p>0.001). But two w eeks after end of trials pain score again increased (6.09\u00b11.93). Other symptoms and quality of life did not improve significantly. The authors conclude that the study demonstrate that peppermint oil is e ffective in transiently relieving only abdominal pain in diarrhoea predominant IBS. As there is no adeq uate information about the dose, no conclusion can be reached for this monograph. Cash et al., (2016) evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a novel formulation of peppermint oil designed for sustained release in the small intestine in patients with IBS-M and IBS-D. They performed a 4-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlle d clinical trial of peppermint oil (180mg per capsule) or identical placebo 3 times daily in patien ts fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBSM (mixed type) or IBS-D (diarrhoea ). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) after 4 weeks of treatment. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 51/101 Seventy two (72) patients, peppermint oil (n=35) or placebo (n=37) were selected and had to meet Rome III criteria for IBS-M or IBS-D with an average daily IBS related abdominal pain rating of 4 on a 0-10 scale and a Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) of 2 on a 0-4 scale. Subjects had to be between 18 and 60 years of age, and had to confirm that they were not planning to change their usual diet and lifestyle during the study. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of IBS-C (constipation predominant) or IBSU (unclassified) as defined by the Rome III criteria or a history of inflammatory or immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders, including celiac disease. Also excl uded were subjects with a history of organic gastrointestinal disorders including intestinal obstruct ion, stricture, toxic megacolon, perforation, impaction, adhesions, cholecystitis, or major gastrointestinal surgery, including cholecystectomy. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of cardiovascular events, uncontrolled hypertension, uns table renal, hepatic, metabolic, or hematologic conditions, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or a history of alcohol abuse or binge drinking. Subjects who refused to discontinue one or more prohibited medications for at least 7 days before beginning the baseline diary and throughout the remainder of the study were excluded. The protocol did not allow concomitant or rescue medications during the trial. The randomization scheme was computer generated, using the PLAN procedure wi th SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) and concealed allocation of assignment was utilised via a central randomisation centre. The primary endpoint was change in the TISS from baseline 28 days after the start of therapy. The trial was conducted at four geographically divers e study sites in the USA, in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP). Secondary outcomes included the TISS score at 24 hours after start of therapy, reduction from baseline in the frequency and intensit y of the 8 individual symptoms included in the TISS (abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating or distension, pain at evacuation, urgency of BM, constipation, diarrhoea, passage of mucus or gas, and sense of incomplete evacuation), reduction in severe or unbearable symptom intensity and freq uency, and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The delivery system for peppermint oil us ed in this study consists of a triple-coated microsphere formulation with sustained release of pepp ermint oil in the small intestine, to improve the tolerability. At 4 weeks, peppermint oil was associated with a 40% reduction in the TISS from baseline (mean change-1.16, SD\u00b10.807), superior to the 24.3% decrease (mean change-0.70, SD\u00b10.737) observed with placebo (p=0.0246). The decrease in the TISS of 19.6% (mean change-0.55, SD\u00b10.613) in the peppermint oil group at 24 hours was also signific antly larger than placebo (-10.3%, mean change- 0.27, SD\u00b10.342) (p=0.0092). At trial completion, patients in the peppermint oil group experienced greater improvement in multiple individual gastro intestinal symptoms as well as in severe or unbearable symptoms, compared to placebo. Peppe rmint oil was well tolerated with few adverse events. Withdrawals were rare, with more than 94% of randomised subjects completing the trial. The 4 individual IBS symptoms that were more responsive to peppermint oil (abdominal pain or discomfort, abdominal bloating or distension, pain at evacua tion, and urgency of BM) were clustered around viscerosensory perception, compared to motility relate d symptoms such as constipation, diarrhoea, or passage of gas or mucus. This TISS scale has never been used to measure 24 hours efficacy and has not been previously validated. The authors explained that this scale was chosen base d on its previous use in a trial of peppermint oil in patients (Cappello, 2007) with IBS as well as the fact that there is no specific regulatory guidance Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 52/101 regarding endpoints for a randomised controlled trial including patients with more than one IBS subtype. Reviews/Meta-analysis In the review of Grigoleit and Grigoleit (2005b), 16 clinical trials in the literature search using 180-200 mg enteric-coated peppermint oil in IBS or recurre nt abdominal pain in children (1 study) with 651 patients enrolled were identified. There was a prevalence of women. Some of the studies were performed before the Rome II criteria, but according to the authors of this review, the inclusion criteria appear to be adequa te. The treatment duration was from 2 to 11 weeks and in one open study was 6 months. Nine out of 16 studies were randomised double blind cross over trials with (n=5) or without (n=4) run in and/or wash out periods, five had a randomised double-blind parallel group design and two were open label studies. Placebo served in 12 and an ticholinergics in three studies as comparator. In 11 of the studies there was a daily patient rating of selected symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension, flatulence, stool frequency, urgency, bloa ting, stool quality, freque ncy of attacks, severity of attacks, or the overall assessment. In two studie s, the rating by patients was at intervals of two weeks. In two studies the interval was not given. In one open trial the physician rating was at the end of the week. To make this data comparable, the va riable \"overall success\" was used (% of responders) (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005b). Eight out of 12 placebo-controlled studies show statistically significant effects in favour of PO. Average response rates in terms of \"overall success\" are 58% (range 39-79%) for peppermint oil and 29% (range 10-52%) for placebo. The three studies versus smooth muscle relaxants did not show differences between treatments hinting for equivalence of treatments. A total of 71 patients dropped out most of them for reasons unrelated with the study. Other reasons were (n=6 worsening of symptoms, peppermint oil or placebo; n=2 nausea and vomiting by peppermint oil; n=3 perianal burning by peppermint oil; n=2 peppermint taste and pyrosis). Adverse events reported were generally mild and transient, but very specific. Peppermint oil caused the typical GI effects like heartburn and anal/perianal burning or discomfort sensations, whereas the anticholinergics caused dry mouth and blurred vision. Anticholinergics and 5HT3/4-antagonists do not offer superior improvement rates; placebo response s cover the range as in peppermint oil trials, conclude the authors (Grigoleit and Grigoleit 2005b). The authors concluded that the clinical data in IBS reveals that peppermint oil in an enteric coated form is safe and efficacious in a sufficient number of studies, as a symptomatic remedy in a short term treatment (Grigoleit and Grigoleit 2005b).

I t s h o u l d b e n o t e d t h a t s o m e o f t h e older studies had serious methodological problems including vague inclusion criteria for patients and treatment periods that were too short. Five double blind, placebo-controlled RCTs were entered in a met aanalysis and scored at least 3 of 5 points on the scoring system to measure the likelihood of bias (Carling et al., 1989, Dew et al., 1984, Lech et al., 1988, Nash et al., 1986, Rees et al., 1979). Three (3) studies had to be excluded from the meta- analyses. Two studies (Lawson et al., 1988, Schneider et al., 1990) presented data in insufficient detail and one study (Shaw et al., 1991) was not double-blind and placebo controlled. In five trials the treatment period ranged from two to four (2-4) w eeks and the doses were 0.2 to 0.4 ml three times daily. In the descriptive review, one small controll ed trial suggested that stress treatment had better results than peppermint oil on a period of six months. The other two trials, placebo controlled, had or no significant improvement on pain re lief or no difference from placebo.

Two (2) trials (Carling et al., 1989, Nash et al., 1986) could not demonstrate a significant difference between peppermint oil and placebo. Three studies (Dew et al., 1984, Lech et al., 1988 Rees et al., 1979) significantly favour treatment with peppermint oil over placebo. Overall, this metaanalysis suggests a significant (p<0.001) positive effect of peppermint oil compared with placebo in the symptomatic treatment of IBS. Three of eight trials (Dew et al., 1984, Nash et al., 1 986, Schneider and Otten 1990) failed to define any inclusion criteria for patients with IBS. Thus, a definitive classification of 44% of the patients studied is impossible. The authors concluded that the role of peppermint oil in the symptomatic treatment of IBS is far from established. Well desi gned and carefully executed studies are needed to clarify the role of peppermint oil in IBS. (Pittler and Ernst 1998). A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using databases such as Medline, Embase, Cochrane controlled trials register up to April 2008 to determine the effect of fibers, antispasmodics and peppermint oil in the treatm ent of IBS was performed by Ford (2008). The comparison used was the placebo or no treatment and the minimum duration of therapy considered Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 56/101 was one week. The studies had to report either a global assessment of cure of or improvement in symptoms, or cure of or improvement in abdominal pain (primary outcomes). In this report, just the results involving peppermint oil are mentioned. Four studies compared peppermint oil with placebo in 392 patients - Lech et al., 1 988, Liu et al., 1 997, Capanni 2005 and Cappello 2007. The proportion of women in each trial ranged from 40% to 76%. Only one study reported on disease subtype according to stool pattern and recruited 25% of patients with predominant constipation and 75% with predominant diarrhoea. Fifty two (52) out of 197 (26%) patients randomised to peppermint oil had persistent symptoms compared with 127 of 195 (65%) receiving placebo (relative risk 0.43, 0.32 to 0.59), with statistically significant heterogeneity detected between studie s (I2=31.1%, p=0.23). The number needed to treat with peppermint oil to prevent one patient having persistent symptoms was 2.5 (2.0 to 3.0). When only the three studies that scored 4 or more on the Jadad scale were considered in the analysis, the relative risk of persistent symptoms was of a similar magnitude (0.40, 0.29 to 0.55), with no statistically significant heterogeneity detected between studies (I2=22.0%, p=0.28). Peppermint oil was superior to placebo, besides th e statistically significant heterogeneity detected between the results. Three of the four studies scored more than 4 on the Jadad scale, but the treatment effect was similar when only these stud ies were included in the meta-analysis, and the heterogeneity observed was no longer detected. According to the authors, this systematic revi ew and meta-analysis shows that ispaghula husk, antispasmodics (particularly hyoscine), and peppermint oil are all effective treatments for IBS. More trials including more patients, defined according to the Rome criteria and using validated outcome measures are warranted (Ford et al., 2008). In a systematic review from Cochrane (Ruepert et al., 2011) to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, a total of 56 studies (3725 patients) were included. These included 12 studies of bulking agents (621 patients), 29 of antispasmodics (2333 patients) and 15 of antidepressants (922 patients). The risk of bias was low for most items. Primary outcome measures included: Improvement of symptoms of abdominal pain; Improvement of patients overall global assessment and Improvement of IBS-symptom score. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A sensitivity analysis excluded studies with poor methodological quality. 5 studies of peppermint oil were included. A statistically significant effect for improvement of global assessment was found for peppermint oil (RR 2.25; 95% CI 1.70 to 2.98; 225 patients) (cited Capanni et al., 2005; Lech et al., 1988). A statistically significant effect for improvement of IBS symptom score was found for peppermint oil (RR 1.94; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.46; 269 patients) al., 2005; Cappello et al., 2007; Czalbert et al., 1990). None of the studies involving peppermint-oil had adequate allocation concealment. When the authors analysed the studies with adequate allocation conc ealment separately, the results get weaker and only improvement of abdominal pain still has a statisti cally significant benefit. According to them, spasmolytics are extensively studied for their use in the treatment of IBS, however due to the diversity of types of spasmolytic agents, the number of studies for each compound are limited. Therefore most subgroups could not be pooled, and a type II error could have occurred. The authors concluded that the subgroup analyses for different types of antispasmodics found statistically significant benefits for cimteropium/ dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. (Ruepert et al., 2011). Another systematic review and meta-analysis (Khanna et al., 2014) assessed the efficacy and safety of enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules compared with placebo for the treatment of active irritable syndrome (IBS). The authors made a literature se arch on MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library up to February 2013 and considered randomised placebo-controlled trials with minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks and Cro ssover studies that provided outcome data before the first cross-over. Patients of any age with active IBS as defined by the Manning, Rome I, or Rome II criteria or clinical symptoms with the exclusion of organic disease were considered for inclusion. An additional 8 studies were identified by searching conference proceedings and the references of review articles. Outcomes included global improvement of IBS symptoms, improvement in abdominal pain, and adverse events. Outcomes were analysed using an intention-to-treat approach. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Nine (9) studies that evaluated 726 patients were identified. Data were anal ysed using the Cochrane Collaboration software Review Manager (RevMan 5). The risk of bias was low for most of the factors assessed. The preparations used were caps (0.1 or 0.2 ml peppermint oil (5 studies), mint oil (225g peppermint oil) (3 studies) and one unspecified, against placebo. Six (6) of the eight (8) trials included in the Pittler and Ernst review had treatment periods of 1month. Two of the studies included in the presen t meta-analysis had treatment periods of 8 and 12 weeks and found a statistically significant benefit for peppermint oil relative to placebo for improvement in abdominal pain and global IBS symptoms. The authors conclude that peppermint oil is a sa fe and effective short-term treatment for IBS. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 58/101 Characteristics of included studies (Khanna et al., 2014): Peppermint oil versus placebo: global improvement. CI indicates confidence interval: Peppermint oil versus placebo: improvement in abdominal pain. CI indicates confidence interval: Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 59/101 Summary of Findings Table: A review from Wall et al., 2014, summarizes the recent evidence-based treatment of IBS including older, \"classic\" treatments as well as newer agents and \"alternative\" therapies in IBS. This review reports the results for peppermint oil of Ford et al., review (2008). The authors conclude that, despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiolog y of this disorder, targeted treatments do not exist yet. Based on the literature reviewed in this review, the authors have constructed an algorithm to guide practicing clinicians to treat this disorder, in cluding peppermint oil capsules in the first line, as well dicyclomine, pinavarium and trimebutine for \"Abdominal pain with mixed bowel symptoms (IBS- M)\", for 4-6 weeks. The American College of Gastroenterology published a Monograph on the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Idiopathic Constipation (Ford et al., 2014), considering the evidence grade of the treatments available. It included m anuscripts that studied adults (aged > 16 years) using any Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 60/101 definition of IBS or CIC. For IBS, this included a clinician defined diagnosis, the Manning criteria the Kruis score or Rome I, II or III criteria. For CIC, th is included symptoms diagnosed by any of the Rome criteria as well as a clinician-defined diagnosis. They included only parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active interventi on with either placebo or no therapy. Crossover trials were eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were provided at the end of the first treatment period, before crossover. For IBS, the following treatments were considered: 1. Diet and dietary manipulation 2. Fiber 3. Interventions that modify the microbiota: probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics 4. Antispasmodics 5. Peppermint oil 6. Loperamide 7. Antidepressants 8. Psychological therapies, including hypnotherapy 9. Serotonergic agents 10. Prosecretory agents 11. Polyethylene glycol Summary of results of monograph on interventions for IBS (Ford 2014): 5 RCTs for peppermint oil were included (Cappani et al., 2005, Cappello et al., 2007, Lech et al., 1988, Liu et al., 1997, Merat et al., 2010) involving 492 patients, using an enteric-coated preparation of Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 61/101 peppermint oil employed in doses ranging from 187 to 225 mg per single dose, 2-6 single doses per day, divided in two to four times daily. The authors mention that the most of the trials did not differentiate between the types of IBS patients recruited, with only one study, from Capanni provid ing data on this, considering only one RCT (Merat) at low risk of bias, with the remainder being unclear. The authors conclude that there was a statistically significant effect in favour of pepper mint oil compared with placebo with the NNT of 3 (95% CI 2-4). Adverse events were not higher on peppermint oil groups compared to placebo (RR of experiencing any adverse event=1.26, 95% CI 0.75-2.12). The conclusion by the authors was: Peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms. The risk of adverse events is no greater with peppermint oil than with placebo. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: moderate. In specific formulations, which may not be universa lly available, peppermint oil is effective in IBS. B -Dyspepsia Controlled studies A placebo controlled double-blind study has been studied in sixty nine (69) women in the treatment of abdominal distension and dyspepsia following routin e gynaecological surgery, using Peppermint oil in enteric coated capsules, 187 mg/caps., 2 capsules, 3 times per day, during 5 days. No differences were found in abdominal distension, flatulence or abdominal pain between the two groups. Peppermint oil was not effective, but safe (Barnick and Cardozo, 1990). In a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, mult icentre, 4-week trial, thirty nine (39) patients with dyspepsia (non ulcerative), and moderate to se vere pain were given a combination (of peppermint (90mg) and caraway oil (50mg). Decrease in pain intensity was significantly greater in the treatment group (15 days - 84.2%, p=0.002; 29 days - 89.9%, p=0.015) than in the placebo group (15 days - 50%; 29 days - 45%) (Barnick and Cardozo, 1990). C - Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting Controlled study A randomised, double-blind clinical trial st udy was performed to assess the efficacy of Mentha spicata (M. spicata) in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Prior to the study, patients were ra ndomly assigned into four groups to receive M. spicata or M. \u00d7 piperita. The inclusion criteria were patients with any cancer diagnosis (colon adeno-carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, liver cancer, cancer, sarcoma, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, and vaginal cancer), who were about to receive chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, and who were chemotherapy na\u00efve. Patients who were experiencing nausea and vomiting from causes ot her than chemotherapy reasons (i.e. intestinal obstruction, stomach cancer, pre-menstrual syndrome , motion sickness), or were deemed physically incapable of participating by the investigators, were excluded from the study. The treatment and placebo groups applied essential oils of M. spicata, M. \u00d7 piperita , via the oral route or a placebo, while the control group continued with their previous antiemetic regimen. Patients or Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 62/101 guardians recorded the number of emetic events, th e intensity of nausea over 20 h of chemotherapy, as well as any possible adverse effects that occurred during this time. During each cycle, patients received their normal antiemetic regimen (granisetron, dexamethason or metocloprimide) plus spearmint and peppermint capsules (containing two drops of each essential oil every four hours, filled with sugar, and admini stered 30 minutes before they received their chemotherapy treatment, again four hours after first capsule and finally four hours later at home) for all patients, independent of their age or weight. No significant side effects were found when increasing the dose. Fifty (50) patients were analysed for each group. Patients treated with M. spicata and peppermint oil were found to have a statistically significant reduction of the median emetic events during 24 h of treatment (acute phase) in which patients treated with placebo presented up to 1.8 emetic events versus 0.6 and 0.7 in the M. spicata and M. \u00d7 piperita , respectively (p<0.05). The intensity of nausea was also significantly reduced in the M. spicata and M. \u00d7 piperita groups during 24 h of treatment compared with placebo (p<0.05). There was no statistical difference between spearmin t and peppermint in controlling emetic events and intensity of nausea (p>0.05). The authors concluded that the essential oils of spearmint and peppermint are less expensive, and a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis in patients. (Tayarani-Najaran et al., 2013). Post-operative Nausea A study was performed with eighteen (18) patients in a three condition experimental design, to investigate the efficacy of peppermint oil on the relief of postoperative nausea in gynaecological surgical patients - (control group - no treatment; placebo - peppermint essence; experimental - peppermint oil), isolated from each other's due to the volatile nature of the compound. The experimental group had an increased number of intra-abdominal procedures, received more opioid analgesia postoperatively and required le ss traditional antiemetics (Tate, 1997). External application Tension headache Controlled studies The analgesic effect of peppermint oil (10% in ethanol) was investigated in thirty two (32) healthy subjects in a double blind placebo-controlled, randomised, four-fold crossover study. Neurophysiological, psychological and experimental algesimetric parameters were investigated. Four different test preparations were applied to larg e areas of the forehead and temples using a small sponge. Preparations containing peppermint with or without Eucalyptus were superior in pain reduction and had a muscle relaxing and mentally relaxing effect. (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994, 1995). Compared to the application of placebo, 10% pepper mint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p<0.01). This clinically significant reduction in pain intensity was sustained over the one-hour observation period (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994, 1995). The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil prep aration on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study. The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and the corresponding placebo. The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90%) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90% ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 63/101 were added for blinding purposes . The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance. The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of fory one (41) patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification, for 14, 12 years on 4. 99 days per month. No other medication with po ssible effect on the symptoms was allowed. The patients were accepted in the order of appearance in the out-patient clinic and went through examination phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 in a balance se quence according to the randomization schedule (Latin squares). A minimum interval of 24h betw een two subsequent episodes had to beobserved. Cutaneous application consisted of spreading the o il largely across forehead and temples and repeated twice (after 15 and 30 minutes). The patients rated their pain intensities according to a standardised categorical rating scale - 0 (no pain) to 4 (severe). The 10% peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p <0.01 ), compared to placebo. This clinically significant reduction in pain intensity was sustained over the one-hour observation period. Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p< 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10% peppermint oil in ethanol solution (G\u00f6bel et al., 1996). The topical application of peppermint oil produces a prolonged cold sensation at the site of application, by the stimulation of the cold-sensitive re ceptors, generating an analgesic effect. Safety data were available for one hundr ed fifty (150) Patients without AE\u00b4s. Analgesic effect Case study Report of a post-herpetic neuralgia study, on a 76 years woman, with relief of the pain during 4-6 hours after the local application of peppermint oil (containing 10% menthol). During two months of treatment she continued to feel the same effect (Davies et al., 2002) Table 4A: Clinical studies Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 64/101 Type (aim) and objective(s) of Study Reference Study Design and Type of Control Study duration (if available) Test Product(s): herbal preparation, pharmaceutical form; Dosage Regimen; Route of Administration Duration of treatment Number of Subjects (including age, sex, drop out) Healthy Subjects or Diagnosis of Patients (inclusion criteria) Outcomes (primary and secondary endpoints) Statistical analysis (e.g. ITT yes/no, CI 95%) Quality score e.g. Jadad score Comments on clinical relevance of results Review of clinical studies for IBS Rees et al., 1979 Double-blind placebo cross-over study, wash out period of 3 weeks Peppermint oil 0.2 ml in enteric-coated capsules, 1-2/day 18 patients. 2 dropouts Patients with IBS IBS symptoms using scores assessed by the patients Peppermint oil group overall assessment significantly better - p<0.001 Peppermint oil group better for abdominal pain p<0.05 The differences of the analysis of the symptom grade with the placebo were not statistically significant Paired T test Small group, insufficient to assess the clinical relevance.

Clinical studies in special popula tions (e.g. elderly and children) Peppermint leaves A double-blind crossover study was performed in thirty (30) infants attending IMIP, Recife, Brazil. They were randomised to use formulation of leaves of the Mentha piperita (liquid drops; 1 drop per Kg body weight) or simethicone (liquid drops; 2.5 mg pe r Kg body weight) daily for a period of 7 days (no information about the preparation of Mentha piperita leaves) in the treatment of infantile colic with either drug. This study was carried out using a cro ssover double-blind design. Each child aged from 8 to 56 days (33\u00b111.1) underwent an intervention for 14 days. Primary outcomes were mother's opinion about resp onses to the treatment, number of daily episodes of colic, and time spent crying, measured by a ch ronometer. Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were used to compare the results. This study was previo usly approved by the Ethical Committee in Research at IMIP. At baseline daily episodes of infantile colic were 3.9 ( \u00b11.1) and the mean crying time per day was 192 minutes ( \u00b151.6). At the end of the study daily episodes of colic fell to 1.6 ( \u00b10.6) and the crying duration decreased to 111 ( \u00b128) minutes. All mothers reported decrease of frequency and duration of the episodes of infantile colic and there were no differences between responses to Mentha piperita and simethicone (Alves et al., 2012). Peppermint oil Clinical studies in children In a randomised, double-blind controlled trial of tw o weeks, forty two (42) children and adolescents (8 to 17 years old) with irritable bowel syndrome were given pH dependent enteric coated peppermint oil capsules (187 mg), or placebo. The patients weighi ng more than 45 kg received 2 capsules, 3 times a day. The smaller children, who weighed 30 kg to 45 kg, received 1 capsule 3 times a day. After two weeks, for 75% of those receiving peppermint oil redu ced severity of pain associated with the IBS, but not the other symptoms, like heartburn, gas, urge ncy of stools, belching, stool pattern or stool consistency, was reported. No adve rse events were reported (Kline et al., 2001). Systematic review Abstracts and full texts of 57 randomised controlled trials on recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children were evaluated; 10 of them met the inclusio n criteria involving children aged 5 to 18 years, diagnosis of RAP, randomization and controlled stud y. Famotidine, Pizotifen, cognitive-behavioural therapy, biofeedback and peppermint oil enteric-co ated capsules (1 study) showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes compared to the control (Weydert et al., 2003). 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy Peppermint leaves The clinical studies are mainly related with combin ations and the clinical study in children gives no information about the preparation used. For these reasons only the traditional use is justified. Peppermint oil Oral administration IBS Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 81/101 IBS is a functional bowel disorder in which abdomina l pain or discomfort is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation (Longstreth et al., 2006). The Rome foundation team diagnostic criteria of Irritable Bowel Syndrome always presumes the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation fo r the symptoms and is made only by a physician. After a consensus approach, the Rome Foundation team considering the available evidence and multinational expert opinions revised the Rome II diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the Rome III (Drossman et al., 2006, Longstreth et al., 2006). The Rome process is a dynamic one, thus in June 2016, there was another update and the Rome IV criteria for diagnosing functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders was published. Rome IV has several changes in how functional bowel disorders are described and diagnosed. Previous versions of Rome considered functional bowel disorders such as IBS, functional diarrhoea, functional constipation, and functional distension (Rome I) as separate entities. Later it was recognised that these disorders could overlap (Rome II-Rome III). However, in the clinic it may be not be possible to confidently separate disorders into separate entities. Such is the case of IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C) from functional constipation or IBS-D from functional diarrhoea. Thus, Rome IV considers that these disorders exist as a continuum rather than as single entities (Schmulson and Drossman, 2017). Rome III Criteria for Diagnosing IBS: a Rome IV Criteria for Diagnosing IBS:c Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfortb at least 3 days per month in the last 3 months associated with two or more of the following: Improvement with defecation Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool Recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following criteria: Related to defecation Associated with a change in frequency of stool Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. aCriterion fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis. b\"Discomfort\" means an uncomfortable sensation not described as pain. cCriteria fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis. Pain is still an essential part of the diagnosis, but the word \"discomfort\" has been removed. The frequency of abdominal pain has been slightly increased, from 3 days per month to 1 day per week. In terms of IBS subtypes, IBS is mainly classified according to the predominant bowel habit for IBS-C (constipation), IBS-D (diarrhoea), IBS with mixed bowel habits, and unclassified IBS. In Rome IV, bowel habits are based on stool forms only during days with abnormal bowel movements (more than one-fourth: 25% of bowel movements). This is in contrast to Rome III in which the 25% threshold was determined based on the total number of bowel movements irrespective of whether they were normal or not. In fact this led to a Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 82/101 predominance of unsubtyped IBS using Rome III as it was the case in several epidemiological studies the USA and Latin America (Schmulson and Drossman, 2017). The pathogenesis of IBS seems to be multifactorial , with several factors, such as heritability and genetics, dietary/intestinal microbiota, low-grade in flammation and disturbances in the neuroendocrine system of the gut, playing a central role. The diag nosis is based on clinical assessment and the Rome III criteria, which in general is not used by most clinicians consulted by IBS patients, who seek advice and require more clinical investigation to achieve the correct diagnosis (El-Salhy, 2012). It affects more women than men and is more commo n in patients 30 to 50 years of age (Hadley and Gaarder, 2005). Throughout the world, about 10%-20% of adults and adolescents have symptoms consistent with IBS. IBS symptoms come and go over time, often overlap wi th other functional disorders, impair quality of life and result in high health care costs. (Longstreth et al., 2006). According to the \"Guideline on the evaluation of medi cinal products for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome\" (CPMP/EWP/785/97 Rev. 1, Set 2014), \"there is still a lack of adequately studied and more so of licensed medications in Europe, and a certain unmet medical need for IBS has still to be realised. Moreover, there is a wide history of unsuccessful dr ug development programmes in the field, and the number of Marketing Authorisation Applications for th e indication has been very low during the past decade''. Pharmacological options are usually recommended if non-pharmacological methods alone have proven to be ineffective. Most of the current pharmacologi cal therapies aim at treating the symptoms with the rationale of modulating intestinal motility and/or secretion, decreasing visceral sensitivity or treating associated disorders, such are anxiety and/or depression. The general recommendation is to use the Rome III criteria for inclusion, and to add a relevant diagnostic work-up for the most relevant potential other diseases. This Guideline recommends, for the time being, as sessing the main symptomatology in, at least, partially validated scales/outcome parameters. Because the main symptoms in IBS are considered to be abdominal pain/discomfort, along with abnormalit ies in defecation (consistency and frequency of stools), and there is ongoing controversy on whether abdominal discomfort is a symptom distinctly different from abdominal pain (and whether it should be evaluated together or separately), the main endpoints are now recommended along with the Rome III definitions. The two components included in the proposed primary endpoint should therefore be the evaluation of abdominal pain and the evaluation of stool frequency for IBS-C (based on the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week), and the evaluation of stool consistency for IBS-D, based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale. For other subtypes of IBS, an d for \"global\" development programmes intending to treat two or more subtypes, the use of the glob al assessment is, however, still recommended. The primary endpoint should be evaluated primarily as responder rate. The numerical evaluation of changes in scales is regarded to be a secondary endpoint. For the evaluation of abdominal pain, the use of a 11-point NRS-scale has at least been partially validated for use in IBS, and is therefore regarded to be acceptable. However, the previously recommended use of other scales for pain can also still be accepted, if adequately justified. As previo usly requested, scales (other than the 11-point NRS) should be open to change in both directions. In cases of weekly evaluations of the primary en dpoints, a minimally required number of valid diary entries should be defined in order to be evaluable as responder, and define patients below this threshold as non-responders. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 83/101 In development programmes, where the global evalua tion of the symptomatology is not included as primary endpoint (choices a) and b)), a global symptom assessment should be defined as the main secondary endpoint. The choice of a scale measuring improvement and deterioration is clearly recommended. The global assessment can also, likewise, be based on daily or weekly responder rates as recommended for the primary endpoint. The epidemiology of IBS according to sex shows an overall predominance of women with a pooled Odds Ratio in prevalence of 1.67. The developmen t of drug candidates for one gender only is considered fully acceptable, if indeed a differential therapeutic response with greatly reduced effects in one of them can be expected. IBS in children - for the conduct of clinical studies - should be defined on the current proposals of the Rome Committee (Rome III criteria) unless otherwise adequately justified (Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome\" (CPMP/EWP/785/97 Rev. 1, Set 2014). Some studies in the literature show methodological problems, such as: use of no validated scales; the randomisation procedure being not clear; lack of adequate washout period; limited treatment period (2-4 weeks) and no data on repeated use; have small sample sizes and unclear diagnostic criteria. Despite this, some interventions with peppermint oil have been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of symptoms of IBS, in several random ised well designed controlled trials, for a 3 month period. A variety of outcome measures have been us ed, making it difficult to compare the results of the trials. In a systematic review of diagnostic criteria on the clinical studies for IBS, the literature was selected according to three periods of time (Rome I era from 1992 to 1999, Rome II era from 2000 to 2006 and Rome III era from 2007 to 2011). The first stage of the systematic review identified only 14 published studies validating diagnostic tests for IBS (with th ree studies evaluating more than one criterion). There were eight validations for Manning, three validatio ns for Kruis, four validations for Rome I, three validations for Rome II, and no validation for Rome III. In the second review of utilization of Rome criteria, only 25.7% of published IBS papers used Rome III criteria during the Rome III era (Rome II was used most in 64.8% of studies). According to th e author, this review identified that comparator groups varied widely between studies making comparison of criteria impossible (Dang et al, 2012). The meta-analysis by Pittler and Ernst reported that the role of peppermint oil in the symptomatic treatment has not been established and more studies are needed to clarify. The difference in the diagnosis criteria in the clinical studies, may justify part of the problems encountered in the comparator groups in the meta-analysis. The review by Cochrane about IBS treatment (201 1) found a statistically significant effect for improvement of global assessment and at the meta-analysis from Khanna et al., ( 2013), peppermint oil demonstrates to be clinically safe and effective short-term treatment for IBS. The review from Wall et al., (2014) include peppermint oil in an algorithm to guide practicing clinicians to treat IBS in the first line, as well as dicyclom ine, pinavarium and trimebutine for \"Abdominal pain with mixed bowel symptoms (IBS-M)\", for 4-6 weeks. The American College of Gastroenterology (Ford, 2014) considered the quality of evidence as moderate, concluding that in specific formulations , which may not be universally available, peppermint oil is effective in IBS. The dose of peppermint oil in the individual studies was in the range of 0.6 ml to 1.2 ml per day in gastro resistant capsules, divided in 2- 6 single doses for adolescents and adults and of 0.6 ml daily for children, divided in 3 single doses. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium the topical intralum inal administration of peppermint oil, was used as antispasmodic agent in several studies, with superior efficacy than placebo and hyoscine-N- butylbromide, with less adverse reactions too. Post-operative nausea, sleep/alertne ss action and respiratory action The studies on post-operative nausea were performed with an experimental design, those on sleep/alertness in healthy subjects, not providing enou gh support for the efficacy of the indications. Just the TU can be accepted using the inhalation route for the relief of symptoms of cough and cold, according to the historical record of 30 years. Tension headache The tension-type headache (TTH) is classified at the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3 rd edition (beta version). This kind of primary headache is very common, rang ing from 30 to 78% in several studies. It was first considered as psychogenic, but recent studies sugges t a neurobiological basis, especially for the more severe cases. The last edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders further subdivided episodic tension-type headache, into an infrequent subtype with headache episodes less than once per month and a frequent one. Another difference in this edition is noted regarding the use of precranial muscles' disorder, for the subdivision by assessing the tenderness on manual palpation and not the surface EMG or pressure algometry (T he International Classification Of Headache Disorders, 2013). This indication is mentioned in the ESCOP monograph. The Commission E monograph only includes the indication \"muscle and neuralgic complaints\". The peppermint oil, by laboratory tests, seems to exert some actions on mechanisms associated with the pathophysiology of tension headache, producin g an analgesic affect, after administering a 10% solution of peppermint oil on the forehead and the temples of the patients. The comparative clinical study with 1000 mg acetaminophen, demonstrated no significant difference between both products on the relief of the pain. The numbers of patients in the studies were small; the inclusion criteria are not well defined with a broad range of ages. The characteristics of the pain described - 4.99 days per month for 14.12 years - fulfil the diagnostic criteria of the Frequent episodic tension-type headache (ICHD-II) and Episodic tension- type headache (IHS code). No clinical trials were found for other preparat ions with peppermint oil for this indication. 5. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance 5.1. Overview of toxicological/safety da ta from clinical trials in humans Oral administration Peppermint leaves No data available for peppermint leaves. Peppermint oil In a literature search peppermint oil was found to cause the typical GI effects like heartburn and anal / perianal burning or discomfort sensations; 16 clinical trials investigating 180-200 mg enteric-coated Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 85/101 peppermint oil in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or recurrent abdominal pain in children (1 study) with 651 patients enrolled were identified (Grigoleit and Grigoleit, 2005b). Adverse effects were reported in six trials, in the ve rum treatment, such as heartburn, perianal burning blurred vision, nausea and vomiting. The frequency ranged from 11% to 36% (Pittler and Ernst, 1998). The meta-analysis from Khanna et al., ( 2014), evaluated seven hundred twenty six (726) patients from nine studies. The adverse events that were reported in the placebo-controlled studies were of mild and transient nature. The adverse events incl uded heartburn, dry mouth, belching, peppermint taste, peppermint smell, rash, di zziness, headache, increased appetite and a cold perianal sensation. In the review from the American College of Gastroenterology (Ford et al., 2014), the 5 RCTs (peppermint oil ) included invo lving 492 patients and using an enteric-coated preparation of peppermint oil employed in doses ranging from 187 to 225 mg/caps, (2-3 times daily, 2-6 caps per day) not higher in peppermint oil groups compared to placebo (RR of experiencing any adverse event =1.26, 95% CI 0.75- 2.12) adverse events were reported. No certain cases of liver damage caused by pe ppermint oil or mint oil have been reported (EMEA/HMPC/138386/2005). Menthol A case of asthma due to menthol was reported in a 40-year-old woman with no history of asthma or any other allergy. The aetiology was suggested by the history of exposure. The diagnosis was confirmed by the clinic history and by skin tests (Santos, 2001). A form of stomatites and glossites with extremely prominent circumvallated papillae was described in patients who consumed excessive amounts of mint-flavoured sweets (Rogers, 1995). Pulegone and menthofuran A literature review of cases of human intoxication with pennyroyal oil ( Mentha pulegium containing pulegone content 62-97%) indicate that ingestion of 10 ml (corresponding to ca 5.4-9 g pulegone, ca 90-150 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg person; calculated with a relative density of 0.9 as for peppermint oil) resulted in moderate to severe toxicity while ingest ion of greater than 15 ml (corresponding to ca 8-13 g pulegone, ca 130-215 mg/kg bw for a 60 kg person) resulted in death. The clinical pathology was characterised by massive centrilobular necrosis of the liver, pulmonary edema and internal haemorrhage (SCF, 2002, cited in EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). A non-urgent information request was sent out to the member states concerning the use and association of licensed herbal medicinal products containing pennyroyal oil, peppermint oil and mint oil with reports of liver damage. The toxicity of pulegone and menthofuran have been evaluated by HMPC and presented in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). Inhalation Some reports about auricular fibrillation after the inhalation and ingestion of excessive amounts of mentholated products were published in medical journals (Thomas, 1962) Inhalation of large doses of menthol was reported to cause dizziness, confusion, muscle weakness, nausea or double vision (Natural Standard Research Collaboration 2005).

Patient exposure Peppermint leaves Peppermint leaves and extract can be used in cosmetic formulations as fragrance ingredients. Peppermint water can be used as a flavouring agent or, also, as a fragrance component. Peppermint oil Peppermint essential oil is widely used in flavou ring, cosmetic formulations and skin-conditioning agents. In general peppermint oil is considered as safe ingredient for use in dietary supplements and common as a folk medicine. The FDA calculated the estimated human exposure from cosmetic use, based on the concentration of use information supplied by industry. Using a body splash product containing 0.2% peppermint oil and assuming 100% absorption over a body surface of 17,000 cm2 and a daily application of 1 mg/cm2 (17 ml of the product), the FDA estimated an exposure of 34 mg/day. For a 60 kg person, this amounted to an estimated daily dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day (FDA 1997) (Final report on the Safety Assessment of Mentha piperita , 2001). Menthol In 1976, FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Foods Additives (JECFA) established an ADI of 0-2 mg/kg body weight/day for menthol. In 2000, an ADI of 0- 4mg/kg of body weight/day was allocated (WHO 2000). Pulegone and menthofuran Maximum levels for pulegone in foodstuff and bevera ges to which flavourings or other food ingredients with flavouring properties have been added: 25 mg /kg in foodstuff, 100 mg/kg in beverages, with the exception of 250 mg/kg in peppermint or mint flavoured beverages and 350 mg/kg in mint confectionery (Annex II of Directive 88/388/EEC). Pule gone may not be added as such to foodstuff. Committee of Experts on Flavouring Substances (CEF S) of the Council of Europe (1997): Menthofuran is the proximate hepatotoxin of pulegone. Tolerated daily intake (TDI) of menthofuran and pulegone was set to 0.1 mg/kg bw, based on a no effect level (NOEL) of 20 mg/kg bw/d in the 28 days oral toxicity study in rats (Thorup et al., 1983 a,b) with a safety factor of 200. Menthofuran is listed in the register of chemically defined fl avouring substances laid down in Commission Decision (1999/217/EC, 2002/113/EC). In addition to the use in medicine, humans are exposed to pulegone as part of the essential oil in flavourings, confectionery, and cosmetics (Karousou et al., 2007; Barceloux, 2008 cited in Public statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran, draft 1, Nov 2014). According to JECFA, the estimated per capita intake of pulegone is reported as 2 g/day and 0.04 g/kg bw/day for Europe, and 12 g/day and 0.03 g/kg bw/day for the USA (IPCS, 2001, cited in Public statement on the use of herbal medicina l products containing pulegone and menthofuran, EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1, 2014). The Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in contact with Foods (SPFA, 2005) noted that in certain cases the maximum permitted levels of pulegone in food may lead to high intakes in subjects consuming regularly mint flavoured beverages or confectionery. For example, 500 ml/day of mint flavoured beverage and 100 g/day of mint confectionery could lead to 128 intakes of respectively 4.2 mg/kg bw and 1.2 mg/kg bw for a 30 kg child (SPFA, 2005 cited in Public statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1, 2014). Assessment report on x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 89/101 In conclusion, humans are exposed to pulegone and menthofuran in herbal medicinal products and food, and as part of the essential oil in flavouring s, confectionery, and cosmetics. Estimates of per capita intakes are widely variable. The highest recommended daily dose in medicinal products in EU is 1.2 ml peppermint oil i.e. 1099 mg peppermint oil, which contains maximum 120 mg pulegone + menthofuran (Ph Eur). For a 60 Kg person this would correspond to a daily intake of 2.4 mg/kg. In the Public Statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1), the HMPC concludes that an intake of pulegone + menthofuran up to 37.5 mg/person/day, for an adult of 50 kg body weight, can be accept ed for herbal medicinal products as a lifetime intake. For children, the daily amount of pulegone + menthofuran has to be adjusted to the body weight of the age group: e.g. body weight of 20 kg would lead to an acceptable daily intake of 15 mg/day. 5.3. Adverse events, serious ad verse events and deaths Peppermint leaves Peppermint teas contain only a low amount of ment hol and menthone. In adults, the adverse reactions are, in general, related with a high intake of menthol by other products, as confectionary or pharmaceuticals. There are no reports of serious adverse effects with the normal and prolonged use of peppermint tea, but the gastroesophageal reflux may be worsened by taking it, such as peppermint relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter. Due to this effect, it is not recommended to people with hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux. Peppermint may stimulate the production of bile. In case of cholangitis, gallstones and other biliary disorders this product should be used with caution and under the supervision of a medical doctor. Assessor's comment: The following text will be included in section 4.8 'U ndesirable effects' of the monograph on peppermint leaf: \"The gastroesophageal reflux may worsen and heartburn may increase. The frequency is not known.\" Menthol and methyl salicylate There is a report of full thickness skin and muscle necrosis and interstitial nephritis in an elderly patient after topical application of a preparation co ntaining menthol and methyl salicylate, followed by prolonged use of an electrical heated pad. (Heng 1987, Bowen and Cubbin, 1992). Peppermint oil Anaphylactic shock has been reported (BfArm, Germany). Topical preparations of peppermint oil have been used to calm pruritus and relieve irritation and inflammation. Their frequent application to impaired skin could contribute to the sensitization rates seen. Numerous allergic contact dermatitis reactions to peppermint oil, many of which are linked to both perioral and intraoral disorders, have been described. Although peppermint oil is known for its many properties, its role as a sensitizer should be recognised so as to aid in the diagnosis of both dermatitis and oral conditions and to allow the initiation of proper avoidance measures (Herro and Jacob, 2010). A report of 12 cases of contact sensitivity to the flavouring agents, menthol and peppermint oil, in patients presenting with intra-oral symptoms in association with burning mouth syndrome, recurrent Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 90/101 oral ulceration or a lichenoid reaction is noted. The patients were referred from the Glasgow Dental Hospital over a 4-year period for assessment of the possible contribution of contact sensitivity to their complaints. 5 patients with burning mouth syndrome demonstrated contact sensitivity to menthol and/or peppermint, with 1 patient sensitive to both agents, 3 positive to menthol only and 1 to peppermint only. 4 cases with recurrent intra-oral ulceration were sensitive to both menthol and peppermint. 3 patients with an oral lichenoid reaction were positive to menthol on patch testing, with 2 also sensitive to peppermint. 9 of the 12 cases demonstrated additional positive patch test results. After a mean follow-up of 32.7 months (range 9-48 months), of the 9 patients that could be contacted, 6 patients described clearance or improvement of their symptoms as a consequence of avoidance of menthol/peppermint (Morton et al., 1995). Positive reactions were observed in 7 of 450 dermatitic patients tested with a patch of 2% Peppermint oil in yellow soft paraffin. Other study revealed reac tion on in 6 of 86 dermatitic patients (Ernst, 2000). Clinical dermal testing demonstrated that 8% Peppermint oil was not a sensitizer and 2% gave a small number of positive reactions in dermatitic patien ts (Final report on the Safety Assessment of Mentha piperita , 2001). There are some reports referring allergic contact dermatitis after topical application on the skin of peppermint oil. These reactions are the most of the time transient and of mild to moderate sensitivity (Ernst, 2000). Assessor's comment: The following adverse events will be listed in sectio n 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the WEU monograph on peppermint oil: Oral use Urine and stools with an odour of menthol were obse rved; dysuria and inflammation of the glans of the penis have been reported. The frequency is not known. Allergic reactions to menthol we re reported, with headache, brad ycardia, muscle tremor, ataxia, anaphylactic shock and erythematous skin rash. The frequency is not known. Heartburn, perianal burning blurred vision, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting were frequent in clinical trials. Cutaneous use Hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rash, contac t dermatitis, and eye irritation have been reported. These reactions are usually mild and transient. The frequency is not known. The following adverse events will be listed in section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the TU monograph on peppermint oil: Inhalation Apnoea, broncho- and laryngoconstriction in hypersensitive patients have been reported. The frequency is not known. Oral and oromucosal use Allergic reactions to menthol we re reported, with headache, brad ycardia, muscle tremor, ataxia, anaphylactic shock, contact sensitivity on the mucosa and erythematous skin rash. The frequency is not known. Cutaneous and transdermal use Assessment report on Mentha folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page reactions such as skin rash, contac t dermatitis, and eye irritation have been reported.

Laboratory findings No data available. 5.5. Safety in special populations and situations 5.5.1. Use in children and adolescents Use in children Importantly, the content of pulegone and menthofu ran must comply with the safe limits recommended in the Public Statement on the use of herbal medi cinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 mucosa is an autonomic reflexogenic orga n, which has a remote action to the heart, lungs and circulation and may lead to sudden apnoea and glottal constriction. The children less than 2 years old particularly present this reflex, so all the substances with a strong odour must be avoided (Dost and Leiber, 1967). The occurrence of jaundice in babies exposed to menthol is mentioned in one report at the Medline, advising patients with G6PD deficiency to use menthol cautiously (Natural Standard Research Collaboration, 2005). According to the SmPCs for herbal medicinal products in EU, the pharmaceutical form suppositories containing the essential oils eucalyptus oil, peppe rmint oil, mint oil and camphor, cineol, menthol, should not be used in children under the age of 30 months and in children with a history of seizures (febrile or not). The use of peppermint preparations in open skin ar eas of small children, especially on the nose, face and chest, is not recommended. The use in children is described further in the sections 5.5.2. 'Contraindications' and 5.5.3. 'Special warnings and precautions for use'. 5.5.2. Contraindications Peppermint leaves and peppermint oil People with hypersensitivity to peppermint preparatio ns or menthol should not use/ take this medicinal product. Peppermint oil WEU Oral use Patients with liver disease, cholangitis, achlorhydria, gallstones and any other biliary disorders. TU Children under 2 years of age, because menthol can induce reflex apnoea and laryngospasm. Assessment report on x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 92/101 There is no information available regarding the direct relationship of seizures with the inhalation of peppermint oil alone at the dosage recommended in the monograph. For safety reasons HMPC decided to retain as a contraindication the administration to children with history of seizures (febrile or not). Oral and oromucosal use Hypersensitivity to peppermint oil or menthol. 5.5.3. Special warnings and precautions for use Peppermint leaves Patients with gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) should avoid peppermint leaf preparations because heartburn may increase. Patients with gallstones and any other biliary disorder should be cautious using peppermint leaf preparations. The use in children under 4 years of age is no t recommended due to lack of adequate data. Peppermint oil Other products containing peppermi nt oil (e.g. other medicinal products, beverages, confectionery, and chewing gum) shall be avoided during the use of this medicinal product. If the symptoms worsen during the use of the medicinal product, a doctor or a pharmacist should be consulted. Oral use (WEU) The use in children under 8 years of age is not re commended due to lack of data on safety and efficacy. The gastro-resistant solid dosage forms should be swallowed whole, i.e. not broken or chewed, because this would release the peppermint oil prematurely, possibly causing local irritation of the mouth and oesophagus. Patients, who already suffer from heartburn or hiatal hernia have sometimes an exacerbation of this symptom after taking peppermint oil. Treatmen t should be discontinued in these patients. Cutaneous use (WEU) The use is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy. Eye contact with unwashed hands after the application of peppermint oil may potentially cause irritation. Inhalation, cutaneous use (nasal application), oral and oromucosal use (TU) The use in children between 2 and 11 years of age ha s not been established due to lack of adequate data. Oral and oromucosal use (TU) Patients, who already suffer from heartburn or hiatal hernia, have sometimes an exacerbation of this symptom after taking peppermint oil. Treatmen t should be discontinued in these patients. Patients with gallstones and any other biliary disorder should be cautious using peppermint oil. Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 93/101 Peppermint oil should be used with caution in inflam ed and ulcerated conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Cutaneous and transdermal use (TU) The use in children between 2 to 3 years of age has not been established due to lack of adequate data. Eye contact with unwashed hands after the application of peppermint oil may potentially cause irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied on broken or irritated skin. 5.5.4. Drug interactions and other forms of interaction Peppermint leaves Not reported for peppermint leaves. Menthol A case report describes a possible interaction of menthol cough drops (the active ingredient is menthol) with warfarin, in a 57 year white male wa iting for cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The warfarin dose was adjusted to 7 mg daily to stabilise the INR values. One week later it fell from 2.28-2.68 to 1.45. The patient just used menthol cough dr ops to treat a flu-like illness. The values returned after stopping the drops (Kassebaum et al., 2 005). Another case report describes the probable inte raction of cough menthol drops with warfarin. A reduction on the INR value was observed on a patien t taking 50 mg/week of warfarin, from 2.6 to 1.6 and remains stable despite incremental increases of the warfarin dose. The patient reported that he was taking 8-10 menthol cough drops per day during the time period that the INR decreased. Five days after discontinuing the drops, the INR increased to 2.9 (Coderre K, 2010). Assessor's comments The dose of menthol responsible for these cases is not known, so it is not possible to consider the relevance for the peppermint oil preparations covered by this report . Peppermint oil Use of food or antacids administered at the same time could cause early release of the enteric coated capsules content. Other medicinal products used to decrease stomach acid, like histamine-2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors may cause premature dissolution of the enteric coating and should be avoided. 5.5.5. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Adequate data on the use during pregnancy and lactation is not available. Some studies were performed to assess the preval ence and pattern of herbal medicines use during pregnancy, in each trimester (Bishop et al., 2011; Nordeng et al., 2011, Glover et al., 2003, Pallivalapila et al, 2015), but no safety data about the intake of peppermint oil was included. In a review of the literature on safety and effi cacy of the most commonly used herbs to enable midwives to give evidence-based information to pregnant women a total of 578 expectant mothers at least 20-weeks pregnant were enquired. It was concluded that there is limited documentation on the safety and efficacy of many herbs commonly used du ring pregnancy. Scientific documentation of the safety and efficacy of peppermint in pregnancy is not available (Holst et al., 2011). Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 94/101 Despite the uncertainties about their safety and effe ctiveness, herbal preparations and other modalities of complementary and alternative medicine products are widely used during the pregnancy. More studies should be performed to assess their safety on fertility, pregnancy and lactation to provide the health professionals of more reliable information in order to give a scientific based advice to expectant mothers. Some references report that peppermint may dry up milk secretions (Mills and Bone, 2005). HMPC concludes that safety during pregnancy and la ctation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and la ctation is not recommended. However, in the WEU indication \"Herbal medicinal product for the symptoma tic relief of mild tension type headache\", the use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended, unless medical advice proposes that the benefit outweighs the potential risk. No fertility data is available. 5.5.6. Overdose Peppermint leaves Not reported for peppermint leaves. An intoxication of a 9 years boy with a menthe (car vone) infusion prepared with 30 leaves is reported. The symptoms were tachycardia and agit ation, relieved after 24 hours (Augiseau et al., 1987). Peppermint oil Oral overdose may cause severe gastro-intestinal sy mptoms, diarrhoea, epileptic convulsions, loss of consciousness, apnoea, nausea and disturbances in cardiac rhythms, ataxia and other CNS problems, probably due to the presence of menthol. In the event of massive overdose, the stomach should be emptied by gastric lavage. Observation should be carried out with symptomatic treatment if necessary (MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia, 2017). Inhalation of large doses of menthol may lead to dizziness, confusion, muscle weakness, nausea and double vision (Natural Standard Research Collaboration, 2005). A near fatal suicidal case due to ingestion of toxic dose of oral peppermint oil is being reported. The patient came in a comatose state and was in shock. She was managed with mechanical ventilation and ionotropes. Her vital parameters reached normal within 8 hours and became conscious by 24 hours. The quantity ingested was not mentioned on the article (Nath et al., 2012). Drug abuse One case of fulminant pulmonary oedema following i.v. injection of 5 ml of peppermint oil was described in a patient with a history of drug abuse (Behrends et al., 2 005). 5.5.7. Effects on ability to drive or op erate machinery or impairment of mental ability No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 5.5.8. Safety in other special situations Not applicable Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 95/101 5.6. Overall conclusions on clinical safety Peppermint leaves There is a long experience on the use of preparations of peppermint leaves in adults, with no reports on interactions and overdose. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) should avoid peppermint leaf preparations, because heartburn may increase. Patients with gallstones and any other biliary disorder should be cautious about using peppermint leaf preparations. There is no adequate data available with the use in children under 4 years old, pregnancy and lactation. Therefore is not recommended. Peppermint oil The adverse events reported in the doses recommended for the therapeutic indications, in non-allergic adults were generally mild and transient. When used orally, it may cause heartburn, perian al burning, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting. Heartburn is related with the release of the oil in the upper GI tract, which relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter, facilitating the reflux. The same occurs in the cases of hiatal hernia. This particular undesirable effect is minimised by an ap propriate pharmaceutical formulation administration. People with gallbladder disease, severe liver damage, gallstones and chronic heartburn should avoid the intake of peppermint oil. Menthol and peppermint oil caused burning mouth sy ndrome, recurrent oral ulceration or a lichenoid reaction, by contact sensitivity in the intra-oral mucosa, in sensitive patients. When applied on the skin, it may cause allergic reactions, as skin rashes, contact dermatitis and eye irritation. Use in infants or children is not recommended, when inhaled, taken by mouth or if applied on open skin areas, the face or chest, due to the potential toxicity of the product. Because there is a lack of information about the safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the use is not recommended. In one clinical study with peppermint oil and one clin ical study with menthol, so me inhibition of CYP3A4 activity has been described. Further investigations are necessary. 6. Overall conclusions (benefit-risk assessment) Peppermint leaves Mentha piperita leaves is a well-known traditional herbal medicinal product used for centuries inside and outside the European countries. There is enough literature evidence over a period of 30 years to demonstrate its use for the symptomatic treatment of digestive disorders. Preparations of peppermint leaves demonstrated a relaxant and antispasmodic effects on gastrointestinal tissue and antinociceptive effect on animal models. Mixed flavonoids showed choleretic activity in dogs. Also the peppermint oil present a similar action in animal and clinical studies. The carminative effect is due to a reduction in the tonus of the esophageal sphincter. Assessment report on Mentha x L., folium and EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 96/101 pharmacological actions supports the traditiona l use on digestive disorders and the therapeutic indication proposed on this assessment report for the monograph - symptomatic relief of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia and flatulence. According to the Ph. Eur., the whole drug contains a minimum of 12ml/kg of essential oil (EO) and a minimum of 9ml for the cut drug. Considering the density of essential oil (based on relative density 0.9-0.916 g/cm 3 according Ph. Eur. version 8.1 (2014)) ref.: 0405 the content of EO is of 10.992g/kg leaves. Some articles mention that the infusions may contain 20-28% of EO. Given the relative amount of pulegone (<3%) and menthofuran (1-8%) present in the essential oil, we may find a minimum of 0.0216mg/g and a maximum of 0.3386mg/g of leaves in the infusion, of both. Administering the posology for peppermint leaf infusions proposed, a minimum of 0.0972mg/day (4.5g of leaves) and a maximum of 3.047mg/day (9g) for adults and a minimum of 0.065mg/day (3g) and 1.693mg/day (5g of leaves) for children of pulegone+menthofuran can be found. There is no information on the content of pulegone and menthofuran in the extracts. Toxicity studies and clinical information gives no reason for concern, with the recommended dosage range for oral use, reflecting the dose limit of pulegone and menthofuran proposed. The special warnings advise patients with cholangitis, gallstones and any other biliary disorders to be cautious using peppermint leaf preparations.. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) should avoid peppermint leaf preparations. There are no reports on interactions. There is no adequate data available with children under 4 years old and in fertility, pregnancy and lactation. There are no adequate tests for reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity for peppermint leaves preparations. Therefore an EU list entry cannot be supported. Peppermint oil WEU Peppermint oil has been used widely since many decades ago as a digestive and carminative. As an authorised medicinal product for oral use, peppermint oil has been prescribed under the approved indications \"for the symptomatic relief of symptoms related with irritable bowel syndrome\" or \"for the symptomatic relief of minor spasms of the gastrointest inal tract, flatulence and abdominal pain\". It has also been used topically, as a medicinal product, for the symptomatic treatment mild to moderate tension headache. According to the preclinical and clinical data assessed and presented in this report, peppermint oil demonstrated an antispasmodic action of the smoot h muscle of the GI tract, relieving minor spasms, flatulence and abdominal pain. The treatment of IBS is complex, with unpredictab le periods of relapse and remission, presenting a variety of symptoms. There is a lack of adequately studied and licensed medications in Europe for this indication. Moreover, there is a wide history of unsuccessful drug development programmes in the field, and the number of Marketing Authorisation A pplications for the indication has been very low during the past decade (Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome EMA/CHMP/60337/2013). Assessment report on Mentha x piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 97/101 Some studies on IBS in the literature show method ological problems, such as use of non-validated scales, the randomization procedure is not clear, lack of adequate washout period, limited treatment period (2-4 weeks), small sample sizes and unclear di agnostic criteria. Despite this, some interventions with peppermint oil have been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of symptoms of IBS, in several randomised well designed controlled trials. The peppermint oil, by laboratory tests, seems to exert some actions on mechanisms associated with the pathophysiology of tension headache, producing an analgesic effect, after applying a 10% solution on the forehead and the temples of the patients . The clinical studies are small but the results demonstrated the efficacy of peppermint oil on the episodic tension-type headache, according to the IHS classification. TU There is a lack of clinical studies to confidently conclude about the efficacy on the treatment of cough and colds for Mentha x piperita , folium, as well as for peppermint oil. The symptomatic relief of localised muscle pain and pruritic conditions of the intact skin are not supported by clinical studies, allowing just the traditional use. There is enough in formation on the time of use, posology and method of administration to assure safe use of the product. Humans are exposed to pulegone and menthofuran in herbal medicinal products and food, and as part of the essential oil in flavourings, confectionery, and cosmetics. Estimates of per capita intakes are widely variable. According to the conclusions of the \"Public statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran, EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1, the HMPC concludes that an intake of pulegone + menthofuran up to 37.5 mg/per son/day, for an adult of 50 kg body weight, can be accepted for herbal medicinal products as a lifetime intake. For children, the daily amount of pulegone + mentho furan has to be adjusted according to the body weight of the age group: e.g. body weight of 20 kg would lead to an acceptable daily intake of 15 mg/day, (life-long exposure) or 30 mg/day for a short-term exposure (less than 1 year). For treatment durations of less than 1 year an intake (pulegone + menthofuran) of 75.0 mg/day can be accepted. In the case of intermittent dosing, th e acceptable daily intake should be based on the total number of dosing days instead of the time in terval over which the doses are administered. For example, a drug administered once per week for 5 years (i.e., 260 dosing days) would have an acceptable intake per dose of 75.0 mg. No quantitative data concerning absorption of pulegone and menthofuran through the skin exist although it is known that pulegone has been used as a \"penetration enhancer\". It is to ensure that the sum of pulegone and menthofuran within the daily dose is <37.5 mg for adults. The short term use (maximum 14 days) is restricted to intact skin. Higher contents within the products would be possible if for the relevant product (means the relevant matr ix, because absorption might be greatly influenced by the excipients, for instance essential oils as enhancers) low absorption rates can be shown, not exceeding the daily intake of 37.5 mg for adults (EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1). The calculations on the content of pulegone+menth ofuran were assessed according to the posology found as plausible for traditional use and based on the clinical studies for well-established use.

In the safety evaluation proposed in the \"Guidelin e on the evaluation of medicinal products for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome\" (CPMP/EW P/785/97 Rev. 1, Set 2014), \"because treatment of IBS will require intermittent or continuous long-term use of medication, it is necessary to have long- term safety data with an observation period of at least 12 months available in adequate numbers to accurately assess the safety of the medicinal produc t. For products intended for long-term continuous use, this will mean the observation of 12 months on active treatment, whereas for compounds with an intermittent use, the time on active drug can be reduced to a period of at least 6 months, with the documentation of at least 12 months of observation (whichever comes first). Safety data collected in sub-populations of IBS patients may not support auth orisation in a wider patient population. The safety evaluation in clinical trials for IBS is in general not different from other investigational products under development and should be focused according to the pharmacology of a compound. The main focus should be on the evaluation of gastrointestinal events (...). The focus may however change, depending on the primary pharmacology of a compound (...).\" The adverse effects of peppermint oil enteric coated capsules were generally mild and transient in the clinical studies as well as in pharmacovigilance the reports. Nevertheless, the preclinical data on pulegone and menthofuran requires an alerted pharmacovigilance of peppermint oil products with regard to potential toxicity. The content of 75 mg of pulegone+menthofuran in medi cinal products has the time limit of intake of 1 year. This recommendation is not adequate for a condition such as \"minor spasms of the gastrointestinal tract, flatulence and abdominal pain, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome\", which requires intermittent or continuous long-term treatment. The pulegone+menthofuran limit of 37.5 mg, which allows a lifetime intake, assures a safer treatment of the symptoms related with IBS, providin g a positive benefit-risk assessment. For adults and adolescents, the content of the maximum daily dose (1.2ml) requires peppermint oil with a limit of 3.4% of menthofuran + pulegone. The minimum dose (0.6ml) requires peppermint oil with the limit of 6.9% of menthofuran + pulegone. In children, the limit for a lifetime intake of 0.75 mg/kg/day of menthofuran + pulegone can be accepted. However, at the proposed posology (0.6ml/day) included in the monograph, the peppermint oil would need to be restricted to batches complying with a limit of 2.79% of menthofuran + pulegone. It is evident from data of commercial batches (sup plied in confidence by EDQM) that most batches from currently available commonly traded natural peppermint oils would exceed such a maximum limit for menthofuran + pulegone. Whilst HMPC recognises that for this reason use in children may not be feasible, it has decided to include children in the posology as the use is supported by clinical trial data and selection of suitable peppermint oil batches may be possible. For the traditional use, the posology proposed for oromucosal, inhalation (0.08- 0.48 ml/day) and cutaneous use (from 1-20%) depending on the preparation or age, as there are no proven beneficial effects, should comply with the safe limit for life in take of pulegone and menthofuran, proposed on the Assessment report on Mentha piperita L., folium and aetheroleum EMA/HMPC/522409/2013 Page 101/101 \"Public statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing pulegone and menthofuran, EMA/HMPC/138386/2005 Rev. 1, for long te rm intake, in adults and children.
