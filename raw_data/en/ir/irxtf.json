The Executive Board , at its 144 th session in January 2019 , noted an earlier version of this report.1 The draft road map has been revised and a new Appendix 2 has been added to indicate the linkage between the Thirteenth General Programme of Work , 2019 -2023 and the activities, actions, deliverables and milestones set out in the road map . The m ilestones have been updated to reflect the global goods planning process , and information has been added on the Organization's mandate with regard to the actions requir ed by the road map and on the distribution of road map activities across the programme budget . The revised draft also reflect s issues raised by the Executive Board relating to providing health products for primary health care, monitor ing access, optimizing the use of biosimilars, addressing the challenges f aced by small island States , and support ing countries transitioning from donor funding.2 2. In May 2018, the Seventy -first World Health Assembly considered a report by the Director -General on addr essing the global shortage of, and access to, medicines and vaccines.3 The report focused on a list of priority options for actions to be considered by Member States and presented a comprehensive report by the Director -General on access to essential medici nes and vaccines. 3. Having considered the report, the Health Assembly adopted decision WHA71(8), in which it decided to request the Director -General to elaborate a road map report, in consultation with Member States, outlining the programming of WHO's work o n access to medicines and vaccines for the period 2019 -2023, including activities, actions and deliverables. The Health Assembly also requested the Director -General to submit the road map report to the Seventy -second World Health Assembly, through the Exec utive Board at its 144th session. 4. In July 2018, the Secretariat initiated a process to consult Member States and an online consultation with Member States on the zero draft road map w as conducted in the period July-September 2018, during which 62 countries provided feedback. In addition, a consultation with Member States on the zero draft was conducted on 10 and 11 September 2018 in Geneva, preceded by an informal discussion with representatives of the United Nations and other international organizations and non -State actors in official relations with WHO. The draft report was updated based on the feedback obtained by these consultation processes, including broadening of the scope to include medicines, vaccines and health products. 1 See document EB144/17 and summary record of the Executive Board at its 144 th session, ninth and tenth meeting. 2 See the summary records of the Executive Board at its 144 th session, tenth meeting. 3 Document A71/12.

Introduction and rationale 1. Equitable access to health products is a global priority, and the availability, accessibility, acceptability, and affordability of health products of assured quality need to be addres sed in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular target 3.8.1 Every disease management strategy requires access to health products for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, palli ative care and rehabilitation. 2. Access is a global concern, given the high prices of new pharmaceuticals and rapidly changing markets for health products that place increasing pressure on all health systems' ability to provide full and affordable access to quality health care. The high percentage of health spendin g on medicines (20-60% as demonstrated in a series of studies in selected low - and middle -income countries) impedes progress for the many countries that have committed to the attainment of universal health coverage.2 Furthermore, it is known that a large p roportion of the population in low -income countries who spend for health do pay out -of-pocket for medicines. With the rise in noncommunicable diseases - many of which are chronic conditions that require long -term treatment - the financial burden on both governments and pati ents will become even greater. 3. Improving access to health products is a multidimensional challenge that requires comprehensive national policies and strategies. These should align public health needs with economic and social development o bjectives and promote collaboration with other sectors, partners and stakeholders; they also need to be aligned with legal and regulatory frameworks and cover the entire product life cycle, from research and development to quality assurance, supply chain m anagement and use. 4. Primary health care services rely on access to health products , including medicines, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, protective equipment and assistive devices. Th ese products must be of assured safety, efficacy , performance and quality , as well as being appropriate, available and affordable. Ensuring that appropriate health products are available and affordable for primary care depends on policy decisions and processes related to the selection, pricing, procurement, supply chain management, maintenance (in the case of medical devices), prescribing and dispensing (in the case of medicines) and use of health products. 5. WHO's comprehensive health systems approach to increasing access to health products is guided by a series of Health Assembly and Regional Committee resolutions. These resolutions, nearly 100 in number (see Annex, Appendix 1) formed the basis for the previous report by the Director -General on this topic.3 The present document responds to the Health Assembly's subsequent request for WHO to develop a road map describing its activities, actions and deliverables for improving access to medicines and vaccines, for the period 2019 -2023. 1 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, acces s to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. 2 Reich MR, Harris J, Ikegami N, Maeda A, Cashin C, Araujo EC, et al.

The Lancet. 2016; 387:811 -16 (https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140 - 6736(15)60002 -2.pdf ). 3 Document A71/12. Annex A72/17 5 II. Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019 -2023 6. The Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019 -20231 sets out three strategic priorities for ensuring healthy lives and well -being for all at all ages: achieving universal health coverage, addressing health emergencies and promoting healthier populations. These strategic priorities are supported b y three strategic shifts: stepping up leadership; driving public health impact in every country; and focusing global public goods on impact (see Fig . 1). Fig. 1. Overview of WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019 -2023: strategic priorities and shifts2 1 Docum ent A71/4. 2 Previously issued in document A71/4. Mission Strategic Priorities (and goals ) Strategic shifts Orga nizational shifts Promote health - keep the world safe - serve the vulnerable Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well -being for all at all ages by: Achieving universal health coverage - 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage Addressing health emergencies - 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies Promoting healthier populations - 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well -being Stepping up leadership - diplomacy and advocacy ; gender equality, health equity and human rights; multisectoral action ; finance Focusing global public goods on impact - normative guidance and agreements ; data, research and innovation Measure impact to be accountable and manage for results Reshape operating model to drive country, regional and global impacts Transform partnerships, communications and financing to resource the strategic priorities Strengthen critical systems and processes to optimize organizational performance Foster culture change to ensure a seam less, high -performing WHO Policy dialogue - to develop systems of the future Strategic support - to build high performing systems Technical assistance - to build national institutions Mature health system Fragile health system Driving public health impact in every country - differentiated approach based on capacity and vulnerability Service delivery - to fill critical gaps in emergencies A72/17 Annex 6 7. The planning framework for the Thirteenth General Programme of Work provides a structure for identifying priorities at the country level and for the planning and budgeting of the work of WHO. It will ensure that the programme budget reflects the needs of the countries and that work at all three levels of the Organization i s geared towards delivering country impact. This road map for access to medicines, vaccines and other health products, 2019 -2023, aligns with the following outputs that have been identified within this framework: provision of authoritative guidance and sta ndards on the quality, safety and efficacy of health products, including through prequalification services, essential medicines and diagnostics lists; access to essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and devices for primary health care improved ; countr y and regional regulatory capacity strengthened and supply of quality -assured and safe health products improved; research and development agenda defined and research coordinated in line with public health priorities; countries enabled to address antimicrob ial resistance through strengthened surveillance systems, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, awareness -raising and evidence - based policies and practices. III. How the road map was developed 8. The previous report (document A71/12) proposed prio rity actions based on the comparative advantage of WHO, whether the action provides value for money and if the actions lead to achievable and sustainable improvements. These prioritized actions form the basis for the activities, actions and deliverables ou tlined in the zero draft road map . It was developed based on input from all levels of the Organization, taking into consideration existing governing body documents, the Programme budget 2018 -2019 and relevant departmental and Regional Office strategies. 9. The road map builds on the numerous regional and national initiatives and commitments undertaken to improve access to safe, effective and quality medicines, vaccines and health products , several of which, including the Delhi Declaration on improving access to essential medical products in the South -East Asia Region , have been cited in the report by the Director -General on addressing the global shortage of, and acc ess to, medicines and vaccines.1 10. This revised road map takes into consideration the feedback received through the drafting and consultative processes described in paragraph 4 above of the report by the Director -General. All written contributions from the survey and other written submissio ns are available on http://www.who.int/medicines/access_use/road -map-medicines -vaccines/en/ . 1 Document A71/12. Annex A72/17 7 IV. Structure of the road map 11. The road map outlines the principles of WHO's wor k on access to health products, including essential health system components. It is structured around two interlinked strategic areas that are necessary to support access to health products : ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of health products; improving equitable access to health products . Under each strategic area, the road map describes activities and puts forward the specific actions and deliverables for the period 2019 -2023. 12. Fig. 2 shows the activities included under each strategic area; the ac tivities are listed in sequential order of the product life cycle. 13. Appendix 2 indicate s the linkage between the 13th General Programme of Work and the activities, actions, deliverables and short -, medium - and long -term milestones. Fig. 2. Activities within the two strategic areas V. A health systems approach to improving access to health products 14. The six components of a well -functioning health system outlined in the WHO document \" Key components of a well -functioning health system\"1 include: Leadership and governance, health information systems, health financing, human resources, essential medical products and technologies, 1 http://www.who.int/healthsystems/publications/hss_key/en/ (accessed 11 November 2018). Ensuring quality, safety and efficacy of health products Regulatory system strengthening Assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy/performance of health products through prequalification Market surveillance of quality, safety and performance Improving equitable access Research and development that meets public health needs and improves access to health products Application and management of intellectual property to contribute to innovation and promote public health Evidence -based selection and fair and affordable pricing Procurement and supply chain management Appropriate prescribing, dispensing and rational useA72/17 Annex 8 and service delivery. Ensuring access to health products depends on all of these, in particular governance, hea lth information, financing and human resources. There is no one -size-fits-all approach to ensuring a functional health system and tailored strategies are required to adapt them to the local context. 15. Four key health system components of improving access to healt h products are detailed below; specific actions to address them are included in relevant activities under the two strategic areas of the road map provided in Sections VI and VII. Financing of health products 16. Inadequate financing of health products, hi gh prices of new health products and ineffective policy interventions and processes to manage expenditure, such as the ineffective use of policies for generic and biosimilar medicines , contribute to the challenges facing the health system in ac hieving univ ersal health care. Evidence indicates that up to one fifth of health spending could be channe lled towards better use by avoiding waste that occurs (a) when health products are priced higher than is necessary, (b) when less expensive but equally effective a lternatives are not used and (c) when purchase d products are not used at all. 17. Countries that are transitioning away from receipt of donor funding , such as from the G AVI Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria , need particular support to strengthen their health systems , allocate resources more effectively and sustain financing . 18. Activities in this road map support countries' ability to allocate resources more effectively through evidence -based decisions to ensure that cost -effec tive health products are included in a country's essential medicines list, essential diagnostics lists or reimbursement lists and through more efficient procurement and supply processes and rational use of medicines. Support for fair pricing1 and policy im plementation to reduce out -of-pocket expen ditures will also be provided. Governance of health products 19. The need for good governance is increasingly recognized as a major hurdle on the road to achieving universal health coverage. Weak governance complicates access to health products by fuelling inefficiencies, distorting competition and leaving the system vulnerable to undue influence, corruption, waste, fraud and abuse. Given the large role of health products in the provision of health care and the proporti on of health spending they represent (as high as 60% for medicines in some countries),2 improving governance will help prevent the waste of public resources needed to sustain health systems and provide quality and affordable care. 20. There is a pressing need to improve access to timely, robust and relevant information concerning health products. Unbiased information that is free of any conflict of interest is vital for the sound selection, incorporation, prescription and use of health products. Transparency of this information is 1 WHO's working definition, based on input from the fair pricing initiative is that a fair price is one that is affordable for health systems and patients and at the same time provides sufficient market incentive for industry to invest in innovatio n and the production of medicines. 2 WHO guideline on country pharmaceutical pricing policies. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2015 (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/153920/9789241549035_eng.pdf?sequence=1 , accessed 11 November 2018). Annex A72/17 9 central to accountability, strengthens confidence in public institutions and improves the efficiency of the system. Activities in the road map address the transparency of clinical trials enabling support for clinical trial registries a nd address price transparency through the Market Information for Access to Vaccines ( MI4A platform),1 for example. 21. The relationship between government and the private sector, such as pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies, requires particula r attention. A question of growing importance is how to support governments to work effectively with the private sector and develop public policy while avoiding the risks of undue influence and maximizing benefits. WHO supports improving practices in both the public and private sectors to ensure that national policies reflect the central role of access to health products in achieving universal health coverage and in contributing to improved accountability. A health workforce that ensures access to health pr oducts2 22. According to the High -Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth , the global economy is projected to create about 40 million new health -sector jobs by 2030.3 Most of these jobs, however, will be in middle - and high -income countries, leaving a projected shortage of 18 million health workers in low - and lower -middle -income countries. Part of the health workforce shortage concerns pharmacists, one of the specialized workforces required to ensure access to medicines and vaccines. There is also a shortage of biomedical engineers,4 who play a crucial role in supporting the best and most appropriate use of medical technologies. Both pharmacists and biomedical engineers are essential to the development, production, procurement, distribution an d appropriate use and maintenance of health products, as well as the supportive functi on of regulation. 23. The WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 addresses health workforce challenges. Many of the interventions needed to improve the workforce are cross -cutting, such as mainstreaming relevant competencies in the pre -service education curricula of health personnel, scaling up the training of pharmacists, pharmacy assistants and biomedical engineers, and ensuring dedicated training for personnel in administrative and management positions within the supply chain. Some of the actions needed to strengthen the health workforce responsible for hea lth products may be similar to - or implemented as part of - broader health workforce policie s, including improving public sector pay and incentives, establishing mechanisms for access to education and training in rural areas and reforming education strategies to reflect current and emerging health system needs. 24. Activities provided in the road map include support to ensure that the workforce is fit -for-purpose in key areas such as regulatory capacity, where specific competencies are required to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of health products. Another key area is procurement and supply ch ain management, 1 MI4A: Market Information for Access to Vaccines (http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/procurement/v3p/platform/en/ , accessed 11 November 2018). 2 In line with resolution WHA69.19 (2016) on the global strategy on human resources for health: workforce 2030, a health workforce impact a ssessment was carried out for the draft road map for access to medicines, vaccines and other health products, 2019 -2023 (see https://www.who.int/hrh/documents/WHA72_HRHlinks_16011 9-EMP.pdf , accessed 21 March 2019). 3 Working for health and growth: Investing in the health workforce. Report of the High -Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2016 ( http://www.who.int/hrh/com - heeg/reports/en/ , accessed 11 November 2018). 4 Specialists within the category of biomedical engineering include clinical engineers, biomedical engineering technicians, r ehabilitation engineers, biomechanical engineers and bioinstrumentation engineers. A72/17 Annex 10 for which particular skills are required to forecast needs, procurement processes, warehousing and distribution, stock management and maintenance (of medical devices), for example. Information on health products for decision -making 25. Information is essential for decision -making, monitoring policy implementation and establishing accountability. To make accurate and useful decisions, timely and accurate data and information are needed in such categories as national expenditures on health products; the procurement of health products, supply chain and distribution; pharmaco -vigilance and post -marketing surveillance; health insurance coverage; prescription prices of health products; and the availability of medicines, vaccines and other healt h products in health facilities. Monitoring access to health products is a complex endeavour that requires gathering information from multiple sources and ensuring the interoperability of various data collection systems. Within the framework of the Health Data Collaborative, WHO is supporting countries to improve their capacity to collect, organize, analyse and use quality data for policy -making, to create standards of reference for data compatibility and to advance the harmoniza tion and modernization of da ta collection tools. 26. WHO is working to develop agreed tracer indicators to monitor the enablers to more available and affordable medicines. To advance this, WHO convened an expert meeting in February 2019 to review existing frameworks for monitoring the ph armaceutical system and to identify indicators that reflect the performance of each of the system's component s. The se indicators will help countries to identify potential barriers to access and corrective measures , and will contribute to the measurement of the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on access to medicines . Activities provided in the road map include support for platforms in collecting a wide variety of data such as the Global Observatory on Health Research and Development, the Global Surveil lance and Monitoring System for substandard and falsified medical products, the shortages notification system and the global programme on surveillance of antimicrobial consumption. VI. Strategic area: Ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of health product s 27. National regulatory authorities in countries are responsible for the quality, safety and efficacy of health products. A weak regulatory system can have an impact on patient outcomes and has the potential to impair initiatives for improving access, for ex ample by taking too long to approve products for use in a country. Unfortunately, the capacity of many low - and middle -income countries to assess and approve health products remains limited, with as few as 30% of national regulatory authorities globally ha ving the capacity to perform all core regulatory functions for medicines.1 This lack of regulatory capacity in many countries hampers efforts to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of health products. 28. Key challenges include inadequate resources, overburdened staff and incoherent policy frameworks. Differences between regulatory systems cause delays for researchers and manufacturers, who must navigate multiple regulatory systems to register the same health product in different countries. The introd uction of new therapeutic classes, such as biotherapeutics and similar biotherapeutic products, will require new capacities and updatin g of guidelines. 29. A specific challenge has been highlighted by the recent public health emergencies requiring an urgent ne ed for health products and decision -making in a context that is different from \"business as usual\". Many countries do not have the regulatory pathways in place to enable rapid access to novel 1 WHO Essential medicines and health products: Annual report 2017: Towards access 2030. Geneva: 2018. Available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/272972 . Annex A72/17 11 health products. Another specific challenge is related to the gr owing interest in local production of health products as a strategy to improve access, strengthen national health security and enhance industrial and economic development. In most cases, low - and middle -income countries seeking to embark on local productio n have limited regulatory capacity to ensure the quality of products manufactured. 30. The underreporting of adverse drug reactions and adverse events following immunization highlights the need for improved approaches to post -marketing surveillance. In additio n, the rise in substandard and falsified products in all markets is hampering efforts to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of health products. A review showed that the observed failure rate of tested samples of substandard and falsified medicines in low- and middle -income countries is approximately 1 out of 10. Substandard and falsified medical products endanger health, promote antimicrobial resistance, undermine confidence in health professionals and health systems, create distrust about the effectiv eness of vaccines and medicines, waste the limited budgets of families and health systems and provi de income to criminal networks. 31. The activities in this strategic area support countries to deliver regulation that protects the public while enabling timely access to, and innovation of, quality products. Activities focus on regulatory system strengthening, assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy of health products through prequalification, and market surveillance o f quality, safety and efficacy. 32. Regula tory system strengthening. WHO develops international norms and standards so that countries worldwide can consistently regulate health products. Through its expert committees , WHO provides detailed recommendations and guid ance on the manufacturing, licensi ng and control of health products , including similar biotherapeutic products. It supports countries, including those with local manufacturing or those seeking to develop local manufacturing, to strengthen regulation and regulatory capacity. Its action supp orts expanding reliance on national regulatory authorities that meet international performance benchmarks (WHO listed authority) as assessed via the Global Benchmarking Tool for assessment of national regulatory systems. WHO facilitates work -sharing and co nvergence to ensure greater efficiencies and more rapid registration of health products. The further development of reliance networks will contribute to increased efficiency. Specific actions proposed in this activity include support for preparing regulato ry procedures for emergency and crisis situ ations. 33. Assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy/performance of health products through prequalification . Prequalification aims to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and immunization -related equipm ent, diagnostics and medical devices meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Products that have been assessed and prequalified by WHO are eligible for international procurement and provide the extra assurance of quality, safety and efficacy. Drawing on the expertise of some of the best national regulatory authorities, prequalification provides a list of products that comply with unified international standards. In parallel, WHO supports countries in building national regulatory capacity throu gh networking, training and information -sharing . 34. Market surveillance of quality, safety and efficacy/performance . This activity area supports countries to strengthen post -market surveillance and monitor substandard and falsified health products. It provides support for collecting safety data to detect, assess and prevent adverse drug effects. One strategic approach relies on the introduction of active surveillance of a limited number of priority health products (for example in HIV, tuberculosis and m alaria treatment programmes or new vaccines). This leads to robust safety data for the specific products in the short -term and a sustainable pharmacovigilance infrastructure in the long -term. The WHO global surveillance and monitoring system for substandar d and falsified medical products collects data in support of the prevention, detection and response to substandard and falsified health products. A72/17 Annex 12 Activity: Regulatory system strengthening Action - Development and implementation of WHO technical guidelines, norms and standards for quality assurance and safety of health products1 Deliverables Guidelines, standards and biological reference materials to support decreased regulatory burden and support production and quality control of safe and effective health products.

Support for implementation of WHO quality standards3 to decrease the regulatory burden. Support for r egulatory capacity strengthening towards WHO listed authority status, especially in countries manufacturing products for lower -middle -income countries or for local production to ensure quality of products. Support for the use of the Global Benchmarking To ol for the formulation of country -specific institutional development plans and related provision of technical advice, training and measures. Action - Strengthen preparedness for entry of medicines, vaccines and other health products into countries experiencing a public health emergency or crisis4 Deliverables Support for strengthening regulatory procedures for risk -based evaluations during public health emergencies through the revision of regulatory procedures and standards for risk -based evaluations during public health emergencies and the strengthening of pro cesses and services.

Support for development of national capacity for surveillance of safety of health products on nati onal markets. Improved prevention, detection and response to substandard and falsified health products. VII. Strategic area: Improving equitable access to health products 35. Many people worldwide do not have adequate and regular access to health products. Many medical devices in resource -poor settings are broken, unused or unfit for purpose. Access depends on having appropriate products available at affordable prices. This is a particular challenge in small island States and for small markets , such as children's medicines. The introduction of new medicines and other health products and the rise of noncommunicable diseases are putting increasing pressure on health care systems a round the world and on individuals who pay out -of-pocket in the case of lack of government financing. Lack of access can affect patient outcomes if patients go undiagnosed or untreated or receive suboptimal treatment and can contribute to the rise in antim icrobial resistance. Challenges for improving access occur throughout the system, ranging from inadequate investment in research and development, lack of effective policies, weak procurement and supply chain management, and inappropriate prescribing and ir rational use of health products. 36. Research and development investments in neglected diseases have shown an annual decline of 2-3% from 2012 (US$ 3.3 billion).3 Neglected diseases and other major global health problems cannot 1 Corresponding mandates: WHA67.20, WHA70.14. 2 Corresponding mandates: WHA61.21,WHA65.19, WHA67.20. 3 R&D funding flows for neglected diseases (G -FINDER), by disease, year and funding category. World Health Organization, Global Observatory on Health Research and Development, 2018 ( http://www.who.int/research - observatory/monitoring/inputs/neglected_diseases/en/ , accessed 11 November 2018). A72/17 Annex 14 be addressed with the health products that are currently available in markets, including for emerging infectious disease pathogens, and new antibiotic therapies. Some of the key challenges facing research and development include setting priorities for rese arch and development needs and incentivizing research and development for health products that have a potentially limited return on investment. 37. Poor selection of health products, inadequate financing and ineffective policy interventions and processes to ma nage expenditure, including out -of-pocket expenditure, contribute to a lack of access and unaffordable prices. There is an increasing need to ensure the sustainable availability of health products through careful management of affordable pricing for health systems and fair pricing for producers. 38. Inefficient procurement and supply chain management is another major challenge. The special skills required for the procurement of quality assured products are lacking in many countries. The supply chain requires a strong infrastructure and accurate data management systems. This can be particularly complex for vaccines and other temperature - or time -sensitive health products that require careful handling and efficient cold chain systems. Preventing, detecting and re sponding to shortages of health products is complex as well. In the case of infectious diseases, such shortages or stock -outs contribute to growing antimicrobial resistance and have an impact on health outcomes. Inefficient supply chain management can lead to high levels of wastage, with significant consequences in terms of access. Waste management is also an emerging public health problem, particularly for products such as antibiotics. 39. Local production of health products has been proposed as a strategy to improve access, strengthen national health security and enhance industrial and economic development. There are a number of barriers to developing local production, however, including policy incoherence, unreliable financing, lack of affordable, quality -assured materials and unavailable skilled workforce. 40. Particular challenges for medical devices include a lack of biomedical engineering capacity to advise on their suitability for use in resource -poor settings such as those with high temperature, fluctuating electricity or lack of clean water. Installation, maintenance services and user training are also often lacking, leading to unsafe handling practices with potentially harmful consequences, such as misdiagnosis due to improper use or calibration of equipme nt. 41. Estimates have shown that in low - and lower -middle income countries, less than 40% of primary -care patients in the public sector and less than 30% of primary -care patients in the private sector are treated in accordance with standard treatment guidelin es.1 Factors that contribute to inappropriate prescribing, dispensing and use include an inadequately trained workforce, incorrect diagnoses, the prohibitive costs or simple unavailability of medicines, and activities related to product marketing and promo tion. Policy approaches and interventions have been identified to improve the use of health products but have generally not been implemented over the past decade. Increasing burdens on health resources, the rise of antimicrobial resistance to dangerously h igh levels and the rise in noncommunicable diseases require a renewed focus on appropriate prescribing dispensing and use. 42. Activities under this strategic area will support countries to achieve a continuous supply of quality, safe, effective and affordable health products through research and development that meets public health needs; the application and management of intellectual property standards; evidence -based selection and fair and affordable pricing; procurement and supply chain management; and appr opriate prescribing, dispensing and rational use. 1 The World medicines situation 2011: Rational use of medicines. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2011. Annex A72/17 15 43. Research and development that meets public health needs. In line with the Global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, which recommends prioritizing needs for and promoting research and development, WHO is playing a role in facilitating research and development for neglected areas, where there is a compelling unmet public health need for new products, including by coordinating the efforts of different actors, se tting research and development priorities, identifying associated gaps, defining desired product profiles and facilitating the development of affordable, suitable health products. The Global Observatory on Health Research and Development is central to sett ing priorities for product development and contributing to coordinated actions on health research and development. The R&D Blueprint supports the development of a global preparedness plan for addressing future epidemics. WHO, together with the Drugs for Ne glected Diseases initiative, has set up the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership to develop new treatments for bacterial infections. 44. Application and management of intellectual property. Since the adoption of the Agreement on Trade -Related A spects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), many Health Assembly resolutions have requested WHO to address the impact of trade agreements and intellectual property protection on public health and access to health products. The Global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, along with other relevant resolutions, constitutes the basic mandate for WHO's work in this area. As requested by the plan of action, WHO has intensified its collaboration with oth er relevant international organizations, in particular through trilateral collaboration with WIPO and WTO, as well as with other organizations, including UNCTAD and UNDP. Trilateral cooperation with WIPO and WTO is fostering a better understanding of the l inkage between public health and intellectual property policies and enhancing a mutually supportive implementation of those policies. This activity area supports countries by fostering innovation and access to health products through appropriate intellectu al property rules and management and by providing technical support and capacity -building. 45. Evidence -based selection and fair and affordable pricing. Procurement and reimbursement of health products is guided by evidence -based selection (including health t echnology assessment). Adoption or expansion of national essential medicines or diagnostics lists requires the capacity and competency at the national level to translate findings from evidence to local contexts and to use findings for decision -making. This activity area contributes directly to improving the availability and affordability of health products. Actions will be carried out to support countries for appropriate selection of medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other health products, transparent an d fair pricing, and implementation of policies, including on the use of generic and biosimilar medicines to reduce costs to both governments and individuals while ensuring quality, safety and efficacy and sustainable supply. This will be particularly impor tant for countries transitioning from donor funding. Additional work on support for evaluating the benefit of future technologies as they are developing will be carried out, in addition to the advancement of strategic approaches to ensuring supply security and other pricing and purchasing policies. A72/17 Annex 16 46. Procurement and supply chain management. Good procurement practices play a key role in securing quality products at affordable prices and ensuring adequate and timely supply, while good supply chain management en sures that quality products are available at all levels of the health system. WHO will continue to support collaborative efforts to optimize the procurement and supply chain for health products and to build competencies for the required skills, such as for ecasting needs, procurement processes, warehousing and distribution, stock management and maintenance (of medical devices). WHO will contribute to the global understanding of supply and demand dynamics and to platforms for collaborative approaches to procu rement and facilitating the development of supporting policies and guidelines for improved capacity. In addition, the activity will contribute to support supply management in emergencies and crisis situations which may create an urgent need for health prod ucts. Being prepared with the necessary products, plans and tools is essential for manufacturers, regulators, donor agencies, supply chain managers and health workers. 47. Appropriate prescribing, dispensing and rational use of medicines. This activity will contribute to ensuring health impacts and the effective use of resources. This will require training of health care workers, quality improvement processes and routine monitoring of the use of medicines. WHO will support countries by consolidating interventi ons to ensure that prescribers have the capacity to implement clinical guidelines and other proven strategies and that policy guidance is aligned, from selection of medicines to prescribing practices. Work on responsible use will be reinforced to guarantee the appropriate prescription and use of medicines and other health products, including working with partners to improve health literacy. WHO will support countries in implementing stewardship programmes, with a focus on antimicrobials, and will support co untries in developing policies and regulations to ensure access, appropriate prescribing, dispensing and use of controlled medicines for the treatment of pain and palliative care while minimizing the risk of diversion and misuse. Capacity for monitoring wi ll be provided especially for the use of antibiotics in health facilities and in the community.

VIII. How WHO will collab orate on access to health products 48. As described in the document Towards access 2030 ,3 the key stakeholder groups with whom collaboration will be strengthened and sustained include United Nations and other international partners, research institutions and a cademia , donors, civil society and the private sector. Collaboration with each of these broad groups provides an opportunity for WHO to synergize action and to be a more active and effective partner. Collaboration with United Nations and other internationa l agencies will focus on optimizing information flows, sharing information and implementing mechanisms to ensure 1 Corresponding mandates: medicines and r eport 2017 : towards a World Health 2018. Available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/272972 (accessed 11 November 2018). A72/17 Annex 22 coordination in the field. Collaboration with academia will continue to leverage each entity's comparative advantages so as to achieve faster a nd better impact on access, while collaboration with donors will focus on enhanced advocacy to enable funding partners to contribute to the agenda described in this road map. The growing importance of civil society's role in influencing health leads WHO to engage civil society in policy and advocacy processes and help channel their expertise and experience in countries. Lastly, WHO will seek to engage with the private sector to find solutions to health challenges, such as the need for public health -driven r esearch and development, pricing and affordability of health products, and leveraging innovative technologies and solutions for health. IX. How WHO will measure progress on access to health products 49. WHO's impact framework for the Thirteenth General Programme o f Work and its targets and indicators are aligned with the Sustainable Develo pment Goals and Health Assembly approved resolutions and action plans. The present road map aligns with the draft Prop osed programme budget 2020 -20211 and the WHO Impact Framework2 targets for outcome 1.3 (Improved access to essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and devices for primary health care).3 The relevant targets and corresponding indicators are listed below.
