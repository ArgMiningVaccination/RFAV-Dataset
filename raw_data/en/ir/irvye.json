Plotkin 1 How Would We License and Use a CMV Vaccine? Final Salt Lake City 2014 9/19/2014 9:00 AM 2 Why a CMV Vaccine? To prevent congenital infection To prevent CMV infection in transplant recipients -Seronegative solid organ transplant recipients at high risk of primary infection -Seropositive bone marrow transplant patients at high risk of reactivation Role of CMV in atherosclerosis and restenosis ? Role of CMV in immunosenescence and cognitive function? US National Academy of Sciences highest priority Live CMV Vaccines in Development Attenuated strain (Towne) Med Coll VA Non-Living CMV Vaccines Self-Replicating RNA Novartis Peptides City of Hope Dense bodies Vaccine Project Management (Germany) Virus-like particles and soluble pentamers Variations Bio, Redbiotech, Humabs 4 Lessons Learned from Prior CMV Vaccine Trials and Other Studies in Humans Neutralizing responses to gB can be elicited by a variety of vaccine approaches gB, if adjuvanted, is a protective antigen against CMV infection in seronegative women and solid organ transplant recipients. Importance of antibodies that neutralize entry into epithelial cells? Live attenuated virus also protected immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients against severe disease, and volunteers against low dose challenge. CTL cell responses to pp65 can reduce replication of CMV in hematogenous stem cell recipients 5 6 Chief Unanswered Questions About Prevention of CMV \u00a7 Importance of cellular immune response in maternal-fetal transmission? \u00a7 Can maternal-fetal infection in seropositive women be prevented by boosting antibody or CMI? \u00a7 Can protective immune responses be prolonged? Probable First Targets for CMV Vaccination Girls 11-13 yrs. age (association Seronegative organ transplant recipients Seropositive hematogenous stem cell recipients 7 How to Demonstrate Efficacy of a CMV Vaccine \u00d8 Artificial challenge with low passage virus \u00d8 Prevent infection of women whose children are in day care \u00d8 Prevent infection of children entered in day care \u00d8 Prevent disease or infection in solid organ or stem cell transplant recipients \u00d8 Cohort study in pre-pregnant women to prevent later fetal infection \u00d8 Prevention of fetal disease 8 Challenge Studies Advantages: Small numbers of subjects Quick answer Disadvantages: -Need challenge virus of defined virulence and dose -Can results be extrapolated to natural infection? to other CMV strains? -Ethical issues 9 Endpoint: Infection Advantages: \"Real-life\" challenge High exposure Easy to define whether virus came from child Disadvantages: Ethical issue about other means of prevention Doesn't test protection of fetus Vaccination of Non-Pregnant Women Whose Children are in Day Care 10 Endpoint: Infection of women Vaccination of Children Attending Day Care 11 Advantages: Decreases circulation of CMV Protects their mothers Disadvantages: Will immunity last until child-bearing age? Endpoint: Infection of children Advantages Real test of public health value of vaccination If not infected, can't transmit to fetus Answer available with minimum specimens Disadvantage Doesn't measure protection of fetus Vaccination of Women Intending Pregnancy 12 Endpoint: Infection of women Vaccination of Women Intending Pregnancy with Follow-up 13 Can demonstrate prevention of transmission to fetus Demonstrates real public health value Long study duration Advantages:: Disadvantages:: Endpoint: Infection of fetus Diagnosis of Neonatal Infection (Sensitivity) PCR - urine (100%) blood (100%) Virus - urine (100%), saliva (100%), blood (28%) IgM antibody (71%) Antigen - blood (43%) 14 Vaccination in Solid Organ Transplantation (Recipients) Possible Endpoint: Viral Load Use of Antivirals Graft rejection 15 Vaccination in Bone Marrow Transplantation (Recipients \u00b1 Donors) Possible Endpoint: Return of CTL Viral Load Use of Antivirals Disease 16 Speculative Targets for CMV Vaccination All infants, to reduce viral circulation Seropositive recipients of bone marrow transplant Prospective cardiac bypass patients (to prevent atherosclerosis) All elderly (to prevent immunosenescense) 17 Overall reduction in the annual number of cCMV infections at equilibrium by proportion of individuals effectively vaccinated by age at vaccination, assuming age-specific duration of infectiousness, 20-year duration of latency, and a vaccine with 5-year duration of protection, United States and Brazil. 18 Lanzieri TM, et al.

Conclusions 22 The components of a CMV vaccine are still being defined, but the candidates are known Licensure of a CMV Vaccine is feasible, but: - the choice of target populations is not yet defined. - at the minimum they will include seronegative women and transplant recipients 23 Back Up 24 Clinical Courier 24(18):1 (May 2006) Situations in which Antibodies Protect Against CMV Disease Newborns exposed to WBC carrying CMV Solid organ transplant recipients given passive antibodies Bone Marrow transplant recipients given passive antibodies (equivocal) Animal models (guinea pigs, mice) Protection of placenta by maternal antibodies Protection of fetus by infused antibodies ? 25 Neutralizing titers to CMV in adults After Natural Infection or Towne vaccine Group No. of Virus No. of Doses/Subject Subjects Reciprocal Antibodies Geometric Mean Neutralizing Titer Females Wild-type 0 15 488 (256-2048) Males Towne 23 270 (128-1024) Males Towne 2 43 402 (128-2048) Males Towne 3 12 512 Adler S, et al.
