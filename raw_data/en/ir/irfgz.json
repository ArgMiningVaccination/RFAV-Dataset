Geriatric Fellowship Curriculum This curricular content was authored by our HRSA Grant Faculty to enhance geriatric care by adding the element of Optimal Aging to what has previously been a disease oriented curriculum. Since Osteopathic Medicine incorporates treatment of the whole person, body, mind and spirit, we felt that the inclusion of Optimal Aging was essential. he concept of Optimal Aging is defined as: the capacity to function across many domains\u2014physical, functional, cognitive, emotional, social, and spiritual - to one's satisfaction and in spite of one's medical conditions. The curriculum includes Goals and Objectives and includes evaluation. It incorporates both AOA and ACGME standards since it has been one of our goals to create dually accredited fellowship and residency programs in light of an evolving single accreditation system. Our curricular modules were created to be used by our geriatric fellows in a year-long geriatric fellowship. However, it was created in such a manner that portions of it may be used for residency training and undergraduate medical training. We invite you to review the curriculum and use any parts of it that may help you in your educational training needs. We ask only that you give appropriate credit to our grant faculty for their authorship. The curriculum is currently displayed in PDF files to allow it to be more easily placed on our website. We welcome any feedback that you might have with regards to our curriculum as we are continuing to modify and update.
