Find out how. Coronary angioplasty with stenting (also known as percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI) is a treatment that helps improve the blood supply to your heart. Many people find they can do more after the procedure and their symptoms, such as chest pain and breathlessness, get better. Most people can return to their normal lives within a few weeks after having a coronary angioplasty with stents. If your doctor has told you or a loved one that a coronary angioplasty with a stent is needed, you might be wondering what is a stent, how does it work, how serious is having a stent put in, how to prepare for a coronary angioplasty, or what the recovery will be like after the procedure. On this page, our trusted specialists give evidence-based information and answer the most common questions people have about coronary angioplasty and stents (PCI), including: Angioplasty is a common, generally painless procedure that is used to open up narrowed or blocked arteries (the vessels that supply blood to your heart muscle). You'll be given local anaesthetic at the start of the procedure. A narrow flexible tube (called a catheter) is put into your wrist or groin (the area of your hip between your stomach and thigh) and pushed up to the coronary artery. A small balloon at the end of the tube is blown up to widen the narrowed part of your artery. Sometimes if the artery is so narrow that the balloon can't pass through it, a tiny drill might also be used (this is called [rotablation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/ask-the-experts/rotablation)) to chip away at the fatty deposits, to gradually widen the narrowing. Most of the time angioplasty is combined with putting in a small metal mesh tube (called a stent). When the balloon is deflated and the catheter tube and balloon are removed, the stent stays in place, acting like a scaffold to keep your artery open. You may hear your doctor call coronary angioplasty with stenting a PCI. PCI is a medical abbreviation (name) for percutaneous coronary intervention. Your coronary arteries play a vital role in keeping your heart healthy. But in some people, fatty deposits can build up and narrow or block the coronary arteries (this is called [atherosclerosis](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/atherosclerosis), which can cause [coronary heart disease](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/coronary-heart-disease)). If not enough blood is flowing through the coronary arteries, this can lead to [angina ](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/angina)or a [heart attack](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/heart-attack). Coronary angioplasty widens narrowed coronary arteries. This procedure is used: Angioplasty isn't for everyone. Depending on your health and individual heart conditions, you may be advised that you need [coronary artery bypass surgery](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/treatments/coronary-bypass-surgery). In most cases coronary angioplasty and stenting improves the blood flow through the treated artery. Many people find their symptoms [get better ](#ben) and they're able to do more. Sometimes the artery can become narrowed again (restenosis), causing angina symptoms. But advances in stent technology mean that the risk of this happening is getting lower. Many people are now symptom-free for a long time.

The pain should go away within five minutes. If it doesn't, take your GTN again. If the pain hasn't gone away within five minutes of taking the second dose of GTN, call 999 immediately.
