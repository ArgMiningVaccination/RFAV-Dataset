These can include fatigue, brain fog, memory loss, hair loss, numbness and tingling, shortness of breath, and many other symptoms. Renowned pathologist Dr. Bruce Patterson and his team have been researching to uncover the underlying immunologic causes of Chronic COVID. He and his team have taken care of over 20,000 Covid Long Haulers. Dr. Lalezar has been directly working with Dr. Patterson's teams and implementing his protocol successfully on her patients. Vaccine Injury Treatment If you are experiencing an injury after the Covid vaccine or another vaccine, Dr. Shiva will be able to assess your specific needs and determine the right holistic treatment for your vaccine injury. How To Treat Covid Long Haul Dr. Lalezar will order a Cytokine panel that evaluates 14 immune markers and Covid Long Haul Index. Based on this test, a protocol will be written. This protool may include statins that reduce inflammation in the lining of arteries, an antidepressant, and Moravorac, which acts as an immunomodulator. High-dose IV Vitamin C, IV Glutathione, chelation therapy, and different nutritional supplements are also very helpful in treating Covid Long Haul. Please note that at this time, testing and treatments for long Covid are not FDA-approved and the treatments used are \"off-label.\" Since this virus is novel, physicians are still trying to figure out how to help patients.
