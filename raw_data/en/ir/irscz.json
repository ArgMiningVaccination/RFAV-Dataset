The goal is to learn as much as possible about the patient through a comprehensive patient history intake, with a physical examination, an assessment of the patient's diet, environment, toxic load, stress, and other aspects of lifestyle and proper diagnosis with appropriate testing. A homeopathic visit is different that our regular initial consultations. The first visit with our Toronto naturopath for homeopathic case taking will usually last 60 minutes. During the visit, the naturopathic doctor - SUSHMA SHAH will review the patient's medical history, attempt to elicit a full picture of the patient's symptoms - mental, emotional, and physical along with the appropriate testing. This visit will be followed by a second visit, during which a physical exam will be conducted. During a homeopathic consult, our naturopath will go through a host of questions related to the various symptoms that you may wish to resolve. Homeopathic remedies are symptom specific and very individual, hence a lot of questions are based on the finer details of the symptoms, for example, for a muscle ache, what side you may have symptoms on each time you get a specific symptom or if hot / cold applications improve or worsen the symptom, or if lying on the one side improve a specific symptom or worsen it. The second visit will include a complete physical exam and appropriate laboratory tests - standard and specialized and other standard diagnostic procedures to evaluate the physiologic function of the individual (if required). Once all the information is collected, our naturopath - SUSHMA SHAH will research the remedy that would fit your symptom picture, she will also be analyzing the information on the computer to provide you with a computer generated remedy list, with the homeopathic remedy most suitable for your resolving your symptoms. A homeopathic medicine will be chosen to match the patient's unique symptoms after the physical exam and proper diagnosis is completed. Sometimes the naturopathic doctor will need to do even more research before choosing the ideal homeopathic medicine. This will be provided at the treatment plan visit, which follows after the first and second visit. Diagnosis of the disease is only part of the process; once a good understanding of the patient's health and disease status is established, the naturopathic doctor and the patient work together to establish a treatment and health-promoting program. Scheduling of follow-up visits will vary depending on the case and the practitioner's philosophy. Intervals of four to six weeks are not unusual. A naturopathic - homeopathic follow-up visit typically lasts about 30 minutes. * DISCLAIMER: The information on this page is the property of Dr. Sushma Shah, Naturopathic Doctor, and is not intended to treat, diagnose or cure any diseases or promote any services or products mentioned on the website.
