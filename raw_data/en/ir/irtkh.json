The CCDF program also provides funding to enhance the quality of child care for all children. The CCDF Plan is how states and territories apply for CCDF funding (658E (a)) and is the primary mechanism that the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) uses to determine state and territory compliance with the requirements of the law and rule (98.16). ACF acknowledges that in the FY 2022 - 2024 Plan, states and territories may still be operating under approved waivers related to the COVID-19 pandemic and where appropriate plan responses should reflect the approved waivers. The CCDF Plan allows states and territories to describe their implementation of the CCDF program and it is organized into the following sections: 1. Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems and Funding Sources 2. Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Education 3. Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families 4. Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low-Income Children 5. Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings 6. Recruit and Retain a Qualified and Effective Child Care Workforce 7. Support Continuous Quality Improvement 8. Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability These organizational categories reflect key goals of an integrated system of child care for low- income working families. Although the Plan is divided into sections for reporting and accountability purposes, ACF encourages Lead Agencies to approach the Plan in a cross-cutting, integrated manner. The intention is that grantees and the federal government will be able to use this information to track and assess progress, determine the need for technical assistance (TA), and determine compliance with specific requirements. Citations ACF recognizes that Lead Agencies use different mechanisms to establish policies, such as state statute, regulations, administrative rules, or policy manuals or policy issuances. When asked to provide a citation in the CCDF Plan, Lead Agencies should list the citation(s) for the policy that clearly identifies and establishes the requirement and that allows the Lead Agency to enforce the requirement. Lead Agencies may list multiple sources as needed to cover all types of providers receiving CCDF (e.g., policies for licensed providers may be established in licensing regulations, and policies for license-exempt providers may be in subsidy rules). These citations are intended to provide documentation to support the requested information but not replace requested responses or descriptions. Complete answers must include citations, responses, and descriptions. CCDF Plan Submission 5 | P a g e States and territories will submit their Plans electronically through the ACF-118 electronic submission site. The ACF-118 site will include all language and questions included in the final CCDF Plan Preprint template approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Please note that the format of the questions on the ACF-118 site could be modified from the Word version of the document to ensure compliance with Section 508 policies regarding accessibility to electronic and information technology for individuals with disabilities. (See http://www.section508.gov/ for more information.) In responding to questions, states and territories are asked to provide brief, specific summaries and/or bullet points only with specific language that responds to the question. Do not use tables or copy and paste charts, add attachments, or paste manuals into the Plan. All information and materials developed to support CCDF implementation and information reported in the CCDF Plan are subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing oversight and monitoring efforts. 1 Define Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems and Funding Sources This section identifies the leadership for the CCDF program in each Lead Agency and the entities and individuals who will participate in the implementation of the program. It also identifies the stakeholders that were consulted to develop the Plan and who the Lead Agency collaborates with to implement services. Respondents are asked to identify how match and maintenance-of- effort (MOE) funds are used. Lead Agencies explain their coordination with child care resource and referral (CCR&R) systems and describe their efforts on their disaster preparedness and response plans to support continuity of operations in response to emergencies. 1.1 CCDF Leadership The Governor of a state or territory must designate an agency (which may be an appropriate collaborative agency) or establish a joint interagency office to represent the state or territory as the Lead Agency. The Lead Agency agrees to administer the program in accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations and the provisions of this Plan, including the assurances and certifications appended hereto (658D; 658E(c)(1) and 98.16 (a)). Note: An amendment to the CCDF State Plan is required if the Lead Agency changes or if the Lead Agency official changes. 1.1.1 Which Lead Agency is designated to administer the CCDF program? Identify the Lead Agency or joint interagency office designated by the state or territory. ACF will send official grant correspondence, such as grant awards, grant adjustments, Plan approvals, and disallowance notifications, to the designated contact identified here (658D(a) and 98.16(a)). a.

The Lead Agency contracts by annual sub-awards with two community-based resource and referral agencies, one in the North and one in the South, that perform eligibility determinations, as well as consumer education and resource and referral. The Lead Agency tracks categorical expenditures in accordance with CCDF requirements. All contractors are required to 10 | P a g e adhere to the program policies reflected in the Nevada Child Care Policy Manual and oversight is accomplished through a variety of auditing processes including Quality Control reviews conducted by Quality Control staff as well as annual monitoring by a team consisting of the Lead Agency's internal auditor, a contracted CPA, and fiscal and program staff. The two resource and referral agencies monitor the before and after school programs that are private as well as all Family, Friend, and Neighbor (FFN) providers. State Child Care Licensing is administered by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); they provide child care licensing for all counties aside from Washoe County. The Washoe County Human Services Agency conducts child care licensing in Washoe County. Washoe County are required to follow the same code as State Licensing; however, they may adopt standards that are not less restrictive than those adopted under State Licensing (NRS 432A.131). Both child care licensing entities license providers, and monitor background check compliance, health and safety requirements, and group size and ratio requirements. The Lead Agency contracts with both State child care licensing and Washoe County child care licensing through annual subawards and the Lead Agency conducts annual monitoring by a team consisting of the Lead Agency's internal auditor, a contracted CPA, and fiscal and program staff. State child care licensing monitors all licensed child care outside of Washoe County and they monitor city and county affiliated before and after school that receive CCDF statewide; Washoe County is responsible for monitoring all licensed providers in Washoe County. Quality activities are conducted by the Lead Agency, contracted Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, and also by the Nevada Department of Education's (NDE) Office of Early Learning and Development (OELD) program. The Lead Agency contracts with NDE/OELD through an annual subaward to conduct quality improvements in early childhood statewide and is monitored by the Lead Agency's internal auditor, a contracted CPA, and fiscal and program staff. 1.2.4 Information systems availability to public agencies Upon request, and to the extent practicable and appropriate, Lead Agencies must ensure any code or software for child care information systems or information technology for which a Lead Agency or other agency expends CCDF funds to develop must be made available to other public agencies. This includes public agencies in other states, for their use in administering child care or related programs (98.15(a)(11)). Assure by describing how the Lead Agency makes child care information systems (e.g., subsidy, registry, and QRIS systems) available to public agencies in other states. Information and statistical data regarding Nevada's child care systems can be found at the following public websites: dwss.nv.gov/childcare; (http://www.nvsilverstatestars.org/) http://www.nvsilverstatestars.org/; (https://nevadachildcare.org/) https://nevadachildcare.org. Should a public agency, including public agencies from other states, request information about Nevada's child care systems directly via email or phone, the representative would verify the purpose for the request, and provide the requester with information needed. 1.2.5 Confidential and personal identifiable information policies Lead Agencies must have in effect policies to govern the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information about children and families receiving CCDF assistance and child care providers receiving CCDF funds (98.15(b)(13)). Certify by describing the Lead Agency's policies related to the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information. The Lead Agency utilizes its application for assistance to provide parents with its policies related to the use and disclosure of confidential and personally-identifiable information. The application states as follows: By signing below, you authorize the release of information about your household members to the Child 11 | P a g e Care and development Program including, wage information, information made confidential by law or otherwise, and patient information privileged under NRS 49.225 or any other provision of law or otherwise. You release the holder of such information from liability, if any, resulting from disclosure of the required information.

Describe: 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds, CCDF Matching, and Maintenance-of-Effort Funds Optional Use of Combined Funds: States and territories have the option to combine CCDF funds with any required program in 1.4.1. These programs include those operating at the federal, state, and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with disabilities, children experiencing homelessness, and children in foster care (658E(c)(2)(O)(ii)). Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children and families to allow for the delivery of comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, state/territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a state/territory may allow a county/local government to use coordinated funding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding sources to pay for full-day, full-year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start Program Performance Standards or state/territory Prekindergarten requirements in addition to state/territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and CCDF is strongly encouraged by sections 640(g)(1)(D) and (E); 640(h); 641(d)(2)(H)(v); and 642(e)(3) of 20 | P a g e the Head Start Act in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services. To implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment, or materials, grantees may layer several funding streams so that seamless services are provided (Policy and Program Guidance for the Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/acf_im_ohs_15_03.pdf ). 1.5.1 Combined funding for CCDF services Does the Lead Agency choose to combine funding for CCDF services for any programs identified in 1.4.1 (98.14(a)(3))? [ ] No (If no, skip to question 1.5.2) [x] Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum: a. How you define \"combine\" Braiding funds to support programming. b. Which funds you will combine? CCDF, Head Start, and WIOA c. What is your purpose and expected outcomes for combining funds, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full-day, full-year programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care, or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations? Note: Responses should align with the goals, processes and results describe in 1.4.1. Head Start: funds are provided through contracts to HS/EHS agencies to extend services to a full day for CCDP children; WIOA: funds are provided through sub-award to Workforce Connections to increase child care workforce capacity. d. How you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the state/territory level, local level, program level? At the program level. e. How are the funds tracked and method of oversight Funds are provided through contracts, sub-awards, and memorandums of understanding, etc. Contracts, eligibility, and service provisions are reviewed and monitored via established State monitoring and audit process. 1.5.2 CCDF Matching and MOE Requirements Which of the following funds does the Lead Agency intend to use to meet the CCDF matching and MOE requirements described in 98.55(e) and 98.55(h)? Check all that apply. Note: Lead Agencies that use Prekindergarten funds to meet matching requirements must check Prekindergarten funds and public and/or private funds. Use of PreK for Maintenance of Effort: The CCDF Final Rule clarifies that public PreK funds may also serve as maintenance-of-effort funds as long as the state/territory can describe how it will coordinate PreK and child care services to expand the availability of child care while using public Prekindergarten funds as no more than 20 percent of the state's or territory's maintenance of effort or 30 percent of its matching funds in a single fiscal year (FY) (98.55(h)). If expenditures for PreK services are used to meet the maintenance-of-effort requirement, the state/territory must certify that it has not 21 | P a g e reduced its level of effort in full-day/full-year child care services (98.55(h)(1); 98.15(a)(6)). Use of Private Funds for Match or Maintenance of Effort: Donated funds do not need to be under the administrative control of the Lead Agency to qualify as an expenditure for federal match. However, Lead Agencies do need to identify and designate in the state/territory Plan the donated funds given to public or private entities to implement the CCDF child care program (98.55(f)). [ ] a. N/A\u2014The territory is not required to meet CCDF matching and MOE requirements. [x] b. Public funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fund requirement. Public funds may include any general revenue funds, county or other local public funds, state- /territory-specific funds (tobacco tax, lottery), or any other public funds. i.

ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate how they encourage public-private partnerships to leverage existing child care and early education service-delivery systems and to increase the supply and quality of child care services for children younger than age 13, for example, by implementing voluntary shared service alliance models (98.14(a)(4)). 1.6.1 Lead Agency public-private partnerships Identify and describe any public-private partnerships encouraged by the Lead Agency to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Include in the response any public-private partnerships that have emerged from the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (98.16(d)(2)) and if applicable, how those partnerships will be continued post- pandemic. CCDP is in partnership with the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), which works with licensed child care facilities to provide training and mental health consultants to support child care providers caring for children with potential social-emotional needs. CCDP is in partnership with the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH), which provides child care licensing to ensure basic health and safety of licensed child care providers. In addition, Nevada Early Intervention Services provides training and TA to licensed child care facilities on the topic of inclusion for children with special needs. In July of 2014 the Office of Early Care and Education was transferred from the Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (which houses the CCDP), to the Nevada Department of Education (NDE). This was done as an opportunity to promote, facilitate, and further the goals and objectives for improving early childhood 23 | P a g e learning and development in Nevada. NDE Staff oversee the State's CCDF quality activities in order to align activities with the State's P-12 education goals. CCDP is in partnership with the Children's Cabinet, which provides professional development opportunities to both early childhood and out of school providers in an effort to improve the skills and knowledge of the workforce and develop a system of continual quality improvement. Community outreach efforts are provided in order to increase the general public's understanding and demand for high quality early learning opportunities for children. The Early Childhood Support Network provides modeling of high quality teacher interactions with children, and at the same time substitute teachers help licensed child care providers maintain ratios during teacher turnover and absences. Parent engagement supports and encourages parents to advocate for their children by giving them information and skills in supporting them as their children's first and most important teacher. CCDP is in partnership with the Las Vegas Urban League, which provides child care resource and referral consultations services to parents to find high quality child care. Family, Friend, and Neighbor case management and home visitation increase the quality of child care offered by non-licensed providers. Outreach is provided to newly licensed child care providers to increase the supply of providers registered on the subsidy programs. CCDP is in partnership with the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada and the Lead Agency to develop a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure ongoing inclusion and consideration of the needs associated with tribal components. The CCDP conducts ongoing consultations with the Intertribal Council of Nevada to assist one another with the coordination and development of policies and procedures. Wraparound services are provided to a variety of before and after school programs to provide full day services and access to services for school age children. The CCDP provided a draft of the State Plan to Nevada tribes for consultation and feedback in addition to an invitation to the State Plan public hearing. The following tribes were contacted for consultation: Ely Shoshone Tribe, Inter-Tribal Council of NV Inc, Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, Moapa River Indian Reservation Moapa Band of Paiutes, Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, Reno/Sparks Indian Colony, and Shoshone Paiute Tribe. CCDP is in partnership with the Library District to align programming and policy around recruitment and support of Family, Friend, and Neighbor to cohorts/networks. CCDP is in partnership with Workforce Connection, WIOA Administrator, to braid funding to support child care workforce recruitment. CCDP is in partnership with Boys and Girls Clubs statewide to support wraparound for school age children and mental health and special health needs services. 24 | P a g e CCDP is partnering with County and City government officials to strategize braiding funding and streamline services. 1.7 Coordination with Child Care Resource and Referral Systems Lead Agencies may use CCDF funds to establish or support a system or network of local or regional child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizations that is coordinated, to the extent determined by the state/territory, by a statewide public or private non-profit, community-based or regionally based, lead child care resource and referral organization (such as a statewide CCR&R network) (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii); 98.52). If Lead Agencies use CCDF funds for local CCR&R organizations, the local or regional CCR&R organizations supported by those funds must, at the direction of the Lead Agency: Provide parents in the state with consumer education information concerning the full range of child care options (including faith-based and community-based child care providers), analyzed by provider, including child care provided during non-traditional hours and through emergency child care centers, in their area. To the extent practicable, work directly with families who receive assistance to offer the families support and assistance to make an informed decision about which child care providers they will use to ensure that the families are enrolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting that suits their needs and one that is of high quality (as determined by the Lead Agency). Collect data and provide information on the coordination of services and supports, including services under Part B, Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Collect data and provide information on thesupply of and demand for child care services in areas of the state and submit the information to the state. Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith- based and community-based child care providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the state and, as appropriate, coordinate their activities with the activities of the state Lead Agency and local agencies that administer funds made available through CCDF (98.52(b)). Nothing in the statute or rule prohibits states from using CCR&R agencies to conduct or provide additional services beyond those required by statute or rule. Note: Use 1.7.1 to address if a state/territory funds a CCR&R organization, describe what services are provided and how it is structured. Use subsection 7.5 to address the services provided by the local or regional child care resource and referral agencies and the indicators of progress met by CCR&R organizations if they are funded by quality set-aside funds. 1.7.1 Funding local or regional CCR&R organizations Does the Lead Agency fund local or regional CCR&R organizations?

A key purpose of the CCDBG Act is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings\" (658A(b)). Lead Agencies have the opportunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care consumer education websites. The target audience for the consumer education information includes three groups: parents 27 | P a g e receiving CCDF assistance, the general public, and when appropriate, child care providers. OCC expects that Lead Agencies are using targeted strategies for each group to ensure tailored consumer education information. In this section, Lead Agencies will address how information is made available to families, the general public and child care providers to assist them in accessing high-quality child care and how information is shared on other financial assistance programs or supports for which a family might be eligible. In addition, Lead Agencies will certify that information on developmental screenings is provided and will describe how research and best practices concerning children's development, including their social-emotional development, is shared. This section also covers the parental complaint process and the consumer education website that has been developed by the Lead Agency. Finally, this section addresses the consumer statement that is provided to parents supported with CCDF funds. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals, or policy issuances.

Describe whether the process includes monitoring, and highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and non-CCDF providers and licensed and license- exempt providers: Each complaint is assessed by a qualified person trained to determine whether the allegations present a situation that may cause substantial harm, minimal harm or no harm (but conditions are not desirable). Each allegation is further assessed to determine whether there is a regulation or law related to the allegation. Based on these assessments complaints are generally given priorities as follows: - Immediate Response = imminent harm (same day response required) - Priority 1 = not imminent, but possible risk involved (1-3 day response time) - Priority 2 = no observed or perceived danger (10-15 day response time) - Priority 3 = NAC or NRS violations noted (30 day response) Some other factors considered during prioritization include: the age of the complaint (if the event occurred in the distant past for example, more than one year prior to filing the complainant, the priority may be adjusted accordingly), the relevance of the information given to regulatory violations (if the information is difficult to align with regulations, the priority may be adjusted accordingly). Licensed Exempt: - All provider complaints are documented using our Child Abuse and Neglect reporting form. All reports are then made to CPS or applicable agency. If the issue cannot be immediately resolved, the provider is terminated from the Subsidy program. When a complaint is made, a monitoring visit is established right away and we reserve the right to do an unannounced visit which includes two staff memebers. The program responds within 24 hours to the complaint and the parent is immediately notified. All complaints are kept in the provider's file regardless of outcome. - If a provider is found to be in non-compliance at the Health and Safety Visit (or follow-up visit), they must be given-up to 30 calendar days to make the noted corrections indicated on the H&S Checklist. Recommendations for improvement must be made and a followup visit must be scheduled. If improvements are not made within the required time period, the provider must be terminated from the Child Care and Development Program giving the client 10 days to find a new provider. Exception: In Clients home. Recommendations for improvements must be made. However, termination must not occur if recommendations for improvement are not pursued. If at any time R&R staff believe the health and/or safety of the child is at risk, regardless of the type of care, Child Care staff must assess the situation to validate if a report with the Department of Child Protection Services should be made. If there is validation for a report, the CPS & Child Care Licensing form will be completed, the original copy sent to the applicable licensing agency and a copy of the form kept in the provider file. 2.2.3 Maintaining records of substantiated parental complaints Certify by describing how the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints. Highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and non-CCDF providers and licensed and license-exempt providers: Licensed: - All incoming complaints are inputted for intake, assigned an Inspector (as necessary), report generated for review of findings and pend supervisor closure This complaint system is tracked and monitored by 30 | P a g e licensing Manager and Supervisor through the licensing system which details out the intake, priority, assessment, findings and approved closure. All completed complaints (Substantiated or UnSubstantiated) can be viewed by the public online. Licensed Exempt: - Our Reporting Child Abuse and Neglect form is placed in the provider's permanent file and case noted and provider is ineligible from becoming a subsidy provider in the future. Parents are informed of provider's ineligible status upon making the registration appointment. All complaints are kept in the provider's file regardless of outcome. 2.2.4 Making information about substantiated parental complaints available to the public Certify by describing how the Lead Agency makes information about substantiated parental complaints available to the public; this information can include the consumer education website discussed in section 2.3: Licensed: All incoming complaints are inputted for intake, assigned an Inspector (as necessary), report generated for review of findings and pend supervisor closure This complaint system is tracked and monitored by licensing Manager and Supervisor through the licensing system which details out the intake, priority, assessment, findings and approved closure. All completed complaints (Substantiated or Unsubstantiated) can be viewed by the public online through child care licensing at: (https://nvdpbh.aithent.com/Protected/LIC/LicenseeSearch.aspx?Program=HF&PubliSearch=Y&returnURL=%7e% 2fLogin.aspx%3fTI%3d2#noback) https://nvdpbh.aithent.com/Protected/LIC/LicenseeSearch.aspx?Program=HF&PubliSearch=Y&returnURL=%7e%2 fLogin.aspx%3fTI%3d2#noback. Public can enter the name of the provider, type of care and other search criteria to pull up records. Once record is located, public can select View Detail under the Action column. This will open the provider record to display complaints, inspection reports and other actions associated with the provider. Licensed Exempt: - Our Reporting Child Abuse and Neglect form is placed in the provider's permanent file and case noted and provider is ineligible from becoming a subsidy provider in the future. Parents are informed of provider's ineligible status upon making the registration appointment. It is not posted on the web or made available to the public at large. 2.2.5 Citations related to parental complaints Provide the citation to the Lead Agency's policy and process related to parental complaints: NRS 432A.178 Child care facility required to maintain certain information; reporting of information to parents and guardians; notice of right to information. 1.

The POC must contain an acceptable (approved by the Division) timeframe for the correction to all noted deficiencies within the SOD and then proof of those corrections must be submitted or observed prior to license expiration. Technical assistance is always offered to facilities to help ensure they understand what is expected, why and how they can meet compliance. Failure to correct any deficiency could lead to progressive action including but not limited to Notice of Violation (NOV), Sanctions/Fines, provisional license, suspension, or revocation. If any areas of non- compliance are identified during the visit, Section F of the checklist is used to outline the non- performance areas, and provider follow up visit is scheduled as needed with 30 days to ensure corrections were made. Section G of the inspection checklist provides the follow up inspection outcomes. Provider can be subject to penalties, including termination if corrections are not made timely. [x] A minimum of 3 years of results, where available. c. How and where are reports posted in a timely manner?

Effective April 1, 2019, the Child Care and Development Program (CCDP) began the process of rolling out CCDP funded Technical Assistance Center for Social-Emotional Intervention (TACSEI) trainings and support to licensed providers who accept child care certificates through either The Children's Cabinet or The Las Vegas Urban League, with the exception of Head Start programs. Listed below are the trainings and support which will be implemented: - Required Training: At least one designated staff member with a leadership role (e.g. director or assistant director) at any child care site that is funded with CCDF dollars must complete either the TACSEI ePyramid training or the TACSEI in-person training covering modules 1-3. - Implementation of Training Content: The designated staff member mentioned above will facilitate implementation of methods that promote social-emotional development, including building positive relationships, creating supportive environments, and facilitating social-emotional teaching strategies amongst the staff in their child care center. - Scheduled Support: Childcare Information and Resource Phone Support (CHIRPS) community of practice phone conferences with a Pyramid Model Specialist will be regularly scheduled to provide a platform for group discussions and support with implementation of the training content. - Real-Time Support: A support hotline will be available for immediate assistance from a Pyramid Model Specialist. - In-Person Training: A designated staff member must attend an in-person TACSEI training on Pyramid Model Module 3 content prior to a temporary or permanent removal of a child from their program. 2.5 Procedures for Providing Information on Developmental Screenings Lead Agencies are required to provide information on developmental screenings to parents, the 44 | P a g e general public and, when applicable, child care providers. Information should include: Existing resources and services that the state can use in conducting developmental screenings and providing referrals to services for children who receive child care assistance. Lead Agencies must also include a description of how a family or child care provider can use these resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for children who receive subsidies and who might be at risk of cognitive or other developmental delays, which can include social, emotional, physical, or linguistic delays (658E(c)(2)(E)(ii)). This information about the resources can include the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program carried out under title XIX of the Social Security Act and developmental screening services available under IDEA Part B, Section 619 and Part C, in conducting those developmental screenings and in providing referrals to services for children who receive subsidies. Lead Agencies are required to provide this information to eligible families during CCDF intake and to child care providers through training and education (98.33(c)). Information on developmental screenings, as other consumer education information, should be accessible for individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with disabilities. 2.5.1 Certify by describing: a. How the Lead Agency collects and disseminates information on existing resources and services available for conducting developmental screenings to CCDF parents, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers (98.15(b)(3)). Information on developmental screenings is provided to all parents upon registering for the Subsidy program. Parents are given the age-appropriate ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE2 upon registration. An online parent portal to complete the ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE2 is also provided. Parents can choose to sign up and be notified to complete their children's screening. This online screening portal link can also be used by the general public. Additionally, parents for all children in FFN settings will have the option to have their children screened by R&R staff using the BRIGANCE Screener III at the initial and annual health and safety visits. Children in licensed child care settings must have assessments at least twice a year per Nevada's Administrative Code. The BRIGANCE screener can fulfill this requirement. Children in district PreK classrooms must have two BRIGANCE screenings, one conducted in the Fall and one in the Spring, of each school year. All BRIGANCE screening information is entered in the Online Management System (OMS) and transferred by Nevada Department of Education staff to Infinite Campus, Nevada's K-12 Student Information System which has an early childhood district for children birth through kindergarten entry. b. The procedures for providing information on and referring families and child care providers to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program\u2014carried out under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.)\u2014and developmental screening services available under Part B, Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1419, 1431 et seq.). Screening results are shared with parents along with activities to support their child's development by R&R staff for FFN BRIGANCE screens and ASQ3 and ASQ:SE2 screens completed on paper or through the portal. If a child does not meet screening cut offs and the screening identifies red flags, the family is referred to Nevada Early Intervention Services 45 | P a g e (Part C) for children ages birth through age 2 and the school district's child find office for children ages 3 and up. c. How the Lead Agency gives information on developmental screenings to parents receiving a subsidy as part of the intake process. Include the information provided, ways it is provided, and any partners in this work. Information on developmental screenings is provided to all parents upon registering for the Subsidy program by the child care resource and referral agency. Information includes What is the ASQ3 Screening and What is the ASQ:SE2 screening informational handouts. In addition to the informational handout, parents are given the age-appropriate ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE2 screening instrument upon registration and are asked to return it to their case manager. Optionally, an online parent portal link to complete the ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE2 is provided. If parents choose to use the online portal, the system will notify parents on when their child has reached the age for the next developmental screening tool. They will be able to complete online. Parents who choose FFN care will also receive information on the BRIGANCE Screener III during their FFN enrollment appointment. At this enrollment appointment, parents can choose to have their child screened in the FFN provider environment using the BRIGANCE tool. d. How CCDF families or child care providers receiving CCDF can use the available resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for CCDF children at risk for cognitive or other developmental delays. Families are given access to screening upon enrollment in Subsidy. R&R case managers follow-up with parents regarding their child's screening results along with developmentally appropriate activities to support their child's development. Licensed providers on QRIS can use their grant to pay for the BRIGANCE Screener III kits. The Online Management System is currently paid for by the Nevada Department of Education and the online parent portal for the ASQ is paid for through CCDF Subsidy. e. How child care providers receive this information through training and professional development. Training for licensed providers on the BRIGANCE Screener III is provided by the Nevada Department of Education. Additionally, child care providers that are TACSEI implementation or model demonstration sites receiving training and technical assistance to use the ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE2 as this is a requirement of the TACSEI program. f. Provide the citation for this policy and procedure related to providing information on developmental screenings. The Children's Cabinet Resource and Referral Policy and Procedures Manual is the current source for this information. The CCDP Policy Manual update will be forthcoming. 2.6 Consumer Statement for Parents Receiving CCDF Funds Lead Agencies must provide CCDF parents with a consumer statement in hard copy or electronically (such as referral to a consumer education website) that contains specific information about the child care provider they select (98.33 d). Please note that if the consumer statement is provided electronically, Lead Agencies should consider ensuring the statement is accessible to parents, including parents with limited access to the internet, and that parents have a way to contact someone to address their questions. 2.6.1 Certify by describing: 46 | P a g e a. How and when the Lead Agency provides parents receiving CCDF funds with a consumer statement identifying the requirements for providers and the health and safety record of the provider they have selected. Nevadachildcare.org is Nevada's Consumer Education landing page. Nevada Child Care Licensing and Washoe County Child Care Licensing have both developed search engine tools which allow access to provider-specific information about health and safety, licensing and regulatory requirements. Additionally, each website provides information on inspections for individual providers. Links to these Licensing websites are found on the Children's Cabinet website: (http://www.childrenscabinet.org/child-care-resources/for-providers/starting-a-license-child- care/?) http://www.childrenscabinet.org/child-care-resources/for-providers/starting-a- license-child-care/ Provider-specific information can be found if you look at NV State Licensing: (http://dpbh.nv.gov/Reg/ChildCare/Child_Care_Licensing_-_Home/) http://dpbh.nv.gov/Reg/ChildCare/Child_Care_Licensing_-_Home/ \"Child Care Inspection Web Portal\". All sites link to one another. The Children's Cabinet and Las Vegas Urban League offer child care resource and referral consultation services in the family's native language by phone, in person, and through an online referral system. Child care licensing entities, Washoe County and the State of Nevada, offer lists of licensed child care providers. The State's Quality Rating and Improvement System website offers lists of licensed child care centers along with their participation and star rating. The Children's Cabinet and Las Vegas Urban League also offer general information about child care resource and referral services through billboards, radio, newsletters, social media, community outreach events, and other public service announcement opportunities. 47 | P a g e b.

In addition to the website information provided to parents, they are also provided with the following tools in hard copy: Quality Care Brochure: (https://www.childrenscabinet.org/who-we-serve/i-am-a-parent/finding- child-care/) https://www.childrenscabinet.org/who-we-serve/i-am-a-parent/finding-child-care/ 3 Stable Child Care Financial Assistance for Families In providing child care assistance to families, Lead Agencies are required to implement these policies and procedures: a minimum 12-month eligibility and redetermination period, a process to account for irregular fluctuations in earnings, a policy ensuring that families' work schedules are not disrupted by program requirements, policies to provide for a job search of no fewer than 3 months if the Lead Agency exercises the option to discontinue assistance, and policies for the graduated phase-out of assistance. In addition, the Lead Agency is also required to describe procedures for the enrollment of children experiencing homelessness and, if applicable, children in foster care. Note: Lead Agencies are not prohibited from establishing policies that extend eligibility beyond 12 months to align program requirements. For example, Lead Agencies can allow children enrolled in Head Start, Early Head Start, state or local Prekindergarten, and other collaborative programs to finish the program year or, similarly, parents enrolled in school can have eligibility extended to allow parents to finish their school year. This type of policy promotes continuity for families receiving services through multiple benefit programs. In this section, Lead Agencies will identify how they define eligible children and families and how the Lead Agency improves access for vulnerable children and families. This section also addresses the policies that protect working families and determine a family's contribution to the child care payment. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances.

Lead Agencies must coordinate with TANF programs to ensure that TANF families with young children will be informed of their right not to be sanctioned if they meet the criteria set forth by the state/territory TANF agency in accordance with Section 407(e)(2) of the Social Security Act. In fulfilling this requirement, the following criteria or definitions are applied by the TANF agency to determine whether the parent has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care. Note: The TANF agency, not the CCDF Lead Agency, is responsible for establishing the following 57 | P a g e criteria or definitions. These criteria or definitions are offered in this Plan as a matter of public record. a. Identify the TANF agency that established these criteria or definitions: The Division of Welfare & Supportive Services b. Provide the following definitions established by the TANF agency: i. \"Appropriate child care\": Child care chosen by the parent which offers developmentally-appropriate practices meeting the needs of that parent and child. ii. \"Reasonable distance\": A parent should not be required to travel more than 60 minutes dropping the child off at the care provider's location, and 60 minutes picking up their child. iii. \"Unsuitability of informal child care\": Informal child care is unsuitable' if it is not being provided legally or it does not meet basic health and safety standards as outlined in the state child care plan. Informal child care is unsuitable if circumstances exist that cause possible abuse, neglect, or harm as outlined in county or state statutes. Informal child care is unsuitable if the arrangements do not support the working schedule of a parent, are not affordable, not easily-accessible, or do not meet quality standards as defined by the parent. iv. \"Affordable child care arrangements\": Child care not exceeding 10-15% of the parent's gross income. c. How are parents who receive TANF benefits informed about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirements? [x] i. In writing [x] ii. Verbally [ ] iii. Other.

Provide the citation for the TANF policy or procedure: Section A-816.2 https://dwss.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dwssnvgov/content/TANF/EP%20Man%20Complete.pdf 3.2 Family Contribution to Payments Lead Agencies are required to establish and periodically revise a sliding-fee scale for CCDF families that varies based on income and the size of the family to determine each family's contribution (i.e., co- payment) that is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF funds (658E(c)(5)). In addition to income and the size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co- payments. Lead Agencies, however, may NOT use cost of care or amount of subsidy payment in determining co-payments (98.45(k)(2)). Questions 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 address co-payments during the initial/entry-eligibility period. To help families transition off child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co-pay amounts for families determined to be eligible under a graduated phase-out. Question 3.2.5 addresses co-58 | P a g e payments during the graduated phase-out period. 3.2.1 CCDF payments according to family size Provide the CCDF co-payments in the chart below according to family size for one child in care. a.

Describe: 3.2.4 Waiving family contributions/co-payments The Lead Agency may waive contributions/co-payments from families whose incomes are at or below the poverty level for a family of the same size (98.45(k)) or for families who are receiving or needing to receive protective services, on a case-by-case basis, as determined for purposes of CCDF eligibility, or who meet other criteria established by the Lead Agency (98.45(k)(4)). Does the Lead Agency waive family contributions/co-payments for any of the following? Check all that apply. [ ] No, the Lead Agency does not waive family contributions/co-payments. [x] Yes, the Lead Agency waives family contributions/co-payments. If yes, identify and describe which families have their family contributions/co-payments waived. [x] a. Families with an income at or below the Federal poverty level for families of the same size. Describe the policy and provide the policy citation.

Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of state median income (SMI) are required to provide a graduated phase-out of assistance for families whose income has increased above the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains below the federal threshold of 85 percent of the state median income (98.21 (b)(1)). Providing a graduated phase-out promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program as income increases, and supports long- term self-sufficiency for families. Lead Agencies that provide a graduated phase-out must implement a two-tiered eligibility threshold, with the second tier of eligibility (used at the time of eligibility redetermination) to be set at: (i) 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size. (ii) An amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold that: (A) Takes into account the typical household budget of a low-income family. (B) Provides justification that the second eligibility threshold is: (1) Sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low-income workers and that promote and support family economic stability. (2) Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption. At redetermination, a child shall be considered eligible if his or her parents are working or attending a job training or educational program even if their income exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initially qualify for assistance as long as their income does not exceed the second tier of eligibility (98.21(a); 98.21(b)(1)). Note that once deemed eligible, the family shall be considered eligible for a full minimum 12-month eligibility period, even if their income exceeds the second tier of eligibility during the eligibility period, as long as it does not exceed 85 percent of SMI. A family eligible for services via the graduated phase-out of assistance is considered eligible under the same conditions as other eligible families with the exception of the co-payment restrictions, which do not apply to a graduated phase-out. To help families transition from child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co-pay amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under a graduated phase-out and may require additional reporting on changes in family income. However, Lead Agencies must still ensure that any additional reporting requirements do not constitute an undue burden on families. a. Check and describe the option that best identifies the Lead Agency's policies and procedures regarding the graduated phase-out of assistance. [x] N/A. The Lead Agency sets its initial eligibility threshold at 85 percent of SMI and 62 | P a g e therefore, is not required to provide a graduated phase-out period. (If checked, skip to subsection 3.3) [ ] The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at 85 percent of SMI. A. Describe the policies and procedures. B. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure. [ ] The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at an amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold. A. Provide the income level for the second tier of eligibility for a family of three: B. Describe how the second eligibility threshold: 1. Takes into account the typical household budget of a low-income family: 2. Is sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low-income workers and that promote and support family economic stability: 3. Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption: 4. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure related to the second eligibility threshold: b. To help families transition from assistance, does the Lead Agency gradually adjust co-payments for families eligible under the graduated phase-out period? [ ] No [x] Yes i. If yes, describe how the Lead Agency gradually adjusts co-payments for families under a graduated phase-out: If a family's income has increased at 12 month redetermination, the copay is recalculated and adjusted for that income tier. ii. If yes, does the Lead Agency require additional reporting requirements during the graduated phase-out period? (Note: Additional reporting requirements are also discussed in section 3.4.3 of the Plan.) [ ] No [x] Yes. Describe: If the family's income exceeds 85% of the SMI or if the family moves out of state. 3.3 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families Lead Agencies are required to give priority for child care assistance to children with special needs, which can include vulnerable populations, in families with very low incomes, and to children experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B); 98.46(a)). The prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limited to eligibility determination. Other ways to give priority may 63 | P a g e include the establishment of a waiting list or the ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served. Note: CCDF defines \"child experiencing homelessness\" as a child who is homeless, as defined in Section 725 of Subtitle VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a) (98.2). 3.3.1 Increasing access for vulnerable children and families Describe how the Lead Agency defines: a. \"Children with special needs\": A special need is defined as a physical or mental condition, which severely limits the child's ability to care for himself/herself, or an emotional condition that places the child or others at risk. Supervisory/Managerial Child Care staff will determine if a child meets the definition as stated above. Special consideration must be requested to the CCDP DWSS Child Care Chief for those cases where the child's special needs status is questionable. b. \"Families with very low incomes\": \"At-Risk Subsidy benefits provided to households that have income below 130% of the Federal Poverty Level for their household size. Families at the lowest income levels on the State's income sliding fee scale are given priority when funding is limited. Waiting lists are imposed at higher income levels first. 3.3.2 Priority populations Identify how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child care services for the following children and families: Note: If waiving co-payments is checked, Lead Agencies will need to provide further information in question 3.2.4. Paying higher rates for accessing higher quality care is addressed in 4.3.3 and using grants or contracts to reserve spots is addressed in 4.1.6. a.

Prioritize for enrollment, service without placing these populations on waiting lists, extended timeframes for providing verifications, and waive co-payments. 3.3.5 Enrollment and outreach for families experiencing homelessness Lead Agencies are required to expend CCDF funds to (1) permit the enrollment (after an initial eligibility determination) of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained, (2) provide training and technical assistance to child care providers and the appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving children and families experiencing homelessness (addressed in section 6), and (3) conduct specific outreach to families experiencing homelessness(658E(c)(3); 98.51). a. Describe the procedures to permit the enrollment of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained. Households who meet the definition of homeless will be allowed up to 90 days to provide verifications that are not readily available or easily obtainable. b.

The length of such a grace period shall be established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency (658E(c)(2)(I)(i)(I); 98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)). Note: Any payment for such a child during the grace period shall not be considered an error or improper payment (98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)(2)). a. Describe procedures to provide a grace period to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements, including how the length of the grace period was established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency for: i.

Describe: CPS/Foster (including Voluntary and Reunification Plan participants) 3.4 Continuity for Working Families 66 | P a g e 3.4.1 Minimum 12-month eligibility The Lead Agency is required to establish a minimum 12-month eligibility and redetermination period: regardless of changes in income. Lead Agencies may not terminate CCDF assistance during the minimum 12-month period if a family has an increase in income that exceeds the state's income eligibility threshold but not the federal threshold of 85 percent of state median income (SMI). regardless of temporary changes in participation in work, training, or educational activities (658E(c)(2)(N)(i) and (ii)). The Lead Agency may not terminate assistance prior to the end of the minimum 12-month period if a family experiences a temporary job loss or a temporary change in participation in a training or educational activity. Any temporary change cannot have a time limit (e.g. 60 days, 90 days, etc.). A temporary change in eligible activity includes, at a minimum: 1. any time-limited absence from work for an employed parent due to such reasons as the need to care for a family member or an illness 2. any interruption in work for a seasonal worker who is not working 3. any student holiday or break for a parent participating in a training or educational program 4. any reduction in work, training, or education hours, as long as the parent is still working or attending a training or educational program 5. any other cessation of work or attendance at a training or educational program that does not exceed 3 months or a longer period of time established by the Lead Agency 6. a child turning 13 years old during the minimum 12-month eligibility period (except as described in 3.1.1) 7. any changes in residency within the state, territory, or tribal service area a.

PT 01-2015 Length of Certification Effective March 1, 2015 the maximum certification period is increased from 180 days to 365 days. The current exceptions to certify a household for the maximum certification period in MS 165 (NEON, expected age change, school schedule) still apply. The new 365 day certification period for ongoing participants will be applied at recertification. The Child Care and Development Block Grant which was reauthorized in November 2014, places an emphasis on increasing stability for families. The new law states, each child who receives assistance under this subchapter in the State will be considered to meet all eligibility requirements for such assistance and will receive such assistance, for not less than 12 months before the State or designated local entity redetermines the eligibility of the child under this subchapter, regardless of a temporary change in the ongoing status of the child's parent as 67 | P a g e working or attending a job training or educational program or a change in family income for the child's family, if that family income does not exceed 85 percent of the State median income for a family of the same size.

NA 3.4.2 Assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period Continuing assistance for \"job search\" and a Lead Agency's option to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period. Lead Agencies have the option, but are not required, to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program, otherwise known as a parent's eligible activity. If the Lead Agency chooses the option to discontinue assistance due to a parent's non-temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity, it must continue assistance at least at the same level for a period of not fewer than 3 months after each such loss or cessation. This time period allows the parent to engage in a job search and to resume work or resume attendance in a job training or educational program. At the 75 | P a g e end of the minimum 3-month period of continued assistance, if the parent has engaged in a qualifying work, training, or educational program activity with an income below 85 percent of state median income (SMI), assistance cannot be terminated, and the child must continue receiving assistance until the next scheduled redetermination or, at the Lead Agency option, for an additional minimum 12-month eligibility period. a.

If yes, describe the policy or procedure (including any differences in eligibility at initial eligibility determination vs. redetermination of eligibility): b. Does the Lead Agency discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity and offer a minimum 3- month period to allow parents to engage in a job search and to resume participation in an eligible activity? [ ] No, the state/territory does not discontinue assistance during the 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program. [x] Yes, the Lead Agency discontinues assistance during the 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of eligible activity and provides a minimum 3-month period of job search. If yes: i. Provide a summary describing the Lead Agency's policies and procedures for discontinuing assistance due to a parent's non-temporary change: FOR TANF NEON CASES ONLY we --- we discontinue assistance under if 90 days pass from termination from TANF without employment, but not any other purpose of care --- All other cases are allowed the full 12 months. When a household's TANF/NEON case terms for any reason and the POC is not employment, the certification period will be limited to no more than an additional 3 months (90 days) of child care assistance. If the household becomes employed within that 90 day period, their child care assistance will be continued for the remainder of the original 12-month certification period. This policy only applies to TANF/NEON purpose of care. This does not apply to households other than TANF/NEON. ii. Describe what specific actions/changes trigger the job-search period after each such loss or cessation: Termination from NEON results in a 90 job search limitation to certification; however, this only applies to TANF/NEON purpose of care. iii.

Note: Responses should exclude reporting requirements for a graduated phase-out, which were described in question 3.2.5 b. 77 | P a g e Families are required to report a change to the Lead Agency at any time during the 12-month eligibility period if the family's income exceeds 85 percent of the state median income, taking into account irregular fluctuations in income (98.21(e)(1)). If the Lead Agency chooses the option to terminate assistance, as described in section 3.4.2 of the Plan, they may require families to report a non-temporary change in work, training or educational activities (otherwise known as a parent's eligible activity). a. Does the Lead Agency require families to report a non-temporary change in a parent's eligible activity? [ ] No [x] Yes b. Any additional reporting requirements during the minimum 12-month eligibility period must be limited to items that impact a family's eligibility (e.g., income changes over 85 percent of state median income (SMI)) or that impact the Lead Agency's ability to contact the family or pay the child care providers (e.g., a family's change of address, a change in the parent's choice of child care provider).

Lead Agencies are prohibited from acting on information reported by the family that would reduce the family's subsidy unless 78 | P a g e the information reported indicates that the family's income exceeds 85 percent of SMI after considering irregular fluctuations in income or, at the option of the Lead Agency, the family has experienced a non-temporary change in eligible activity. i. Describe any other changes that the Lead Agency allows families to report. Households are advised of their responsibility to report the changes listed below: - Household composition (examples: required household member moves in or out, marital status changes, etc.); - Residence and/or mailing address; - Child care provider; - Schedule changes; - A new or increased source of income. If a change is reported or identified a Request For Information (RFI) is sent to the household to verify the change. If the change would cause a decrease in subsidy or increase in copay, no action is taken. If the change results in a positive action, updates are made to the case. If a household has moved out of state or is above 85% of SMI, the case is reviewed for termination. ii. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure.

Examples include developing strategies to inform families and their providers of an upcoming redetermination and the information that will be required of the family, pre-populating subsidy renewal forms, having parents confirm that the information is accurate, and/or asking only for the information necessary to make an eligibility redetermination. In addition, states and territories can offer a variety of family-friendly methods for submitting documentation for eligibility redetermination that considers the range of needs for families in accessing support (e.g., use of languages other than English, access to transportation, accommodation of parents working non-traditional hours). 79 | P a g e a. Identify, where applicable, the Lead Agency's procedures and policies to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving TANF program funds) do not have their employment, education, or job training unduly disrupted to comply with the state/territory's or designated local entity's requirements for the redetermination of eligibility.

Other: Child Care Manual Section 540. Applications and other required documentation may be submitted in person, by mail, email, or fax. Reapplications for TANF/NEON clients are submitted by DWSS workers directly to child care eligibility workers without requiring additional verification from parents. Eligibility for families participating in wraparound services for Early Head Start and Head Start is only re-determined when the child transitions from Early Head Start to Head Start or when the child ages out of Head Start. 4 Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low-Income Children A core purpose of CCDF is to promote parental choice and to empower working parents to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suit their family's needs. Parents have the option to choose from center-based care, family child care, or care provided in the child's own home. In supporting parental choice, the Lead Agencies must ensure that families receiving CCDF funding have the opportunity to choose from the full range of eligible child care settings and must provide families with equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non-CCDF families. Lead Agencies must employ strategies to increase the supply and to improve the quality of child care services, especially in underserved areas. In addition to generally building the supply of child care for all families, this effort also supports equal access for CCDF eligible children to the priced child care market. This section addresses strategies that the Lead Agency uses to promote parental choice, ensure equal access, and increase the supply of child care. Note: In responding to questions in this section, the Office of Child Care (OCC) recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories and types of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF-defined categories and types of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 4.1 Maximize Parental Choice and Implement Supply Building Mechanisms The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive(s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either receiving a child care certificate or, if available, enrolling their 80 | P a g e child with a provider that has a grant or contract for providing child care services (658E(c)(2)(A); 98.30(a)). Even if a parent chooses to enroll their child with a provider who has a grant or contract, the parent will select the provider, to the extent practicable. If a parent chooses to use a certificate, the Lead Agency shall provide information to the parent on the range of provider options, including care by sectarian providers and relatives. Lead Agencies must require providers chosen by families to meet health and safety standards and has the option to require higher standards of quality. Lead Agencies are reminded that any policies and procedures should not restrict parental access to any type of care or provider (e.g. center care, home care, in-home care, for-profit provider, non-profit provider, or faith-based provider, etc.) (98.15 (a)(5)). 4.1.1 Child care certificate Describe the child care certificate, including when it is issued to parents (before or after the parent has selected a provider) and what information is included on the certificate (98.16 (q)). A provider must be selected prior to the issuance of the certificate. Information included on the certificate includes: the provider name, location, telephone number, and provider id; program information, including applicant name, UPI, dates for which care is authorized (12 months), case manager name and contact information; child information, such as name, DOB, UPI, approved subsidy reimbursement rate per day for full- time and part time, as well as the authorized schedule. 4.1.2 Child care certificate and parent choice Identify how the parent is informed that the child care certificate allows the option to choose from a variety of child care categories, such as private, not-for-profit, faith-based 658Q). Check all that apply. [ ] a. Certificate provides information about the choice of providers [ ] b. Certificate provides information about the quality of providers [ ] c.

Community outreach, workshops, or other in-person activities [ ] i. Other. Describe: 4.1.3 Equal access for families receiving CCDF-funded child care A core principle of CCDF is that families receiving CCDF-funded child care should have equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non-CCDF families (658E(c)(4)(A) and 98.45(a)). a. Describe how parents have access to the full range of providers eligible to receive CCDF: The CCR&R staff ensure the parent is provided with and understands all available options for the type of care they are seeking. Please see: (https://nevadachildcare.org/child-care-subsidy-assistance/) https://nevadachildcare.org/child-care-subsidy-assistance/ 81 | P a g e b. Describe state data on the extent to which eligible child care providers participate in the CCDF system: Currently, the subsidy program is serving 64% of licensed child care providers in Nevada. Out of the 261 providers who responded to the 2022 MRS, 201 (77%) reported that they participate in Nevada's Child Care Subsidy Program. c. Identify any barriers to provider participation, including barriers related to payment rates and practices - including for family child care and in-home providers - based on provider feedback and reports to the Lead Agency: Participants of the 2022 MRS reported many provider barriers to subsidy program participation. Percentages listed below are directly related to the percentage of providers who participated in the MRS. Reimbursement rate is too low: 45% Delay in reimbursement: 37% We do not have enough families that qualify: 31% Too much administrative burden: 25% Program is confusing: 12% Communication from state or state partners is poor: 8% I do not have challenges or experience barriers with the program: 45% Other challenge(s): 26% Providers responses to challenges reported are included in detail in the 2022 MRS Report. Examples of the other challenges relate to behavior problems with the child; lack of payment, missing timesheets; poor communication and lack of parent engagement; and participation in QRIS. 4.1.4 Procedures to ensuring unlimited access Certify by describing the Lead Agency's procedures for ensuring that parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider who receives CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(B); 98.16(t)). This requirement is in the provider service agreement. The Service Agreement (IX.B.3) states, \"As with all enrolled families, providers will allow unlimited access to parents during normal hours of operation and when children are in the care of the provider.\" 4.1.5 Allowing and limiting in-home care The Lead Agency must allow for in-home care (i.e., care provided in the child's own home) but may limit its use (98.16(i)(2)). Will the Lead Agency limit the use of in-home care in any way? [ ] No 82 | P a g e [x] Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the use of in-home care? Check all that apply. [x] a. Restricted based on the minimum number of children in the care of the provider to meet the Fair Labor Standards Act (minimum wage) requirements. Describe: In-home providers must care for at least two children on the subsidy program to meet this requirement. Providers caring for only one child must care for the child in the provider's own home to meet the FLSA. [x] b. Restricted based on the provider meeting a minimum age requirement. Describe: Providers must be 18-years of age to become a family, friend or neighbor provider, regardless of where the care is provided. A government-issued ID is required to verify age. [ ] c. Restricted based on the hours of care (i.e., certain number of hours, non- traditional work hours). Describe: [x] d. Restricted to care by relatives. (A relative provider must be at least 18 years of age based on the definition of eligible child care provider (98.2)). Describe: An exemption is allowed that the provider may live in the home of a child with special needs (Manual Section 601 and 211 (special needs requirements)). [x] e. Restricted to care for children with special needs or a medical condition. Describe: An exemption is allowed that the provider may live in the home of a child with special needs (Manual Section 601 and 211 (special needs requirements)). [x] f. Restricted to in-home providers that meet additional health and safety requirements beyond those required by CCDF. Describe: All Family, Friend, and Neighbor providers must meet the same Health & Safety requirements, regardless of where the care is provided. There are no exemptions for in- home care. All FFN providers are subject to a health and safety inspection of the care setting within 45 days of enrollment and must meet all mandatory pre-service training requirements within 90 days: - Prevention and control of infectious diseases; - Prevention of sudden infant death syndrome and use of safe sleeping practices; - The administration of medication, consistent with standards for parental consent; - The prevention of and response to emergencies due to food and allergic reactions; - Building and physical premise safety; - Prevention of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma; - Emergency preparedness and response planning for emergencies resulting from a natural disaster, or a man-caused event (such as violence at a child care facility); - The handling and storage of hazardous materials and the appropriate disposal of bio- contaminants; - Appropriate precautions in transporting children (for providers that offer transportation); 83 | P a g e - First aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and - Nutrition and physical activity (optional). After the first year, FFN providers are required to take a minimum of 24 hours of early education and child care training annually. [ ] g. Other. Describe: 4.1.6 Child care services available through grants or contracts. a. In addition to offering certificates, does the Lead Agency provide child care services through grants or contracts for child care slots (658A(b)(1))? Note: Do not check \"yes\" if every provider is simply required to sign an agreement to be paid in the certificate program. [ ] No. If no, skip to 4.1.7 [ ] Yes, in some jurisdictions but not statewide. If yes, describe how many jurisdictions use grants or contracts for child care slots. [x] Yes, statewide. If yes, describe: i. How the Lead Agency ensures that parents who enroll with a provider who has a grant or contract have choices when selecting a provider: The CCR&R staff ensure the parent is provided with and understands all available options for the type of care they are seeking. ii. The entities that receive contracts (e.g., shared services alliances, CCR&R agencies, FCC networks, community-based agencies, child care providers) and how grants or contracts are promoted by the Lead Agency: School-age care is provided by non-profit agencies including Boys & Girls Clubs and city/county recreational programs. Wraparound services are provided by Head Start and Early Head Start agencies. iii. How rates for contracted slots are set through grants and contracts and if they are viewed by providers as a vehicle for stabilizing payments. For OST/OSR, the rates were initially set through a funding formula that included geographical area, their average daily program attendance, and the free and reduced lunch rates of the schools in their service delivery area. This was multiplied by the working population and the result was the number of children that could be funded for each agency. Contract amounts were calculated by using the daily reimbursement rate for the geographical area, type of care, and age of child multiplied by the number of children to be served and then multiplied by the number of days in the year care was provided. This amount was dependent upon the total amount available per geographical area, which was determined based on percentage of overall need. Now, funding is based on this historical precedent, and will be reevaluated as funding comes available in the future. For Wraparound, the rates are set based on the 2004 reimbursement rate. 84 | P a g e For Homeless, CPS, and Foster, the rates are set by capacity and available funds. b. Will the Lead Agency use grants or contracts for direct child care services to increase the supply or quality of specific types of care? [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes, does the Lead Agency use grants or contracts to increase the supply and/or quality of child care programs serving the populations below? Check all that apply.

Describe: ARP Provider Stabilization Grant Proposal Grant Administration: All subgrants under this proposal would be administered by The Children's Cabinet at a cost of approximately $486,375 for the three year project period, which includes two full time FTEs to process applications, provide technical support to providers and review monthly reports to ensure program compliance. 89 | P a g e Round One Subgrant Proposal Details: Round one of the provider stabilization grants would be open to all home-based providers to support up to six months of operational costs, based on annual operating budgets reported by the provider. For eligible FFN and/or family child care providers that do not utilize a business operating budget and have only one staff/employee providing services, operational costs may be calculated at a rate of $15 per hour times the average number of hours of care provided, regardless of actual costs and/or payment rates (a formula to easily calculate this rate for the 6 month operating period should be provided in the application). Providers may use the funds for any operational expenses of the program including: payroll, rent/mortgage, supplies, equipment, insurance, fees/permits, food/snacks for children in care, and related expenses as allowed under federal ARP guidance. Providers must use a portion of the funds to meet the following requirements: Staff Compensation Enhancement All providers who have staff (full or part-time) must utilize at least 20% of funds to support staff compensation enhancements. Options for staff compensation enhancements may include one-time bonuses or stipends and/or hourly wage increases that may be either permanent or temporary during the grant funding period. FFN's and home-based providers with no additional staff do not need to meet this requirement. Family Financial Supports All providers (including FFNs and home-based providers) must utilize at least an additional 20% of funds to provide financial relief from enrollment fees, tuition and/or related parent expenses for the care of their children. Home based providers that are unable to meet the 20% requirement due to subsidy payments or other factors may provide an explanation and be waived from this requirement (only if there is no or minimal out of pocket expenses for parents). Outreach and Engagement of Home-based providers An analysis of CARES Act grant to providers shows that approximately 20% of known licensed in-home care providers applied for and/or received a grant. In an effort to support more providers, this proposal includes a recommendation to utilize approximately $600,000 over a two year period to issue outreach, engagement and technical support assistance sub-grants to five community based organizations that work directly with or in the communities with a high rate of home based providers (specifically, Hispanic/Black populations in Urban areas and at least one rural serving organization). The proposal includes five sub grants in the amount of $60,000 per year to conduct outreach and engagement (identifying and conducting outreach to home-based providers, particularly unlicensed or license exempt providers), as well as technical assistance support for these providers to complete applications and with implementation and reporting requirements during the grant period. These community based organizations will also be utilized to help support outreach, education and technical assistance for Round Three grants (see below). Monthly Reporting Providers will be required to submit monthly reports outlining the use of funds, including the number and amount of staff compensation payments, as well as the number of families/children benefitting from the family financial support component. Monthly reports will utilize a simplified format to reduce burden on providers. Round Two Subgrant Proposal Details: 90 | P a g e Round two of the provider stabilization grants would be open to all center based and out of school time providers to support up to six months of operational costs, based on annual operating budgets reported by the provider. Providers may use the funds for any operational expenses of the program including: payroll, rent/mortgage, supplies, equipment, insurance, fees/permits, food/snacks for children in care, and related expenses as allowed under federal ARP guidance. Providers must use a portion of the funds to meet the following requirements: 1. Staff Compensation Enhancement All providers who have staff (full or part-time) must utilize at least 20% of funds to support staff compensation enhancements. Options for staff compensation enhancements may include one-time bonuses or stipends and/or hourly wage increases that may be either permanent or temporary during the grant funding period. 2. Family Financial Supports All providers must utilize at least an additional 20% of funds to provide financial relief from enrollment fees, tuition and/or related parent expenses for the care of their children. Funds may not be used to supplant or replace other funding sources, such as subsidy, but may be used to cover parent co-pays and any other parent out of pocket expenses. Monthly Reporting Providers will be required to submit monthly reports outlining the use of funds, including the number and amount of staff compensation payments, as well as the number of families/children benefitting from the family financial support component. Monthly reports will utilize a simplified format to reduce burden on providers. Round Three Subgrant Proposal Details: Round three of the provider stabilization grants would be open to all providers to support project specific activities related to quality improvements, infrastructure, expanded capacity and/or family supports. Projects may include, but are not limited to: Updating technology and/or data system to streamline enrollment, attendance and/or reporting; Minor facility renovations that will increase capacity, quality and/or ability of the provider to offer services to new populations (including new age groups, children with disabilities, etc.); Professional development and/or training for providers and staff aimed at improving quality and/or the delivery of services, including funds to support temporary/substitute teachers during training or professional development opportunities; Purchase of supplies and/or equipment needed to improve quality rating and/or to replace old, non-functional equipment or supplies; Recruitment, marketing and/or advertising to fill teacher/staff vacancies and/or child care center slots; Staffing, facility and/or equipment expenses necessary to expand program capacity to serve more children and/or a different population of children; Membership or fees associated with joining a networking and/or shared services program to ease administrative burden and streamline business processes; Hiring business consultants or coaches to increase business capacity, including development of organizational budgets, streamlining human resources and related business functions; Other projects as identified by the provider that will improve capacity, quality and/or 91 | P a g e business practices. The total amount of grant awards will depend on the amount of funds available after Rounds One and Two, as well as the total amount of funds requested from qualified providers. Priority will be given to providers serving families in high need areas and that submit proposals which provide a clear and direct benefit to families, including serving children with special needs, offering non- traditional hours and related needs identified in the community. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until all funds are expended, but no later than the ACF deadline for full obligation of funds (9/30/22). Technical Assistance and Support Providers will receive technical assistance and support in the development of proposals (identifying programs and services), as well as with implementation and reporting of project activities. A series of informational webinars will be provided prior to the release of the grant notices outlining the use of the project funds and potential opportunities for providers. Monthly Reporting Providers will be required to submit monthly reports outlining the use of funds, including the impact of projects on the provider, staff and families. Monthly reports will utilize a simplified format to reduce burden on providers.

The NV Registry would make direct payments to these staff upon verification of continued employment in the child care sector. Expansion of 50 additional TEACH scholarship opportunities for non-QRIS providers to futher their growth on the Nevada Career Ladder and promote workforce retention. Includes admin for 75 stipend-based scholarships for NYF (stipends included in NYF budget). CCDP will issue an RFP to hire a consultant to conduct an in-depth cost modeling analysis to determine the fiscal impact of restructuring Nevada's subsidy reimbursesment system to reflect the cost of care versus utilization of the market rate survey, which has been shown to perpetuate inequities in low-income communities where markets cannot support the true cost of high quality care. CCDP will conduct an RFP to identify a marketing/PR firm to conduct an extensive, statewide communications and outreach campaign directed at parents of young children to connect them to resources including, but not limited to the nvchildcare.org website which includes information on financial assistance programs and includes an interactive tool to identify child care providers (with real time capacity detail). The campaign will be utilized to connect parents with resources, as well as to assist providers in connecting with parents, as well as sharing information on best practices and related resources necessary for the care and development of young children. The RFP will also include updates to the current nvchildcare.org website. Community Health Workers who receive an Early Childhood Education Endorsement (through the NV Community Health Worker Association) would provide health education, technical assistance, assessments, mental health resources and referrals for child care providers (organization/curriculum related), teachers, children and families (assessments, mental health 95 | P a g e resources, provider referrals, system navigation, etc.). CHW-ECE's would be trained in early childhood mental health, developmental assessments, nutrition education and resource/referral navigation to support both providers and their families with supporting healthy development of young children. Proposals to be submitted by each ECAC up to the amount available to support local efforts to improve provider quality, improve provider capacity and/or increase access for families. 4.1.9 Prioritizing investments for increasing access to high-quality child care and development services Lead Agencies must prioritize investments for increasing access to high-quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and do not currently have sufficient numbers of such programs (658 E(c)(2)(M); 98.16 (x);98.46(b)). a. How does the Lead Agency define areas with significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment? The Lead Agency identifies the number of families living under the FPL by zip code or county to define high concentrations of poverty. b. Describe how the Lead Agency prioritizes increasing access to high-quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have access to high-quality programs. CCDP is currently targeting these populations through Head Start programs, One Stop Shops, and QRIS implementation. Parents who are participating in the TANF cash program, are homeless and at risk without services receive 100% subsidy (no copay) for 12 months to help the family secure stable employment. Head Start/Early HS services are also covered at 100% subsidy to support these families. 4.2 Assess Market Rates and Analyze the Cost of Child Care Key principles of the CCDF are to: (1) provide equal access to child care for children receiving child care assistance; and (2) ensure parental choice by offering a full range of child care services. Payment rates that are too low to support equal access undermine these principles. To establish subsidy payment rates that ensure equal access, Lead Agencies collect and analyze data through a number of tools. Lead Agencies have the option to conduct a statistically valid and reliable (1) market rate survey (MRS) reflecting variations in the price to parents of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child or (2) an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, such as a cost estimation model (658E(c)(4)(B)). A cost estimation model estimates the cost of care by incorporating both data and assumptions to judge what expected costs would be incurred by child care providers and parents under different scenarios. Another approach would be a cost study that collects cost data at the facility or program level to measure the costs (or inputs used) to deliver child care services (CCDF-ACF- PI-2018-01). Regardless of whether Lead Agencies conduct a market rate survey or an alternative methodology, they are required to analyze the cost of providing child services, known as the narrow cost analysis, that meet basic health, safety, quality and staffing requirements (base level care) (98.45(b)(3), (f)(1)(ii)(A), and (f)(2)(ii)), and higher-quality care at each level of quality, as defined by the Lead Agency (98.45(b)(4), (f)(1)(ii)(B), and (f)(2)(iii)). The analysis must identify the gaps between the cost of care and subsidy levels adopted by the state and then be 96 | P a g e considered as part of the rate setting process. Note: Any Lead Agency considering using an alternative methodology, instead of a market rate survey, is required to submit a description of its proposed approach to its ACF Regional Child Care Program Office for pre-approval in advance of the Plan submittal (see https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/resource/ccdf-acf-pi-2016-08 ) . Advance approval is not required if the Lead Agency plans to implement both a market rate survey and an alternative methodology. In its request for ACF pre-approval, a Lead Agency must: Provide an overview of the Lead Agency's proposed approach (e.g., cost estimation model, cost study/survey, etc.), including a description of data sources. Describe what information the Lead Agency will obtain from an alternative methodology that could not be obtained from the required narrow cost analysis. Describe how the Lead Agency will consult with the State Early Childhood Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, organizations representing child care caregivers, teachers and directors, and other appropriate entities prior to conducting the identified alternative methodology. Describe how the alternative methodology will use methods that are statistically valid and reliable and will yield accurate results. For example, if using a survey, describe how the Lead Agency will ensure a representative sample and promote an adequate response rate. If using a cost estimation model, describe how the Lead Agency will validate the assumptions in the model. If the proposed alternative methodology includes an analysis of costs (e.g., cost estimation model or cost study/survey), describe how the alternative methodology will account for key factors that impact the cost of providing care, such as: staff salaries and benefits, training and professional development, curricula and supplies, group size and ratios, enrollment levels, licensing requirements, quality level, facility size, and other factors. Describe how the alternative methodology will provide complete information that captures the universe of providers in the child care market. Describe how the alternative methodology will reflect variations by provider type, age of children, geographic location, and quality. Describe how the alternative methodology will use current data. What metrics the Lead Agency will use to set rates based on the alternative methodology. Describe the estimated reporting burden and cost to conduct the approach. A Market Rate Survey (MRS) or an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than 2 years before the date of submission of the Plan (658E(c)(4)(B)(i) (98.45 (c)). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lead Agencies may request a waiver for up to one additional year (until July 1, 2022) to complete the required MRS or an ACF pre- approved alternative methodology. Lead Agencies may also request the required Narrow Cost Analysis be waived for one year (until July 1, 2022). These waiver requests must include a justification linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. 4.2.1 Completion of the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology.

Identify the date of the Lead Agencies' most recent and complete Market Rate Survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology that will provide data to inform responses to questions 4.2.2-4.5.2. ? 4.2.2 Consultation prior to developing MRS or pre-approved alternative methodology Prior to developing and conducting the MRS, or conducting the ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency is required to consult with (1) the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities, and (2) organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.45 (e)). Local child care program administrators may also be good informants to Lead Agencies on narrow cost analyses. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the: a. State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body: A survey was sent asking stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the 2022 MRS. The stakeholder group consisted of 48 stakeholders which included the Nevada Early Childhood Advisory Council (ECAC). The stakeholder survey was conducted via Survey Monkey and aggregate results with open-ended comments were included in the final 2022 MRS report. b. Local child care program administrators: 98 | P a g e A survey was sent asking stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the 2022 MRS. The stakeholder group consisted of 48 stakeholders which included child care program administrators from center, family child care, group family child care and out-of-school time programming. The stakeholder survey was conducted via Survey Monkey and aggregate results with open-ended comments were included in the final 2022 MRS report. c. Local child care resource and referral agencies: A survey was sent asking stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the 2022 MRS. The stakeholder group consisted of 48 stakeholders which included Child Care Resource & Referral (CCR&R) agencies. The stakeholder survey was conducted via Survey Monkey and aggregate results with open-ended comments were included in the final 2022 MRS report. d. Organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors: A survey was sent asking stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the 2022 MRS. The stakeholder group consisted of 48 stakeholders which included the following: Nevada Institute for Children's Research and Policy, Washoe County Licensing, Quality Rating Improvement System, Nevada Pyramid Model, Nevada Association of Education for Young Children, State Child Care Licensing, Washoe County Licensing, Nevada Department of Education, NV Registry, and Children's Advocacy Alliance. The stakeholder survey was conducted via Survey Monkey and aggregate results with open-ended comments were included in the final 2022 MRS report. e. Other. Describe: A survey was sent asking stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the 2022 MRS. The stakeholder group consisted of 48 stakeholders which included all Early Childhood Education (ECE) stakeholders in Nevada. The stakeholder survey was conducted via Survey Monkey and aggregate results with open-ended comments were included in the final 2022 MRS report. 4.2.3 Benchmarks for MRS or pre-approved alternative methodology ACF has established a set of benchmarks, largely based on research, to identify the components of a valid and reliable market rate survey (81 FR, p. 67509). To be considered valid and reliable a Market Rate Survey or preapproved alternative methodology meets the following: o represents the child care market o provides complete and current data o uses rigorous data collection procedures o reflects geographic variations o analyzes data in a manner that captures other relevant differences An MRS can use administrative data, such as child care resource and referral data, if it is representative of the market. a. Describe how each of the benchmarks are met in either the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. i. Represent the child care market: For the 2022 MRS, all licensed and Out-of-School Time (OST) child care providers were contacted 99 | P a g e to participate in the survey: 74.91% of providers responded ii. Provide complete and current data: On March 29, 2022, an email was sent to all licensed and out-of-school time (OST) providers in Nevada notifying them that a link to the MRS survey will be sent the following week. The notification was in both English and Spanish. The notification included the importance of the survey, the estimated length of time it will take to complete the survey, items to prepare, and the survey incentive. All providers in Nevada were sent the notification regardless of participation on the Child Care Subsidy program. On April 6, 2022, the Survey Monkey link to the MRS was sent to all licensed and OST providers in Nevada. The entire provider universe and response rate is reported in the next section. The bi- lingual survey announcement was sent via the Department of Public and Behavioral Health Child Care Licensing ListServ, the Washoe County Human Service Agency Child Care Licensing ListServ, the Nevada Department of Education Office of Early Learning and Development ListServ, The Children's Cabinet CCR&R database director/owner contacts and posted on The Nevada Registry. The survey was also available in both English and Spanish. The week of April 13, Quality Rating Improvement System (QRIS) coaches encouraged their sites to participate in the survey and used QR codes to direct providers to the survey location. The week of April 20, 2022, an email was sent to all providers who had initiated the survey in Survey Monkey but did not complete the survey. The week of May 5, 2022, resource and referral staff started making phone calls to achieve a 65% response rate by county and provider type. Staff used a separate survey monkey link to record provide responses received via the phone. Many providers reported to resource and referral staff that they did not have time to complete the entire survey. In these instances, staff requested that the provider email their current rate form and staff entered provider rates directly into the CCR&R database. The week of June 13, 2022, administrative rate data were pulled, and all rates reported between January 1, 2022, and April 1, 2022, were used in the market rate analysis. On June 16, 2022, a 65% response rate was achieved by county and by provider type and data cleansing and rate conversion commenced. Final provider response rate (including administrative data pulled from January 1, 2022, through April 1, 2022) was 74.91% iii. Use rigorous data collection procedures: On March 29, 2022, an email was sent to all licensed and out-of-school time (OST) providers in Nevada notifying them that a link to the MRS survey will be sent the following week. The notification was in both English and Spanish. The notification included the importance of the survey, the estimated length of time it will take to complete the survey, items to prepare, and the survey incentive. All providers in Nevada were sent the notification regardless of participation on the Child Care Subsidy program. On April 6, 2022, the Survey Monkey link to the MRS was sent to all licensed and OST providers in Nevada. The entire provider universe and response rate is reported in the next section. The bi-100 | P a g e lingual survey announcement was sent via the Department of Public and Behavioral Health Child Care Licensing ListServ, the Washoe County Human Service Agency Child Care Licensing ListServ, the Nevada Department of Education Office of Early Learning and Development ListServ, The Children's Cabinet CCR&R database director/owner contacts and posted on The Nevada Registry.

On June 16, 2022, a 65% response rate was achieved by county and by provider type and data cleansing and rate conversion commenced. Final provider response rate (including administrative data pulled from January 1, 2022, through April 1, 2022) was 74.91% iv. Reflect geographic variations: Rate results are aggregated by geographical area: Washoe County (Urban), Carson/Douglas County (Capital Area), Clark (Urban), Rural (the balance of all other counties in Nevada). v. Analyze data in a manner that captures other relevant differences: Rates are analyzed separately within each geographical area for centers, family child care, and group family child care. Rates are analyzed separately within each geographical area and provider type for infants (0-11 months), toddlers (1 year through 2 years), PreK (3 years through 5 years), and School-Age (6 years through 12 years) 122 providers participating in the Nevada Quality Rating Improvement System (QRIS) responded to the 2022 MRS. This allows the Lead Agency the ability to compare QRIS and non QRIS rates for all population and provider types listed above. b. Given the impact of COVID-19 on the child care market, do you think that the data you gathered (as indicated in 4.2.1) on the prices or costs of child care adequately reflect the child care market as you submit this plan? [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes, why do you think the data represents the child care market? The survey was conducted in 2022 and reflects the current child care market prices. 101 | P a g e 4.2.4 Variations in the price or cost of services Describe how the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology reflects variations in the price or cost of child care services by: a. Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets). Describe: Rate results are aggregated by geographical area: Washoe County (Urban), Carson/Douglas County (Capital Area), Clark (Urban), Rural (14 remaining Counties in Nevada). b. Type of provider. Describe: Rates are analyzed separately within each geographical area for centers, family child care, and group family child care. c. Age of child. Describe: Rates are analyzed separately within each geographical area and provider type for infants (0-11 months), toddlers (1 year through 2 years), PreK (3 years through 5 years), and School-Age (6 years through 12 years). d. Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, such as quality level. The Nevada MRS also enables the Lead Agency to obtain analytics of the QRIS star level rating for our participating providers. 4.2.5 Narrow cost analysis completion Has the Narrow Cost Analysis been completed for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan? [ ] No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. If no, describe the status of the Lead Agency's upcoming narrow cost analysis. [x] Yes, the narrow cost analysis information is included in the report as described in 4.2.6. If yes, describe how the State/Territory analyzed the cost of child care through a narrow cost analysis for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan, including: a. The methodology the Lead Agency used to conduct, obtain, and analyze data on the estimated cost of care (narrow cost analysis), including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child (98.45 (f)(ii)). The Center for American Progress has created costofchildcare.org, which is an interactive calculator to illustrate the true cost of care by state. Rates were compared between the following: Nevada's 4.1.2022 75th percentile rate Cost of Quality Calculator's base cost of care meeting licensing standards Higher quality care to include teacher pay parity (wages increased to mirror kindergarten teachers), health insurance, and increased quality ratios allowing for lower numbers of children per teacher (quality ratios assessed for centers only). b. How the methodology addresses the cost of child care providers' implementation of health, safety, quality and staffing requirements (i.e. applicable licensing and regulatory 102 | P a g e requirements, health and safety standards, training and professional development standards, and appropriate child to staff ratio, groups size limits, and caregiver qualification requirements (98.45 (f)(ii)(A)). All costs and requirements are built into the cost of care calculator at the base level. c. How the methodology addresses the cost of higher-quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality (98.45 (f)(ii)(B)). Nevada would use this methodology to provide a base-rate for child care providers at the first tier of the reimbursement for QRIS participating providers and adjustments would be necessary to arrive at the incentivized cost to align with the 5 star rated system. d. The gap between costs incurred by child care providers and the Lead Agency's payment rates based on findings from the narrow cost analysis. Center Infants: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $190.38/week less than the cost of care Family Infants: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $89.61/week less than the cost of care Center Toddlers: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $107.41/week less than the cost of care Family Child Care Toddlers: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $89.61 less than the cost of care Center PreK: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $46.76 less than the cost of care Family Child Care PreK: 2018 95th percentile in Clark County is $82.11 less than the cost of care 4.2.6 Detailed report of the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology results After conducting the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology. The detailed report must also include the Narrow Cost Analysis, as described in 4.2.5, which estimates the cost of care (including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child) necessary to support (1) child care providers' implementation of the health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements, and(2) higher quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality. For states without a QRIS or for a state with a QRIS system that is currently limited to only certain providers, those states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, school-age quality standards, or state defined quality measures.) The Lead Agency must make the report with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the report, including posting the results on the Lead Agency website. The Lead Agency must describe in the detailed report how the Lead Agency took into consideration the views and comments of the public or stakeholders. Describe how the Lead Agency made the results of the market rate survey or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology report widely available to the public (98.45(f)(1)) by responding to the 103 | P a g e questions below. a. Date the report containing results was made widely available\u2014no later than 30 days after the completion of the report. July 29, 2022 b. Describe how the Lead Agency made the detailed report containing results widely available and provide the link where the report is posted. The results of the MRS were published to the DWSS Child Care website on: (https://dwss.nv.gov/Care/Child_Care_-_Documents_and_Links/) https://dwss.nv.gov/Care/Child_Care_-_Documents_and_Links/ Additionally, the results of the MRS are published in the following locations: (https://nevadachildcare.org/provider-resources/) https://nevadachildcare.org/provider- resources/ c. Describe how the Lead Agency considered stakeholder views and comments in the detailed report. All feedback received from stakeholders on survey design and administration is provided in Appendix A. DWSS and The Children's Cabinet reviewed the stakeholder feedback and incorporated all suggested modifications. Changes made to the survey are highlighted in yellow in Appendix B. 4.3 Establish Adequate Payment Rates The Lead Agency must set CCDF subsidy payment rates, in accordance with the results of the current MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, as identified in 4.2.1, at a level to ensure equal access for eligible families to child care services that are comparable with those provided to families not receiving CCDF assistance. Lead Agencies must also consider the costs of base and higher quality care at each level as part of its rate setting. The Lead Agency must re- evaluate its payment rates at least every 3 years. 4.3.1 Base payment rates and percentiles Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the most recent MRS as identified in 4.2.1) for the following categories below. Lead Agencies are required to provide a summary of data and facts in their Plan to demonstrate how its payment rates ensure equal access. The preamble to the final rule (81 FR, p. 67512), indicates that a benchmark for adequate payment rates is the 75th percentile of the most recent MRS. The 75th percentile is the number separating the lowest 75 percent of rates from the highest 25 percent. Setting rates at the 75th percentile, while not a requirement, would ensure that eligible children have access to three out of four child care slots. The 75th percentile benchmark applies to the base rates. Base rates are the lowest, foundational rates before any differentials are added (e.g., for higher quality or other purposes). Further, base rates must be sufficient to ensure that minimum health and safety and staffing requirements are covered. Percentiles are not required if the Lead Agency conducted an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, but must be reported if the Lead Agency conducted a MRS. For states that conduct an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, report the base payment rates based on a full-time weekly rate. 104 | P a g e The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of the categories on which rates can be based and are not intended to be comprehensive of all categories that might exist or to reflect the terms used by the Lead Agency for particular ages. If rates are not statewide, please use the most populous geographic region (defined as the area serving highest number of CCDF children) to report base payment rates below. a. Fill in the table below based on either the statewide rates or the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF). To facilitate compiling state by state payment rates, provide the full-time weekly base payment rates in the table below. If weekly payment rates are not published, then the Lead Agency will need to calculate its equivalent. Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting. (All rates are full- time) Base payment rate (including unit) Full-time weekly base payment rate If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate? i. Infant (6 months) Center care 62.50 312.5 73rd percentile NA ii. Toddler (18 months) Center care 57 285 74th percentile NA iii. Preschooler (4 years) Center care 36 180 55th percentile NA iv.

If the Lead Agency does not publish weekly rates then how were these rates calculated (e.g., were daily rates multiplied by 5 or monthly rates divided by 4.3)? Daily rates were multiplied time 5. c. Describe how the Lead Agency defines and calculates part-time and full-time care. For Infant, toddler, and preschool children: part-time care is considered 15 minutes to 4 hours 29 minutes full-time care is considered equal to and greater than 4 hours 30 minutes. For School-Age children: part-time care is considered 15 minutes to 2 hours and 59 minutes full-time care is considered equal to and greater than 3 hours. d. Provide the date these current payment rates became effective (i.e., date of last update based on most recent MRS as reported in 4.2.1). 05/01/2022 e. If applicable, identify the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF) used to complete the responses above. Clark County f. Provide the citation, or link, if available, to the payment rates https://dwss.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dwssnvgov/content/Care/Child%20Care%20Manual%20 Mar%202018.pdf (Page 116) g. If the payment rates are not set by the Lead Agency for the entire state/territory, describe how many jurisdictions set their own payment rates (98.16(i)(3)). 106 | P a g e Jurisdictions in Nevada do not set their own payment rates. The State Agency sets the payment rates, statewide. 4.3.2 Differentiating payment rates Describe how and on what factors the Lead Agency differentiates payment rates. Check all that apply. [x] a. Geographic area. Describe: By county [x] b. Type of provider. Describe: Licensed center, licensed family care center, licensed group center, license exempt family, friend, & neighbor care, and school age programs. [x] c. Age of child. Describe: Infant, Toddler, Pre-K, School-Age [x] d. Quality level. Describe: Star Ratings (1-5) [ ] e. Other. Describe: 4.3.3 Tiered rates, differential rates, or add-ons Lead Agencies can choose to establish tiered rates, differential rates, or add-ons on top of their base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., a higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers to serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Lead Agencies may pay providers more than their private pay rates as an incentive or to cover costs for higher quality care (81 FR, p. 67514). Has the Lead Agency chosen to implement tiered reimbursement or differential rates? [x] No [ ] Yes, If yes, identify below any tiered or differential rates, and at a minimum, indicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates, including if the rates were based on the MRS or an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. Check and describe all that apply. [ ] a. Tiered or differential rates are not implemented. [ ] b. Differential rate for non-traditional hours. Describe: [ ] c. Differential rate for children with special needs, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: [ ] d. Differential rate for infants and toddlers. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no separate bonus or add-on. Describe: [ ] e. Differential rate for school-age programs. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for school-age children with no separate bonus or add- on. Describe: 107 | P a g e [ ] f. Differential rate for higher quality, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: [ ] g. Other differential rates or tiered rates. Describe: 4.3.4 Establishment of adequate payment rates. a. Describe how base payment rates are adequate and enable providers to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF, and how they were established based on the most recent MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology and the Narrow Cost Analysis, as reported in 4.2.1 and 4.2.5.. In determining compliance with the Act for the equal access provisions in the FY2019-2021 CCDF Plan, the OCC reviewed all the states with payment rates below the 75th percentile benchmark. Of those states, the half with the lowest payment rates were considered non-compliant and placed on a corrective action plan (CAP). These states all had rates below the 25th percentile for either some or all categories of care. The 25th percentile is not to be viewed as a benchmark or a long-term solution to gauge equal access. It is also not to be viewed as sufficient for compliance in future plan cycles. OCC expects to continue to take action against states with the lowest rates in future plan cycles in an effort to keep payment rates moving upward toward ensuring equal access. Note: Per the preamble (81 FR p. 67512), in instances where an MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology indicates that prices or costs have increased, Lead Agencies must raise their rates as a result. The base payment rates support the health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF and are aligned with the most recent MRS conducted in 2022. b. Describe the process used for setting rates, including how the Lead Agency factors in the cost of care, including any increased costs and provider fees because of COVID-19, and how such costs may be modified after the pandemic subsides. Nevada's subsidy rates are currently set at the 95th percentile rate of the 2018 MRS, which is higher than the 75th percentile of the 2022 MRS in many regions and age groups. Implementing the 75th percentile base rate of the 2022 MRS would decrease the reimbursement rate for several provider types and age groups in our rural regions. While the MRS reflects the current market price, it does not consider cost of care. Nevada is currently in the RFP process for selecting a consultant to conduct an in-depth cost modeling analysis to determine the true cost of high-quality care in Nevada. The results of the cost modeling analysis, in conjunction with the 2022 MRS, will be part of the methodology for a new rate structure which will be submitted for approval prior to the next CCDF state plan submission. 4.3.5 Cost of higher quality Describe how the Lead Agency took the cost of higher quality, as determined in 4.2.5, into account, including how payment rates for higher-quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a QRIS or other system of quality indicators, relate to the estimated cost of care at each level of quality. Note: For states without a QRIS, the states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, or state-defined quality measures). In Nevada, our reimbursement rates are tied to the QRIS star levels. As providers improve quality, their reimbursement rate increases. 4.3.6 Additional facts in determining payments rates Identify and describe any additional facts that the Lead Agency considered in determining its 108 | P a g e payment rates ensure equal access. If applicable, provide a description of how any additional health and safety costs, because of the COVID-19 pandemic are included in rate setting. Payment rates were not changed based on COVID-19; however, the state did provide emergency grants and stipends to help providers to pay for these costs and to preserve child care supply in Nevada. 4.4 Implement Generally Accepted Payment Practices and Ensure Timeliness of Payments Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate that they have established payment practices applicable to all CCDF child care providers that include ensuring the timeliness of payments by either (1) paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services or (2) paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. To the extent practicable, the Lead Agency must also support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by (1) paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance, (2) providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time, (3) providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month, or (4) using an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan (658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(2)). Lead Agencies are required to use CCDF payment practices that reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF-funded assistance. Unless a Lead Agency is able to demonstrate that the following policies are not generally accepted in its particular state, territory, or service area or among particular categories or types of providers, Lead Agencies must (1) pay providers based on established part-time or full-time rates rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time and (2) pay for reasonable, mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private- paying parents (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). Responses may also identify any additional health and safety fees providers are charging as a result of COVID-19. In addition, there are certain other generally accepted payment practices that are required. Lead Agencies are required to ensure that child care providers receive payment for any services in accordance with a payment agreement or an authorization for services, ensure that child care providers receive prompt notice of changes to a family's eligibility status that could impact payment, and establish timely appeal and resolution processes for any payment inaccuracies and disputes (98.45(l)(4) through (6); 658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(4); 98.45(l)(5); 98.45(l)(6)). 4.4.1 Payment practices Certify by identifying and describing the payment practices below that the Lead Agency has implemented for all CCDF child care providers. a. Ensure the timeliness of payments by either (Lead Agency to implement at least one of the following): [ ] i. Paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services. Describe the policy or procedure. NA [x] ii. Paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. Describe the policy or procedure. The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League pay within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of complete invoice for services. b. To the extent practicable, support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by: Note: The Lead Agency is 109 | P a g e to choose at least one of the following: [x] i. Paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance. Describe the policy or procedure. Child care payments are made based on enrollment rather than attendance based on a client's schedule. In very limited circumstances, payments are made based on attendance; for example, if a child attends more than one child care. [ ] ii. Providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time. Describe the policy or procedure. NA [x] iii. Providing full payment if a child is absent for five or fewer days in a month. Describe the policy or procedure. Payments are generally made based on a parent's approved schedule. The exceptions are varying schedules and before and after school programs. When a family works a varied schedule, policy allows 21 absence days per year to ensure payments to providers and stability for families. Before and after school programs frequently cannot take payments for days the child was not in attendance, so policy reflects this practice. [ ] iv. Use an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan. If chosen, please describe the policy or procedure and the Lead Agency's justification for this approach. NA c. The Lead Agency's payment practices reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF subsidies. These payment practices must include the following two practices unless the Lead Agency provides evidence that such practices are not generally accepted in its state (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). i. Paying on a part-time or full-time basis (rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time). Describe the policy or procedure and include a definition of the time increments (e.g., part time, full-time). Rates are paid on a full-time or part-time basis. Because school-age children have schedules that include public school hours, the hours that constitute full-time and part- time are different: - Infant, Toddler, and Preschool Children: Part-time = 15 minutes to 4 hours and 29 minutes; Full-time = 4 hours, 30 minutes and greater - School Age Children: Part-time = 15 minutes to 2 hours and 59 minutes; Full-time = 3 hours or more. Although we pay on a part-time/full-time basis, Nevada reimburses providers monthly for care provided the previous month. The generally accepted payment practice of the field is to pay on a weekly basis. ii. Paying for reasonable mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private- paying parents. Describe the policy or procedure. The CCDP pays up to $40 for annual fees and then the provider determines and 110 | P a g e charges any additional fees to the family. d. The Lead Agency ensures that providers are paid in accordance with a written payment agreement or an authorization for services that includes, at a minimum, information regarding provider payment policies, including rates, schedules, any fees charged to providers, including fees related to COVID 19, and the dispute-resolution process. Describe: The following is included on the Provider Service Agreement: Certificates Once you accept/receive a Child Care Certificate, CCDP participants are not required to pay the full cost of tuition up-front and in full prior to attendance. The approved reimbursement rate is documented on the Child Care Certificate for each eligible child. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Child Care Certificate received is current, covers the schedule utilized by the client, and is valid for the site where services are being provided. CCDP participants are required to obtain a new Child Care Certificate when circumstances change and when they transfer providers, even within the same child care chain. Reimbursement for child care services is based on either actual attendance or approved schedule as specified on the Child Care Certificate. CCDP is not responsible for payment of days and hours not covered on the Child Care Certificate; this is the responsibility of the parent. Payments Reimbursements will be issued within 30 business days after timely timesheet submittal in accordance with Section I.E. Child Care Attendance and Provider Timesheet submitted after the last day of the month following the service period (e.g., timesheets submitted August 1 or later for the month of June) are subject to non-payment. Payment issues and discrepancies are your responsibility and must be resolved within 60 days of receiving payment for services. Submittals outside this timeline are subject to non-payment. CCDP will not deduct taxes, insurance, or other coverage for providers from their CCDP reimbursements (also see Employment in section IX.C). CCDP participants are responsible for maintaining current co-payments with providers. All providers are responsible for keeping records of copayments and overages received from the client and providing the client a receipt for payment. Reimbursable Fees All or part of the cost of child care, not to exceed the current DWSS maximum rates, for the days, times and time period authorized by the CCDP per the Child Care Certificate. All or part of the Enrollment/Registration fee not to exceed the DWSS maximum amount. Clients with actual attendance billing are allowed 21 discretionary days to use for holidays, sick, or vacation. CCDP contractors have 10 days to update cases due to any changes to the family's eligibility and issue a new certificate to the child care provider or notify the provider that the case is terminated. e. The Lead Agency provides prompt notice to providers regarding any changes to the family's eligibility status that could impact payments, and such a notice is sent no later than the day that the Lead Agency becomes aware that such a change will occur. Describe: When a change is made to a client's eligibility case, the NOA/Appeal is generated from the system and emailed/mailed to the client the same day the change is made. The NOA/Appeal will state all changes made to the eligibility case. f. The Lead Agency has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: Providers have 60 calendar days from the issuance of payment to request an adjustment if they disagree with the amount of their payment. All payment adjustment requests must be resolved and responded to in writing by the Child Care office within 30 calendar days of the 111 | P a g e request. Child Care contactors must resolve all provider underpayments in the next available reimbursement period from the date the underpayment is validated. If an underpayment is discovered through a Management Evaluation (ME) or Quality Control (QC) review, the underpayment must be validated by the contracting agency. If the underpayment was due to a mistake of the contracting agency, the supplemental payment must be issued with the next available reimbursement period after validations. If an overpayment is found by a contractor or through a ME or QC review, the overpayment must be validated by the contractor within 60 calendar days from the date the overpayment is discovered. Child Care contractors are primarily responsible for the collection of all provider overpayments. Recovery is accomplished through retention of future provider payments until the debt is retired in whole. If the provider suggests that repayment of the debt will cause a hardship they may seek special consideration from the DWSS Child Care Chief. To dos so, the provider must submit a written request to the DWSS Child Care Chief fully disclosing the circumstances which warrant special consideration. If the provider's contract is terminated prior to full repayment of the overpayment, the Child Care contractor must refer the debt to the appropriate DWSS Investigations & Recovery (I&R) office for continuation of the recovery action. If the provider initiates a new contract with Child Care contractor prior to full recovery of the debt by DWSS I&R the Child Care office must suspend approval of the contract until the remaining overpayment balance is paid. The provider retains the right to seek hardship consideration using the process. If a hardship is granted, the Child Care contractor must submit a written request to DWSS I&R seeking to reclaim the debt and assume responsibility for collection of the outstanding balance through reimbursement reduction. g. Other. Describe: NA 4.4.2 Payment practices across regions counties, and/or geographic areas Do payment practices vary across regions, counties, and/or geographic areas? [x] No, the practices do not vary across areas. [ ] Yes, the practices vary across areas. Describe: NA 4.4.3 Payment practices supporting equal access Describe how Lead Agencies' payment practices described in subsection 4.4 support equal access to a full range of providers. Payments based on the most current MRS help bridge the gap between what the provider charges and what the State reimburses. This reduces any \"overpayment\" or out of pocket expense to families because the state is covering at a rate that is aligned with the price of care for a full range of providers and allowing equal access for families. 4.5 Establish Affordable Co-Payments Family co-payments are addressed in Section 3 related to minimum 12-month eligibility and the graduated phase-out provision and also in this subsection, because they are an important element for determining equal access. If a Lead Agency allows providers to charge amounts more than the required family co-payments, the Lead Agency must provide a rationale for this practice, including how charging such additional amounts will not negatively impact a family's ability to receive care they might otherwise receive, taking into consideration a family's co- 112 | P a g e payment and the provider's payment rate. 4.5.1 Affordable family contribution/co-payment How will the Lead Agency ensure that the family contribution/co-payment, based on a sliding- fee scale, is affordable and is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF services (98.16 (k))? Check all that apply. [ ] a. Limit the maximum co-payment per family. Describe: [ ] b. Limit the combined amount of co-payment for all children to a percentage of family income. List the percentage of the co-payment limit and describe. [x] c. Minimize the abrupt termination of assistance before a family can afford the full cost of care (\"the cliff effect\") as part of the graduated phase-out of assistance discussed in 3.2.5. Describe: At initial eligibility, families are required to be under 130% of the FPL. If at the 12- month eligibility redetermination, the income limit increases to 85% of SMI, and eligibility will continue for an additional 365 days at the new subsidy percentage, based on their new income. [ ] d. Other. Describe: 4.5.2 Option to allows providers to charge additional amounts Does the Lead Agency choose the option to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co-payment in instances where the provider's price exceeds the subsidy payment (98.45(b)(5))? [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes: i. Provide the rationale for the Lead Agency's policy to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co-payment, including a demonstration of how the policy promotes affordability and access for families. Due to limited child care capacity in the state of Nevada, if we were to stop allowing this practice, we would not have enough providers to serve subsidized children. In Nevada, we understand that the price for care is up to the provider, as this is their privately owned business. CCDP does not have the ongoing funding to pay all gaps across the board, regardless of what a providers sets their price at; instead we align with the current MRS to reduce the gap. Additionally, the program will be procuring a contractor to analyze the true cost of care in Nevada in additon to analyzing our current policies vs. the federal guidelines in terms of income limit and purposes of care. With Nevada's base CCDF award (not including COVID-related funds), Nevada can serve between 6 and 7 thousand children. In order to pay rates at cost of care, to open eligibility for more purposes of care, and to take advantage of the higher income limit at intake, Nevada will need to reduce the number of children we are serving. ii. Provide data (including data on the size and frequency of such amounts) on the extent to which CCDF providers charge additional amounts to families. In addition to charge rates, providers also charge a variety of fees including initial registration, 113 | P a g e annual fee, materials & supplies, meals, field trips, and late payment. Not all providers completed the fee portion of the survey and the results do not represent all survey respondents. Registration Annual Materials & Supplies Meals Field Trips Late Payment # Reporting Charging Fee 87 52 18 6 17 62 Maximum Charged $470.00 $250.00 $500.00 $10.00 $150.00 $ 25.00 $ $ 10.00 $ Average $126.17 $138.33 $ 8.33 $ 58.33 $ 27.84 Frequency One-time upon Once per Annually - 12 Daily - 3 Per occurance - 11 Each Occurance - 53 enrollment - 87 year - 52 Biannually - 2 Monthly - 2 Once/Summer - 2 Weekly - 6 Varies - 1 Per Meal-1 Weekly Summer-1 Monthly - 3 Once at Enrollment-3 Annuall - 2 Depends on fundraising - 1 iii. Describe the Lead Agency's analysis of the interaction between the additional amounts charged to families with the required family co-payment and the ability of current subsidy payment rates to provide access to care without additional fees. Based on data collected in the 2022 MRS, 82% of providers in Nevada charge parents for the difference between the state's maximum reimbursement rate and the provider's price for care. Nevada is exploring moving toward a cost of care rate methodology. As reimbursement rates for subsidy providers is increased, the number of families accessing care without additional fees should decrease. Nevada's QRIS tiered reimbursement system is also another way providers can receive increased payment amounts based on quality and lower the hidden copay amount for families. 114 | P a g e 5 Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings Lead Agencies are required to certify that there are in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services in the state/territory, which supports the health and safety of all children in child care. States and territories may allow licensing exemptions. Lead Agencies must describe how such licensing exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and development of CCDF children in license-exempt care (98.16 (u)). Lead Agencies also must certify that there are in effect health and safety standards and training requirements applicable to providers serving CCDF children whether they are licensed or license- exempt. These health and safety requirements must be appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served, must include specific topics and training on those topics, and are subject to monitoring and enforcement procedures. The organization of this section begins with a description of the licensing system for all child care providers in a state or territory and then moves to focus specifically on CCDF providers who may be licensed, or those exempt from licensing. The next section addresses child-staff ratios, group size limits, and required qualifications for caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.16(m)) serving CCDF children. The section then covers the health and safety requirements; standards, training, and monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that CCDF child care providers comply with licensing and health and safety requirements (98.16(n)). Finally, Lead Agencies are asked to describe any exemptions for relative providers (98.16(l)). In some cases, CCDF health and safety requirements may be integrated within the licensing system for licensed providers and may be separate for CCDF providers who are license-exempt. In either case, Lead Agencies are expected to identify and describe health and safety requirements for all providers receiving CCDF. Note: When responding to questions in this section, the OCC recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF-defined categories of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Criminal background check requirements are included in this section (98.16(o)). It is important to note that these requirements apply to all child care staff members who are licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law and all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances.

Staff should notify parents/guardians of children who have symptoms that require exclusion, and parents/guardians should remove children from the early care and education setting as soon as possible. For children whose symptoms do not require exclusion, verbal or written notification to the parent/guardian at the end of the day is acceptable. Most conditions that require exclusion do not require a primary health care provider visit before re-entering care. When a child becomes ill but does not require immediate medical help, a determination should be made regarding whether the child should be sent home. The caregiver/teacher should determine if the illness: a) Prevents the child from participating comfortably in activities; b) Results in a need for care that is greater than the staff can provide without compromising the health and safety of other children; c) Poses a risk of spread of harmful diseases to others; d) Causes a fever and behavior change or other signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea). An unexplained temperature above 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C) (armpit) in a child younger than 6 months should be medically evaluated. Any infant younger than 2 months of age with fever should get immediate medical attention. If any of the above criteria are met, the child should be removed from direct contact with other children and monitored and supervised by a staff member known to the child until dismissed to the care of a parent/guardian, primary health care provider, or other person designated by the parent. The local or state health department will be able to provide specific guidelines for exclusion. 3.6.1.4 Infectious Disease Outbreak Control (pg. 15) During the course of an identified outbreak of any reportable illness at the program, a child or staff member should be excluded if the local health department official or primary health care provider suspects that the child or staff member is contributing to transmission of the illness, is not adequately immunized when there is an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease, or the circulating pathogen poses an increased risk to the individual. The child or staff member should be readmitted when the health department official or primary health care provider who made the initial determination decides that the risk of transmission is no longer present. Parents/guardians should be notified of any determination. 7.2.0.1 Immunization Documentation (pg. 23) 148 | P a g e Programs should require that all parents/guardians of enrolled children provide written documentation of receipt of immunizations appropriate for each child's age. Infants, children, and adolescents should be immunized as specified in the Recommended Immunization Schedules for Persons Aged 0 Through 18 Years, developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Children whose immunizations are not up-to-date or have not been administered according to the recommended schedule should receive the required immunizations, unless contraindicated or for legal exemptions. 7.2.0.2 Unimmunized Children (pg. 24) If immunizations have not been or are not to be administered because of a medical condition, a statement from the child's primary health care provider documenting the reason why the child is temporarily or permanently medically exempt from the immunization requirements should be on file. If immunizations are not to be administered because of the parents'/guardians' religious or philosophical beliefs, a legal exemption with notarization, waiver, or other state-specific required documentation signed by the parent/guardian should be on file. Parents/guardians of an enrolling or enrolled infant who has not been immunized due to the child's age should be informed if/when there are children in care who have not had routine immunizations due to exemption. The parent/guardian of a child who has not received the age-appropriate immunizations prior to enrollment and who does not have documented medical, religious, or philosophical exemptions from routine childhood immunizations should provide documentation of a scheduled appointment or arrangement to receive immunizations. Children who are in foster care or experiencing homelessness as defined by the McKinney-Vento Act should receive services while parents/guardians are taking necessary actions to comply with immunization requirements of the program. An immunization plan and catch-up immunizations should be initiated upon enrollment and completed as soon as possible. If a vaccine-preventable disease to which children are susceptible occurs and potentially exposes the unimmunized children who are susceptible to that disease, the health department should be consulted to determine whether these children should be excluded for the duration of possible exposure or until the appropriate immunizations have been completed. The local or state health department will be able to provide guidelines for exclusion requirements. 7.2.0.3 Immunization of Caregivers/Teachers (pg. 24) Caregivers/teachers should be current with all immunizations routinely recommended for adults by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as shown in the Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule in the following categories: a) Vaccines recommended for all adults who meet the age requirements and who lack evidence of immunity (i.e., lack documentation of vaccination or have no evidence of prior infection); and b) Recommended if a specific risk factor is present. 149 | P a g e If a staff member is not appropriately immunized for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons, the program should require written documentation of the reason. If a vaccine-preventable disease to which adults are susceptible occurs in the facility and potentially exposes the unimmunized adults who are susceptible to that disease, the health department should be consulted to determine whether these adults should be excluded for the duration of possible exposure or until the appropriate immunizations have been completed. The local or state health department will be able to provide guidelines for exclusion requirements. iii.

Child Care Licensing helps to ensure a base for knowledge by providing on-going trainings to help ensure prospective and current providers are updated regarding daily operations of process and procedures for licensing which would include required trainings. Initial trainings for caregivers are required within 90 days of hire, so it is imperative that facilities understand this requirement and plan accordingly. The trainings offered by Child Care licensing help ensure facilities facilitate this by requiring the Licensed Application Process (online and available day or night at will); New Facility Training/Director Orientation Training (required for all new facilities and recommended/required for open/operating facilities when needed) and Backgrounds Training (required for all new facilities and recommended/required for open/operating facilities when needed). These trainings are updated whenever there is a change to process, procedure, or legislation. Further, to help get information out to the industry, Child Care Licensing uses email blasts, listserv announcements and social media to help keep the industry abreast of the happenings within licensing which would include training requirements along with other operational requirements. FFN and OST providers receive all training requirement information upon registration and annual training. Any change in requirements is mailed and emailed directly to the providers. FFN providers are informed of training requirements at the time of enrollment. Licensed providers are required to participate in introductory training to the licensing regulations prior to licensure, which includes the mandatory training requirements.

How do providers receive updated information and/or training regarding the standard(s)? This description should include methods to ensure that providers are able to maintain and update the health and safety practices as described in the standards above. Child Care Licensing provides are required to orient their staff within 2 weeks of hire with regulations set forth in the Regulating licensing chapters of 432A. Child Care Licensing helps to ensure a base for knowledge by providing on-going trainings to help ensure prospective and current providers are updated regarding daily operations of process and procedures for licensing which would include required trainings. Initial trainings for caregivers are required within 90 days of hire, so it is imperative that facilities understand this requirement and plan accordingly. The trainings offered by Child Care licensing help ensure facilities facilitate this by requiring the Licensed Application Process (online and available day or night at will); New Facility Training/Director Orientation Training (required for all new facilities and recommended/required for open/operating facilities when needed) and Backgrounds Training (required for all new facilities and recommended/required for open/operating facilities when needed). These trainings are updated whenever there is a change to process, procedure, or legislation. Further, to help get information out to the industry, Child Care Licensing uses email blasts, listserv announcements and social media to help keep the industry abreast of the happenings within licensing which would include training requirements along with other operational requirements. FFN and OST providers receive all training requirement information upon registration and annual training. Any change in requirements is mailed and emailed directly to the providers. FFN providers are informed of training requirements at the time of enrollment. Licensed providers are required to participate in introductory training to the licensing regulations prior to licensure, which includes the mandatory training requirements. Licensing updates are sent out through the licensing listserv. FFN staff are informed of training updates by their CCRR specialist. Monitoring visits by Child Care Licensing and the CCRR Agencies (for FFNs/OSTs) ensure staff have met the required training elements each year. 5.3.5 Building and physical premises safety 164 | P a g e Building and physical premises safety, including the identification of and protection from hazards, bodies of water, and vehicular traffic. a.

Lead agencies must certify that procedures are in effect to ensure that all child care providers 204 | P a g e caring for children receiving CCDF services comply with all applicable state and local health and safety requirements, including those described in 98.41 (98.42(a)). This may include, but is not limited to, any systems used to ensure that providers complete health and safety trainings, any documentation required to be maintained by child care providers, or any other monitoring procedures to ensure compliance. Note: Inspection requirements are described starting in 5.4.2. a. To certify, describe the procedures to ensure that CCDF providers comply with the required Health and Safety Standards as described in Section 5.3. Monitoring of Health and Safety requirements is broken into four pieces. The State of Nevada has two child care licensing entities. The Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) administers State Child Care Licensing which oversees providers in all counties aside from Washoe County, while Washoe County administers their Child Care Licensing within Washoe. Washoe County Child Care Licensing must follow the same rules and regulations as State Licensing unless they choose to be more restrictive. State Licensing, DPBH, oversees Washoe in terms of State and Federal regulations; however, CCDP is responsible for overseeing both in terms of CCDF rules. Subsidy and CCR&R are split with the Children's Cabinet being responsible for the North and the Urban League being responsible for the South. For monitoring purposes: State Licensing, DPBH, monitors licensed providers in all counties aside from Washoe County and also monitors all Out of School Recreation programs (city or county run before and after school programs such as Latchkey) that serve CCDF families, Statewide. Washoe County Licensing monitors licensed providers in Washoe County. Washoe County is not responsible for monitoring and OST or OSR programs. Children's Cabinet monitors FFN providers and Out of School Time programs (private before and after school programs such as Boys and Girls Club) that serve CCDF families in the North. Urban League monitors FFN providers and Out of School Time programs (private before and after school programs such as Boys and Girls Club) that serve CCDF families in the South. State of Nevada Licensed facilities are subject to unannounced visits to ensure maintenance of compliance throughout a licensing year. License-exempt OST, OSR, and FFNs are monitored annually. Each monitor for both licensed and licensed-exempt providers is completed with a checklist of all of the required standards, trainings, and background checks to be reviewed for compliance. b. To certify, describe the procedures to ensure that CCDF providers comply with the required Health and Safety Training as described in Section 5.3. Each monitor for both licensed and licensed-exempt providers is completed with a checklist of all of the required standards and trainings to be reviewed for compliance. Washoe County Child Care Licensing and State Child Care Licensing monitor all licensed providers, statewide, for compliance with required health and safety trainings ((https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-432a.html#NAC432ASec190) State Statute), while the Children's Cabinet and the Urban League are responsible for monitoring all Family, Friend, and Neighbor providers annually; these are called Home Visits (see (https://dwss.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dwssnvgov/content/Care/Child%20Care%20Manual%20 Mar%202018.pdf) Policy Manual Section 622.2). The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League are also responsible for monitoring all Out of School Time providers (privately owned before and after school programs), see (https://dwss.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dwssnvgov/content/Care/Child%20Care%20Manual%20 Mar%202018.pdf) Policy Manual Section 623.4.

DPBH-HCQC-Child Care Licensing and Washoe County 5.4.3 Inspections for license-exempt center-based and family child care providers. The Lead Agency must have policies and practices that require licensing inspectors (or qualified monitors designated by the Lead Agency) to perform an annual monitoring visit of each license- exempt CCDF provider for compliance with health, safety, and fire standards (658E(c)(2)(K)(i)(IV); 98.42(b)(2)(ii)). Inspections for relative providers will be addressed in question 5.6.4. At a minimum, the health and safety requirements to be inspected must address the standards listed in subsection 5.3 (98.41(a)). a. To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of: License-exempt center-based CCDF providers, including if monitoring is announced or unannounced, occurs more frequently than once per year, and if differential monitoring is used. Monitoring is announced is conducted annually for licensed-exempt OST and OSR providers.The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League are responsible for monitoring all Out of School Time providers (privately owned before and after school programs), see (https://dwss.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dwssnvgov/content/Care/Child%20Care%20Manual%20 Mar%202018.pdf) Policy Manual Section 623.4.

Lead Agencies have the option to develop alternate monitoring requirements for care provided in the child's home that are appropriate to the setting. A child's home may not meet the same standards as other child care facilities and this provision gives Lead Agencies flexibility in conducting more streamlined and targeted on-site inspections. For example, Lead Agencies may choose to monitor in-home providers on basic health and safety requirements such as training and background checks. Lead Agencies could choose to focus on health and safety risks that pose imminent danger to children in care. This flexibility cannot be used to bypass the monitoring requirement altogether. States should develop procedures for notifying parents of monitoring protocols and consider whether it would be appropriate to obtain parental permission prior to entering the home for inspection (98.42(b)(2)(iv)(B)). a. To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of license-exempt in- home care, including if monitoring is announced or unannounced, occurs more frequently than once per year, and if differential monitoring procedures are used.

FFN providers can be a relative or non-relative and may provide services in the child'shome (in-home) for up to four children. FFN providers who offer in-home services must care for a minimum of two subsidy children to be eligible as an in-home provider. Monitoring, called \"home visits\" take place annually and a monitoring checklist is used to inspect for health and safety standards, required training, background checks and other requirements.

CCPT 05-2021 5.5 Comprehensive Background Checks The CCDBG Act requires states and territories to have in effect requirements, policies and procedures to conduct comprehensive background checks for all child care staff members (including prospective staff members) of all child care programs that are 1) licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law; or, 2) all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services (e.g., license-exempt CCDF eligible providers) (98.43(a)(1)(i)). Background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation, including contract employees and self-employed individuals; whose activities involve the care or supervision of children; or who has unsupervised access to children (98.43(2)). For family child care homes, this requirement includes the caregiver and any other adults residing in the family child care home who are age 18 or older (98.43(2)(ii)(C)). This requirement does not apply to individuals who are related to all children for whom child care services are provided (98.43(2)(B)(ii)). Exemptions for relative providers will be addressed in 5.6.5. A comprehensive background check must include eight (8) separate and specific components (98.43(2)(b)), which encompass three (3) in-state checks, two (2) national checks, and three (3) interstate checks (if the individual resided in another state in the preceding 5 years). 5.5.1 Background check requirements Background Check Requirements.

Components of Interstate Background Checks i. Criminal registry or repository in any other state where the individual has resided in the past 5 years, with the use of fingerprints being optional. Note: It is optional to use a fingerprint to conduct this check. Searching a general public facing judicial website does not satisfy this requirement. This check must be completed in addition to the national FBI history check to mitigate any gaps that may exist between the two sources (unless the responding state participates in the National Fingerprint File program). [x] Licensed, regulated, or registered child care providers Citation: Nevada is now a compact state under the National Fingerprint File. Individual applicants must request their own background check information (for the past five years) by completing a request form that is sent to the appropriate criminal history agency in their previous state(s) of residence . Name-based checks are completed. Providers are informed that staff must conduct their own interstate background checks. A consent and release form must be completed and signed to attest to whether a staff person has resided in another state within the past five years. Child Care Licensing makes the eligibility determination. States would not disseminate Criminal History or CANS information directly to Nevada's Child Care Licensing Agencies, so Nevada began using the applicant to get the information. It is a bit of an honor system as we try to navigate the obstacles many State Laws have in place that prevent us from receiving this information directly. Right now, as we review the documentation submitted, we look for the information to be presented on official letter head and it usually accompanies contact information where we can call and verify enough information to confirm that the documents received are legitimate. Once states are able to figure out a way to share the information without breaking their own State Laws the process will naturally become more secured. 218 | P a g e The individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed family, friend, and neighbor provider must request this information on their own merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency. The criminal history check information is then delivered to the Nevada Department of Public and Behavioral Health Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. Nevada Department of Public and Behavioral Health Child Care Licensing or the applicable law enforcement or criminal repository agency in the state for which the result is returned handles the appeals.

A consent and release form must be completed and signed to attest to whether a staff person has resided in another state within the past five years. Child Care Licensing makes the eligibility determination. States would not disseminate Criminal History or CANS information directly to Nevada's Child Care Licensing Agencies, so Nevada began using the applicant to get the information. It is a bit of an honor system as we try to navigate the obstacles many State Laws have in place that prevent us from receiving this information directly. Right now, as we review the documentation submitted, we look for the information to be presented on official letter head and it usually accompanies contact information where we can call and verify enough information to confirm that the documents received are legitimate. Once states are able to figure out a way to share the information without breaking their own State Laws the process will naturally become more secured. The individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed family, friend, and neighbor provider must request this information on their own 219 | P a g e merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency.

The state/territory must ensure that fees charged for completing the background checks do not exceed the actual cost of processing and administration, regardless of whether they are conducted by the state/territory or a third-party vendor or contractor. What are the fees and how do you ensure that these fees do not exceed the actual cost of processing and administering the background checks? Lead Agencies can report that no fees are charged if applicable (98.43(f)). NRS432A.170.4 states the Division may charge each person investigated pursuant to this section for the reasonable cost of that investigation. c. Describe the state/territory policy(ies) related to prospective staff members working on a provisional basis. Pending completion of all background check components in 98.43(b), the prospective staff member must be supervised at all times by an individual who received a qualifying result on a background check described in 98.43(b) within the past 5 years (98.43(c)(4)) and the prospective staff member must have completed and received satisfactory results on either the FBI fingerprint check or a fingerprint check of the state/territory criminal registry or repository in the state where the prospective staff member resides. Describe and include a citation for the Lead Agency's policy: Staff will continue to work, under supervision by another fully cleared provider/staff person, while 223 | P a g e their background check is being processed. The state will continue to work toward compliance in this area. d. Describe the procedure for providers to request background checks for staff members that resided in another state within the previous 5 years. CANS: Providers are informed that individual applicants must request their own background check information (for the past five years) by completing a request form that is sent to the appropriate child abuse and neglect records agency in their previous state(s) of residence. The provider forwards results to Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. Criminal History: Providers are informed that the individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed provider must request this information on their own merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency. This information is then delivered to the Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. NSOR: Providers are informed that the individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed provider must request this information on their own merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency. This information is then delivered to the Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. State Child Care Licensing requires a \"Consent & Release\" form be completed by licensed family, group, and center providers, as well as all unlicensed providers in order for them to conduct a search of the public website for the national sex offender registry within their office. This consent and release asks each individual to answer if they have been a resident of Nevada for the last 5 years and requires them to sign off on the following: I am required to be fingerprinted and to undergo a criminal record review pursuant to NRS 432A.175. NAC 432A.200(4)(a) requires fingerprinting be completed and submitted within 24 HOURS after date of hire , or date of registration if you are a subsidy provider, and every 5 years thereafter . I do hereby consent to be fingerprinted and agree to the following conditions and terms: 1. The fingerprints will be used to check the criminal history records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Nevada Criminal History Repository, and the Child Abuse and Neglect System (CANS). 2. I hereby authorize the FBI, the National Sex Offender Repository, Nevada Criminal History Repository, and/or other local/national law enforcement agencies and Child Protective Services agencies to release criminal history information and CANS history to Child Care Licensing. 3. All information provided to Child Care Licensing is confidential, as relating to a third party or entity. 4. I hereby authorize the Nevada Criminal History Repository to retain a fingerprint card in the central repository's master file for the sole purpose of identifying same against subsequent disqualifying criminal arrest and I authorize the Nevada Criminal History 224 | P a g e Repository to release criminal history information to Child Care Licensing in accordance with dissemination restrictions as provided for in the Nevada Revised Statutes. 5. I may be suspended, terminated, or disqualified from employment/FFN participation, and/or licensure based on the findings of the criminal record review consistent with applicable laws and regulations or on the findings of the Child Abuse and Neglect System. 6. I understand that I may review the challenge the accuracy of any and all criminal history records which are returned to the submitting agency, and that the proper forms and procedures will be furnished to me by the Nevada Department of Public Safety Records Bureau upon request. 7. This waiver and its authority is valid until such time as the applicant is no longer licensed and/or employed at a child care facility. 8. I hereby release from liability and promise to hold harmless under any and all causes of legal action, the State of Nevada, its officer(s), agent(s) and/or employee(s) who conducted my criminal history records search and provided information to the submitting agency for any statement(s), omission(s), or infringement(s) upon my current legal rights. I further release and promise to hold harmless and covenant not to sue any persons, firms, institutions, or agencies providing such information to the State of Nevada on the basis of their disclosures. I have signed this release voluntarily and of my own free will. e. Describe the procedure to ensure each staff member completes all components of the background check process at least once during each 5-year period. If your state enrolls child care staff members in the FBI Rap Back Program or a state-based rap back program, please include that in this description. Note: An FBI Rap Back program only covers the FBI Fingerprint component of the background check. If child care staff members are enrolled in a state-based rap back, please indicate which background check components are covered by this service. State of Nevada has its own database called NABS (Nevada Automated Background System) which tracks each background applicant to ensure each component is complied with, checked and updated accordingly as specified within our NRS432A.170.5. NRS432A.170.5 states the information required to be obtained pursuant to subsections 2 and 3 must be requested concerning an: (a) Employee of an applicant, licensee or small child care establishment, resident of a child care facility or small child care establishment who is 18 years of age or older, other than a resident who remains under the jurisdiction of a court pursuant to NRS 432B.594, or participant in an outdoor youth program who is 18 years of age or older for an initial background check not later than 3 days after the employee is hired, the residency begins or the participant begins participating in the program and before the employee, resident or participant has direct contact with any child at the child care facility, All staff are required to have a comprehensive background check completed every five years and the NABS system tracks the five years and all staff are alerted that need a comprehensive background check (not just individual component, all required components) every five years. 225 | P a g e As a contengency plan, Child Care Licensing also tracks the five years to ensure checks are required. See NRS 432A 170 (https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-432A.html#NRS432ASec170) https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-432A.html#NRS432ASec170 f. Describe the procedure to ensure providers who are separated from employment for more than 180 consecutive days receive a full background check. State of Nevada has its own database called NABS (Nevada Automated Background System) which tracks each background applicant to ensure each component is complied with, checked and updated accordingly, so if an individual is separated from their employer and then returns to the industry, they are subjected to a newly initiated background check as promoted by the system. All providers are required to update the NABS system whne an employee is seperated from employmnets. The NABS system tracks the individual employee and will create an alert to providers and Licensing when 180 days of seperation have passed and will require a comprehensive background check for that individual. As a contengency plan, Child Care Licensing also tracks the 180 days to ensure checks are required. g. Provide the website link that contains instructions on how child care providers should initiate background check requests for a prospective employee (98.43(g)). (http://dpbh.nv.gov/Reg/ChildCare/Child_Care_Licensing_Open_and_Operate/) http://dpbh.nv.gov/Reg/ChildCare/Child_Care_Licensing_Open_and_Operate/ 5.5.3 Procedures for a Lead Agency to Respond to and Complete a Background Check. Once a request has been initiated, the state shall carry out the request of a child care provider for a criminal background check as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed 45 days after the date on which such request was submitted. The Lead Agency shall make the determination whether the prospective staff member is eligible for employment in a child care program (98.43(e)(1)). Lead Agencies must ensure the privacy of background checks by providing the results of the criminal background check to the requestor or identified recipient in a statement that indicates whether a child care staff member (including a prospective child care staff member or a family child care household member over the age of 18) is eligible or ineligible for employment, without revealing any documentation of criminal history or disqualifying crimes or other related information regarding the individual. In the following questions, describe the Lead Agency's procedures for conducting background checks. These responses should include: The name of the agency that conducts the investigation; include multiple names if multiple agencies are involved in different background check components How the Lead Agency is informed of the results of each background check component Who makes the determinations regarding the staff member's eligibility? Note: Disqualification decisions should align to the response provided in 5.5.7. How the Lead Agency ensures that a background check request is carried out as quickly as possible and not more than 45 days after a request is submitted. a. Describe the procedures for conducting In-State Background Check requests and making a 226 | P a g e determination of eligibility. For the NSOR, Fingerprint and Criminal Repository checks: In Washoe County, the sheriff's office sends the fingerprints to the Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS contacts the sheriff's office.The sheriff's office determines eligibility, per CCDF rules and contacts Washoe County Child Care Licening on whether the applicant has passed the checks. In the remaining counties, State Child Care licensing sends the fingerprints to DPS and DPS contacts State Child Care Licensing with results. State Child Care Licensing makes the eligibility determination per CCDF rules. For the CANS check: Statewide, both Child Care Licensing entities complete the CAN check internally and determine eligibility per CCDF rules. Backround checks are completed as quickly as possible. b. If the procedure is different for National Background checks, including the name-based NCIC NSOR check and FBI fingerprint check, please describe here. All NCIC NSOR checks results must be reported to a State Agency, per DPS. State Child Care Licensing recieves the resutls, statewide, and makes the determination per CCDF rules. c. Describe the procedures for conducting Interstate Background Check requests and making a determination of eligibility. (Note this response should detail how a state conducts an interstate check for a provider who currently lives in their state or territory but has lived in another state(s) within the previous five years). Providers are informed that staff must conduct their own interstate background checks. A consent and release form must be completed and signed to attest to whether a staff person has resided in another state within the past five years. Child Care Licensing makes the eligibility determination. States would not disseminate Criminal History or CANS information directly to Nevada's Child Care Licensing Agencies, so Nevada began using the applicant to get the information. It is a bit of an honor system as we try to navigate the obstacles many State Laws have in place that prevent us from receiving this information directly. Right now, as we review the documentation submitted, we look for the information to be presented on official letter head and it usually accompanies contact information where we can call and verify enough information to confirm that the documents received are legitimate. Once states are able to figure out a way to share the information without breaking their own State Laws the process will naturally become more secured. For the Sex Offender Registry (not NCIC), Child Care Licensing DPBH does the check within their office, conducting a Name-Based and Social Security Number search nationwide. 227 | P a g e CANS: Providers are informed that individual applicants must request their own background check information (for the past five years) by completing a request form that is sent to the appropriate child abuse and neglect records agency in their previous state(s) of residence. The provider forwards results to Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. Criminal History: Providers are informed that the individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed provider must request this information on their own merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency. This information is then delivered to the Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination.

This waiver and its authority is valid until such time as the applicant is no longer licensed and/or employed at a child care facility. 8. I hereby release from liability and promise to hold harmless under any and all causes of legal action, the State of Nevada, its officer(s), agent(s) and/or employee(s) who conducted my criminal history records search and provided information to the submitting agency for any statement(s), omission(s), or infringement(s) upon my current legal rights. I further release and promise to hold harmless and covenant not to sue any persons, firms, institutions, or agencies providing such information to the State of Nevada on the basis of their disclosures. I have signed this release voluntarily and of my own free will. Criminal History: Individual applicants must request their own background check information (for the past five years) by completing a request form that is sent to the appropriate criminal history agency in their previous state(s) of residence . The individual employee of a licensed family, group, or center, or an unlicensed family, friend, and neighbor provider must request this information on their own merit, and if a result is provided, they will receive the result from the state or agency. This information is then delivered to the Nevada Department of Public and Behavioral Health Child Care Licensing who makes the eligibility determination. Does this mean that the staff person gets the info back from the other state and then sends it to DPBH? If yes, how do we ensure they don't tamper with it? The system is imperfect as States won't disseminate criminal history information directly to us (DPBH- CCL), so our best option for the time being is using the applicant as an in between. It is a bit of an honor system as we try to navigate the obstacles many State Laws have in place that prevent us from receiving this information directly. Right now, as we review the documentation submitted, we look for the information to be presented on official letter head and it usually accompanies contact information where we can call and verify enough information to confirm that the documents received are legitimate. Once states are able to figure out a way to share the information without breaking their own State Laws the process will naturally become more secured. Additionally, Name-based checks are completed by DPBH d. Describe the procedure the Lead Agency has in place to make an eligibility determination in the event not all the components of the background check are completed within the 229 | P a g e required 45-day timeframe. NA e. Describe procedures for conducting a check when the state of residence is different than the state in which the staff member works. When the state of residence is different from the state in which the staff member works, the staff member is required to have an in-state check and an inter-state check. 5.5.4 \"Compact State\" and participation in the National Fingerprint File program State designation as a \"Compact State\" and participation in the National Fingerprint File program. a. \"Compact States\" are states that have ratified the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Act of 1998 in order to facilitate electronic information sharing for noncriminal justice purposes (such as employment) among the Federal Government and states. More information can be found here: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact-council . The Compact allows signatory states to disseminate its criminal history record information to other states for noncriminal justice purposes in accordance with the laws of the receiving state. For the most up-to-date Compact States and Territories map visit: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact-council/maps. Is your state or territory a Compact State? [ ] No [x] Yes b. The National Fingerprint File (NFF) is a database of fingerprints, or other unique personal identification information relating to an arrested or charged individual, which is maintained by the FBI to provide positive fingerprint identification of record subjects. Only a state or territory that has ratified the Compact (a Compact State) may join the NFF program. An FBI fingerprint check satisfies the requirement to perform an interstate check of another state's criminal history record repository if the responding state (where the child care staff member has resided within the past 5 years) participates in the NFF program. It is unnecessary to conduct both the FBI fingerprint check and the search of an NFF state's criminal history record repository (refer to CCDF-ACF-PIQ-2017-01). For the most up-to-date NFF Participation map visit: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact-council/maps Is your state or territory an NFF State? [x] No [ ] Yes 5.5.5 Respond to Interstate Background Checks Procedures for a Lead Agency to Respond to Interstate Background Checks: Interstate a. Criminal History Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate criminal history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain criminal history information to an out-of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). When a request is received, the requester is notified by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) that Nevada does not provide information at this time, unless a fingerprint based background check is received from a State Agency. If a state agency requests the background check, DPS will respond. 230 | P a g e NRS179A.090Prerequisite to dissemination of records; exceptions.No agency of criminal justice in Nevada may disseminate any record of criminal history which includes information about a felony or a gross misdemeanor without first making inquiry of the Central Repository, to obtain the most current and complete information available, unless: 1.The information is needed for a purpose in the administration of criminal justice for which time is essential, and the Central Repository is not able to respond within the required time; 2.The full information requested and to be disseminated relates to specific facts or incidents which are within the direct knowledge of an officer, agent or employee of the agency which disseminates the information; 3.The full information requested and to be disseminated was received as part of a summary of records of criminal history from the Central Repository within 30 days before the information is disseminated; 4.The statute, executive order, court rule or court order under which the information is to be disseminated refers only to information which is in the files of the agency which makes the dissemination; 5.The information requested and to be disseminated is for the express purpose of research, evaluation or statistical activities to be based upon information maintained in the files of the agency or agencies from which the information is sought; or 6.The information is requested by a compensation officer pursuant to (https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-217.html#NRS217Sec090) NRS 217.090. b. Interstate Sex Offender Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate sex offender history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain sex offender information to an out-of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). When a request is received, the requester is notified by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) that Nevada does not provide information at this time, unless a fingerprint based background check is received from a State Agency. If a state agency requests the background check, DPS will respond. c. Interstate Child Abuse and Neglect Registry Check Procedures Provide a description of how the state or territory responds to interstate child abuse and neglect history check requests from another state and whether there are any laws or policies that prevent the state from releasing certain child abuse and neglect information to an out- of-state entity for civil purpose (i.e., for purposes of determining employment eligibility). Any employer from out of state must complete the required form to request a CANs check for employees (see link): (https://dcfs.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dcfsnvgov/content/Forms/1607A- EmployerRequestforCentralRegistrySearch.pdf) https://dcfs.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dcfsnvgov/content/Forms/1607A-231 | P a g e EmployerRequestforCentralRegistrySearch.pdf 5.5.6 Consumer Education Website Links to Interstate Background Check Processes Lead Agencies must have requirements, policies, and procedures in place to respond as expeditiously as possible to other States', Territories' and Tribes' requests for background checks in order to meet the 45-day timeframe (98.43(a)(1)(iii)). In addition, Lead Agencies are required to include on their consumer education website the process by which another Lead Agency may submit a background check request, along with all of the other background check policies and procedures (98.43 (g)). State and Territory Lead Agencies are required to designate one page of their existing Consumer Education Website as a landing page for all interstate background check related processes and procedures pertaining to their own state. The purpose of having a dedicated interstate background check web page on the Lead Agency Consumer Education Website is to help state and territories implement the interstate background check requirements of the CCDBG Act (CCDF Consumer Education Website and Reports of Serious Injuries and Death (OMB #0970- 0473)). Check to certify that the required elements are included on the Lead Agency's consumer education website for each interstate background check component, and provide the direct URL/website link.

Lead Agencies are required to reserve and use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high-quality child care (98.53). This section addresses the quality improvement activities implemented by the Lead Agency related to the support of the child care workforce and the development and implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines. It asks Lead Agencies to describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services. (98.53 (f)) in either of these two areas. States and territories are required to describe their framework for training, professional development, and post-secondary education for caregivers, teachers, and directors, including those working in school-age care (98.44(a)). This framework is part of a broader systematic approach building on health and safety training (as described in section 5) within a state/territory. States and territories must incorporate their knowledge and application of health and safety standards, early learning guidelines, responses to challenging behavior, and the engagement of families. States and territories are required to establish a progression of professional development opportunities to improve the knowledge and skills of CCDF providers (658E(c)(2)(G)). To the extent practicable, professional development should be appropriate to work with a population of children of different ages, English-language learners, children with disabilities, and Native Americans (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). Training and professional development is one of the options that states and territories have for investing their CCDF quality funds (658G(b)(1)). 6.1 Professional Development Framework 6.1.1 Professional development framework for training and professional development Each state or territory must describe their professional development framework for training, professional development, and post-secondary education for caregivers, teachers and directors in programs that serve children of all ages. This framework should be developed in consultation with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body. The framework should include these components: (1) professional standards and competencies, (2) career pathways, (3) advisory structures, (4) articulation, (5) workforce information, and (6) financing (98.44(a)(3)). Flexibility is provided on the strategies, breadth, and depth with which states and territories will develop and implement their framework. a. Describe how the state/territory's framework for training and professional development addresses the following required elements: i. State/territory professional standards and competencies. Describe: The Nevada Registry published Nevada's Core Knowledge Areas (CKA) and Core Competencies for Early Care and Education Professionals in 2007. The CKA are a set of content areas that define what caregivers should know and understand in order to provide quality experiences for children while the Core Competencies are a set of observable skills that reflect a caregiver's knowledge of 242 | P a g e the Core Knowledge Areas. All community-based training approved by The Nevada Registry is linked to specific CKA. The CKA support the framework of the Nevada Early Care and Education Career Ladder and provide the foundation for the professional development system. They CKA are also aligned with Nevada's Pre-K Standards. In 2020, the Nevada Department of Education partnered with SRI Education to facilitate the Nevada Ready B5! Alignment Project. Though this work, Nevada's Core Competencies were reviewed, and it was ultimately determined that rather than revising Nevada's existing competencies, our state will adopt the standards and competencies created through the National Association for the Education of Young Children's (NAEYC) Power to the Profession initiative. NAEYC's Standards and Competencies are slated to be formally adopted in FY22. ii. Career pathways. Describe: The Nevada Early Care and Education Professional Career Ladder is tailored specifically to the field of Early Care and Education (ECE) with 7 levels representing various combinations of formal education, training and direct experience (up to 4000 hours). Through the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program, early childhood professionals pursue Early Childhood Education (ECE) Certificates, Associate, and Bachelor Degrees at participating Institutes of Higher Education within Nevada. The following pathways are available: Early Childhood Education Certificate; Associate of Applied ECE, ECE Director/Administration, Infant/Toddler, Administration/Non-License, ECE Pre-K- 2nd Grade/License, Human Development and Family Studies. iii. Advisory structure. Describe: In addition to the State Early Childhood Advisory Council, each quality initiative in the State of Nevada has developed an advisory board or committee that serves as a sounding board and helps to guide the development of the various projects (i.e. TEACH, QRIS, The Nevada Registry, and State and County Child Care Licensing). iv. Articulation. Describe: Course titles and number are consistent between the Institutes of Higher Education. Articulation exists between ECE Associate of Arts degree pathways at community colleges and Bachelor of Science degree pathways at the universities T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada facilitates a workgroup of ECE Higher Education professionals to discuss topics related to the ECE higher education pathways. v. Workforce information. Describe: The Nevada Registry publishes a biennial membership and training approval system report highlighting the demographics of the Registry membership. This report includes general demographics, wage information, educational attainment, career ladder information as well as training and trainer statistics. With over 7000 active members, this is currently the primary source of data specific to the ECE workforce. The Registry's data is also referenced in The Children's Cabinet's biennial fact sheets that provide county-level data on the supply, demand, quality and availability of child care in Nevada. vi. Financing. Describe: The T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program provides financial assistance for ECE professionals to attain ECE credentials and degrees. Eighty percent (80%) of the cost of tuition and books are supported by the scholarship. The T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program provides the following financial incentives for educational attainment and retention: 1) $50 incentive per semester to assist with costs related to tuition, travel and Internet; 2) a bonus for successfully completing a minimum of 243 | P a g e nine credits per year while receiving the college scholarship: $300 bonus for Associate degree scholarships and $400 bonus for Bachelor degree scholarships. Additionally, employers, sponsoring staff on the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program, provide $300 bonuses or 2% raises per year for successfully completed scholarships. b. The following are optional elements, or elements that should be implemented to the extent practicable, in the training and professional development framework. [ ] i. Continuing education unit trainings and credit-bearing professional development to the extent practicable. Describe: [ ] ii. Engagement of training and professional development providers, including higher education, in aligning training and educational opportunities with the state/territory's framework. Describe: [x] iii. Other. Describe: The Child Care and Development Program has partnered with the TEACH program to pilot an expansion of program services for participants of the Nevada Youth First Program. The Pilot provides scholarships for higher learning in partnership with the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Administration in Nevada to implement statewide efforts to recruit, mentor, and place staff into the field of early childhood. 6.1.2 Consultation with state advisory council Describe how the state/territory developed its professional development framework in consultation with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care (if applicable) or similar coordinating body if there is no SAC that addresses the professional development, training, and education of child care providers and staff. The Nevada Registry's training approval system launched in 2004 prior to the establishment of the SAC. As a result, the training and professional development requirements were not initially developed in direct consultation with the SAC. However, since that time, both the Registry Advisory Committee and the newly established Training Approval System Advisory Workgroup include representation from the SAC. Both committees help to guide, advise and support the ongoing development of the training and professional development system in Nevada. 6.1.3 Description of framework Describe how the framework improves the quality, diversity, stability, and retention of caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.44(a)(7)). The T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program provides financial assistance for ECE professionals to attain ECE credentials and degrees. Eighty percent (80%) of the cost of tuition and books are supported by the scholarship. The T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program provides the following financial incentives for educational attainment and retention: 1) $50 incentive per semester to assist with costs related to tuition, travel and Internet; 2) a bonus for successfully completing a minimum of nine credits per year while receiving the college scholarship: $300 bonus for Associate degree scholarships and $400 bonus for Bachelor degree scholarships. Additionally, employers, sponsoring staff on the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Scholarship Program, provide $300 bonuses or 2% raises per year for successfully 244 | P a g e completed scholarships. T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada conducts outreach at high schools with ECE programs to inform high school students of the scholarship program and its eligibility criteria. At the annual Nevada Association for the Education of Young Children (NevAEYC) Early Childhood Conference sessions are offered that address providers' mental health including yoga and relaxation techniques to reduce stress, self-regulation and calming, and to improve sleep. To assist with retention, recipients of T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada scholarships remain employed with their sponsoring child care programs while receiving the scholarships; as well as commit to remaining employed for one year after the conclusion of the scholarships. 6.2 Training and Professional Development Requirements The Lead Agency must describe how its established health and safety requirements for pre- service or orientation training and ongoing professional development requirements\u2014as described in Section 5 for caregivers, teachers, and directors in CCDF programs\u2014align, to the extent practicable, with the state/territory professional development framework. These requirements must be designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children receiving CCDF funds across the entire age span, from birth through age 12 (658E(c)(2)(G)). Ongoing training and professional development should be accessible and appropriate to the setting and age of the children served (98.44(b)(2)). 6.2.1 Training and professional development descriptions Describe how the state/territory incorporates into training and professional development opportunities: the knowledge and application of its early learning and developmental guidelines (where applicable); its health and safety standards (as described in section 5); and social-emotional/behavioral and mental health intervention models for young children, which can include positive behavior intervention and support models that reduce the likelihood of suspension and expulsion of children (as described in Section 2 of the Pre-Print) (98.44(b)). Learning and Develpmental Guidelines Nevada's early childhood educators rely on the Nevada Pre-K Content Standards to provide a framework and guidance for curriculum development. The Nevada Pre-K Content Standards were developed based on child development research and developmentally appropriate practices for 4 year-old children. Through the PDG B-5 grant, NDE worked with SRI Inc. to embark upon the beginning phases of standards revisions. Work for the next two years will 245 | P a g e focus on finalizing the standards revisions to resume statewide training and support to the ECE workforce. Director and Program Administrator: Director Perspective training are offered for ECE program directors and administrators to gain more comprehensive information on the use of the Pre-KStandards and Infant and Toddler Guidelines. In addition, they receive information and resources that include The Nevada Registry, T.E.A.C.H.\u00ae Early Childhood Nevada, TACSEI, Pre-K to K transitions and QRIS.This information provides program directors and administrators with the knowledge to promote professional development for their staff and to improve program quality and introduces them to other agencies that support their programs. Parent Education: The Parent Perspective training is offered and provided to parents about the use of standards.These trainings are available in English and Spanish and parents learn about the Nevada Pre-K Standards and developmentally appropriate strategies on how to support learning at home. They receive an overview of what typically developing 4-year-old children should know and be able to do before they enter kindergarten.They have an opportunity to participate in a variety of activities with their child based on the Nevada Pre-K Content Standards. Parent and family engagement activities are essential, and we recognize that parents are their child's first teacher. Supporting and helping families understand about school readiness skills with easily replicated activities helpsto foster the importance of the home school connection for their child. The Infant and Toddler Guidelines are available for parents as a frame of reference for their child's development. Supportive activities are included so parents can foster learning at home. Infants and toddlers grow and develop rapidly so it is important to mention that different milestones can occur at different times and stages in a child's development can change quickly. Parents receive a copy of the \"Ready for K\" book that provides detailed information about the Pre-K Standards and how they can track their child's development and mastery of new skills. Health and Safety standards are at the core of training requirements for Family Friend and Neighbor providers. FFN providers must complete 30 hours of training within the first 90 days after registration on the Subsidy program. The same initial training requirements must be met by all providers working in Licensed child care facilities within 120 days of employment, with the exception of Child Abuse and Neglect which must be taken within 90 days. Training must include: - Administration of Medication - Building and physical premises safety - Emergency preparedness and response planning 246 | P a g e - Precautions in transporting children Prevention/response to food allergies - Handling & storage of biocontaminants Identification of child abuse & neglect - Nutrition and physical activity - First-aid and CPR Prevention and control of infectious diseases - Prevention of shaken baby syndrome - SIDS and use of safe sleep practices Social Emotional/Behavioral Licensed providers that receive subsidy in Nevada are required to participate in Nevada's TACSEI ePyramid training to assist providers and staff with tools for relationship building, challenging behaviors, and to prevent suspension and expulsion. 6.2.2 Accessibility of professional development for tribes and tribal organizations Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development are accessible to providers supported through Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving CCDF funds (as applicable) (98.44(b)(2)(vi)). All trainings are open to any provider in Nevada. There is tribal representation on The Nevada Registry Advisory Committee to help guide, advise and make recommendations concerning issues related to Nevada's professional development and training approval system. T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada scholarships are accessible to early childhood professionals associated with Indian tribes and tribal organizations with state licensed or tribally regulated child care programs. Currently, T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada collaborates with the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada and a representative from the Inter-Tribal Council participates on the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood\u00ae Nevada Advisory Committee With the exception of CPR and First Aid, all of the currently required initial health & safety trainings are available online at no cost through two online training organizations: ProSolutions Training and the University of Nevada Reno Extension Office. These online trainings are available to all providers in Nevada, regardless of setting. 6.2.3 Accessibility for providers with limited English proficiency and disabilities States/territories are required to facilitate participation of child care providers with limited English proficiency and disabilities in the subsidy system (98.16 (dd)). Describe how the state/territory will recruit and facilitate the participation of providers in the subsidy system: a. with limited English proficiency. CCDP has become a part of Arizona's Kith and Kin program, Candelen, to support kith and kin providers in the community in partnership with the Urban League and Children's Cabinet to provide a 247 | P a g e pathwary to subsidy. A large focus of this program is to reach those unregistered providers in that may be limited in English proficiency and loop them into opportunites for trainings, wraparound services, and paths to subsidy and/or licensure. CCDP is utilizing community based organizations embedded within communities with limited English proficiency to recruit adults to become licensed Family Child Care providers and to facilitate a pathway to subsidy. FFN registration and training materials are available in Spanish. R&R staff have Spanish-speaking staff members to register FFN providers who speak Spanish. All registration materials are available in Spanish. All information on training requirements is available in Spanish including the R&R FFN training catalog which has trainings offered in Spanish. Caring for Our Children Basics was also translated in Spanish and given to providers to prepare to their health & safety visit which is conducted by a Spanish-speaking staff member. For languages other than Spanish, Telelanguage service can be used to communicate with providers. This service is offered 24/7/365 and provides professional translation services for over 200 languages. b. who have disabilities. All R&R offices are ADA compliant, and staff have training on the use of Relay Nevada (7-1-1) which is a free service that provides full telephone accessibility to people who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, deaf- blind and speech disabled. This service allows relay users to communicate with standard telephone users through specially trained relay operators. The call can be made to anywhere in Nevada 24/7/365 with no restrictions on the number, length, or type of calls. All calls are strictly confidential, and no records of any conversations are maintained. 6.2.4 Training and professional development requirements for CCDF providers Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development requirements are appropriate, to the extent practicable, for child care providers who care for children receiving child care subsidies, including children of different age groups (such as specialized credentials for providers who care for infants and/or school-age children); English-language learners; children with developmental delays and disabilities; and Native Americans, including Indians as defined in Section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (including Alaska Natives) and Native Hawaiians (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). With the exception of requiring specific training for caregivers working with infants under one year of age (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Shaken Baby Syndrome), Nevada's Child Care Licensing training regulations apply to all licensed facilities, regardless of the type of setting (Child Care, Family Child Care, etc.) or the ages served. Family, Friend, and Neighbor (FFN) provider training options are available in Spanish and support is given to Spanish-speaking providers to access and complete web-based trainings. Additionally, if training requirement are specifically for infants and toddlers (i.e., SIDS and Shaken Baby Syndrome), these requirements are not enforced if the provider does not care for children in this care level. Caring for Children with Disabilities would count toward the mandatory initial training hours for FFN providers. We do not have training options specifically for Native Americans or Native Hawaiians. 6.2.5 Training and technical assistance to identify families experiencing homelessness The Lead Agency must provide training and technical assistance (TA) to providers and 248 | P a g e appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving children and families experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B)(i)). a. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for providers in identifying and serving children and their families experiencing homelessness (relates to question 3.2.2). The CCDP subgrants CCDF funds to the Nevada Department of Education, who developed a survey to evaluate providers' understanding of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act's definition of homeless, the effects of homelessness on children and families, the effects of homelessness on child behavior and learning, identifying the barriers of providing service to homeless children, as well as ascertain information on what additional resources would be helpful for them to better serve this population. The Las Vegas Urban League partners with Homeless Youth Alliance and participates in their Project Homeless Connect and other events in order to find and assist homeless families. Information, training and webinars are shared with staff. CCR&R staff attended Child Care for Families Experiencing Homelessness: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead on May 2, 2018 and Serving Young Children Experiencing Homelessness: Practical Strategies for McKinney-Vento Liaisons and School- based Staff on May 8, 2018. Both webinars are from School House Connection. b. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff in identifying and serving children and their families experiencing homelessness (connects to question 3.3.6). Information, training and webinars are shared with staff. R&R staff attended Child Care for Families Experiencing Homelessness: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead on May 2, 2018 and Serving Young Children Experiencing Homelessness: Practical Strategies for McKinney- Vento Liaisons and School-based Staff on May 8, 2018. Both webinars are from School House Connection. A survey was distributed at the 2018 Nevada Association for the Education of Young Children Early Childhood Conference to understand the topics of training and support is needed by child care providers. In addition, meetings have been held with the Nevada Department of Education McKinney-Vento liaison to discuss possible shared resources and training opportunities. We are in the process to determine if Initial online trainings offered by the Office of Head Start and Child Care can be approved by The Nevada Registry for child care training hours. 6.2.6 Strategies to strengthen business practices Lead Agencies must develop and implement strategies to strengthen the business practices of child care providers to expand the supply and to improve the quality of child care services (98.16 (z)). Describe the state/territory's strategies to strengthen providers' business practices, which can include training and/or TA efforts. a. Describe the strategies that the state/territory is developing and implementing for strengthening child care providers' business practices. There are two business series trainings available through a blended online training and cohort meetings training format. A Basic Center Management Certificate and a Budgeting and Risk Management Certificate are available. Providers who complete the series are reimbursed the cost of the training ($69). The Child Care and Development Program intends to use COVID Response and Relief funding (CRRSA) to strengthen business practices of child care providers and to improve the quality of child care services through Staffed Family Child Care Networks, including training and technical assistance on fiscal management, budgeting, recordkeeping, community relationships, marketing and public relations, and parent-provider communication. b.

These early learning and developmental guidelines are to be used statewide and territory-wide by child care providers and in the development and implementation of training and professional development (658E(c)(2)(T)). The required essential domains for these guidelines are cognition, including language arts and mathematics; social, emotional, and physical development; and approaches toward learning (98.15(a)(9)). At the option of the state/territory, early learning and developmental guidelines for out-of-school time may be developed. Note: States and territories may use the quality set-aside, discussed in section 7, to improve on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines. a. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines address the following requirements: i. Are research-based. The Nevada Pre-K Content Standards are research based and aligned to the Nevada Academic Content Standards. The developmentally appropriate standards include the aligned K-12 standard to help support the Pre-K to K transition. The content standards are used for planning curriculum, assessing growth and development, and for sharing important information with families about their child's growth and development. ii. Developmentally appropriate. The Early Learning Guidelines provide a framework of developmental milestones to guide and support ECE Practioners and professionals in their teaching practices. The guidelines are developmentally appropriate and help teachers to implement curriculum and improve child outcomes. The guidelines are aligned and the support the developmental growth from birth to kindergarten. iii. Culturally and linguistically appropriate. Nevada's Early Learning Guidelines include culture, diverstiy, and language into the guidelines 255 | P a g e and standards; for example, language develpment, social emotional develpment, and creative expression. Culture, diversity and language are important issues in early childhood programs. Providing a classroom that is rich in language and that embraces the culture of the program is key to helping children develop a positive culture identity (Derman-Sparks, Edwards, 2009). Young children begin to develop a greater understanding about themselves, their families and their communities in classrooms that foster this approach. Providing children with opportunities to learn about other cultures gives them experiences where they can learn about the similarities and the differences of about each other. Modeling respect for each other, tolerance and acceptance of different points of view helps young children to understand and promote a true antibias classroom. Understanding and respecting others will help to develop a compassionate attitude. Early childhood programs that model acceptance and respect of a child's native language will help them to feel more included in a classroom. A program that supports the use of a child's home language sends the message that their culture is important while exposing them to an enriched bilingual environment. Language barriers exist when we fail to provide support for children to be successful. iv. Aligned with kindergarten entry. The Early Learning Guidelines provide a framework of developmental milestones to guide and support ECE Practioners and professionals in their teaching practices. The guidelines are developmentally appropriate and help teachers to implement curriculum and improve child outcomes. The guidelines are aligned and the support the developmental growth from birth to kindergarten. v. Appropriate for all children from birth to kindergarten entry. The Early Learning Guidelines provide a framework of developmental milestones to guide and support ECE Practioners and professionals in their teaching practices. The guidelines are developmentally appropriate and help teachers to implement curriculum and improve child outcomes. The guidelines are aligned and the support the developmental growth from birth to kindergarten. vi. Implemented in consultation with the educational agency and the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. The Early Learning Guidelines and the Nevada Pre-K Standards are written into the State Advisory Council's Strategic plan that is currently going through the final edits and revisions. Aligning programs, resources and quality indicators supports best practices and better outcomes for Nevada's children b. Describe how the required domains are included in the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines. Responses for \"other\" are optional. i.

Describe how other optional domains are included, if any: NA c. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are updated and include the date first issued and/or the frequency of updates. The Nevada Pre-K Content Standards were originally established in 2004 and updated in 2010. The companion crosswalk to the Nevada Academic Content Standards was completed in 2014 and provides guidance for aligning Math and Language and Literacy standards. The Early Learning Guidelines were established in 2013 and revised in 2014. Work groups are currently being developed to review and align the B-third grade standards to better support the State of Nevada's B-3 plan. We may want to add that we are looking to use the Head start learning outcomes as a guide in this work. d. If applicable, discuss the state process for the adoption, implementation, and continued improvement of state out-of-school timestandards. The State has adopted OST health and safety standards but has not implemented or revised the standards to include the CCDF reauthorization requirements. In addition, Nevada has developed a OST Self-Assessment tool. e. Provide the Web link to the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines and if available, the school-age guidelines. http://www.nevadaregistry.org/fb_files/PreKStandards-FINAL.pdf; and http://www.nevadaregistry.org/fb_files/InfantToddlerGuidelines.pdf 6.4.2 How early learning and guidelines are used CCDF funds cannot be used to develop or implement an assessment for children that: Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care provider ineligible to participate in the CCDF Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward or sanction for an individual provider Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing program effectiveness Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF (658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I); 98.15(a)(2)) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines are used. The Early Learning Guidelines and Pre-K Standards provide the guidance for the ECE workforce to establish appropriate outcomes for the children that they serve. The QRIS and licensing provide guidance to programs regarding the implementation of the guidelines and standards. Early Learning Guidelines were used as the basis for Nevada's I'm Ready for K! What I know about Nevada's Pre-K Standards and more: A booklet for my parents and teachers. This booklet contains all Nevada's early learning and developmental guidelines written from a child's voice. The booklet contains very specific skills that children will exhibit when they have mastered the standard area. This booklet is shared with all families on the Subsidy program, all early learning providers (including FFN providers), school district Pre-k programs, and all libraries across Nevada. 258 | P a g e 6.4.3 Measurable Indicators for early learning and developmental guidelines If quality funds are used to develop, maintain, or implement early learning and development guidelines, describe the measurable indicators that will be used to evaluate the state/territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services and the data on the extent to which the state/territory has met these measures (98.53(f)(3)). Nevada's early childhood educators rely on the Nevada Pre-K Content Standards to provide a framework and guidance for curriculum development. The Nevada Pre-K Content Standards were developed based on child development research and developmentally appropriate practices for 4 year-old children. Through the PDG B-5 grant, NDE worked with SRI Inc. to embark upon the beginning phases of standards revisions. Work for the next two years will focus on finalizing the standards revisions to resume statewide training and support to the ECE workforce. Director and Program Administrator: Director Perspective training are offered for ECE program directors and administrators to gain more comprehensive information on the use of the Pre-KStandards and Infant and Toddler Guidelines. In addition, they receive information and resources that include The Nevada Registry, T.E.A.C.H.\u00ae Early Childhood Nevada, TACSEI, Pre-K to K transitions and QRIS.This information provides program directors and administrators with the knowledge to promote professional development for their staff and to improve program quality and introduces them to other agencies that support their programs. Parent Education: The Parent Perspective training is offered and provided to parents about the use of standards.These trainings are available in English and Spanish and parents learn about the Nevada Pre-K Standards and developmentally appropriate strategies on how to support learning at home. They receive an overview of what typically developing 4-year-old children should know and be able to do before they enter kindergarten.They have an opportunity to participate in a variety of activities with their child based on the Nevada Pre-K Content Standards. Parent and family engagement activities are essential, and we recognize that parents are their child's first teacher. Supporting and helping families understand about school readiness skills with easily replicated activities helpsto foster the importance of the home school connection for their child. The Infant and Toddler Guidelines are available for parents as a frame of reference for their child's development. Supportive activities are included so parents can foster learning at home. Infants and toddlers grow and develop rapidly so it is important to mention that different milestones can occur at different times and stages in a child's development can change quickly. Parents receive a copy of the \"Ready for K\" book that provides detailed information about the Pre-K Standards and how they can track their child's development and mastery of new skills. For State Fiscal Year 2019/20 - WCSD Standards Office provided 120 trainings, equaling 458 hours, to 641 259 | P a g e participants. Those participants included center-based staff, family child care providers, FFN providers, after school staff, school district staff, and parents. They did 12 TA visits around standards. They provided 20 orientations (which is different than trainings) for 220 participants. They distributed 7,528 materials which included books, periodicals, packets and toys. 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high-quality child care (98.53). The quality activities should be aligned with a statewide or territory-wide assessment of the state's or territory's need to carry out such services and care. States and territories are required to report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1. In the CCDF Plan, the ACF 118, states and territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the 3-year period (658G(b); 98.16(j)). 2. In the annual expenditure report, the ACF-696, ACF will collect data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities. This report will be used to determine compliance with the required quality and infant and toddler spending requirements (658G(d)(1); 98.53(f)). 3. For each year of the Plan period, states and territories will submit a Quality Progress Report, the ACF 218, that will include a description of activities funded by quality expenditures and the measures used by the state/territory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory (658G(d); 98.53(f)). States and territories must fund efforts in at least one of the following 10 activities: Supporting the training and professional development of the child care workforce (Addressed in Section 6) Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines (Addressed in Section 6) Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating and improvement system or other systems of quality improvement for child care providers and services Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers Establishing or expanding a statewide system of child care resource and referral services Supporting compliance with state/territory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in section 5) Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the state/territory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children Supporting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation Supporting the development or adoption of high-quality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development 260 | P a g e Performing other activities to improve the quality of child care services, as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well- being, or kindergarten entry are possible Throughout this Plan, states and territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, quality set-aside funds, and will describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services for each expenditure (98.53(f)). These activities can benefit infants and toddlers through school-age populations, and all categories of care. It is important that while Lead Agencies have the flexibility to define \"high quality\" and develop strategies and standards to support their definition, Lead Agencies should consider how that definition and those strategies for different provider types reflect and acknowledge their unique differences and how quality varies in different settings, including family child care and small care settings as well as child care centers. This section covers the quality activities needs assessment, quality improvement activities, and indicators of progress for each of the activities undertaken in the state or territory. 7.1 Quality Activities Needs Assessment for Child Care Services 7.1.1 Assessment process and frequency of assessment Lead Agencies must invest in quality activities based on an assessment of the state/territory's needs to carry out those activities. Lead Agencies have the flexibility to design an assessment of their quality activities that best meet their needs, including how often they do the assessment. Describe your state/territory assessment process, including the frequency of assessment (658G(a)(1); 98.53(a)). A needs assessment was completed in order to develop the Nevada Early Childhood Advisory Council's (NECAC) strategic plan. As part of the assessment the following steps were completed: extensive interviewing of public and private leaders throughout Nevada, formation and facilitation of strategic planning working groups, and discussions with potential partners for each area of focus to determine interest and opportunities of involvement. The assessment established three overarching goals to strengthen Nevada's early childhood system. Next steps include the formation of work groups who are determining action steps for each goal. In addition, quality activities will be reviewed to ensure alignment with these goals. A needs assessment will be completed every four years to inform the revision of the strategic plan. 7.1.2 Assessment findings and identified quality improvement goals Describe the findings of the assessment and if any overarching goals for quality improvement were identified. If applicable, include a direct URL/website link for any available evaluation or research related to the findings. The goals identified: 1) Strengthen the complex system of early learning to provide every child and family with high quality education and development, 2) Ensure families have the support they want and need to nurture their children's early learning and development, and 261 | P a g e 3) Promote and support increased access to and the delivery of high quality, evidence-based health services for families with young children.

ARP grant plan is still being developed.264 | P a g e 7.3 Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) or Another System of Quality Improvement Lead Agencies may respond in this section based on other systems of quality improvement, even if not called a QRIS, as long as the other quality improvement system contains the elements of a QRIS. QRIS refers to a systematic framework for evaluating, improving, and communicating the level of quality in early childhood programs and contains five key elements: 1. Program standards 2. Supports to programs to improve quality 3. Financial incentives and supports 4. Quality assurance and monitoring 5. Outreach and consumer education 7.3.1 QRIS or another system of quality improvement Does your state/territory have a quality rating and improvement system or another system of quality improvement? [ ] a. No, the state/territory has no plans for QRIS development. If no, skip to 7.4.1. [ ] b. No, but the state/territory is in the QRIS development phase. If no, skip to 7.4.1. [x] c. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS operating statewide or territory-wide. Describe how the QRIS is administered (e.g., statewide or locally or through CCR&R entities) and any partners, and provide a link, if available. Nevada's QRIS is administered through the Nevada Department of Education, Office of Early Learning and Development. Nevada's QRIS works with multiple partners, including: Statewide CCR&R for coaching, University of Nevada, Cooperative Extension for Assessments, and Nevada Institute for Children's Research & Policy for evaluation. Two assessment tools are used to determine a program's QRIS rating the Environment Rating Scales (center and family home provider model) and the CLASS (district pre-k QRIS model.) An outside evaluator, UNLV Nevada Institute for Children's Research and Policy (NICRP), has been contracted to evaluate the impact of the star ratings on outcomes for children. We no longer use the CLASSS tool on the LEA (District) model or any of the QRIS models as an evaluation tool, it is used strictly as a coaching tool on all three models. (http://www.nvsilverstatestars.org/) http://www.nvsilverstatestars.org/ [ ] d. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS initiative operating as a pilot-test in a few localities or only a few levels but does not have a fully operating initiative on a statewide or territory-wide basis. Provide a link, if available. ? [ ] e. Yes, the state/territory has another system of quality improvement. Describe the other system of quality improvement and provide a link, if available. 7.3.2 QRIS or another system of quality improvement participation Indicate how providers participate in the state or territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement. a. Are providers required to participate in the QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply if response differs for different categories of care. 265 | P a g e [ ] i. Participation is voluntary. [x] ii. Participation is partially mandatory. For example, participation is mandatory for providers serving children receiving a subsidy, participation is mandatory for all licensed providers or participation is mandatory for programs serving children birth to age 5 receiving a subsidy. If checked, describe the relationship between QRIS participation and subsidy (e.g., minimum rating required, reimbursed at higher rates for achieving higher ratings, participation at any level). Participation in Nevada QRIS is mandatory for all licensed providers centers, family, and group facilities receiving subsidy. Mandatory participation began in 2016 and the full roll out /onboarding of all subsidy programs is ongoing in Nevada. It became mandatory for group and family childcare programs began in 2019. Nevada's QRIS is a 5-level (stars) rating system. Providers on subsidy with one star receive the state rate for reimbursement. Providers at 5- stars receive the 75th percentile rate. Providers at 2-stars receive the state rate plus an additional 25% of the difference between the state rate and the 75th percentile rate. Providers at 3-stars receive the state rate plus an additional 50% of the difference between the state rate and the 75th percentile rate. Providers at 4-stars receive the state rate plus an additional 75% of the difference between the state rate and the 75th percentile rate. All tiered reimbursements are then rounded up to the nearest dollar. Nevada is phasing in mandatory participation for providers serving children receiving subsidy. Priority has been given to programs with the highest number of children receiving subsidy. We have currently enrolled the top 79 subsidy providers. There are currently no minimum rating requirements for programs, however if they are not meeting QRIS goals they will no longer be allowed to provide services to children receiving subsidy. All participating QRIS programs are required to sign an MOA with required timelines and participation requirements. The requirements include a coaching cycle of 2 years and an updated star rating every 2 years. [ ] iii. Participation is required for all providers. b. Which types of settings or distinctive approaches to early childhood education and care participate in the state/territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply. [x] i. Licensed child care centers [x] ii. Licensed family child care homes [ ] iii. License-exempt providers [x] iv. Early Head Start programs [x] v. Head Start programs [x] vi. State Prekindergarten or preschool programs [x] vii. Local district-supported Prekindergarten programs [x] viii. Programs serving infants and toddlers [ ] ix. Programs serving school-age children [x] x. Faith-based settings [ ] xi. Tribally operated programs [ ] xiv. Other. Describe: N/A 266 | P a g e c. Describe how the Lead Agency's QRIS, or other system for improving quality, considers how quality may look different in the different types of provider settings which participate in the QRIS or other system of quality improvement. For instance, does the system of quality improvement consider what quality looks like in a family child care home with mixed-age groups vs. child care centers with separate age groups? Or are standards related to quality environments flexible enough to define quality in home-based environments, as well as child care center environments? The Nevada Silver State Stars QRIS greatly values the differences in program types. As such, we have 3 separate and unique QRIS models for Centers, Family Child Care and Local Education Agencies (Districts). Each model includes an environment rating scale assessment tool that is most appropriate for their setting. For example: Family childcare is assessed on the FCCERS (Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale) and classrooms in a childcare center are rated on ages of the children served in that room, either the Infant Toddler Environment Rating Scales (ITERS) or the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS). Each model also includes required criteria or quality indicators that are relevant and specific to their program type. 7.3.3 Identify how the state or territory supports and assesses the quality of child care providers. The Lead Agency may invest in the development, implementation, or enhancement of a tiered quality rating and improvement system for child care providers and services or another system of quality improvement. Note: If a Lead Agency decides to invest CCDF quality dollars in a QRIS, that agency can use the funding to assist in meeting consumer education requirements (98.33). Do the state/territory's quality improvement standards align with or have reciprocity with any of the following standards? [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes, check the type of alignment, if any, between the state/territory's quality standards and other standards. Check all that apply. [x] a. Programs that meet state/territory PreK standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between PreK programs and the quality improvement system). [x] b. Programs that meet federal Head Start Program Performance Standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between Head Start programs and the quality improvement system). [x] c. Programs that meet national accreditation standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, an alternative pathway exists to meeting the standards). [ ] d. Programs that meet all or part of state/territory school-age quality standards. [ ] e. Other. Describe: N/A 7.3.4 Link between quality standards and licensing requirements Do the state/territory's quality standards build on its licensing requirements and other regulatory requirements? 267 | P a g e [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes, check any links between the state/territory's quality standards and licensing requirements. [x] a. Requires that a provider meet basic licensing requirements to qualify for the base level of the QRIS. [ ] b. Embeds licensing into the QRIS. [ ] c. State/territory license is a \"rated\" license. [ ] d. Other. Describe: N/A 7.3.5 Financial or other incentives through QRIS or another quality improvement system Does the state/territory provide financial incentives and other supports designed to expand the full diversity of child care options and help child care providers improve the quality of services that are provided through the QRIS or another system of quality improvement. [ ] No [x] Yes. If yes, check all that apply. a. If yes, indicate in the table below which categories of care receive this support.

Other: N/A 7.3.6 Measurable indicators of progress relevant to Subsection 7.3 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.3 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. Indicators of Progress for QRIS: Assessment scales - assessment scores and scale of indicators, for example group size and ratio, percentage of children screened, membership in the perfessional registry (NV Registry). Also, the star rating acheived reflects the impact of coaching and support by QRIS. Results: 51.5% of QRIS participating programs achieved between 3 and 5 star levels after coaching. Nevada has surpasssed our QRIS State Plan goal for 30% of participating providers to achieve either 4 or 5 stars; 33% of providers achieved 4 or 5 stars. The next goal is to have 60% of all programs meet between 3 and 5 star ratings. 7.4 Improving the Supply and Quality of Child Care Programs and Services for Infants and Toddlers 269 | P a g e Lead Agencies are required to spend 3 percent of their total CCDF expenditures on activities to improve the supply and quality of their infant and toddler care. This is in addition to the general quality set-aside requirement. Lead Agencies are encouraged to use the required needs assessment to systematically review and improve the overall quality of care that infants and toddlers receive, the systems in place or needed to support and enhance the quality of infant and toddler providers, the capacity of the infant and toddler workforce to meet the unique needs of very young children, and the methods in place to increase the proportion of infants and toddlers in higher quality care, including any partnerships or coordination with Early Head Start and IDEA Part C programs. 7.4.1 Activities to improve supply and quality of infant and toddler care Identify and describe the activities that are being implemented by the state/territory to improve the supply (see also section 4) and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers and check which of the activities are available to each provider type. [ ] a. Establishing or expanding high-quality community- or neighborhood-based family and child development centers. These centers can serve as resources to child care providers to improve the quality of early childhood services for infants and toddlers from low- income families and to improve eligible child care providers' capacity to offer high-quality, age-appropriate care to infants and toddlers from low-income families.

CCDP will collect data on number of infants/toddlers being served before and after implementation of slot agreements; additionally, CCDP will track the number of infants/toddlers alloted nonstandard hour slots by providers. Providers will be surveyed on how the slot funding and support have impacted their business and their families. 7.5 Child Care Resource and Referral A Lead Agency may expend funds to establish, expand, or maintain a statewide system of child care resource and referral services (98.53(a)(5)). It can be coordinated, to the extent determined appropriate by the Lead Agency, by a statewide public or private non-profit, community-based, or regionally based lead child care resource and referral organization (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii)). This effort may include activities done by local or regional child care and resource referral agencies, as discussed in section 1.7. 7.5.1 Child care resource and referral agencies' services What are the services provided by the local or regional child care and resource and referral agencies? In Nevada, two agencies are responsible for CCR&R. The Children's Cabinet is responsible for CCR&R in the north and rural areas, and the Urban League is responsible for CCR&R in the south. They assist with development of CCDP policy and procedures, and resources to families and providers in terms of education and trainings, annual monitoring of our Family Friend and Neighbor Providers as well as our Out of School Time 274 | P a g e programs (like the Boys and Girls Clubs). They also conduct developmental screenings for children, support providers in meeting the requirements of the of the program, and provide parents with tools for finding quality child care. 7.5.2 Measurable indicators of progress relevant to Subsection 7.5 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.5 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. Accreditation support is offered to child care centers and family home providers who have achieved a four-star QRIS rating. Measurement of progress: # of centers and family home providers who achieve national accreditation (new) and # of centers and family home providers maintain national accreditation (renewal. The latest numbers are that there are 40 childcare centers and 2 family childcare centers for a total of 42 programs nationally accredited. It is the belief that all of these have been renewals in this past year. 7.6 Facilitating Compliance with State Standards 7.6.1 Activities to facilitate provider compliance with health and safety requirements What activities does your state/territory fund with CCDF quality funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with state/territory health and safety requirements? These requirements may be related to inspections, monitoring, training, compliance with health and safety standards, and with state/territory licensing standards as outlined in Section 5. Describe: CCDF funds all of our State Child Care Licensing's activities, including all licensing staff and operating costs, all orientations, trainings, inspections for any applicable providers, and any other assoicated costs toward compliance with health and safety standards under State Licensing. Additonally, CCDF funds our CCR&Rs that conduct home visits for FFN providers and Out of Schol Time providers (privately owned before and after school programs). CCDF also funds child care licensing positions at Washoe County Human Services Agency/WC Child Care Licensing. 7.6.2 Financial assistance to support complying with minimum health and safety requirements Does the state/territory provide financial assistance to support child care providers in complying with minimum health and safety requirements?

To align with the KEA, the Brigance is also required for children receiving subsidy services in family, friend, and neighbor care as well as a requirement of the QRIS. Results of the Brigance are being collected in the Curriculum Associates Online Management System. In addition, children receiving subsidy will be entered into Infinite Campus which is Nevada's student information system. They will be receiving their student unique identifier that will be used through grade 12. COVID-19 Activities: Quality funds were used to establish an emergency stipend for COVID related supplies for child care providers. - CARES Act funds were used to establish a competitive grant program to cover operating costs of child care providers. The grant application requires the submission of an annual budget, a \"steps-to-sustainability\" plan, and a marketing plan to be evaluated by a Grant Evaluation Committee established from a pool of subject matter experts. Also, CRRSA and ARP funds will be used to provide grants to child care providers to assist with operation costs. - The CRRSA funds are earmarked for all licensed FCCs and Centers in Nevada aside from Head Start as well as earmarked for subsidized Out of School Time programs. The grants cover 2 months of operating costs at 75% capacity based on the Simon Workman calculator. The application consists of questions to gather data; the grant is not competitive. Any eligible providers that do not complete an application will be contacted and provided TA. - The ARP grant process is still being developed. 8 Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability Program integrity and accountability activities are integral to the effective administration of the CCDF program. Lead Agencies are required to describe in their Plan effective internal controls that ensure integrity and accountability while maintaining the continuity of services (98.16(cc)). These accountability measures should address reducing fraud, waste, and abuse, including program violations and administrative errors. This section includes topics on internal controls to ensure integrity and accountability and processes in place to investigate and recover fraudulent payments and to impose sanctions on clients or providers in response to fraud. Respondents should consider how fiscal controls, program integrity, and accountability apply to: Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) within the Lead Agency's various divisions that administer or carry out the various aspects of CCDF MOUs, grants, or contracts to other state agencies that administer or carry out various aspects of 279 | P a g e CCDF Grants or contracts to other organizations that administer or carry out various aspects of CCDF, such as professional development and family engagement activities Internal processes for conducting child care provider subsidy 8.1 Internal Controls and Accountability Measures to Help Ensure Program Integrity 8.1.1 Fiscal management practices Lead Agencies must ensure the integrity of the use of funds through sound fiscal management and must ensure that financial practices are in place (98.68 (a)(1)). Describe the processes in place for the Lead Agency to ensure sound fiscal management practices for all expenditures of CCDF funds. Check all that apply: [x] a. Verifying and processing billing records to ensure timely payments to providers. Describe: At the Cabinet and Urban League level, timesheets are received and placed in date stamp order. The billing is reviewed for accuracy and placed in a billing log and given a number to be processed. Staff then send the Request for Reimbursement sheets to CCDP at DWSS. CCDP then analyzes and reconciles each RFR to ensure accuracy of formulas, that spending is toward allowable costs and then sends the document to the DWSS's Fiscal team to analyze again and move to the process of drawing down the funds - this process allows providers to be reimbursed within the 30-business day deadline while still ensuring integrity of the program. [x] b. Fiscal oversight of grants and contracts. Describe: Every request for funds must have supporting documentation that is specific to the scope of work outlined in the agreement. Funds are monitored against spending authority and any requests for budget modification must be in writing and the modification must be related to achieving the scope of work. The Lead Agency maintains fiscal oversight of subgrants and contracts by monitoring all subgrants and contracts to ensure federal and state regulations are adhered to and to ensure outcomes are met by the contractor or subrecipient. The grants and contracts are monitored by CCDP fical staff, and DWSS fiscal staff for accuate billing. The Child Care and Development Program monitors the Subsidy/Eligibility CCR&R agencies, Licensing agencies (State and Washoe) and the Department of Ed (Quality) annually to assess policy implementation and ensure integrity of the program: Internal Controls Each agency is required to develop written procedures to carry out its systems of internal accounting and administrative control including: A plan of organization, which provides for the segregation of duties appropriate to safeguard the assets of the agency; A plan which limits access to assets of the agency to persons who need the assets to perform their assigned duties; Procedures for authorizations and record keeping which effectively control accounting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; A system of practices to be followed in the performance of the duties and functions of each 280 | P a g e agency; An effective system of internal review. The purpose of internal control is to help ensure that the following objectives are being achieved: Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; Reliability of financial reporting; and Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. An effective internal control system consists of five standards: Control Environment: Management and employees must establish and maintain an environment throughout the organization that sets a positive and supportive attitude toward internal control and conscientious management. Risk Assessment: Internal control must provide for an assessment of the risks the agency faces both external and internal sources. Control Activities: Policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms implemented by management to address all levels and all functions of an agency covering operational, financial reporting, and compliance issues. Information and Communication: Information should be recorded and communicated to management and others within the agency who need it and in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. Monitoring: Internal control monitoring must assess the quality of performance overtime and ensure that the audit findings and other issues are promptly resolved. Each Agency must complete a Self Assessment Questionnaire: Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) The SAQ is a tool to be used by an agency to: Develop fiscal and administrative controls. Evaluate the adequacy of existing procedures, both as written and actually performed. Ensure that written procedures and actual practices are the same. Each agency should review its procedures annually to ensure compliance with the minimal internal control standards as set forth in this SAQ. By completing the SAQ, an agency can identify potential internal weaknesses. Each year's SAQ should be reviewed and approved by management and the original maintained in the agency's files for audit purposes. The SAQ is designed so that a No response indicates an area of concern, which may require corrective action in the form of: 281 | P a g e Developing new or revised procedures to correct the deficiencies found; or Implementing a compensating control. [x]c. Tracking systems to ensure reasonable and allowable costs. Describe: DWSS's internal Quality Control team completes reviews through desk audits to ensure proper payment is being made.

This has resulted in less burden for families in providing verifications that can be accessed through these systems. Additionally, this results in less chance of misinformation from families regarding income or participation in other programs. [ ] ii. Run system reports that flag errors (include types). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: NA [x] iii. Review enrollment documents and attendance or billing records. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Provider files and timesheets are audited by staff on a regular basis making sure all documents are current. Billing is doublechecked by matching entered time and dates against system generated queue reports. Signatures are verified when needed by matching to client files. Requests for reimbursement are analyzed through three tiers of reviewers; first at the Cabinet and Urban League level, then CCDP, then DWSS fiscal. This results in less errors in requests for reimbursement and enables case managers to identify when a provider may be fraudulently signing timesheets. 288 | P a g e [x] iv. Conduct supervisory staff reviews or quality assurance reviews. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Managers, Supervisors and QA staff do ongoing audits to ensure that all information in files are accurate and that all systems were checked for correct information. Quality Assurance Results in SFY21 (69 randomly pulled cases were reviewed): The percentage of cases with errors was 1.45%; the percentage of cases with improper payments was 1.45%; the percentage of the total amount of payments for the sampled cases that are improper payments was 0.00%; the average amount of improper payments was $0.00; the estimated annual amount of improper payments was $0.00 [x] v. Audit provider records. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Ongoing reviews of provider and client files and documents are done. Licensed providers must keep licenses current and submit copies to the program. Provider billing documents are reviewed upon receipt and when being processed.

Describe the activities and the results of these activities: During initial training, subsidy eligibility staff are introduced to the Quality Assurance Department and are given a detailed overview of what the Quality Assurance Department does. During this training, staff are trained on what to look for, or red flags while processing and when and how to send cases over to the QA department for review. Internal audits are also done to prevent fraud and IPV's. 289 | P a g e [x] vii. Other. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: The I&R Unit is principally responsible for activities associated with Child Care and Development Program penalties of an accused individual suspected of program rule violations. However, any employee of the Division or the Child Care Staff may initiate penalty/disqualification action against an accused individual by completing Form 6021- AF, Administrative Disqualification/ Penalty Waiver. Staff initiating a penalty action must complete all required administrative penalty paperwork and be prepared to act in the capacity of a witness in front of the hearings officer. The Division's Central Office Investigations & Recovery (I&R) Unit maintains a central repository for all Nevada Child Care and Development Program IPVs. Before completion or submittal of Form 6021-AF, the worker must check for prior disqualifications by sending an email to welfinvest@dwss.nv.gov (Welfare Investigations) to ensure the appropriate penalty period is requested. The email must specify the program type (e.g., Child Care), last name, first name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and any alias of the accused individual. If past IPV penalties are identified, the I&R worker shall obtain a copy of the previous IPV waiver, hearing decision or criminal court disposition. These documents must be attached to the new IPV paperwork (Form 6021-AF) to substantiate pursuit of enhanced penalties. The IPV waiver may be used to address an accused individual's program violations without prior submittal of the 6021-AF to the Hearing Unit. This permits accused individual acceptance of IPV penalty without the formality of the actual hearing. If this method is used, the accused individual must also sign the Rights of the Accused and Waiver of Right to Administrative Disqualification Hearing/Acceptance of Penalty section of Form 6021-AF acknowledging their understanding of their rights under program laws, regulation and rules. Note: If a signed IPV waiver is obtained, penalties must not be imposed until the case manager has forwarded the signed waiver, via referral to IRIS, and received notification from I&R staff. No further administrative appeal procedure exists after an accused individual waives his/her right to an administrative disqualification hearing and a disqualification penalty has been imposed. The accused individual, however, is entitled to seek relief in a court having appropriate jurisdiction. To eliminate confusion and duplication of effort, all administrative penalty/disqualification requests and signed IPV waivers must be sent to the I&R Unit assigned responsibility for the submitting office. The approval of the I&R supervisor or their designee is mandatory to ensure prior penalty occurrences have been checked and case manager actions are not duplicating the actions of I&R staff. If a signed IPV Waiver or judgment of conviction is obtained, penalties shall not be imposed until the case manager has received notification from I&R staff. For open cases, penalties are imposed against current benefits as soon as administratively possible after the signed Waiver is approved by the designated I&R staff or receipt of the hearing officer's penalty order or criminal court JOC and notification is received from I&R staff. Penalties will continue for the ordered or applicable period of time. Worker inability to affect benefits because of computer programming restriction does not negate the case manager's ability to impose the full penalty period. For closed cases, the penalties will be imposed immediately after the signed waiver is approved by the designated I&R staff or, receipt of the hearing officer's penalty order or a criminal court JOC and notification is received from I&R staff. Penalties will continue for the ordered period of time. 290 | P a g e b.

Quality Assurance Results in SFY21 (69 randomly pulled cases were reviewed): The percentage of cases with errors was 1.45%; the percentage of cases with improper payments was 1.45%; the percentage of the total amount of payments for the sampled cases that are improper payments was 0.00%; the average amount of improper payments was $0.00; the estimated annual amount of improper payments was $0.00 291 | P a g e [x] v. Audit provider records. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Ongoing reviews of provider files and documents are done. Licensed providers must keep licenses current and submit copies to the program. Provider billing documents are reviewed upon receipt and when being processed. This ensures documents are completed accurately and signatures are valid. [x] vi. Train staff on policy and/or audits. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: During initial training, subsidy eligibility staff are introduced to the Quality Assurance Department and are given a detailed overview of what the Quality Assurance Department does. During this training, staff are trained on what to look for, or red flags while processing and when and how to send cases over to the QA department for review. Internal audits are also done to prevent fraud and IPV's. 292 | P a g e [x] vii. Other. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: The I&R Unit is principally responsible for activities associated with Child Care and Development Program penalties of an accused individual suspected of program rule violations. However, any employee of the Division or the Child Care Staff may initiate penalty/disqualification action against an accused individual by completing Form 6021- AF, Administrative Disqualification/ Penalty Waiver. Staff initiating a penalty action must complete all required administrative penalty paperwork and be prepared to act in the capacity of a witness in front of the hearings officer. The Division's Central Office Investigations & Recovery (I&R) Unit maintains a central repository for all Nevada Child Care and Development Program IPVs. Before completion or submittal of Form 6021-AF, the worker must check for prior disqualifications by sending an email to welfinvest@dwss.nv.gov (Welfare Investigations) to ensure the appropriate penalty period is requested. The email must specify the program type (e.g., Child Care), last name, first name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and any alias of the accused individual. If past IPV penalties are identified, the I&R worker shall obtain a copy of the previous IPV waiver, hearing decision or criminal court disposition. These documents must be attached to the new IPV paperwork (Form 6021-AF) to substantiate pursuit of enhanced penalties. The IPV waiver may be used to address an accused individual's program violations without prior submittal of the 6021-AF to the Hearing Unit. This permits accused individual acceptance of IPV penalty without the formality of the actual hearing. If this method is used, the accused individual must also sign the Rights of the Accused and Waiver of Right to Administrative Disqualification Hearing/Acceptance of Penalty section of Form 6021-AF acknowledging their understanding of their rights under program laws, regulation and rules. Note: If a signed IPV waiver is obtained, penalties must not be imposed until the case manager has forwarded the signed waiver, via referral to IRIS, and received notification from I&R staff. No further administrative appeal procedure exists after an accused individual waives his/her right to an administrative disqualification hearing and a disqualification penalty has been imposed. The accused individual, however, is entitled to seek relief in a court having appropriate jurisdiction. To eliminate confusion and duplication of effort, all administrative penalty/disqualification requests and signed IPV waivers must be sent to the I&R Unit assigned responsibility for the submitting office. The approval of the I&R supervisor or their designee is mandatory to ensure prior penalty occurrences have been checked and case manager actions are not duplicating the actions of I&R staff. If a signed IPV Waiver or judgment of conviction is obtained, penalties shall not be imposed until the case manager has received notification from I&R staff. For open cases, penalties are imposed against current benefits as soon as administratively possible after the signed Waiver is approved by the designated I&R staff or receipt of the hearing officer's penalty order or criminal court JOC and notification is received from I&R staff. Penalties will continue for the ordered or applicable period of time. Worker inability to affect benefits because of computer programming restriction does not negate the case manager's ability to impose the full penalty period. For closed cases, the penalties will be imposed immediately after the signed waiver is approved by the designated I&R staff or, receipt of the hearing officer's penalty order or a criminal court JOC and notification is received from I&R staff. Penalties will continue for the ordered period of time. 293 | P a g e c.

Describe the activities and the results of these activities: DWSS allows access to our TANF/SNAP/Medicaid systems, Nomads and Amps, as well as ANSRS and Prism for the Urban League and the Children's Cabinet to help identify information/countable income that was not reported at the time of applying for services. This has resulted in less burden for families in providing verifications that can be accessed through these systems. Additionally, this results in less chance of misinformation from families regarding income or participation in other programs. [ ] ii. Run system reports that flag errors (include types). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: NA [x] iii. Review enrollment documents and attendance or billing records. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Provider files and timesheets are audited by staff on a regular basis making sure all documents are current. Billing is doublechecked by matching entered time and dates against system generated queue reports. Signatures are verified when needed by matching to client files. Requests for reimbursement are analyzed through three tiers of reviewers; first at the Cabinet and Urban League level, then CCDP, then DWSS fiscal. This results in less errors in requests for reimbursement and enables case managers to identify when a provider may be fraudulently signing timesheets. [x] iv.

Identify what agency is responsible for pursuing fraud and overpayments (e.g. State Office of the Inspector General, State Attorney). The DWSS Investigations and Recovery (I&R) unit is responsible for pursuing fraud and overpayments for clients and providers. The CCR&R entities are responsible for calculating overpayments associated with the Child Care Subsidy program. b. Check and describe all activities, including the results of such activity, that the Lead Agency uses to investigate and recover improper payments due to fraud. Include in the description how each activity assists in the investigation and recovery of improper payment due to fraud or intentional program violations. Activities can include, but are not limited to, the following: [x] i. Require recovery after a minimum dollar amount of an improper payment and identify the minimum dollar amount. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: $0.00 [x]ii. Coordinate with and refer to the other state/territory agencies (e.g., state/territory collection agency, law enforcement agency). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League do an internal review and then refers the case to state I&R. The CCRR agency collects provider overpayments through the retention of future payments for active providers. The DWSS I&R unit will pursue collection from clients and termed providers either directly (if client makes and keeps a payment arrangement) and/or may take other actions, such as obtaining a court summary judgement ( $5000 through the Deputy AG's office) to garnish wages and/or may use an outside collections agency to recoup debts if no payment is made within 180 days of a judgement (I&R manual section 403.4). [x] iii. Recover through repayment plans. Describe the activities and the results of these activities The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League create a repayment plan with the provider and withholds a portion of the child care reimbursement on each payment until the payment is received in full. Clients receive a Notification of Debt and Debt Repayment Plan notice when an overpayment is calculated. This document allows them to request repayment over a period of time (up to 36 months, I&R manual 405), rather than through a lump sum payment. [x]iv. Reduce payments in subsequent months. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: The Children's Cabinet and the Urban League reduce payment if the provider desires as part of the payment plan. Active Child Care providers with an overpayment may have payments reduced in future months to repay the debt. Providers are notified of the debt and may have debt collected over more than one payment if taking the lump sum would create a hardship for the provider. If collection can not be made through the reduction in payment, the debt is set to DWSS I&R for collection through other methods. [x] v. Recover through state/territory tax intercepts. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: (I&R manual section 415) 297 | P a g e The Treasury Offset Program (TOP) allows money to be intercepted from federal sources (e.g., IRS tax refund and Social Security benefits, etc.) and applied against delinquent SNAP claims. Claims eligible for TOP collection include: Inadvertent household errors; Intentional Program Violation errors; and Agency errors DIVISION OF WELFARE AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INVESTIGATIONS AND RECOVERY POLICY MANUAL Section 415 MTL 1/11 1 Jan 11 Eligible claims must be referred to TOP when they are at least 180 days delinquent and meet the following criteria: at least the minimum amount prescribed by TOP, which is currently $25.00; not included under an automatic stay due to bankruptcy; not currently under litigation or review; not currently being collected through allotment reduction; not currently under a repayment plan approved by the agency; and at least one responsible person has a valid SSN (pseudo numbers may not be submitted to TOP) When claims meet the criteria as outlined above, the I&R worker must designate the case for TOP intercept by marking the TREASURY INTRCPT flag and inputting the social security number of the responsible persons in the TRS UNT RESP PRSN field on the DEBT details screen in NOMADS. 60-Day Notice Due Process: y informs the debtor their claim is being referred to TOP unless action is taken; allows the debtor the opportunity to inspect and receive copies of the Division's records with respect to the claim; allows the debtor the opportunity to review the Division's determination of the claim and the opportunity to present evidence that all or part of the claim is not past-due or legally enforceable; allows the debtor an opportunity to enter into an acceptable repayment agreement. If the debtor signs and returns the agreement within the due process timeframe, the claim will not be submitted to TOP. However, failure to abide by the terms of the agreement may result in the claim being referred to TOP; and informs the debtor that fees may be added to the claim amount. The request for review must be made in writing within the 60-day notification period to avoid the claim from being sent to TOP. The agency has thirty (30) days to review the case and inform the debtor of the decision in writing. The agency must also inform the debtor of the intent to refer to TOP if the decision is not in favor of the debtor and the debtor's right for an FNS review. When TOP notices are sent to the I&R offices, a 298 | P a g e copy of the notice is to be placed in the claim file and may be used to update the debtor's mailing address in NOMADS. [x]vi. Recover through other means.

N/A. the Lead Agency does not recover misspent funds due to agency errors. [x] ii. Require recovery after a minimum dollar amount of an improper payment and identify the minimum dollar amount. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: CCDP Manual section 761 requires the program staff to calculate an overpayment when it is 301 | P a g e determined that an individual, household or business received benefits they were not eligible to receive. Individuals who owe money are required to repay the program. For clients, the calculated overpayment is sent to the DWSS Investigations & Recovery department for collection activities; for provider overpayments, if the provider is active, the overpayment is recouped through the retention of one or more future payments. For inactive providers, the debtor file is created and sent to DWSS I&R for collection as with clients. The threshold for collection is $125 (per I&R manual section 306.2). Claims are determined through a review of program records by the Child Care Contractor. The claim is the difference between what they received as a benefit minus what they were entitled to received if the individual or business had reported correctly. Claims can be calculated for up to 3 years back from the date of discovery if there is sufficient evidence to substantiate that the overpayment exists. A debtor file is created which provides the evidence of the claim, applicable policies used to determine the claim exists and documents showing how the claim was calculated by the program. The program sends a Notification of Debt and Debt Repayment notice to the client informing them of the overpayment. The Debt Repayment notice allows them to request a repayment plan if the debt cannot be paid in full. These forms are not used for active providers; for the active provider, the overpayment is sent to the Child Care Contractor's payment department for retention of future reimbursements until the debt can be collected in full. The DWSS I&R department is responsible for the collection of debt activities for all Welfare programs, to include Child Care Program clients and inactive providers. [x] iii. Coordinate with and refer to the other state/territory agencies (e.g., state/territory collection agency, law enforcement agency). Describe the activities and the results of these activities: All claims must be calculated by the Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) agency within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of all necessary collateral information. Prior to initiating the calculation process, the CCR&R agency must ensure they possess credible evidence, which clearly substantiates, verifies, or confirms the client received benefits they were not entitled to for a specific period of time. CCR&Rs will coordinate with the Chief of Child Care to ensure the claim is calculated within 60 days and all necessary documentation is completed and then forwarded to I&R. The Child Care Chief must be CC'd when the claim calculation is returned to I&R by the CCR&R agency for tracking purposes. [x] iv. Recover through repayment plans. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: Clients can request a repayment plan if payment of the full debt in a lumpsum payment would be a hardship. The amount of the repayment in installments is determined by dividing the total owed by 36 months to determine the minimum monthly payment. The minimum acceptable monthly payment is set at $25 unless otherwise approved by DWSS I&R. Clients must sign the Debt Repayment form indicating the minimum amount to be paid by which date each month. If the client fails to meet the payment amount and frequency of the repayment agreement, debts may be collected through other methods. [x] v. Reduce payments in subsequent months. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: For the Child Care Program, active provider payments are reduced for the collection of owed debts. This is done by creating a negative adjustment to offset the payment owed in one ore more months until the debt is fully [x] vi. Recover through state/territory tax intercepts. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: 302 | P a g e DWSS I&R makes several attempts to collect overpayments directly from the client. An initial Notification of Debt/First Demand Letter is sent to the debtor informing them of the overpayment. If the client makes payment in full or sets up a repayment agreement and makes their scheduled payment, no additional notifications are sent (I&R Manual 403.2). If the debt becomes delinquent, or the client fails to respond to the initial notice within 30 days, a Final Demand notice will be sent. If the client fails to respond after the Final Notice, the DWSS I&R staff may complete and mail a Notice of Court Filing if the debt exceeds the debt threshold of $125 and the individual is still living in Nevada, and possesses the ability to pay. After sending the Notice of Court Filing, the I&R wait 10 days for response from the debtor. If no response, then I&R staff will: 1) prepare a case for submission to Small Claims Court of the amount is under $5000, or 2) submit the debt to the Deputy Attorney General of Nevada if the amount exceeds $5000. Once a summary judgement is made, the DWSS I&R team can pursue repayment through wage garnishment or other means. [x] vii. Recover through other means. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: DWSS may pursue claims collection through the use of a Collection Agency if the claim cannot be collected through other means. The claim must be at least $25, must be delinquent 90 days or more, is unable to be collected through intercept of funds (I&R MS 414.1). [x] viii. Establish a unit to investigate and collect improper payments and describe the composition of the unit. Describe the activities and the results of these activities: The Las Vegas Urban League and The Children's Cabinet work directly with the Lead Agency and the DWSS internal Investigations and Recovery Unit to establish debts and repayment of incorrect payments, both intentional and unintentionally, by recipients and Investigations & Recovery staff (I&R) use collateral sources to secure factual information and/or evidence to determine violator intent and program consequence. The DWSS Quality Control department conducts monthly audits of program records to determine if contractors correctly apply policies in determining eligibility and issuing provider payments. When errors are identified which are classified as a contactor error, the total error amount is calculated, and if it is an underpayment, the contractor must adjust the calculation of benefits. If it is an overpayment, the agency must identify corrective actions that will be put into place to prevent future errors. Contractors are required to maintain a 95% policy adherence rate through annual reviews or further corrective actions will be taken by the Lead Agency to address the errors (e.g. providing formal training in targeted policy areas).

These waivers will be considered \"extraordinary circumstance waivers\" to provide relief from the timeline for completing the MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology and the narrow cost analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. These waivers are limited to a one-year period. Approval of these waiver requests is subject to and contingent on OCC review and approval of responses in Section 4, questions 4.2.1 and 4.2.5. To submit a Market Rate Survey (MRS) or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology or a Narrow Cost Analysis waiver, complete the form below. Check and describe each provision for which the Lead Agency is requesting a time-limited waiver extension.

Describe the provision (MRS or ACF pre-approved alternative methodology) from which the state/territory seeks relief. Include the reason why the Lead Agency is seeking relief from this provision due to this extraordinary circumstance. The Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services is requesting a waiver from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Child Care (OCC) from Nevada's compliance with the regulatory section specified below: Unmet requirement: \u00a798.45 Equal Access The State seeks relief from the MRS for 2021 due to the pandemic and its effects on child care, staff, enrollment/attendance, and rates. Nevada does not need a waiver for 4.1.3b because we have the data: Currenlty, the subsidy program is serving 61% of licensed child care providers in Nevada. Nevada is requesting a waiver for 4.4.1c to conduct an analysis of Nevada's current fee cap ($40 annual fee cap), what providers in Nevada currently charge for the annual fee, and the out-of-pocket expense or \"gap\" between the two to determine if the fee cap should be raised to reduce inequity. Nevada is requesting a waiver for 4.5.2 to gather data through an Ad Hoc request from our Nevada Child Care System Database in comparison to the current price of care, to analyze the difference, by provider type, between the reimbursement rate and the price of care, statewide. 305 | P a g e 2. Describe how a waiver of the provision will, by itself, improve the delivery of child care services for children. Allowing the State a waiver for the Market Rate Survey will give Nevada child care providers a chance to recover from the effects of the pandemic and for their businesses to be at least somewhat recovered from the impact, prior to submitting their price of care for assessment. This will result in improved reliability of the true price of care providers have established post-pandemic, taking into account any changes they may have implemented, included any chnages in staffing, supplies, or other needs that may result in a change in price of care. 3. Certify and describe how the health, safety, and well-being of children served through assistance received through CCDF will not be compromised as a result of the waiver. CCDP can ensure that the health, safety, and well-being of children served through assistance received through CCDF will not be compromised as a result of the waiver, due to the program's policy of payments based on enrollment rather than attendance for most children receiving subsidy, and due to the CRRSA/ARP planning which will positively impact wages, subsidy, capacity, in addition to health and safety. [x] Appendix A.2: The Narrow Cost Analysis (See related question 4.2.5.) 1. Describe the provision (Narrow Cost Analysis) from which the state/territory seeks relief. Include the reason why in these extraordinary circumstances, the Lead Agency is seeking relief from this provision. The Nevada Division of Welfare and Supportive Services is requesting a waiver from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Child Care (OCC) from Nevada's compliance with the regulatory section specified below: Unmet requirement: \u00a798.45 Equal Access The State seeks relief from completing a Narrow Cost Analysis due to the pandemic and its effects on child care, staff, enrollment/attendance, and rates. CCDP is working on gathering this data through an Ad Hoc request from our Nevada Child Care System Database, to reflect the difference, by provider type, between the reimbursement rate statewide as compared to the most current data on market rate to assess the gap. 2. Describe how a waiver of the provision will, by itself, improve the delivery of child 306 | P a g e care services for children. Allowing the State a waiver will give the State a chance to conduct a cost analysis once child care providers are able to report rates which more accurately align with the true cost of care (which are sufficient to enable them to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements). Additionally, this will allow the state time to procure a consultant to conduct an in-depth cost modeling analysis to determine the fiscal impact of restructuring Nevada's subsidy reimbursement system to reflect the cost of care versus utilization of the market rate survey, which has been shown to perpetuate inequities in low-income communities where markets cannot support the true cost of high quality care. CCDP has earmarked funds to hire a contractor to complete a cost analysis on the estimated cost of care, including relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, and age of child. CCDP will include the cost of child care providers' implementation of health, safety, quality and staffing requirements in the RFP for the contractor. CCDP will address the gap between costs incurred by child care providers and the Lead Agency's payment rates based on findings from the narrow cost analysis. 3. Certify and describe how the health, safety, and well-being of children served through assistance received through CCDF will not be compromised as a result of the waiver. CCDP can ensure that the health, safety, and well-being of children served through assistance received through CCDF will not be compromised as a result of the waiver, due to the program's policy of payments based on enrollment rather than attendance for most children receiving subsidy, and due to the CRRSA/ARP planning which will positively impact wages, subsidy, capacity, in addition to health and safety.
