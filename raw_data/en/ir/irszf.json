Nonclinical GLP-compliant studies in Wistar Han rats were initiated to assess the local tolerance, systemic toxicity, and immune response to four mRNA vaccine candidates encoding immunogens derived from the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Vaccine candidates were administered intramuscularly once weekly for three doses at 30 and/or 100 \u00b5g followed by a 3-week recovery period. Clinical pathology findings included higher white blood cell counts and acute phase reactant concentrations, lower platelet and reticulocyte counts, and lower RBC parameters. Microscopically, there was increased cellularity (lymphocytes) in the lymph nodes and spleen, increased hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen, acute inflammation and edema at the injection site, and minimal hepatocellular vacuolation. These findings were generally attributed to the anticipated immune and inflammatory responses to the vaccines, except for hepatocyte vacuolation, which was interpreted to reflect hepatocyte LNP lipid uptake, was similar between candidates and resolved or partially recovered at the end of the recovery phase. These studies demonstrated safety and tolerability in rats, supporting SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine clinical development.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-11", "cleaned_text": "Pandemic COVID-19 Vaccine\u2014Demonstrating the Suitability of a Platform Approach for mRNA This rapid vaccine generation was the result of advances in ribonucleic acid (RNA) and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology allowing for the development of RNA-based vaccines [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00417), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00417)]. The ease of development and manufacture of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines is improved over traditional recombinant protein-based vaccines and lacks the human health risks associated with manufacture of virus for inactivated or modified live viral vaccines [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00417), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00417)]. Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines are not infectious and may be given to people who cannot be administered a live virus vaccine, such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00417)]. Further, RNA does not integrate into the host genome, and it is metabolized and eliminated by the body's natural mechanisms [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00417)]. Although there were no licensed vaccines using this modality at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA-based technologies had been evaluated in an assortment of clinical trials for both prophylactic and therapeutic indications without evidence of safety concerns, and as of August 2022, two LNP-mRNA vaccines have been approved for licensure [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00417), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00417), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00417), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00417)]. Therefore, the LNP-mRNA vaccines, as well as mRNA-based technologies, present a valid platform for future indications with a demonstrated potential for fast-track development. [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417)]. RNA is a highly versatile molecule that can be manufactured using a cell-free in vitro transcription process; the molecule can be quickly modified to express almost any protein antigen of interest, making it highly adaptable for use in developing vaccines against emerging pathogens [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00417)]. Modifications to the 5 cap structure, 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), poly-A tail, and the coding sequence may increase both the mRNA half-life and efficiency of target protein translation [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00417), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00417)]. The inclusion of nucleoside analogs, such as 1-methyl-pseudouridine in place of uridine, may also decrease targeted degradation and reduce RNA-mediated innate immune responses that may limit tolerability in humans [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00417), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00417)]. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00417)]. Of these four structural proteins, the Spike glycoprotein (S protein) is the key target for vaccine development, as it mediates host-cell entry [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00417)]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein binds to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00417)]. The S protein of mediates host cell entry in two ways: receptor-mediated endosomal host cell entry or viral membrane fusion with the host cell plasma membrane [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00417)]. [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00417)]. The LNP used for the vaccine candidate was composed of four different lipids: cholesterol, an ionizable amino lipid, a PEGylated phospholipid, and a phosphocholine lipid. mRNA-lipid nanoparticles form upon the mixing of the RNA with the dissolved lipids, encapsulating the mRNA [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00417)]. After injection, the mRNA-LNPs are taken up by host cells (e.g., muscle cells, tissue-resident, or recruited antigen-presenting cells), where the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00417)]. mRNA-LNPs can also directly reach immune cells in the draining lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels. Using the host cell machinery, the encoded S antigen is translated, and the expressed protein is presented at the cell surface, released, or presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I or II (depending on the cell type) where it can initiate antigen-specific and protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00417), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00417)]. The distribution of the mRNA-LNPs determines the mRNA expression pattern [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00417), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00417)], with the majority of the LNP remaining at the injection site after IM injection. LNP components are metabolized and recycled or eliminated. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Husbandry [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00417)] as well as local regulations. Each study was conducted according to GLP and OECD guidelines. 2.2. Test and Control Articles [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00417-t001)). [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00417)]. Each modRNA contained Design [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00417-f001). [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00417). 2.4. In Life Assessments [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00417)]. In Study 2, reactions were assessed predose as well as 4 and 24 h postdose ( [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-11-00417)), and if an animal had irritation present (e.g., severity score of 2) at 24 h postdose, additional monitoring was conducted. In Study 1, reactions were assessed at 4, 24, and 48 h postdose; if irritation was present at the 48-h postdose observation, additional monitoring was conducted. 2.5. Blood and Urine Sample Collections for Clinical Pathology 2.6. Hematology, Coagulation, Clinical Chemistry, Urinalysis, and Acute Phase Protein Analysis [Supplementary Tables (Tables S3-S5)](#app1-vaccines-11-00417). Hematology was evaluated using a Siemens Advia 120 analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) for Study 1 and a Siemens Advia 2120i analyzer (Siemens Healthineers Tarrytown, NY, USA) for Study 2. Fibrinogen activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time was evaluated the Amax Destiny Plus (Tcoag Deutschland 6mbh 32657, Lemgo, Germany) for Stago STA-R evaluation coagulation analyzer (Diagnostic Stago, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for Study 2. For Study 2, blood smears were prepared for the first 7 animals on Day 4 and all animals on Day 17 and Day 38. Blood cell morphology was evaluated microscopically on 5 animals of each sex from all groups at both scheduled necropsies (i.e., at dosing and recovery phases). Routine clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated using a Konelab 30i (Thermo Fisher Scientific 63303, Drieieich, Germany) for Study 1 and a Siemens Advia 1800 clinical chemistry analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Tarrytown, NY, USA) for Study 2. For Study 1, acute phase proteins alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AGP) were measured by ELISA (Rat Alpha 1 Acid Glycoprotein/AGP ELISA Kit, ab157729); Rat alpha 2 Macroglobulin ELISA Kit, ab157730). For Study 2, acute phase proteins were measured using the rat MSD Acute Phase Protein Panel 1 on the MSD SECTOR S 600 Analyzer (Meso Scale Design). Routine urinalysis parameters were measured. For Study 2, a microscopic examination of sediment for formed elements was performed on 5 animals of each sex from all dose groups at both scheduled necropsies (i.e., dosing and recovery phases). 2.7. Cytokine Analysis 2.8. Serology 2.8.1. Sample Collection and the correlation verification to a SARS-CoV-2-based virus neutralization assay. In brief, a recombinant and replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding the green the VSV glycoprotein (VSVG-GFP) was pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (pVNT), serial dilutions of the rat serum samples from Study 1 were prepared and pre-incubated for 10 min at room temperature with VSV/SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus suspension. After the following incubation on Vero-76 cells for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C, plates were analyzed using the IncuCyte Live Cell Analysis system (Sartorius, 90% pseudovirus neutralization titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum, still yielding a 90% reduction in GFP-positive infected cell number per well compared to the mean of the no serum pseudovirus positive control. Each serum sample dilution weight ratios in Study 2 and organ-to-body weight ratios in Study 1 were calculated. 2.8.6. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. In-Life Findings [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00417)). In Study 2, there were lower mean body weights (0.93x0.94x control) in males administered 30 \u00b5g BNT162b3 on Days 11 and 15 compared with saline controls. Test article-related higher mean body weight (1.05x1.06x control) was noted in males only during the recovery phase on Days 28, 32, 35, and 38 for animals administered 30 \u00b5g BNT162b2 (V9). No test article-related body weight changes were noted for animals administered BNT162b3 during the edema were fully resolved prior to dose administration on Days 8 and 15 and by the end of the 3-week recovery phase ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00417-f003)). 3.2. Clinical (A2M, A1AGP, albumin, AG ratio, globulins, and most leukocytes) or only seen at 100 g (platelets). Finally, there were elevations in -glutamyl transferase (GGT) in Study 1 that were not replicated in Study 2. All clinical pathology changes recovered by the end of the recovery phase (Day 38) except for elevations in RDW and globulins and reductions in A:G ratios. 3.3. Cytokines 3.4. Organ Weight/Macroscopic and Microscopic Observations [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00417-f005)), which correlated with the macroscopic injection site findings. Inflammation at the injection site was characterized by large numbers of neutrophils with fewer plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes admixed with abundant edema and small amounts of cellular debris, fibrin, and hemorrhage. Occasionally, inflammatory cells extend into the subcutaneous tissue/dermis of the overlying skin and into the extra-capsular tissue of the joint. [Figure 6](#vaccines-11-00417-f006)). [Figure 7](#vaccines-11-00417-f007)). This was not associated with hepatocyte degeneration or necrosis or with biochemical alterations in hepatocyte injury biomarkers (AST and ALT) and was considered secondary to the distribution of LNP lipids in the hepatocytes [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00417)]. This finding was fully resolved at the end of the 3-week recovery phase. [Figure 8](#vaccines-11-00417-f008)). At the end of the 3-week recovery phase, the increased cellularity of germinal centers was partially recovered, and the immature plasma cells were replaced by mature plasma cells. 3.5. Serology [Figure 9](#vaccines-11-00417-f009)). 4. Discussion [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00417)]. This change was not associated with evidence of liver dysfunction or damage [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00417), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00417)]. Findings identified at the end of dosing were generally resolved at the end of the recovery phase. For most study parameters, changes were typical of those identified in nonclinical vaccine studies including at the end of the recovery phase (e.g., partial recovery of enlarged lymph nodes, higher serum globulins, partial recovery of inflammation at the injection site) [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00417)]. While the in-life and post-mortem findings were similar to other vaccine formulations tested non-clinically, the magnitude of changes, particularly in hematology and acute phase protein parameters, were somewhat higher than in non-mRNA-LNP vaccines [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00417)]. This difference is interpreted to be the result of a strong innate immune activation by the mRNA-LNP platform. [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00417)]. Evidence of both types of reactions was observed in the rats after administration of the BNT162b vaccine candidates. [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00417)]. However, in Phase 3 clinical trials, injection site reactogenicity did not increase after the second dose [ [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00417)]. Microscopically, inflammation at the injection sites with BNT162b vaccine administration was within the range that has been reported in nonclinical vaccine studies [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00417), [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00417), [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00417)]. At the end of the recovery phase, edema was no longer present at the injection site, and the inflammation was limited to scattered mononuclear cells (resolution phase) without fibrosis. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00417)]. [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00417), [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00417)]. Immune responses in the draining lymph nodes and spleen led to the macroscopic observations of enlarged regional lymph nodes and, occasionally, enlarged spleens. This correlated with the expansion of germinal centers, consistent with B-cell activation, proliferation, and maturation, which are desired and expected responses to vaccine administration [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00417), [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00417)]. Microscopically, draining lymph nodes also had a notable expansion of immature plasma cells (plasmablasts) in the sinuses at the end of the dosing phase, which was replaced by mature plasma cells at the end of the recovery phase. This robust plasmablast expansion was more prominent than observed with other vaccine modalities tested by Pfizer and may underlie the robust antibody responses identified in nonclinical and clinical studies [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00417), [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00417)]. [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00417)]. Microscopically, increased WBCs correlated with slight increases in the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow (mostly myeloid cells) and, to a lesser extent, in the spleen at the end of the dosing phase. Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play a critical role in the expansion of myeloid progenitors during inflammation-induced hematopoiesis [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00417), [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00417)]. Rodents have the capacity to generate myeloid and erythroid cells in the red pulp of the spleen with strong inflammatory signals, and thus this is an anticipated effect of immune stimulation in this species [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00417)]. Somewhat unique to the mRNA-LNP vaccines compared to other Pfizer vaccine programs, however, was the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils both in the tissue section and on blood smears which fully recovered 3 weeks after the last dose administration. Hypersegmented neutrophil presence was considered to be secondary to the robust increases in neutrophil counts, likely related to the mobilization of bone marrow storage neutrophils, as well as prolonged neutrophil lifespan in circulation [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-00417)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00417), [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00417), [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00417)]. The mechanism of reticulocyte effects has been suggested to be due to the sequestration of iron via TLR-mediated downregulation, degradation, and endocytosis of the iron exporter, ferroportin, limiting iron availability for hemoglobin synthesis [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00417), [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00417), [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00417)]. An explanation for the lack of apparent reticulocyte decreases compared to control animals after the 3rd vaccine administration may be due to the combined effect of a robust reticulocyte regenerative response and the age-related decrease in reticulocyte counts, as evidenced in control rats [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00417), [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00417), [53](#B53-vaccines-11-00417)].In male and female control rats on Day 4 (Study 2), the mean reticulocyte counts were 392.1 and 301.7 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively, which decreased by ~44-54% on Day 17 to 178.8 and 168.9 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively. Interestingly, reticulocyte decreases were similarly observed in rats treated with the licensed LNP-siRNA pharmaceutical Onpattro but have not been observed in humans treated with this biotherapeutic [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00417)], suggesting this may be a species-specific effect. [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00417)]. All measured acute phase markers had returned to control levels after a 3-week recovery period, except for globulins, which remained higher. [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00417)]. These include the endosomal receptors toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR8, as well as the cytoplasmic RNA sensors including RIG-like receptors (RLRs) such as RIG-I, NOD-like receptors upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly type 1 interferons, which contribute to potent anti-viral responses. Modification of some or all the uridines by nucleoside analogs, such as 1-methylpseudouridine, as was the case with the BNT162b vaccine candidates, serves to dampen the innate immune response. [56](#B56-vaccines-11-00417)]. The lipid ALC-0315 is an ionizable lipid, which is a key component of the LNP and important for the delivery of nucleic acids. The ability of the LNP to encapsulate the RNA depends in large part on the ionizable nature of the lipid [ [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00417), [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00417)]. At a physiological pH, the ionizable lipid has a limited positive charge, which reduces clearance by the reticuloendothelial system [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00417), [60](#B60-vaccines-11-00417)], improving the LNP has improved tolerability, as cationic lipids have been associated with toxicity and increased immune activation [ [61](#B61-vaccines-11-00417)]. It has been demonstrated that the structure of the ionizable lipid in LNPs has an impact on the local reactogenicity and cytokine expression with parenteral administration [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00417), [62](#B62-vaccines-11-00417), [63](#B63-vaccines-11-00417)]. Recent studies demonstrated that intradermal (ID) or IM administration of 10 g of empty LNPs resulted in robust neutrophilic inflammation at the injection site, and LNP- encapsulating a polycystine RNA can activate multiple inflammatory pathways and induce IL-1 and IL-6 [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-00417)]. Injection site inflammation was comparable to saline control administration when the ionizable lipid was removed from the LNP, consistent with the reports of others that the ionizable lipid contributes to injection site reactogenicity after modRNA-LNP administration. Presently, it is unclear how the ionizable lipid components activate inflammation. However, the mechanisms may resemble those for the Study 2 had biochemical evidence of hepatobiliary injury (such as higher ALT, ALP, or total bilirubin) or microscopic biliary changes. Differences that may have contributed to higher GGT in Study 1 but not Study 2 included the use of serum collection tubes with Li-heparin in Study 1 vs. without anticoagulant in Study 2; differences in sample collection site; sample handling (e.g., underfilled Li-heparin anticoagulant tubes, storage temperature prior to Li-heparin plasma separation, sample storage prior to analysis and reagents/assay methodology); and hemolysis [ [71](#B71-vaccines-11-00417), [72](#B72-vaccines-11-00417), [73](#B73-vaccines-11-00417), [74](#B74-vaccines-11-00417)]. Regardless, the higher GGT in Study 1 was considered an artifact and not the result of a physiological response to the test article in the rats. 5. Conclusions [75](#B75-vaccines-11-00417), [76](#B76-vaccines-11-00417), [77](#B77-vaccines-11-00417)] that suggests platform data may support entry into clinical trials with a different antigen as long as the platform has not significantly changed. Further, because the nonclinical findings were likely driven in part by the innate immune response to the RNA-LNP rather than the antigen, we suggest that a platform approach may be considered for characterized mRNA-LNP vaccines for entry into Phase I clinical trials.
