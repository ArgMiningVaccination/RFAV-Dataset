The air quality in cities is worsening due to the increase in particulate matter (PM), carbon gas generation, yellow dust, exhaust gas, and cigarette smoke, and the incidence of inflammatory diseases is increasing. In addition, as air pollution and the global COVID-19 pandemic are increasing mask use, various skin diseases such as contact dermatitis and eczema are also increasing. Therefore, we intend to investigate the pharmacological effects of natural products and alternative medicine, focusing on inflammatory diseases caused by environmental factors. We cordially invite you to publish research or review papers in this Special Issue, which aims to summarize the findings of recent studies on the bioactivity of natural and alternative medicines. In particular, it is focused on inflammatory diseases caused by environmental factors, such as atopic dermatitis, rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and inflammatory bowel disease. We hope that many interested authors will participate.
