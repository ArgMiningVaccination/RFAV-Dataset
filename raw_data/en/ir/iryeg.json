To control the pandemic, genetically engineered vaccines have been designed for inducing neutralizing antibodies against the Spike proteins. These vaccines do not act like traditional protein-based vaccines, as they deliver the message in the form of mRNA or DNA to host cells that then produce and expose the Spike protein on the membrane (from which it can be shed in soluble form) to alert the immune system. Mass vaccination has brought to light various adverse effects associated with these genetically based vaccines, mainly affecting the circulatory and cardiovascular system. ACE2 is present as membrane-bound on several cell types, including the mucosa of the upper respiratory and of the gastrointestinal tracts, the endothelium, the platelets, and in soluble form in the plasma. The ACE2 enzyme converts the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II into peptides with vasodilator properties. Here we review the pathways for immunization and the molecular mechanisms through which the Spike protein, either from SARS-CoV-2 or encoded by the mRNA-based vaccines, interferes with the Renin-Angiotensin-System governed by ACE2, thus altering the homeostasis of the circulation and of the cardiovascular system. Understanding the molecular interactions of the Spike protein with ACE2 and the consequent impact on cardiovascular system homeostasis will direct the diagnosis and therapy of the vaccine-related adverse effects and provide information for development of a personalized vaccination that considers pathophysiological conditions predisposing to such adverse events.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-03", "cleaned_text": "Immune Response and Molecular Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Adverse Effects of Spike Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and mRNA )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Due to the severity of disease, the lack of specific antivirals, and the purported pressure on health care systems (essentially requiring hospitalization in intensive care units), vaccination was considered the most promising and appropriate solution. [2](#B2-biomedicines-11-00451), [3](#B3-biomedicines-11-00451), [4](#B4-biomedicines-11-00451), [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-00451)] ( non-covalently bound subunits (S1 and S2) that arise from the furin-mediated cleavage of the S protein at the TGN (trans-Golgi network) during the virus transit [ [6](#B6-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The Spike proteins then assemble as trimers on the virus envelope, thus giving the crown-like aspect. It is to be noted that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells may express at the membrane some Spike proteins that have not been assembled into the virion, and from them the S1 could be released in soluble form [ [6](#B6-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The Spike binds to the ACE2 receptor via a part of the molecule called the RBD (receptor binding domain) in the S1 subunit, which in the prefusion state can assume the UP or DOWN configuration with the RBM (receptor binding motif), respectively accessible or not, for binding to the ACE2 [ [6](#B6-biomedicines-11-00451)] ( [Figure 1](#biomedicines-11-00451-f001)). [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-00451), [9](#B9-biomedicines-11-00451)]. How much these differences affect the effectiveness of vaccines is a matter of debate [ [10](#B10-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [11](#B11-biomedicines-11-00451)]. These vaccines were developed in a few months, which seems surprisingly quickly, thanks to the fact that the technology for mRNA transfer in vitro and in animals had been known for decades [ [12](#B12-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Thereafter, trials for assessing the efficacy and safety were run in parallel, for a relatively short period, which led to the vaccine's emergency approval in a few months. Although they have formally been granted a marketing authorization, there is the need to provide further evidence of their efficacy and safety, based on the Phase 3 experimental studies and the Phase 4 observational studies that are still ongoing. [13](#B13-biomedicines-11-00451), [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2, Comirnaty) and Spikevax), both using a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for delivering the genetic information (mRNA) to instruct the synthesis of the Spike protein, were among the first vaccines to be approved for emergency use in December 2020 and are currently still the highest deployed types in the US and Europe. However, concerns have been raised regarding their efficacy to prevent virus transmissibility [ [15](#B15-biomedicines-11-00451), [16](#B16-biomedicines-11-00451), [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-00451)]. However, for the sake of practicality, we shall not discuss here the name that better suits these immunostimulatory gene-based pro-drugs falling in the category of immunological-genetic product and will rather focus on their mechanisms of action. Here we will discuss how the mRNA-based vaccine elicits the immune response along with serious side effects on the cardiovascular system, whose severity depends on the distribution in the body of the Spike protein and the extent of the immune response elicited by the vaccine. [25](#B25-biomedicines-11-00451), [26](#B26-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In this respect, literature data report on a variety of serious adverse effects associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination [ [23](#B23-biomedicines-11-00451)]. These include myocarditis, pericarditis, hypertensive crisis, events [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-11-00451), [28](#B28-biomedicines-11-00451), [29](#B29-biomedicines-11-00451), [30](#B30-biomedicines-11-00451), [31](#B31-biomedicines-11-00451)], [34](#B34-biomedicines-11-00451)], and [38](#B38-biomedicines-11-00451), [39](#B39-biomedicines-11-00451), [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-00451), [41](#B41-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Adverse events reported by the patients or the healthcare giver are collected in the database VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) for US consumers ( [https://vaers.hhs.gov/](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)access date 24 July 2022) and the equivalent database Eudravigilance in Europe ( [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/pharmacovigilance/eudravigilance](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/pharmacovigilance/eudravigilance)access date 24 July 2022), or date 24 July 2022). [42](#B42-biomedicines-11-00451), [43](#B43-biomedicines-11-00451), [44](#B44-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Beyond the differences in technological platforms, it should be considered that mRNA vaccines have had a much wider diffusion and, moreover, require repeated administrations. Starting from the scientific theories explaining how anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, this paper focuses on the cellular, immunological, and pathophysiological mechanisms that could underlie the peculiar reactions in literature reported for the Spike protein, which is the main infectivity system of the virus and at the same time the main product against which vaccines intend to trigger the immune response. The present study contributes to further understanding of the potential toxic side effects, for a comprehensive assessment of the safety profile of these vaccines, which is instrumental to informing public health policy and to the prevention and/or cure of unwanted side effects. 2. Essentials of mRNA Vaccines Design and Functioning [45](#B45-biomedicines-11-00451), [46](#B46-biomedicines-11-00451), [47](#B47-biomedicines-11-00451)], entry into cells by SARS-CoV-2 relies mainly on the interaction of the envelope Spike protein with cellular ACE2. Thus, blocking this interaction with an antibody seemed a good strategy. This prompted the vaccine production industry to design a genetically engineered vaccine capable of inducing in the host the production of neutralizing antibodies against the Spike protein, particularly toward the interacting region called the RBD. Indeed, the immunizing antigen is produced within the hosting cell once the nanoparticle load of mRNA is injected. Thus, for the vaccine to trigger the immune response, i.e., to elicit the biological (immunological) effect, the mRNA must be translated into the protein that, in turn, must interact with the immune system. [12](#B12-biomedicines-11-00451), [48](#B48-biomedicines-11-00451)] yet never exploited on a large scale for human use. Seneff et al. [ [49](#B49-biomedicines-11-00451)] carefully and extensively analysed many of the critical points related to the engineered mRNA vaccines. Here we briefly report on those aspects regarding the immunogenicity of the exogenous vaccine mRNA, its entry into the cells, and its stability. [13](#B13-biomedicines-11-00451), [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It is noteworthy that the mRNA vaccine sequence maintains the furin cleavage site (a stretch of the four basic amino acids Arg- Arg- Ala- Arg at the S1-S2 junction) as in the viral sequence, and this has implications for the generation of the soluble S1 peptide [ [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451), [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [13](#B13-biomedicines-11-00451), [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Other modifications are briefly described below. To allow entrance into the cells, the mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing cholesterol and phospholipids associated with modified polyethylene glycol to avoid its degradation [ [50](#B50-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Viral RNA is recognized by the human cells as foreign, and this triggers defence reactions that impair its translation into proteins, while directing its degradation [ [51](#B51-biomedicines-11-00451), [52](#B52-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Replacing uridines with pseudouridines or (even better) with methyl-pseudouridine, overcomes the recognition as a foreign mRNA by the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) and the subsequent activation of IFN type I [ [53](#B53-biomedicines-11-00451)]. To stabilize the mRNA and thus improve its translation, anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have this characteristic [ [54](#B54-biomedicines-11-00451)]. To further stabilize the mRNA and increase the S protein production, a long poly(A) tail [ [55](#B55-biomedicines-11-00451)] and the 3 UTR from human globin [ [56](#B56-biomedicines-11-00451)] were added to the mRNA molecule. A leader sequence, for translation in endoplasmic reticulum associated ribosomes, was added to ensure the insertion of the Spike protein into the plasma membrane. Notably, mRNAs vaccines are enriched in GC content: 53% in BNT162b2 in native SARS-CoV-2 mRNA [ [57](#B57-biomedicines-11-00451)], and this also contributes to increasing the protein production [ [58](#B58-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Taken together, the vaccine mRNAs driving the Spike protein synthesis have been engineered in a manner that challenges the cellular stress response for the recognition of exogenous nucleic acids and proteins, and this is likely to impact the distribution of the mRNAs coding for the Spike protein and of the protein itself, which may then explain the biological and pathophysiological effects in organs distant from the site of injection. Indeed, the true biodistribution and the half-life of the vaccine mRNA in humans are currently unknown. Normally, mRNA is very fragile and is quickly degraded (within a few days). It was initially thought that vaccine mRNA would remain localized in the site of injection and be degraded within a few days, as is normal mRNA. However, real-world observations contradict this prediction. The S-protein has been detected in the plasma of mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccinees at 15 days following injection [ [59](#B59-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Both mRNA and S protein have been found in axillary lymph nodes after 60 days [ [60](#B60-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Very recently, Spike-mRNA has been detected in the blood of vaccinated individuals 15 and up to 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination [ [61](#B61-biomedicines-11-00451), [62](#B62-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Thus, it is likely that mRNA-LNPs remain in circulation for extended periods of time, retaining their ability to induce S protein expression in encountered cells. Updated bivalent mRNA vaccines that include the coding sequence for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant were made available in September 2022, and studies on their efficacy and safety are still ongoing. Based on two pre-print studies, not yet peer-reviewed, the bivalent mRNA vaccine shows modest protection [ [63](#B63-biomedicines-11-00451)] and a higher rate of adverse events compared to the monovalent mRNA vaccine [ [64](#B64-biomedicines-11-00451)]. 3. The Immune Response to the SARS-CoV-2 and to the mRNA Vaccines 3.1. The Importance of the Route of Entry [65](#B65-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Notably, circulating exosomes with inserted on the membrane the Spike protein have been detected in vaccinated individuals, and it is assumed that such exosomes are internalized by the APC, thus adding another route of immune sensitization [ [66](#B66-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [67](#B67-biomedicines-11-00451), [68](#B68-biomedicines-11-00451)]. To obtain effective and long-lasting protection at the site of entry, the pathogen must have direct contact with and be processed by the local tissue and compartmentalized immune system [ [67](#B67-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [69](#B69-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Upon viral infection, plasmablasts with homing receptors for mucosal sites and with intracellular IgA increase in the blood [ [69](#B69-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The fact that the level of secretory IgA specific for the Spike RBD in saliva was higher than that in the blood of the same subject 49 days after the onset of symptoms is indicative of the persistence of IgA in the oral mucosa [ [69](#B69-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [70](#B70-biomedicines-11-00451), [71](#B71-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Salivary IgA specifically for protein are significantly lower in anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees than in COVID-19 convalescent controls [ [72](#B72-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In fact, the current mRNA vaccines, though able to prevent/attenuate the most serious consequences of the disease, do not trigger the mucosal IgA response [ [73](#B73-biomedicines-11-00451)], even after the booster [ [74](#B74-biomedicines-11-00451)], and do not prevent the colonization of the virus in the mucous membranes [ [16](#B16-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The pattern of the cytokine response is also of paramount importance. The immune response to the virus and to the mRNA vaccines differ in that the former is characterized by strong induction of interferon and circulating effector B and T lymphocytes, whereas the latter is essentially restricted to circulating memory cells [ [75](#B75-biomedicines-11-00451)]. 3.2. Immunization Pathways of the SARS-CoV-2 and mRNA Vaccines [76](#B76-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In the presentation illustrating the immunization process [ [77](#B77-biomedicines-11-00451)], we read that the LNP loaded with the Spike-encoding mRNA would fuse with the plasma membrane of and release the mRNA into antigen presenting cells (APC), which in turn would manufacture the Spike protein and present it on the membrane to CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cytotoxic cells and B cells. According to this theory, the mRNA vaccine: (a) \"provides instruction (Spike protein) directly to the immune system\" and (b) \"efficiently creates specific immune memory in a natural context (in situ)\". This \"theoretical\" pathway is illustrated in the upper part of [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002). [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002), A1 and A2). [78](#B78-biomedicines-11-00451)]. According to this view, the expected adverse events following immunization are transient pain and inflammation at the injection site and transitory systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise. Albeit rarely, serious adverse effects may occur after vaccination, for instance due to an allergy condition (anaphylaxis) or to immune dysregulation or autoimmunity mediated by antigens themselves or by the adjuvant (e.g., aluminum particles), or possibly because of inadvertent use of improperly inactivated or mutated microbe (e.g., Sabin polio), or genetic susceptibility [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-00451), [79](#B79-biomedicines-11-00451), [80](#B80-biomedicines-11-00451), [81](#B81-biomedicines-11-00451), [82](#B82-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [83](#B83-biomedicines-11-00451)]. This implies that the mRNA may direct the synthesis of the Spike protein not exclusively in muscle cells but also in APCs and other somatic cells. 2. The mRNA is provided with a leader sequence, which directs the synthesis of the Spike protein in endoplasmic reticulum-associated ribosomes. The membrane bound S protein would then travel through the Golgi complex (here it will be split into S1 and S2 by furin) and then be exposed on the plasma membrane via insertional exocytosis [ [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Transfected cells could free the S protein and/or its fragments following T cell killing, and S1 (which is non-covalently bound to S2) could be shed from the membrane [ [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-00451), [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Consistently, high levels of soluble Spike proteins are found in the circulation of vaccinees with myocarditis [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The soluble Spike can be subsequently endocytosed by APCs and B lymphocytes. The transfected cells may release exosomes expressing the S protein on the membrane, which also contribute to immunostimulation of APCs in distant organs [ [66](#B66-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002), bottom drawing (B). These cells would produce Spike proteins, display them on the membrane (or release after cell death or shed the S1) and trigger the response of the immune system (B1 in [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002)). Furthermore, the Spikes exposed on the membrane of endothelium can interact with the ACE2 receptors exposed on the platelet membrane, favouring their aggregation (B2 in [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002)). When the Spike synthesis is induced by boosters, i.e., in immunized individuals, the risk is that the transfected cells become victims of the aggression by previously formed antibodies (B3 in [Figure [Figure 2](#biomedicines-11-00451-f002)). If this is the case, the adverse events following repetitive immunizations may be worse and involve various organs in which the Spike localizes. [85](#B85-biomedicines-11-00451), [86](#B86-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The facts that this event is more frequent after the second dose and it occurs a few days after the inoculation [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-11-00451)], suggest an immune-mediated mechanism analogous to an auto-immune reaction. To conclude, the Spike protein acts in a peculiar way, not simply as an immunogen, but as a disease-causing agent. 3.3. Differences between Contact with the Whole Virus and Vaccine-Derived Spike Protein [87](#B87-biomedicines-11-00451)]. 4. LNP Biodistribution and Spike Detection However, the few biodistribution studies carried out [ [88](#B88-biomedicines-11-00451)] showed that in mice and rats challenged with LNP labelled with radioactive probe or luciferase the signal is detected in various tissues, with the injection site, the spleen and the liver being the most enriched ones [ [89](#B89-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The technical dossier presented for the registration of Pfizer anti-COVID-19 vaccine reports that within 48 h from injection, LNP redistributed mainly to the liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and ovaries. [59](#B59-biomedicines-11-00451), [90](#B90-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Since receptors for Spike are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and organs, it is likely that this protein performs activities that clearly go beyond its intended function as simple \"antigen\" [ [91](#B91-biomedicines-11-00451), [92](#B92-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Studies in laboratory animals have shown that Spike proteins may also cross the blood-brain barrier, which may account for neurological symptoms of the disease as well as of the vaccine [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [60](#B60-biomedicines-11-00451)]. These authors found the Spike protein also in plasma in the first few days after vaccination (mean concentration of 47 pg/mL), yet the measurement of the Spike in blood after boosts was affected by the presence of specific antibodies. Circulating exosomes containing the Spike protein were found on day 14 after vaccination, and they increased after the booster dose, lasting up to four months [ [66](#B66-biomedicines-11-00451)]. While it has been suggested that these vesicles expressing the Spike protein on the membrane have the function of stimulating the immune response, it is not known whether they may interact with cells expressing ACE2. Vaccine-derived mRNA and Spike protein have been detected in the germinal centre of secondary lymphoid tissues two months after vaccination, suggesting sustained induction of protein synthesis [ [60](#B60-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Recently, circulating Spike proteins were detected in the blood of subjects hospitalized for myocarditis after mRNA vaccination [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Remarkably, the concentration of Spike protein (mean 33.9 \u00b1 22.4 pg/mL) was significantly higher in symptomatic vaccinees than in asymptomatic ones, and it was measurable until three weeks after vaccination [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [94](#B94-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Since no nucleocapsid (N) protein was detected, the authors suggest that the pathology was caused by vaccination and not by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. [95](#B95-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The Spike protein was detected in platelets from COVID-19 patients' thrombi, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting its involvement in platelet activation and clot formation [ [96](#B96-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [97](#B97-biomedicines-11-00451)]. According to this study, the rapid entry of mRNA into human liver cells would be followed by \"reverse transcription\" to the DNA within a few hours [ [97](#B97-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Whether the DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 mRNA is integrated into the cell genome has not been proved, yet the finding raises the concern that the integrity of genomic DNA could be affected, underscoring possible genotoxic side effects. Furthermore, if the mRNA message is retro-transcribed in DNA, which is more stable, the synthesis of the Spike proteins may persist for long time. 5. The \"Active\" Spike and the Renin-Angiotensin System [98](#B98-biomedicines-11-00451), [99](#B99-biomedicines-11-00451)], platelets mast cells [ [100](#B100-biomedicines-11-00451), [101](#B101-biomedicines-11-00451)], brain [ [102](#B102-biomedicines-11-00451)], testicles, prostate and uterus [ [103](#B103-biomedicines-11-00451)], digestive system cells such as oral mucosa, salivary glands, enterocytes, cholangiocytes of the liver and in adipose tissue [ [99](#B99-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The widespread distribution of ACE2 may explain the multi-organ damages caused by the Spike, either coded upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or following mRNA vaccination. [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-00451), [92](#B92-biomedicines-11-00451), [104](#B104-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In other words, the proteins \"mimic\" the behaviour of the virus-derived homologs, and the pathology depends on the organs in which the Spikes are formed and distributed. [Figure 3](#biomedicines-11-00451-f003). [105](#B105-biomedicines-11-00451)], and when binding to the ACE2 receptors on platelets may cause thrombosis. In leukocytes, other receptors, besides ACE2, can be the target cells, a certain amount of ACE2 molecules is released from the membranes by the action of proteolytic enzymes and pass into the plasma, where they can decrease angiotensin II level, thus leading to hypotension [ [113](#B113-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In COVID-19 patients, ACE2 shedding is exacerbated and the plasma level of sACE2 correlates with COVID-19 severity [ [115](#B115-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It is conceivable that a similar effect occurs in mRNA vaccinated individuals because of the soluble Spike [117](#B117-biomedicines-11-00451)] ( [Figure 4](#biomedicines-11-00451-f004)). [118](#B118-biomedicines-11-00451)], and this leads to a net decrease in ACE2 enzyme activity, which then results in an increase in angiotensin II and consequently in increased blood pressure and bradykinin accumulation. Also, the binding of Spike to membrane-bound ACE2 can cause pulmonary injury and vasoconstriction because of impaired conversion of Angiotensin II to [ [113](#B113-biomedicines-11-00451), regulates the kinin system by eliminating bradykinin, which is responsible for inflammatory phenomena and exudates. It has been shown that key elements of the bradykinin, angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in lung alveolar cells, and this could explain how changes in membrane ACE2 caused by the virus determine the development of the most severe clinical forms of COVID-19 [ [122](#B122-biomedicines-11-00451), [123](#B123-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In fact, bradykinin-mediated inflammation contributes to life-threatening respiratory complications in COVID-19 [ [124](#B124-biomedicines-11-00451)], and this is one of the reasons for recommending an anti-inflammatory in the treatment of COVID-19 patients [ [125](#B125-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In addition, minimal Spike doses, added to human whole blood in vitro, induce the production of many types of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cells expressed and secreted) [ [126](#B126-biomedicines-11-00451)]. As stated, the antibody-mediated clearance of the virus complexed with sACE2 causes a rapid decline of circulating ACE2. Similarly, the free Spike (and the Spike-containing exosome) from the mRNA vaccine can lead to an upheaval of the RAS that may cause an increase in blood pressure and hyperinflammatory have serious and even tragic consequences, being an established risk factor for subarachnoid cerebral haemorrhage, increasing the risk by 2.6 times (as a comparison, smoking increases it by 3.1 times and alcohol abuse by 1.5 times) [ [129](#B129-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [30](#B30-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The risk is as much as 12 times higher with the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine than with the anti-influenza vaccine. 6. Molecular Mimicry and Anti-Idiotype Antibodies [37](#B37-biomedicines-11-00451), [130](#B130-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [131](#B131-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In addition, the \"homologies\" between the Spike protein and human proteins are much greater than for other viruses and bacteria, increasing the risk of developing autoimmune diseases. [Figure 6](#biomedicines-11-00451-f006)). [132](#B132-biomedicines-11-00451)], these antibodies \"look like\" the critical part Spike. Thus, the anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2 in [Figure 6](#biomedicines-11-00451-f006)), which reflect the Spike epitope, may bind to ACE2 or similar structures and cause the pathophysiological reaction described above. Anti-idiotype antibodies against ACE2 were found in 81% of COVID-19 patients but not found in unaffected patients [ [133](#B133-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The authors hypothesized a role of these antibodies in explaining COVID-19-associated cardiovascular events. This phenomenon can occur with the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as with anti-COVID-19 vaccines [ [134](#B134-biomedicines-11-00451)], explaining at least in part the persistence of adverse reactions in some individuals. It has also been suggested that anti-idiotype antibodies could bind to neuropilin-1, which is recognized by the Spike of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [135](#B135-biomedicines-11-00451)], and this could explain some neurological adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathy arising after vaccination with BNT162b2 [ [136](#B136-biomedicines-11-00451)]. 7. The \"Boost\" and Trained Immunity [137](#B137-biomedicines-11-00451), [138](#B138-biomedicines-11-00451)]. Many inflammatory insults can alter the functionality and reactivity of the innate immune system in the long run, and this could be relevant when the stimuli are reiterated, as in the case of repeated vaccinations. [139](#B139-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In monocytes and macrophages, this epigenetic reprogramming was associated with increased cytokine production and a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis [ [140](#B140-biomedicines-11-00451)]. This could be an advantage in terms of specific response, but the same trained immunity can become \"maladaptive\" in diseases characterised by chronic systemic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis and cancer [ [137](#B137-biomedicines-11-00451), [138](#B138-biomedicines-11-00451), [139](#B139-biomedicines-11-00451), [140](#B140-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In addition, certain non-immune cells such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts also display trained immune characteristics, and this has been seen also in relation to coronavirus infection [ [141](#B141-biomedicines-11-00451)]. In the long term, a possible outcome of COVID-19 as well as of repetitive boosters is the development or exacerbation of pre-existing atherosclerosis, given that this is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vascular wall also involving monocyte-macrophage phagocytic cells [ [142](#B142-biomedicines-11-00451)] (see [Figure 7](#biomedicines-11-00451-f007)). [143](#B143-biomedicines-11-00451)], is comparable with the risk of side effects of vaccination, which having short-term protection requires repeated administrations (every 3-5 months) and thus could trigger or worsen chronic inflammatory pathologies. 8. Overview and Prospects [Table 1](#biomedicines-11-00451-t001). [169](#B169-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It has been hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccination could aggravate a pre-existing T-mediated heart-specific autoimmunity. Infiltration of CD3+ T lymphocytes has been reported in acute myocarditis following BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination [ [170](#B170-biomedicines-11-00451)]. A role for sex hormone on myocardial inflammation upon COVID-19 infection or mRNA vaccination also should be considered, given that testosterone and estrogen elicit opposite effects on T cell response. 8.1. Causality Assessment [171](#B171-biomedicines-11-00451), [172](#B172-biomedicines-11-00451)]. The medical history and clinical examinations of the patient along with laboratory data help identify other diseases or congenital anomalies that could have caused the event. However, in addition to the presence of a temporal correlation and the absence of another \"strong\" cause not related to the possible effect of the vaccine, the plausibility of the explanation of the possible pathogenic effect of the vaccine is very important [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-00451)]. For instance, a sudden rise in blood pressure could be fatal in people with brain aneurysms, a problem aggravated by possible thrombocytopenia. For this reason, understanding the Spike protein's mechanisms of action is essential, especially in the event of unforeseen and inexplicable effects based on knowledge accumulated with previous \"conventional\" vaccines. [173](#B173-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It states that during the study period, 15 participants died in the vaccine-treated group and 14 in the placebo group, and that none of these deaths were related to BNT162b2 according to the investigators. However, on closer inspection, Table S4 of that paper [ [173](#B173-biomedicines-11-00451)] shows that among the deaths in the vaccine-treated group, four were due to \"cardiac arrest\" and two to \"atherosclerosis\", whereas in the placebo-treated group the deaths due to these two conditions were 1 and 0, respectively. The fact that vaccine-derived Spike proteins can have a dysregulatory influence on the RAS implies that, in the case of patients with cardiovascular and coagulation diseases, an interaction between the vaccine and the underlying condition is entirely plausible and should not be discarded. 8.2. Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications [174](#B174-biomedicines-11-00451), [175](#B175-biomedicines-11-00451)]. [Figure 7](#biomedicines-11-00451-f007)), and genetic susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases should be carefully evaluated. As with traditional vaccines, it would be possible to develop a program for the systematic detection of adverse effects and associating them with immunogenetic and cardiovascular characteristics, to build a predictive map of the risks [ [176](#B176-biomedicines-11-00451), [177](#B177-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It would be important to evaluate the different cytokine patterns, which could determine the greater or lesser systemic reaction to vaccination, as was reported after smallpox immunization [ [178](#B178-biomedicines-11-00451), [179](#B179-biomedicines-11-00451), [180](#B180-biomedicines-11-00451), [181](#B181-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It has been clearly established that some genetic background characteristics, such as cytokines or ACE2 polymorphisms, can potentially explain the large interindividual variation of COVID-19 disease [ [182](#B182-biomedicines-11-00451)]. It is therefore plausible that the development of tests aimed at identifying specific ACE2 variants could be a strategy to also evaluate the risk of adverse reaction to vaccination. Additionally, awareness of the cardiovascular risk linked to adverse reactions to vaccines can trigger diagnostic suspicion in the case of vague and non-specific symptoms. For instance, troponin dosage is a valid marker of cardiac damage and could be informative even in the event of an autopsy, provided it is performed within 48 h of death with immunomodulatory properties (anti-allergic or anti-cytokine drugs) are useful in the prevention or treatment of adverse reactions to vaccines should be assessed through appropriate randomized clinical trials. Finally, a rational approach would be to harness the omics technology for the design of more efficacious and safe vaccines as well as for understanding the mechanistic causes of the vaccine's adverse effects for a better personalized assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of vaccination [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-00451), [174](#B174-biomedicines-11-00451), [175](#B175-biomedicines-11-00451)].
