Overview Indiana University Indiana University was founded in 1820 at Bloomington and is one of the oldest institutions of higher education west of the Allegheny Mountains. Its facilities and programs are internationally known for their excellence and diversity. With 109,000 full- and part-time students on eight campuses, as well as a faculty of more than 6,000, Indiana University is one of the largest universities in the nation. The university offers 5,000 courses of instruction and 880 degree programs, and it attracts students from all 50 states and more than 150 countries. Indiana University has eight campuses: Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana University Northwest (Gary), Indiana University South Bend, Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Indiana University Kokomo, Indiana University Southeast (New Albany), and Indiana University East (Richmond). It also offers courses through Columbus, Elkhart, and many other sites. The university puts quality education within reach of all Indiana citizens. Indiana University Kokomo Indiana University Kokomo was built upon the foundations of another institution, the Kokomo Junior College. Organized in 1932, the Junior College offered a basic two- year collegiate program. Throughout its 13-year history, it maintained an average enrollment of about 75 students. In 1945, the Junior College asked Indiana University to assume its function and to establish an extension center in the former Junior College building at 508 West Taylor Street. In 1947, to accommodate steadily increasing enrollment, the university purchased the Seiberling- Kingston mansion at 1200 West Sycamore Street. IU Kokomo's main classroom building was occupied in 1965 on South Washington Street. Housing classrooms, lounges, faculty research facilities, and a community auditorium, it is located on a 51-acre site in the southern part of the city. Mission Statement The mission of Indiana University Kokomo, a regional campus of Indiana University, is to enhance the educational and professional attainment of the residents of north central Indiana through effective teaching, learning, and civic engagement and by providing a wide range of bachelor's degrees, and a limited number of master's and associate degrees. Indiana University Kokomo is further dedicated to enhancing research, creative work, and other scholarly activity, promoting diversity and inclusion, and strengthening the economic and cultural vitality of the region and the state through a variety of community engagement, partnerships and programs. Accreditation Indiana University Kokomo is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, which is located at 30 N. LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, IL 60602-2504. Campus Commitment to Assessment of Student Learning As a reflection of our commitment to the student learning mission of IU Kokomo, the campus community is actively engaged in ongoing, systematic assessment of student learning. This process gives faculty information on how effectively academic programs are meeting their goals for student learning and provides guidance for enhancing those programs. In addition, ongoing, systematic assessment is required for the campus to continue to meet the accreditation standards of the North Central Association/Higher Learning Commission. The faculty in the various degree programs develop the student learning outcomes for their programs and are responsible for assessing those outcomes. As part of this process, students will be asked to participate in activities such as surveys, standardized exams, or focus groups. In addition, student performance on examinations, quizzes, papers, or other assignments in a course may be used to assess learning outcomes. In all cases, the purpose is to assess the effectiveness of the program as a whole in achieving its student learning goals. So assessment results are aggregated. No individual students or faculty are identified in any assessment report. Students who have questions about student learning assessment, or are interested in obtaining the results of a program's assessment of student learning may contact the Dean of the School in which the program resides.

Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs.

This degree may be in business or another field. All admission decisions are based upon the student's undergraduate grade point average, GMAT score, professional work experience, and their statement of achievement. To apply, please submit the following: 1) completed application, personalstatement of achievement, and resume; 2) official college or university transcripts from all institutions attended; 3) Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) score or GRE; 4) application fee; and 5) applicants whose native language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in English. The MBA program admits students for fall, spring and summer semesters. Application deadlines for domestic students are June 15 for fall entry, November 1 for spring entry and March 1 for summer entry. Application deadlines for international students are June 1 for fall entry and October 1 for spring entry only. A $60 application fee is required for international applicants. Applicants must meet Indiana University Kokomo's graduate English proficiency requirements. **Applicants holding a graduate degree from an appropriately accredited college or university may be exempted from the GMAT requirement if they earned an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 or higher. Overall Program Requirements Graduation with the MBA degree requires successful completion of a minimum of 30 credit hours. A person holding an undergraduate degree in business administration might complete the program in 30 credit hours, whereas an individual having none of the Phase I foundation course work would require up to 6 additional Phase I courses. Waiver of Phase I foundation courses is determined through an analysis of an applicant's transcripts. Degree requirements must be completed within six years of admission. Student Course Load Most MBA students at IU Kokomo are employed full time in positions of responsibility. The high standards and workload in the MBA program requires considerable time and effort that must be balanced with other life and work demands. For this reason, part-time students are advised to take no more than 6 credit hours in fall and spring, and 3 credit hours during any one summer session. Course schedules are constructed accordingly, with most courses offered after 4 p.m. Transfer of Credit Up to 6 graduate credit hours may be transferred into Phase II of the MBA program from an AACSB accredited or AACSB candidate schools. No graduate courses where the student earned below a B can be transferred into the program. Transfer credit determination is made by the MBA director in consultation with the appropriate faculty. Only grades earned at Indiana University count toward a student's grade point average. Grades from other universities transfer as credits only. Waiver As noted above, Phase I foundation course requirements may be waived if satisfactory completion of equivalent course work is demonstrated in the student's undergraduate or graduate transcript (C or higher grade required from an AACSB accredited program or B or higher grade required from a non-AACSB accredited program). Work experience and noncredit courses normally do not satisfy the foundation requirements, but may serve as confirming evidence along with academic course work. Validation exams are available for several Phase I courses.October 31, 2019 41 Academic Standards Graduation with the MBA degree requires a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 or a B average. A student whose GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on probation and will be required to bring the GPA back to 3.0 within the next 9 credit hours of course work. Failure to remove the deficiency in this timeframe will result in immediate dismissal from the program. A student cannot compensate for deficient course work by completing more credits beyond those required in the program of study. Students must take the ETS exam as a requirement for graduation. Advising Shortly after admission to the program, each MBA student will plan a program of study with the MBA Director. In addition, MBA students seeking career development information are encouraged to confer with the faculty in their area of interest.

Students planning to graduate in December must apply for their degrees by September 15. The application deadline for May and August graduations is January 15. Decision-Making and Appeal Process The Curriculum Management and Assurance of Learning Committee (CMALC) is the main governing body for the MBA program. This committee, which is responsible for academic policy and curriculum, consists of members of the faculty, the dean of the school (ex- officio), and the MBA director. It is also responsible for recommending admission policy, handling appeals concerning admissions, grades, and related academic matters for which a student seeks redress. The MBA director is the program executive, responsible for day- to-day operations, referring applicants to the admission committee and program advising.

The Kokomo School of Education was later established to serve the growing needs of north central Indiana citizens for easily accessible quality programs. The campus awarded its first Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education degree in 1969 and the Master of Science in Education degree in May 1985. Mission The School of Education maintains the highest standards for students in its initial teacher education programs. The successful teacher must master both a body of content knowledge and effective teaching skills. The initial teacher education programs offer a balance of broad liberal arts education and specialized knowledge in professional education and concentrated areas. Students choose from a variety of options to fulfill their educational requirements. The School's advanced teacher education program provides practicing classroom teachers with graduate study aligned with the National Board for Professional Teacher Standards. P-12 classroom teachers gain advanced knowledge of educational foundations, technology, inquiry, subject area content and content pedagogy. The purposes of the initial teacher education programs are (1) to prepare students to serve as effective teachers and members of the profession, (2) to assist students in meeting Indiana certification requirements for public school personnel, and (3) to assist Indiana University graduates in securing satisfying professional positions. The purposes of the advanced teacher education program are (1) to prepare P-12 classroom teachers in reflective and inquiry-based practices, (2) to prepare P-12 classroom teachers in effectively and efficiently utilizing technology in their practice, and (3) to ultimately improve classroom teaching and student learning in central Indiana. Programs The School of Education offers two baccalaureate degrees: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, and a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education. In addition, a post-baccalaureate licensing program is offered at IU Kokomo. Accreditation The School of Education at Indiana University Kokomo is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) for a period of 7 years from Spring66 October 31, 2019 2017 to Spring 2024. The accreditation does not include individual education courses that the EPP offers to P-12 educators for professional development, re-licensure, or other purposes. The School of Education is also accredited by the Indiana Department of Education. Student's Responsibility Advisors assist students in planning a program of study to satisfy requirements; however, each student assumes final responsibility for meeting deadlines and completing requirements for licensure and/or graduation. It is therefore essential that all students be familiar with the degree and licensure requirements set forth in the bulletin and student handbooks. Affirmative Action The School of Education has a strong policy against discrimination that affects student teaching and teacher placement. Discrimination refers to the exclusion of a teacher or a prospective teacher from any position, assignment, or learning opportunity on the basis of any of the following criteria: race, color, minor variations in accent or dialect, religion, gender, national or social origin, economic condition of birth, age, disability, sexual orientation, or any other criterion not directly related to ability as a teacher. The central characteristic of discrimination is the denial of an objective judgment of individual worth by assigning, deliberately or unintentionally, stereotyped status to an individual. It thus introduces criteria that are not relevant to confirmable professional judgment of the quality of an individual's performance. Any complaint concerning discrimination should be called to the attention of the Dean of the School of Education at IU Kokomo. Services Available to Education Students Placement Services for Education Students The Office of Placement and Student Services in the School of Education at Bloomington accepts registration from any person who has either earned a degree from Indiana University or who successfully completed 30 credit hours at Indiana University. Students are encouraged to complete their placement dossiers prior to graduation. The IU Kokomo Office of Career Development and Placement also is available to assist students in preparing and conducting a job search. The office is a point of contact between employers and students or alumni seeking employment. Other Opportunities Undergraduate Research Opportunities are frequently available for undergraduate students to work with faculty on education research projects, and they may be supported by grants. Each student is strongly encouraged to consult with faculty whose academic area is congruent with the student's interest. Honors Program Students with at least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to earn both university and education honors. Honors in education may be completed within two years and include a summer internship. Interested students should contact the Honors program director for further information. Organizations A student organization, the Education Student Advisory Council (EdSAC), represents elementary student concerns to the School of Education to faculty and administration. In addition, EdSAC provides opportunities for education and service to students beyond the formal classroom. The organization promotes educational leadership skills and assists the School in various professional activities. Pi Lambda Theta Pi Lambda Theta is an international honor and professional association of professionals from all levels of education, the health professions, and library science who have achieved high academic excellence and have a demonstrated potential for leadership. Organized in 1910, Pi Lambda Theta now has more than 16,000 members in campus and community-based chapters. The Indiana University Kokomo chapter, Gamma Gamma, has won awards for both innovation and leadership. Professional Organizations Students in the education programs at IU Kokomo are strongly encouraged to join and support external associations in their field, including the International Reading Association, the Association for Childhood Education, the National Science Teachers Association, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council for the Social Studies, and the National Council for Teachers of English. Undergraduate Programs Changes in Program Requirements All program descriptions reflect current regulatory guidelines, but programs may be altered by the School of Education to meet changing requirements of the Indiana Department of Education. Every effort will be made to ensure that changes do not jeopardize the progress of the matriculated student. However, students who extend their programs over several years should expect to be required to complete current standards. Students should confer with their advisor concerning the current educational requirements. Admission Requirements Students are admitted directly into the School of Education upon declaring an education major. To complete admission, each student must attend an orientation seminar and be assigned an advisor. Admission to the education major does not guarantee subsequent admission to the Teacher Education Program. Transfer Credit Policies The following policies govern the transfer of credit at IU Kokomo and in this program: 1.The Office of Admissions determines the credit that may be accepted from other institutions and applied toward a degree. 2.Courses from other institutions applied toward an undergraduate education degree must be equivalent to courses offered at Indiana University. 3.Credit is only accepted for work from approved accredited institutions. 4.No more than 64 credits required by the degree earned at a junior or community college will apply toward an undergraduate degree at Indiana University.October 31, 2019 67 5.No credit will be allowed for work in which the student has earned a letter grade lower than C or its equivalent. Teacher Education Program (TEP) The IU Kokomo teacher education programs leading to initial licensure in Indiana are based on the Professional Educator Model, which is aimed at the development of teachers from novice to professional. Elements of the programs include content knowledge; general pedagogical knowledge; curriculum knowledge; knowledge of learners characteristics; pedagogical content knowledge; knowledge of educational contexts; and knowledge of education ends; purposes, values, and their philosophical and historical grounds.

Thus, our program contributes to IU Kokomo's mission of providing undergraduate coursework leading to the baccalaureate degree for residents of North Central Indiana. We in the psychology department strive to help our majors understand the major theoretical approaches to human behavior and cognition; develop abilities to gather, analyze, synthesize, and apply psychology information; develop a healthy skepticism about conclusions presented without supporting data; and communicate more effectively. The psychology program seeks to provide students the opportunity to develop and achieve their personal and career aspirations, including opportunities for engaging in research with faculty, independent research, and practicum experiences within the community. Thus, our program contributes to IU Kokomo's mission to enhance research and develop partnerships between our degree and various community programs. Majors/Minors Bachelors Degrees Bachelor of Arts in Psychology Bachelor of Science in Psychology, General Science TrackBachelor of Science in Psychology, Psychological Science Track Minors Psychology Masters Degree Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling Courses Undergraduate Courses Graduate Courses Bachelor of Arts in Psychology The Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology provides broad coverage of modern scientific psychology, including the methods by which knowledge is acquired in this field. As a science, psychology seeks to understand the basic principles by which living organisms adapt their behavior to the changing physical and social environments in which they live. The breadth of the discipline, with its links to the humanities, mathematics, computer sciences, and other social and natural sciences, encourages the development of broad problem-solving skills through exposure to research methodology and statistical analysis and contributes to personal growth and the development of communication skills. The psychology major requirements reflect the belief of the faculty that all psychology majors should be exposed to a core of courses, and be allowed to select other courses in the field that are of particular interest. The major is designed so that, in consultation with his or her advisor, each student will be prepared to enter the workforce prepared for positions in human services, social services, or business areas such as personnel or management. The major requirements are also suitable for the psychology major who is considering furthering his or her education at the graduate level in social work, marriage and family counseling, vocational counseling, or the more traditional applied and experimental psychology programs. The program is also appropriate for those who would like to pursue careers that emphasize scientific training and quantitative skills. 1.See the \"Degree Requirements for a B.A. in Humanities and Social Sciences\" section under the \"School of Humanities and Social Sciences\" for General Education and other basic requirements. 2.As part of the General Education, students are required to take ENG-W221 Sophomore Writing Lab: Writing in the Social Sciences.

Through teaching, scholarship, and service, the Department of Sociology provides educational experiences that encourage students to think sociologically about the significance of social structures and processes, multicultural perspectives, and emerging interdependencies among members of the global community. Through a variety of courses for the undergraduate student, both on campus and online, we provide our students with academic programs and varied practical experiences that enhance their understanding and application of Sociology and the sociological imagination. The B.A. and B.S. in Sociology serves as a strong foundation for graduate work in Sociology as well as in other professional fields such as social services, health services, community work, law and government, business, teaching, and college services. As part of a liberal arts education, the Department of Sociology reflects IU Kokomo's broader mission by encouraging the development of critical thinking, effective communication, responsibilities of community membership, and other transferable skills as part of career preparation.

Confidentiality of Student Records In accordance with federal statutes and regulations, student records are confidential. Disclosure of any information contained in these records to anyone other than the student will be made only in accordance with procedures described in the Code of Student Ethics. Professional Liability Insurance All undergraduate nursing students have liability insurance under the malpractice contract of Indiana University. This policy covers students only while caring for patients/clients in the student role as part of an IU course. Health Insurance Students are required to have health insurance once admitted to the major, and should carry their card with them during each clinical course. Should an incident necessitating student treatment occur while in the clinical setting, associated costs will be the responsibility of the student and billed to the student's insurance provider.October 31, 2019 143 Failure to maintain health insurance is grounds for dismissal from the program. Health Requirements All nursing students must provide evidence of compliance with health and safety requirements (immunizations, drug and TB testing, physical examination, background check, CPR, and orientation requirements). Failure to adhere to the policy as posted in the BSN Student Handbook may lead to serious consequences, up to and including course failure and program dismissal. Requirements are subject to change at the discretion of healthcare agencies. Evidence of student compliance with each of the requirements will be provided to the clinical agency upon request. Notification of requirement changes will be forwarded as soon as they are communicated to the school. Submission of this documentation is a requirement of the healthcare agencies. Failure to submit the documentation will result in non-placement for clinical courses, and thus prohibit the student from progressing in the nursing major. Clinical Attendance Missing 20% or more of the clinical hours for a course will constitute failure in that course. Students are expected to attend every scheduled clinical, excepting illness or approved absence. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Inappropriate Behavior in Clinical Setting If at any time, in the judgment of an IU Kokomo School of Nursing faculty member, a student appears to be unable to perform clinical responsibilities safely or in any way compromises safe client care, the student will be dismissed from clinical for that day and may not return until the situation is resolved to the satisfaction of the School of Nursing. If a representative of the clinical facility and/or faculty member requests the student have a drug screen prior to leaving the facility, the student must comply (at the student's expense) or face dismissal from the nursing program. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Standardized Testing Students in the pre-licensure nursing major will be required to take standardized competency tests pertaining to each of the major content areas throughout the curriculum, as well as at program entry and near graduation. These exams may be scheduled at times other than course meeting times. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Dosage Calculation Testing Students must pass a medication administration proficiency exam at 90% in the sophomore 2 semester in order to progress to the junior year. Medication calculation questions may appear on any or all core nursing exams, even if such calculation was not a part of the material taught directly in that course. Dress Code While in clinical and laboratory experiences, nursing students are expected to wear professional attire and the approved photo identification badge in compliance with the BSN Student Handbook. Students not appropriately attired may be asked to leave the clinical area by theirinstructor. BSN students admitted to the nursing major are required to purchase the official Indiana University nursing uniform bearing the Indiana University logo. The IU Kokomo crimson scrub uniform is to only be worn when the student is in clinical or laboratory or other activities in which the student is representing the School of Nursing. While in uniform, students are expected to behave in a professional manner. Transportation Requirements Clinical learning experiences are varied in setting, location, day of week, and time of day. Students are responsible for providing their own transportation to and from all clinical experiences. Drug-Free Campus Policy Students are prohibited by Indiana University to use or possess alcoholic beverages, any drug or controlled substance, or drug paraphernalia on university property or in the course of a university activity or student organization activity. Students are responsible for acquainting themselves with this policy and with sanctions for violation of the policy. This policy includes any educational experience associated with successfully completing the nursing program. Eligibility for Licensure Those who apply for licensure examination as a registered nurse in the state of Indiana are required to submit to the Indiana State Board of Nursing written evidence, verified by oath, that they (1) have not been convicted of any act that would constitute grounds for disciplinary sanction under the State Board rules and regulations, or any felony that has direct bearing on their ability to practice competently (note that convictions include the possession and use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances); (2) have completed an approved high school course of study or its equivalent, as approved by the appropriate educational agency; (3) have completed all graduation requirements at a state-accredited school of nursing; (4) have completed a criminal background check; and (5) fingerprinting. It is each student's responsibility to meet licensure application deadlines. Students wishing to take the licensure examination in another state must contact that state's board of nursing directly. International students and graduates of foreign nursing programs should contact the Indiana State Board of Nursing for specific licensure requirements. Sex Offenders Screening Policy The Indiana Sex Offenders Registry is reviewed every semester for all enrolled students. Any student enrolled in an undergraduate nursing program who has been convicted of a sex offense against children shall be dismissed from the program. Any student already admitted to an undergraduate nursing program whose name appears on the Registry during the time of enrollment in the nursing major shall be ineligible for continuation or completion of their current or any other nursing program. Back Academic Policies for Undergraduate Nursing Programs Good Standing144 October 31, 2019 In order to remain in good standing, a student must: Maintain a grade of C (2.0) or above in required general education (pre-nursing) courses, with not more than one repeat in any course. Repeat no more than three (3) required general education courses. Of the three (3) courses, no more than two (2) courses may be a science. Maintain a grade of C (2.0) or above in each Nursing major course. Progression Progression to the next level of didactic and clinical courses is contingent upon successful completion of the previous semester's general education, didactic, and clinical courses. Academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation when the semester grade point average is below a 2.0 or when the cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Academic probation will be removed following the semester in which the cumulative and semester grade point averages are 2.0 or higher. Continuation in the Program The internal grade point average (nursing GPA) must be at least 2.0 to enter each semester of the program. Dismissal A student will be dismissed from the program when any of the following situations occur: 1.Failure of more than three (3) required general education courses. Of the three (3) courses, only two (2) failures will be allowed in science coursework. Any grade below C (2.0) is considered failing. 2.Failure to achieve an internal grade point average (nursing GPA) of 2.0 at the completion of each semester. 3.Failure to achieve a 2.0 IU semester grade point average in any two consecutive semesters. 4.Failure to achieve a grade of C (2.0) or above in any two nursing courses on the first attempt. 5.Failure to achieve a grade of C (2.0) or above in any one nursing course or in one of a co-requisite set of didactic and laboratory (clinical) nursing courses by the second attempt. 6.Failure to meet probationary stipulations (for example, learning contracts and tutoring sessions) in the semester following the assignment of probation. 7.Lack of personal integrity, as demonstrated by but not limited to falsification of records and reports, plagiarism, or cheating on an examination, quiz, or any other assignment. 8.A health condition that has the potential to place the student or patients under his/her care at a safety risk. 9.Failure to adhere to legal and ethical professional requirements, including, but not limited to confidentiality rules (i.e. HIPAA). Students who are admitted to the major but fail to register for first semester courses must seek readmission to the program, subject to competitive review.Any student who has been dismissed from the school has the right to make an appeal according to the guidance in the BSN Student Handbook. Withdrawal Policies 1.Withdrawal from a required general education course in the semester indicated in the curriculum design requires approval from the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing. 2.Once admitted to the major, students may have only 2 nursing course withdrawals. 3.If a student withdraws from any course that has a didactic, clinical or laboratory components, they must withdraw from all the components. 4.Failure to register in each sequential semester, excluding summer sessions, constitutes withdrawal from the nursing program. 5.After the date for withdrawal with an automatic 'W' has passed, if a student chooses to withdraw from any course the instructor may assign a grade of either W or F, depending upon the level of work to date. Reinstatement Students who have interrupted their nursing program for at least 1 semester and wish to return need to adhere to the following procedural steps: (1) submit written notification of their intent to reenter the program to the Nursing and Allied Health Advising Center AND the pre-licensure track assistant dean by March 15 for fall semester, or October 15 for spring semester; and (2) submit current health and safety requirements August 1 for fall semester, or December 1 for spring semester. All requests for reentry will be evaluated on the basis of the availability of classroom and clinical space. Regardless of the reason for the extended absence, the 6- year rule applies for program completion. Students whose program progression is interrupted will be subject to any curriculum and/or policy changes occurring during the period of interrupted progress. All students must successfully complete an individualized clinical and math skill competency plan as determined by the Assistant Dean of the Pre-Licensure Track or designee prior to the start of the semester for clinical re-entry/ continuation. Intercampus Transfers Students in the nursing major who are in good academic standing may seek intercampus transfer by sending a written request to the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing. Intercampus transfer requests will be evaluated individually on the basis of student record review. Transfer students must meet or exceed admission qualifications relevant to the class into which transfer is requested. Further, the availability of courses, faculty, and facilities to meet student needs and program objectives will be considered. Academic Status Full-time status is given to undergraduate students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours during a regular semester or 6 or more credit hours during a summer term. Enrollment of fewer than 12 credit hours during a regular semester or fewer than 6 during a summer termOctober 31, 2019 145 constitutes part-time status. This may impact the student's qualification for financial aid. Auditing of Courses Students have the option of registering for non-nursing classes on a credit or audit basis. Students who are auditing must officially register for a class and pay the applicable fees. Upon completion, the course is entered on the permanent university transcript as taken for no credit (NC). Required general education courses taken for NC will not apply toward completion of nursing program requirements. Students may not audit any lab or clinical nursing course. The opportunity to audit a didactic nursing course is dependent on the availability of space and demonstration of adequate program progression on the part of the student. Correspondence/Independent Study Courses Students must have completed any correspondence/ independent study courses prior to enrollment in the final semester of the program or register for the on-campus course in the final semester. Prior Learning Credit Any student, pre-licensure BSN or RN to BSN, may earn up to 15 credits of prior learning credit. Of these 15 hours, up to 3 credit hours of nursing elective credit may be earned by pre-licensure BSN students, and up to 6 credit hours of nursing elective credit may be earned by RN to BSN students. The student must provide evidence acceptable to a committee of nursing faculty that such credit is warranted. For example--a military medic may apply for such credits based on the work she/he did in the field. For RNs elective credit may be related to work experience--1 credit hour for each 4 continuous years of at least 20 hours/week employment (up to 6 credits) or a national certification (3 credits), etc. Elective nursing credits do not take the place of required nursing courses. The remaining credits (up to a total of 15 for previous learning) may come from the student petitioning the school normally responsible for those credits--if the student wants to get credit for a composition course then the student must petition the English Department, etc. This might be a student who has written copy for a newspaper and can bring their portfolio of work to show the committee in the English Department so they can judge the quality and appropriateness of the work to meet a given course's requirements. For RN to BSN students, the Assistant Dean of the RN to BSN track will determine appropriateness of all credit requests. Prior learning credit is based on work or life experience, not on formal education as formal education that has credits associated may be transferred in as appropriate. Prior learning credits do not include the 35 credits students are granted upon completion of a certain portion of the RN to BSN curriculum. Determination of Grade Point Average (GPA) The Cumulative Grade Point Average is a reflection of all work completed at Indiana University. Courses transferred from another institution are not used in calculating this average. The Interim Grade Point Average reflects grades received between the time students are admitted to thenursing major and the time that they actually begin nursing course work. Students must maintain a 2.5 interim GPA, or admission to the major will be revoked. If the admission is revoked, reapplication to the major is required. The Pre- nursing Grade Point Average includes all IU and transfer grades earned in the pre-nursing courses applicable toward the program, including initial and repeat attempts and excluding IU FX'd grades. Nursing Contact Hours Theory or didactic course credits are generally arranged on a one-to-one credit/contact hour basis. (For example, a 3-credit-hour course meets three hours per week for 15 weeks.) Clinical laboratory courses are scheduled in a 1-to-3 ratio. (For example, a 2-credit course meets six hours per week for 15 weeks). Additionally, the School of Nursing abides by a 50-minute hour in clinical and lab courses. Some differences may occur in courses with significant online or outside experiential learning. Back Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program of Study The purpose of the baccalaureate program is to offer a program for the education of professional nurses prepared to meet current and future healthcare needs of society. The curriculum prepares a generalist in professional nursing and prepares students for graduate study. Baccalaureate education in nursing requires a broad foundation in the sciences and humanities necessary for preparing professional nurses capable of practicing as knowledgeable generalists, and who are responsible, informed citizens in a democratic society. The baccalaureate graduate in nursing uses the nursing process to assist clients in attaining mutually established health goals and in adapting patterns of functioning to promote maximum health potential. As a generalist, the graduate practices in the roles of provider of care, manager of care, and member of the profession. The baccalaureate nurse is responsible and accountable for providing quality nursing care in practice settings that include, but are not limited to, hospital, home, and community. The graduate demonstrates leadership behavior in collaborating with interdisciplinary health team members and others to design health care plans and to develop more efficient and effective approaches to health care delivery and achievement of desired health outcomes. Program Learning Outcomes for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing meet the nationally recognized standards: AACN Essentials of Baccalaureate Nursing Practice (2013), the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, the ANA Standards of Practice, and the Indiana State Nurse Practice Act. Differences between tracks relate to the distinctive needs of the pre-licensure and RN to BSN student.

School of Sciences Dean: Christian Chauret Associate Caruvana, Mohammad Hong Liu, Tebbe, Chen Zhong Senior Leda Casey, Ashley Linda Supervisors: Sara Deyo, Carrie Kinsey Laboratory Instructor: Nicole Houston Mission The mission of the School of Sciences is to provide students with the academic, research, and experiential background that will enable majors to pursue meaningful careers or additional education in STEM-related fields, or to meet general education or program requirements in other majors. Students graduating from the School of Sciences will be lifelong learners and able to make positive contributions in a world facing challenges in quantitative and scientific literacy, public health, sustainability, and technological advancements. Degrees Courses in the School of Sciences can be taken in various areas: natural sciences, mathematics, computer science and informatics. The general studies program is also housed in the School of Sciences. Course descriptions and specific degree requirements for each area follow after a general discussion of curricula and degrees. The School of Sciences offers several Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, as well as Bachelor of General Studies degree. These degrees are four-year undergraduate degrees requiring 120 credit hours of coursework. Students wishing a greater emphasis on their major will likely opt to earn a B.S. degree in their discipline. The B.S. degrees follow the campus-wide general education curriculum. On the other hand, students wishing a greater emphasis on courses outside the School of Sciences will likely opt to earn a B.A. degree in their selected discipline. The B.A. degrees follow the general education requirements established in the past by the former School of Arts and Sciences, which has a stronger emphasis on the social sciences and humanities than the campus-wide general education curriculum. However, it also meets the campus-wide general education curriculum. The specific general education requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degrees differ from those required for Bachelor of Science degrees. Thus, students must work closely with an academic advisor to ensure that the appropriate general education courses are taken along with the courses required for their major. The Bachelor of General Studies degree offers a flexible program whichconsists of a core of arts and sciences courses and a wide range of electives. The BGS degree follows the campus- wide general education curriculum. In addition to the bachelor's degrees, the School of Sciences offers minors in biology, chemistry, environmental and earth sciences, informatics, and mathematics. Minors in areas from different Schools or units on campus can also be completed. Please consult an advisor for additional information. The School of Sciences also offers collaborative online graduate certificates in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The unique nature and flexibility of the School of Sciences programs enable students to tailor their degree selection to focus their studies in a particular field of interest, thus preparing themselves for a specific career or graduate school objective. Through majors in the School of Sciences, a student may complete all of the pre-professional requirements for medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physician assistant, physical therapy, or optometry in the process of earning a Bachelor's degree at IU Kokomo. See an academic advisor for details.

(765) 455-9339 Special Programs The faculty at IU Kokomo have designed two programs that will enhance your academic experience. The IU Kokomo Honors Program offers educational and cultural opportunities to foster intellectual curiosity and professional development. In addition to engaging coursework, honor students are given special opportunities to work with faculty on research projects, to present their work at conferences, and to receive individualized mentoring from faculty members in their major area of study. The Overseas Study Program provides students with opportunities to study in a variety of countries for a semester or a year. In addition, the faculty have designed courses that include one week travel experiences as part of a course. These trips usually occur over spring break or in the summer. Honors Program The IU Kokomo Academic Honors Program offers educational and cultural opportunities to foster intellectual curiosity and professional development for talented, highly motivated, and creative students. In additionto coursework, Honors students are given special opportunities, for example, to participate with faculty on research projects, to present their work at regional conferences, and to receive individualized counseling. There are two types of honors courses. Honors colloquia are three-credit courses that focus on interdisciplinary topics, such as \"Ethics and Technology\" and \"Human Intelligence.\" H-Option courses provide students with a way to gain honors credit from regular courses. An H-Option section runs concurrently with a section of a regular course, and the Honors student attends class with other students. The instructor and the Honors student develop a special set of course requirements to fit the student's abilities and interests; typically these include many of the regular requirements. To do this, students must complete an H-Option contract form with the professor's approval and submit the form to the Honors director, who will then arrange for honors credit upon completion of the project. H-Option course sections may also be set up for internships, independent studies, field- work experience, undergraduate thesis, or other research/ creative projects. Students should consult the Honors Director for currently offered honors courses. Incoming freshman students are eligible to apply if they have combined SAT scores of 1100 or better (or an ACT score of 23) and if they have ranked in the upper 20 percent of their high school graduating class. Continuing students who have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours at IU Kokomo and maintain a GPA of 3.3 or higher are also eligible to apply. There are two notations of student attainment. These are noted on the student's diploma and transcript. Students may attain both University Honors and Honors in their majors. University Honors To qualify for the University Honors notation, students must complete 9 credit hours in honors course work inside and outside the major, a presentation of work at a student conference, plus two honors colloquia of 3 credits each. Major Honors Each academic division has special honors courses available for students who are majoring in disciplines offered by the division. (There are no major honors available for AHLT students at this time.) To qualify for the degree in major honors, the student must complete 9 credit hours in honors course work in the major, as determined by the division or department, a presentation of work at a student conference, plus two honors colloquia of 3 credits each. Students may count the same two honors colloquia as satisfying both university and major honors requirements. Major Honors in Nursing The major honors in the baccalaureate nursing program follows the general guidelines of the IU Kokomo University Honors program. Students secure eligibility to participate and remain in the major honors in nursing by attending to the eligibility criteria outlined for the Academic Honors Program. Aware of the special needs of superior nursing students, the Major Honors in Nursing Program provides these outstanding students with a variety of opportunities to enrich their nursing career and the nursing professionOctober 31, 2019 191 overall. To graduate with honors in nursing, a nursing student must complete 6 credit hours in honors courses in nursing as well as two 2-credit hour honors colloquium courses. Honors projects within a course are meant to enhance or broaden regular course work. However, the work is in lieu of specific course activities, not in addition to those activities. Honors activities may include: research papers, field work, visual or oral presentations, creative works, analytical library work, annotating a bibliography, writing a series of position papers, or participating in a major scientific project. Honors nursing students and faculty responsible for teaching the specific honors courses work together to create a project and a contract for completing the project. Overseas Study Program IU Kokomo students are eligible to participate in Indiana University's overseas study programs offered at a number of universities including the Kokomo campus. Most credits earned in these programs are considered Indiana University credits, not transfer credits; however, dependent on the course of study selected, some of the courses offered may earn transfer credits. When students enroll in IU programs, they will discover that most university scholarships and loans are applicable to the fees for these programs. Credit usually satisfies Indiana University degree requirements and generally meets the residence requirements. Programs are not restricted to language majors. In fact, there are a broad range of courses offered in multiple schools, geared to meeting varied student interests. Undergraduate students, particularly liberal arts majors, are encouraged to explore the possibilities of experiencing a semester or an academic year at a university in another country. Overseas Programs IU administered and IU co-sponsored programs include the following: 1.One year of college-level language (College of Arts and Sciences language requirement) or the equivalent. 2.Two years of college-level language or the equivalent. 3.Three years of college-level language or the equivalent. Academic-Year Programs: Bologna, Italy Canterbury, England Legon, Ghana Hamburg, Germany Jerusalem, Israel Madrid, Spain Nagoya, Japan Nanjing, People's Republic of China Paris, France (critical studies, film studies) San Jose, Costa Rica S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Strasbourg, France Semester Programs: Adelaide, Australia Alicante, Spain Athens, Greece Beijing, People's Republic of China Budapest, Hungary Canberra, Australia Costa Rica (tropical biology) Freiburg, Germany Leiden, The Netherlands (Public and Environmental Affairs) London, England Maastricht, The Netherlands (business) Madrid, Spain Paris, France Prague, Czech Republic Rennes, France Rotterdam, The Netherlands (public and environmental affairs) Rouen, France (business) Santiago, Chile Santiago, Chile (business) Seoul, South Korea Seville, Spain (language, liberal arts) Singapore (business) St. Petersburg, Russia Tokyo, Japan Wollongong, Australia Summer Language Programs: Baden Wurttemberg, Germany Florence, Italy Graz, Austria Guanajuato, Mexico London, England Maastricht, The Netherlands (business) Mexico City, Mexico Mikkeli, Finland (business) Oldenburg, Germany Paris, France Quebec, Canada Salamanca, Spain St. Petersburg, Russia Shorter Travel Options: Annually, short term travel options may be included within a regular course offered at IU Kokomo. In the past, students have traveled on trips of 14 days or less to England, Guatemala, France, Ireland, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Turkey. Courses offering such travel have ranged from the Hispanic Culture and Health Care Practicum (Guatemala), to courses on Irish, British and Italian culture, to courses in art history in Italy or France, to a course on Irish drama, or a Korean Health Care Practicum, among others. These courses are announced in the spring or fall prior to travel and students often engage in fundraising and other preparations in advance of actual enrollment. In addition, IU Kokomo students are eligible to participate in any of a large number of foreign study programs administered by other U.S. colleges and universities. Students interested in overseas study are advised to start planning as far ahead as possible in order to facilitate their choices and ease preparations. For further information, please consult the IU Kokomo Overseas Studies coordinator, Donna McLean, (765) 455-9442 or by e-mail at: domclean@iuk.edu .192 October 31, 2019 Kokomo Experience and YOU Program The KEY to Your Future Indiana University Kokomo is the home of the KEY (\"Kokomo Experience and You\"), a four-year experiential- learning program designed to transform students' professional, personal, and civic lives. We call it \"the best four years of your life\u2014so far.\" The Experience of a Lifetime\u2014for a Lifetime of Experience Employers agree there is no substitute for experience. So do our students. Experience\u2014seeing, feeling, and especially doing\u2014teaches crucial knowledge and skills, but it also does something more. Experience makes learning come alive. It builds connections and confidence. It makes education engaging, relevant, and fun. \"Being in an intimate space with intelligent, artistic people was invigorating. One of the few times I felt like I deserved to be where I was and I belonged there.\" -New Media, Art, and Technology student on retreat at Camp Tecumseh \"I have always been nervous around my classmates, but I'm not anymore. I learned many valuable things, such as I am a leader and a captain.\" -Education student on retreat at Bradford Woods \"It was really awesome to hear that someone from Kokomo was actually doing this, and made the goals we set seem more reachable and attainable.\" -Sociology student on trip to Graduate Expo in Indianapolis \"The trip to Chicago was incredible. We got to connect with past IU alumni and ask them questions about their profession and how they got there. They gave me so much advice that I never thought about before the trip.\" -Communication student, Sophomore Sojourn to Chicago \"I learned so much about some of my classmates and I feel more at home.\" -Education student on retreat at Bradford Woods Education is What We . Experience is at the heart of the KEY. It comes in a variety of forms, depending on a student's major. Our Communication students have traveled to Chicago, where they heard from IU alumni already succeeding in the world of public relations, toured WBEZ studios and Wrigley Field, and met professionals at Ketchum, one of the world's leading PR firms. Students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management spent two days in Louisville studying Churchill Downs and other attractions. Criminal Justice students have toured Bankers Life Fieldhouse with a CJ professional, who discussed security measures and strategies. Students in Medical Imaging Technology regularly visit a trade show in Chicago, where they interview vendors about equipment. Hundreds of students in Nursing, Sciences, and Health Sciences have attended conferences, and many have presented their own research. Many students exercise their creative muscles in retreats, where they immersed themselves in their art or writing, and publish their work in our Field magazine. Psychologystudents have studied equine therapy (and met the horse therapists in \"person\"). Countless other experiences include internships and externships, participation in national and international business competitions, design projects for real clients, and trips to Google offices and the Field Museum in Chicago, the Underground Railroad Museum in Cincinnati, Shaker Village in Kentucky, an international grocery in Indianapolis, and other sites where students study computing, biology, history, nutrition, and other subjects up close and personal with their classmates, teachers, alumni, and professionals in the field. Students participate in all of these experiences at little or no additional cost to them. Thanks to scholarships, many also can afford to travel to other parts of the world, including Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Guatemala, South Korea, and Yellowstone National Park. A Lifetime of Success Based on outcomes that both employers and educators value, the KEY prepares students for a lifetime of success. Through a wide variety of hands-on experiences, our students learn to apply and integrate their knowledge and skills, collaborate with others, take initiative, and develop a mindset for success and service. Along the way, they make important connections with classmates, faculty, staff, administrators, and members of the larger community while developing the confidence to become their best selves. Fulfilling the Promise The KEY is IU Kokomo's own special way of realizing Indiana University's mission of \"Fulfilling the Promise.\" Our promise to students is simple and heartfelt: \"Get ready to love learning, graduate on time, land a good job, and start changing the world. #You are the KEY.\" University Policies Students are responsible for the requirements and regulations described herein. In addition, the Indiana University Kokomo Bulletin is not intended to be a comprehensive compilation of academic and administrative policies. Students are expected to be familiar with the various regulations that are office-specific, such as regulations related to financial aid, the Office of the Registrar, academic majors, as well as campus-wide rules, to include the Student Code of Conduct. Although every effort is made to provide accurate and current information, Indiana University Kokomo reserves the right to change rules, policies, fees, curricula, courses, and other programs described to reflect faculty or administrative action. Citizenship Verification Effective July 1, 2011, Indiana state law requires that Indiana University collect verification of citizenship from every individual who applies for \"state or local public benefits.\" The legislation stipulates that students who are not lawfully residing in the United States are: ineligible for in-state tuition rates ineligible for scholarships, grants, assistantships or other aid funded by the universityOctober 31, 2019 193 All students are required to complete an electronic citizenship verification within OneStart.

As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Indiana University does not discriminate on thebasis of sex in its educational programs and activities, including employment and admission. Questions specific to Title IX may be referred to the Office for Civil Rights or the University Title IX Coordinator. Indiana University shall take affirmative action, positive and extraordinary, to overcome the discriminatory effects of traditional policies and procedures with regard to the disabled, minorities, women, and veterans. If you have questions or problems related to any of the protected classes list above contact Sarah Sarber, the Affirmative Action Officer, at (765) 455-9316 or room 212B of Hunt Hall. Military Reserve Policy Indiana University realizes that students who are members of the Indiana military reserves may be called to active duty. The following policy is provided in order to minimize disruptions or inconveniences for students fulfilling their military responsibilities. Any student called to active duty may withdraw from all courses and receive a 100 percent refund of tuition and fees. Alternatively, with the permission of the instructor(s), a student may receive an incomplete or a final grade in the courses taken. Either alternative may occur anytime during the semester through the end of final examinations. If the withdrawal is processed after the first week of classes, the grade of W will be assigned initially. Students receiving financial aid will be subject to the refund policies of the agencies sponsoring the aid. The request to withdraw needs to be made within one week of being called to active duty and may be made by either the student or other responsible party who has the student's military information. Students who wish to withdraw from courses as a result of being called to active duty must provide a copy of their orders to the Office of the Registrar on their campus along with a signed note asking to be withdrawn. These materials may be delivered in person, through the mail, or by fax to the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors, the student's school, and other campus offices. Students or other responsible parties may wish to call the Office of the Registrar first to begin the withdrawal process, with the understanding that a copy of the orders needs to be forthcoming. For any questions about this process or to request a withdrawal from all classes due to military orders, contact the Office of the Registrar on your campus. We will be happy to talk about your particular situation so we can minimize inconvenience to you. Residency Because IU is a state-funded public university, in-state and out-of-state students pay different rates for tuition. The rules for determining residence are established by the Trustees of Indiana University. The initial determination of a student's residency status is made at the time of admission. If the student is found to be a nonresident and wishes to appeal the decision, the student should contact the Office of the Registrar for an Application for Classification as a Resident Student. For further information, review the rules for residency and the classification application:October 31, 2019 195 Application for Classification as a Resident Student Rules for Residency Undergraduate Program Regulations The university's academic policies, rules, and procedures have been developed for the collective good of the university community. The information contained in this section is under the authority of the faculty, except for mandates from state and federal statutes. Absence Illness is usually the only acceptable excuse for absence from class. Other absences must be explained to the satisfaction of the instructor, who will decide whether omitted work may be made up. The names of students who are excessively absent are to be reported by their instructors to the Office of the Registrar. Academic Standing of Students, Including Probation and Dismissal A student is considered to be a candidate in good standing for an Indiana University degree when admitted into a degree program by the Office of Admissions, when the academic grade point average is not less than a 2.0 (C) for the last semester's work, and when the cumulative average is not below the same. The following policy regarding academic probation and dismissal applies to all Indiana University Kokomo students. Probation Indiana University Kokomo places a student on academic probation to notify a student that his or her academic performance is falling short of what is needed to eventually earn a degree and is at risk of being dismissed in a subsequent semester. The university encourages such a student to work with an academic advisor to make plans to improve their performance in subsequent semesters so that they can succeed and graduate. Probation works as follows: Any student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. A student may be continued on probation when his/her semester GPA is above a 2.0 but his/her cumulative GPA is below 2.0. A student will be removed from academic probation when he/she has a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Dismissal Dismissal from the university occurs when a student has ceased to make adequate progress toward a degree. Students who have been dismissed from an IU campus cannot enroll at any IU campus until the appropriate amount of time has passed (as noted in the Readmission Policy referenced below). A student on academic probation, or who has ever been on academic probation at Indiana University Kokomo, shall be dismissed from Indiana University Kokomo if his/her semester GPA is below 2.0 and his/her cumulative GPA is below that required in the bulleted list below. Credit Hours Completed at Minimum Cumulative GPA Close of Semester (Total Grade Pts./Total Cr. Hrs.) 12 - 24 - 1.50 25 - 36 - 1.75 37 - 45 - 1.90 46 or more - 2.00 1.Beginning students who attempted 12 or more credit hours (including Ws) must obtain a semester GPA greater than 0.00 at the end of their first semester or they will be dismissed. 2.Continuing students will not be evaluated for possible dismissal until they have completed 12 credit hours. 3.A student will be removed from academic probation when he/she has a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. 4.Summer sessions will count as one semester when determining academic standing. 5.Note: The faculty of a school, division or degree program may enact more stringent or more specific policies governing probation, suspension or readmission in that school, division or degree program. As such, students also may be dismissed from their school or program if they fail to meet academic or professional standards. Such students will be informed of their dismissal in writing by the school's dean or the dean's campus representative. Readmission Students may apply for readmission after dismissal. The policy on readmission can be found at http:// www.academic-affairs/faculty-resources/readmission- policy.php (Faculty Senate, 9/18/2006; Revised 4/18/2016, 1/14/2019 Application for Graduation Degrees are awarded at IU Kokomo in December, May, and August. Students planning to graduate in December must apply for their degrees by September 15. The application deadline for May and August graduation is January 15. Please go to the degree requirements section to be sure all requirements for graduation are met. Classification of Students Class standing is based on the number of Graduate: Students who have applied for and have been accepted into a graduate degree program. Dean's List The Academic Affairs honors list includes students from each undergraduate division who have met the following196 October 31, 2019 academic criteria. Full-time students must have carried at least 12 credit hours of work throughout a semester with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher. Part-time students must have accumulated a minimum of 12 credit hours during the spring semester, summer session, and fall semester with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher. Academic Affairs honor list students are recognized on Honors Day, prior to Commencement activities. Degree Requirements Each student is responsible for planning his/her own program and for meeting the following degree requirements by the time he/she expects to graduate: 1.Apply to graduate by completing and submitting a degree candidate form. Deadlines and the degree candidate form can be found on the main site at www.iuk.edu/registrar. If degree requirements are not met, a change in the graduation date must be made. It is the responsibility of the student to report this change to his/her advisor. 2.Earn a minimum of 120 credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree and 60 credit hours toward an associate degree, excluding any duplicate course credits. Some curricula require more. 3.Earn 30 of the final 60 credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree and 15 of the final 30 credit hours toward an associate degree from Indiana University Kokomo. 4.To complete a baccalaureate degree, earn a minimum of 30 credit hours at the 300- and 400- level of which 15 must be earned from Indiana University Kokomo. 5.To complete a certificate, 15 credit hours must be earned from Indiana University Kokomo. 6.Earn a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. Certain curricula require a higher minimum grade point average. Additional degree requirements may be specified by the school of the students' chosen curricula. Students should consult the relevant section of this bulletin for complete information about degree requirements for their programs. The dean of each college is responsible for certifying the completion of degree requirements for each candidate for graduation. Upon certification of the candidates for graduation, those candidates who are free of all University obligations and who are designated as having completed degree requirements are issued the corresponding diploma from the Office of the Registrar. The academic record is closed once graduation is certified; no record changes will be permitted once the degree is awarded. No further registrations beyond the semester of completion are permitted. If the graduate desires to pursue a second degree, he/she must be readmitted. Extended X Policy Any undergraduate student may retake an IU course for which he/she received a grade below an A. A student may exercise this option for no more than three courses, totaling no more than 10 credits during an academic career. In addition, a student may use this option only once for a given course. The course in which the student reenrolls should be the same course which isbeing replaced. However, course numbers and titles occasionally change, and this will be taken into account. For the course retaken, only the second grade shall be counted in the determination of the student's grade-point average (GPA). The grade for the course that has been replaced shall be marked with an \"X\" on the transcript. The student's transcript shall record both grades. To exercise the Extended X option, students must obtain an Extended X form from their academic unit, secure the appropriate signatures, and return the form to the Office of the Registrar. The following regulations apply: 1. The policy applies to undergraduate students only. 2. The FX option applies to all undergraduate schools and divisions on all Indiana University campuses. 3. Any prior undergraduate course will be eligible for replacement if the replacement course is taken Spring 2004 or later under the new policy. 4. Courses repeatable with different content are not eligible for replacement under this policy unless an academic unit chooses to permit this by means of a specific authorization procedure. 5. The following grades cannot be replaced under the Extended X Policy: S, P, W, I R, NC. In addition, a grade may not be replaced with a second grade of W, I, R, or NC. 6. A student who has failed a course due to academic dishonesty may not retake that course for grade replacement under this policy. 7. Enforcement of the Extended X policy shall be the responsibility of the school or division which certifies the student's fulfillment of degree requirements. 8. Problems relating to the policy shall be referred to the school or division dean, or the administrator fulfilling the equivalent responsibility on the campus. 9. This policy does not apply to students enrolled in the Purdue University School of Technology programs. Financial Encumbrance Students who incur a financial encumbrance are not permitted to register for another semester or receive official transcripts and will be denied all university services until the indebtedness is satisfied and the encumbrance is removed. Forgiveness Policy A \"forgiveness policy\" was adopted by IU Kokomo in 1997. The purpose of the policy is to establish an effective means for students to return to IU Kokomo after they have achieved poorly, affording them a fresh start. For details, go to the main page at http://iuk.edu/registrar/index.php . General Education The following General Education curriculum is required of each student who is granted a baccalaureate degree at the Indiana University Kokomo campus. Section 1. Preamble In 2012 the Indiana Legislature enacted Senate Enrolled Act 182, thereby establishing the requirements for a Statewide Transfer General Education Core of at least 30 credit hours. The statute states that the Core must be based upon a set of competencies in areas agreed upon by the state educational institutions.October 31, 2019 197 Total credit hours will typically number 30. Each course must be completed with a passing grade, and students must obtain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in the General Education curriculum. If a student takes more than the required number of courses within a section, the course(s) with the highest grade(s) will be used in the GPA calculation. With the exception of courses approved as satisfying learning outcomes for either Diversity or Ethically Responsible Citizenship, no course can be used twice to satisfy multiple requirements. Students should consult with their advisor for more information. Each student is subject to the General Education requirements in place when they were admitted to IU Kokomo; therefore, the requirements listed below would apply to students first enrolling in Fall 2019 and beyond. Section 2. Learning Outcomes This version of the learning outcomes for the new IU Kokomo General Education curriculum is based on the statewide general education learning outcomes, but includes some adaptions and additions that reflect the culture of the IU Kokomo campus. The Foundational Intellectual Skills category includes: Written Communication Speaking and Listening Quantitative Reasoning The second category, Ways of Knowing, comprises learning outcomes in broad, disciplinary areas, and includes: Scientific Ways of Knowing Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing Learning outcomes that relate to historical ways of knowing appear in both the Humanistic and Artistic, and the Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing. IU Kokomo has also developed two additional categories of General Education learning outcomes, Diversity and Ethically Responsible Citizenship.

An external course approved for transferring to IU Kokomo as equivalent to an IUK Liberal Arts Core course already approved for either Diversity or Ethically Responsible Citizenship will also count for either Diversity or Ethically Responsible Citizenship. Total Hours: Minimum of 30 credits Grading Policy Instructors in undergraduate and graduate courses use a grading system that includes plus and minus grades as well as straight grades for all undergraduate and graduate course records. The registrar computes numerical grades for plus and minus grades when calculating grade point averages (GPAs) cumulative grade point average of 2.0 is required for graduation. Credit points are calculated by multiplying the grade points earned in a course by the number of credit hours for that course. For example, 3 hours of A=12 grade points. The grade point average for a semester is computed by dividing the total number of credit points earned by the number of credit hours attemped. Suppose that a student has earned the following grades in a semester: 3 credit hours of A (12 credit points) 3 credit hours of B (equals 9 credit points) 3 credit hours of C+ (equals 6.9 credit points) 3 credit hours of D- (equals 2.1 credit points) 3 credit hours of F (equals 0 credit points) The semester grade point average would be 2.0 (30 credit points divided by 15 credit hours) Students have access to a GPA calculator online at Graduation with Distinction To graduate with distinction, baccalaureate and associate degree candidates must rank within the highest 10 percent of the graduating class of their respective degree-granting units. Additionally, baccalaureate candidates must have completed a minimum of 60 credit hours in residence on the campus where the degree is awarded. Associate degree candidates must have completed half of the credit hours required for their degree on the campus where the degree is awarded.Holds Holds may be placed on the record of a student for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, academic, financial or misconduct reasons. A hold may prevent services which may not be accessed without authorization from the office that placed the hold. Incompletes The grade of Incomplete (I) is an agreement between the student and the instructor. It is assigned only when the required work of the course is substantially completed and the student's work is of a passing quality. A grade of Incomplete must be removed within the time stipulated by the instructor; under no circumstances may this exceed one calendar year. If a grade of Incomplete has not been removed within the calendar year of its recording, it will be changed to an F. Students should not register for credit in a course in which they have received a grade of Incomplete. Intercampus Transfer A student changing from the Kokomo campus to another Indiana University campus does not need a transcript; however, arrangements should be made with the academic division to have required credentials other than the permanent record forwarded to the appropriate office on the other campus. Intercampus transfer is an on-line process and information can be found at http:// www.iupui.edu/~moveiu/ . Students on other IU campuses are eligible to complete an intercampus transfer as long as they have not been dismissed from another IU campus. If a student has been dismissed, the IU Kokomo readmission policy applies. Moreover, when a student's GPA and total credits would warrant dismissal from IU Kokomo, IU Kokomo's readmission policy will apply. Students requesting an ICT with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or greater and a most recent semester GPA of 2.0 or greater are considered in good standing. Students who do not meet the above criteria are probationary transfers. The IU Kokomo policy regarding probation and dismissal will apply to these students. Pass/Fail Option The P/F option, which permits students to designate courses to be recorded for either Pass (P) or Fail (F), is available to all undergraduate students for a maximum of two elective courses per academic calendar year, with a maximum of eight courses to be applied toward graduation. These courses may not include those offered only on a Satisfactory/ Fail basis. Graduate students may elect the option for a maximum of four elective courses (which may be restricted to one such course per semester) to be applied toward graduation. Other specific course limitations vary from division to division. The student should consult a divisional advisor for details.

Gustatory, medically, refers to the sense of taste. The sense of taste helps identify food and forms a taste preference, although the appeal of both sweet- and salty-tasting substances, in large part at least, is innately determined (Beauchamp and Cowart, 1985). Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs. Thus, not only signals from the peripheral gustatory nervous system but also those obtained by recalling gustatory memories play a critical role for gustatory information processing.
