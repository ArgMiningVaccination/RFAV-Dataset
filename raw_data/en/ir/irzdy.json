This review aimed to systematically review recent studies on alternative therapies, i.e., probiotics, nanoparticles, and natural products from plants, as well as recent progress in H. pylori vaccines at the preclinical stage. Articles published from January 2018 to August 2022 were systematically searched using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline. After the screening process, 45 articles were eligible for inclusion in this review. Probiotics (n = 9 studies) and natural products from plants (n = 28 studies) were observed to inhibit the growth of H. pylori, improve immune response, reduce inflammation, and reduce the pathogenic effects of H. pylori virulence factors. Natural products from plants also showed anti-biofilm activity against H. pylori. However, clinical trials of natural products from plants and probiotics are still lacking. A paucity of data assessing the nanoparticle activity of N-acylhomoserine lactonase-stabilized silver against H. pylori was observed. Nonetheless, one nanoparticle study showed anti-biofilm activity against H. pylori.

Eradication of H. pylori is recommended to prevent gastric cancer, especially in developing countries where gastric cancer contributes to high economic morbidity and mortality [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Treatment of H. pylori includes administration of multiple antibiotics, namely, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tetracycline [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. However, the emergence of H. pylori strains that are resistant to multiple antibiotics has complicated the treatment strategy to eradicate this bacterium [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In 2018, the World Health Organization listed H. pylori as one of the high-priority pathogens for research and discovery of novel drugs [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Numerous natural products from plants have also been demonstrated to possess antibacterial activity against H. pylori, and they have been used as traditional medicine in some cultures such as East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures to treat multiple infections [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Probiotics are generally regarded as safe microbes that have been shown to give benefits to humans and are usually isolated from the fermentation process, including traditional foods [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In addition to probiotics and natural products from plants, applications of nanoparticles in drug delivery for antibiotics, implantable medical devices, and bone cement have also been explored for antibacterial effects against multiple bacteria [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Despite evidence demonstrating the efficacy of natural products from plants and probiotics against H. pylori, they are still not widely approved for therapy of H. pylori. Prevention of H. pylori infection through vaccination is also pertinent to prevent gastroduodenal diseases. To date, no vaccine for H. pylori has been approved. The objective of this review was to systematically review recent studies on alternative therapies (natural products from plants, probiotics, and nanoparticles) against H. pylori and progress of H. pylori vaccines. 2. Results 2.1. Literature Assessment [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00552-f001)illustrates the screening process adopted for inclusion and exclusion of the articles in this systematic review. A total of 7796 articles were obtained from the following literature databases: PubMed (n = 852), Scopus (n = 743), Web of Science (n = 332), and EBSCO Medline (n = 5869). After we removed the duplicates (n = 1482) and reviews (n = 3319) using Microsoft Excel 2016 and Mendeley reference manager, 2995 articles were eligible for title and abstract screening. An additional 2745 articles were excluded because they were not relevant to the research question. Hence, 250 articles were eligible for full-text evaluation, of which 205 articles were excluded because the studies (n = 53) used natural products, probiotics, or nanoparticles in combination with commercial antibiotics, and the studies were published prior to 2018 (n = 152). Finally, 45 articles were eligible to be included in this systematic review. Overall, seven studies (15.5%) were published in 2018, along with 10 (22.2%) in 2019, 10 (22.2%) in 2020, 10 (22.2%) in 2021, and eight (17.8%) in 2022. Most of the studies published were preclinical studies (n = 44; 97.8%), while only one study (2.2%) was a clinical trial. Nine studies evaluated potential probiotics against H. pylori, 28 studies evaluated plant natural products against H. pylori, one study evaluated nanoparticles only, and seven studies evaluated vaccine candidates. 2.2. Summary of Studies on Alternative Therapies and Vaccines Conducted Prior to 2018 [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In probiotics research, one clinical trial using a combination of eight bacteria administered to 40 patients showed promising results, whereby H. pylori was eradicated in 13 patients [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In summary, we found potential clinical application of alternative therapies and vaccines against H. pylori before 2018. 2.3. Antibacterial Activity also inhibited the growth of H. pylori. Synthesis of data based on the antibacterial mechanism of probiotics against H. pylori revealed that most studies (n = 4) found the administration of probiotics in either animal models or humans altered the gut microbiota of the host infected with H. pylori. In one study, mice infected with H. pylori, but treated with probiotics, were shown to harbor enriched beneficial microbes that produced short fatty acid chains such as Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Oscellibacter and anti-inflammatory microbes (Faecalibaculum) [ [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. However, in a clinical trial, probiotic monotherapy of infantis, L. \u00d7 106 CFU/tablet), and B. cereus for 14 days was not beneficial to H. pylori-infected subjects as the therapy was not successful in reducing H. pylori burden in human's stomach (ChiCTR1900024893) [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Three studies found that administration of probiotics reduced inflammation in the host, in which the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) decreased in H. pylori-infected cell lines or animal models. In addition, molecules essential in proinflammatory cellular signaling were reduced in the H. pylori-infected host model [ [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Administration of probiotics also reduced H. pylori cell adhesion, as observed in two studies [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. An increase in cell apoptosis was observed in two studies [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Furthermore, probiotics treatment was also demonstrated to reduce the effect of vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) vacuolation in cells [ A the \"hummingbird\" [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Lin et al. [ [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] also found that treatment of probiotics reduced H. pylori colonization burden and stimulated the release of metabolites important in the immune response in mice. 2.4. Antibacterial Activity of Natural Products from Plants and Nanoparticles of plants used to examine the antibacterial activity of natural products from plants against H. pylori. In total, 28 studies examining the antibacterial activity of natural products against H. pylori were included in this review. Most studies (n = 15) assessed the antibacterial activity of plant extracts, while the remaining studies (n = 13) assessed isolated compounds from plants. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value was assessed in 20 studies, among which eight studies also assessed the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) value. Most studies that reported the MIC value (n = 16) adopted the broth microdilution assay to assess MIC value, whereas the remaining studies used the disc diffusion assay (n = 2) or both the disc diffusion assay and the agar dilution method (n = 2). Nineteen out of 20 studies (95%) providing the MIC value reported the susceptibility of H. pylori against the plant extracts or isolated compounds examined, while one study (1/20; 5%) reported no direct antibacterial activity. The lowest MIC value was 1.25-5 \u00b5g/mL in a study that examined the compound nimbolide isolated from Azadirachta indica [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In addition, this compound from a similar study also demonstrated an MBC against H. pylori ranging from 2.5 to 10 g/mL. A high MIC value 500 \u00b5g/mL was reported in the studies that examined the antibacterial activity of the compound taxifolin from Mimusops balata fruit [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)], the ethyl acetate fraction of Physalis alkekengi L. var. franchetii, and the dry extract of Libidibia ferrea. The antibacterial mechanisms of plant extracts or compounds were examined in 20 studies. [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] and phylligenin, a compound isolated from flowering plant Forsythia [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)], exhibited anti-biofilm activity against H. pylori. Meanwhile, four studies found that natural plant products possessed anti-urease activity, and six studies showed the gastroprotective properties of plant natural products. Furthermore, six studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of six different plant products. Five studies showed a reduction in H. pylori virulence factors, namely, cagA, vacA, ureA, flaA, and Omp18, while three studies showed a reduction in bacterial load and colonization. Two studies each demonstrated a reduction in cellular signaling important in H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] and conversion of H. pylori from the active (spiral) to inactive coccoid form [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Li et al. [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] observed that phylligenin extracted from Forsythia induced ATP leakage in H. pylori and inhibited the mechanism of antibacterial resistance in the bacteria, as well as induced a good immune response. [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)) demonstrated the application of natural products that can be used as future alternative therapies against H. pylori. Mechanisms targeting H. pylori examined in this study included the effects of the products from plants against important H. pylori virulence factors, namely, urease and CagA, which are both important for H. pylori to establish colonization in the human stomach due to its inhospitable environment. Furthermore, the effect of plant compounds in decreasing CagA activity is also important to prevent gastric carcinogenesis orchestrated by this oncoprotein [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Nevertheless, modeling of the natural products against specific target molecules of H. pylori is still lacking. The interaction of potential compounds with H. pylori using molecular docking and machine learning, coupled with in vitro and in vivo experiments, should be conducted in the future to elucidate the mechanism of antibacterial activity. [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. In this review, only one study [ [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] examined the antibacterial activity of nanoparticles against nanoparticles (namely, N-acylhomoserine lactonase-stabilized silver nanoparticles (AiiA-AgNPs)) inhibited the quorum sensing molecules of H. pylori, which in turn reduced the biofilm formation of the bacteria, production of urease, and cell surface hydrophobicity of H. pylori [ [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. 2.5. Progress on H. pylori Vaccine [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-00552-t002). [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] targeted 169 outer membrane proteins of H. pylori. In summary, all vaccine candidates showed promising results at a preclinical level. All studies observed higher IgA and IgG levels in mice immunized with vaccine candidates compared to controls. A reduction in the bacterial load and stomach inflammation were observed in most studies (6/7; 85.7%). Furthermore, three studies showed that immunization elicited an immune response in mouse models, including an increase in the secretion of interferon gamma (IFN-), IL-4, and IL-17. Contradictory T-cell polarization was observed, whereby one study [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] observed T helper 2 (Th2) polarization in immunized mice while Peng et al. [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] observed Th17 and Th1 polarization. 3. Discussion [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Additionally, antibiotic treatment regimens to eradicate H. pylori consist of multiple antibiotics, which may hinder patient compliance and contribute to an increase in the H. pylori antibiotic resistance rate. Hence, the discovery of alternative monotherapy is pertinent in the research and development of new drugs against H. pylori. Nevertheless, studies have shown that supplementation of probiotics together with antibiotics has helped to eradicate H. pylori infection in patients [ [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-16-00552), [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Despite an observed increase in publications from 2018 to 2022 regarding the alternative therapy of H. pylori in preclinical studies, a lack of publications on human studies was noted. Factors that contribute to a lack of clinical trials on potential therapies include a lack of financial resources and skilled medical specialists, as well as government regulations and administrative issues, specifically in middle- and low-income countries [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. As the prevalence of H. pylori is high in middle- and low-income countries [ [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)], collaboration between high-income countries and middle- and low-income countries in clinical trials should be encouraged to mitigate this issue. The studies included in this systematic review showed that some probiotics exhibited antibacterial activity or competitive exclusion against H. pylori. Furthermore, antibacterial mechanisms of probiotics against H. pylori, including effects on virulence factors, the gut microbiota, and the immune response, were also explored. However, there was a lack of studies that identified and assessed the antibacterial activity of compounds secreted by probiotics against H. pylori. This gap should be examined in future studies. Of note, the clinical trial included in this review that investigated the effect of probiotic monotherapy on human subjects failed to show a beneficial effect of probiotics in human subjects. In contrast, administration of probiotics together with antibiotics was demonstrated to improve eradication with minimal adverse effects [ [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Thus, the mechanism (i.e., drug synergism and antagonism of probiotic monotherapy and probiotic supplementation with antibiotics) of combating H. pylori infection in human should be further investigated in the future. [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. However, we observed that most studies employed the broth microdilution assay to determine the MIC value. This discrepancy is because the agar dilution assay is difficult to perform and laborious, in addition to the fact that H. pylori grows slowly. Various antibacterial mechanisms of plant products against H. pylori were examined, including effects on virulence factors, bacterial burden in the host, and anti-biofilm activity. Although the emergence of multidrug-resistant H. pylori has been observed in Southeast Asia [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)], there is a paucity of recent studies examining the antibacterial activity of plant natural products in this region. Given the richness of tropical biodiversity in this region, the anti-H. pylori activities of products from plants should be explored in the future using the diverse plant species in the region. Nanoparticles have been demonstrated to display antimicrobial activity against multiple types of bacteria [ [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Nevertheless, only one recent study assessed the antibacterial activity of nanoparticles against H. pylori with promising results. Barriers to the application of nanoparticles as antibacterial agents include the design of nanoparticles for efficient delivery to the host and the toxicity of the chemical to the host [ [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. All studies conducted at the preclinical stage in this systematic review demonstrated the promising results of H. pylori vaccine candidates, in which the host's immune response was elicited in all studies. Interestingly, most studies explored the application of new vaccine technologies including vector-based vaccines using bacteria and multi-epitope vaccines targeting specific T and B cells. The unique design of multi-epitope vaccines harnesses a better immune response than single-epitope vaccines, particularly for H. pylori strains with different antigen variability [ [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Meanwhile, vector-based vaccines provide a robust immune response since live bacteria are easily recognized by the immune system, and since the delivery of live bacteria is more efficient compared to traditional vaccines [ [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. Contradictory results regarding T-cell polarization have been found, whereby Peng et al. [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] found Th1 to be polarized in H. pylori vaccination, while Liu et al. [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)] found Th2 to be polarized. Th2 cells are important to neutralize extracellular bacteria such as H. pylori, while Th1 cells are important to neutralize intracellular bacteria [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-16-00552)]. However, both studies showed promising results of H. pylori vaccine immunization. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the importance of Th1 and Th2 cells in H. pylori immunization. 4.
