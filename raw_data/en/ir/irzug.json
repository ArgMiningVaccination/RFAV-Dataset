Recognized among the top hospitals natio nally and regionally by U.S. News & World Report, Montefiore provides compassionate, patient - and family -centered care and educates the healthcare professionals of tomorrow. The Children's Hospital at Montefiore is consistently named in U.S. News' \"Americ a's Best Children's Hospitals,\" and is second among those in the New York metro area. With four hospitals, 1,491 beds and 90,000 annual admissions, Montefiore is an integrated health system seamlessly linked by advanced technology. State -of-the-art primar y and specialty care is provided through a network of more than 140 locations across the region, including the largest school health program in the nation and a home health program. Montefiore's partnership with Einstein advances clinical and translational research to accelerate the pace at which new discoveries become the treatments and therapies that benefit patients. The medical center derives its inspiration for excellence from its patients and community, and continues to be on the frontlines of develop ing innovative approaches to care. 1. Mission Statement: A Longstanding Commitment, A New Focus A. Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : In January, 2009, Montefiore Medical Center completed a comprehensive review and update of its strategic plan. That process included the development and approval by its Board of Trustees of revised statements of the medical center's Mission, Vision and Values. Mission: To Heal, To Teach. To Discover and to Advance the Health of the Communities We Serve. Vision: To be a premier academic medical center that transforms health and enriches lives . Values: Humanity, Innovation, Teamwork, Diversity and Equity As part of that process, Montefiore established five Strategic Goals, setting out Montefiore's course for the decade to come 1. Advance our partnership with the Einstein College of Medicine 2. Create notable Centers of Excellence 3. Build specialty care broadly 4. Develop a seamless delivery system with superior access, quality, safety and patient satisfaction 5. Maximize the impact of our community service The inclusion of an explicit statement affirming Community Service as part of Montefiore's Mission Statement is not new. It has always been one of the core elements of Montefiore's mission. What has changed is the explicit reference to \"advancing the health of the communities we serve\", focusing on making a measurable difference in the health of those populations and communities. This is further sharpened by the inclusion as one of the five strategic goals the i mperative, to \"maximize the impact of our community service\". In pursuing that g oal, Montefiore has tasked itself : to better coordinate and focus its resources on specific high prevalence/high impact problems affecting its community, to work interna lly and with community partners to identify priority health needs, and to develop and implement more effective broad -based plans of action to address them, 2 and to advance the health of the communities we serve. The rationale behind this change was the realization that we must focus our efforts, if we are to make a real, measurable difference in the health of populations, and communities. That is essentially the same logic as underpins the state's revised Community Service Plan process. Historically, M ontefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed services to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (eg . children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). In its updated Strategy, Montefiore included a strategic goal - \"Maximize the impact of our community service\" - that is focused on improving performance in this critical area. It has led to the creation of a new institutional focus for community health improvement activities - the Montefiore Office of Community and Population Health, charged to oversee, and support and coordinate Montefiore's diverse portfolio o f community health improvement programs and activities, enhance Montefiore's capacity to assess and measure the health needs of the communities it serves, identify, assess and select a limited number of top -priority health needs in the communities Mont efiore serves for specific focus, and lead and coordinate Montefiore -wide efforts, and , where possible working , together and with community partners to make a difference, to measurably improve the health of the communities we serve. The Office of Commun ity and Population Health was established in the Fall, 2009. It is a new and important function at Montefiore, and its formation parallels other changes at Montefiore, and at Einstein , including: creation of a new Montefiore Office of Community Relations ; consolidation and integration of responsibility for Health Education and Community Outreach, coupled with the re -organization of the staffing for Montefiore's eleven community advisory boards to improve their effectiveness and ability to provide meani ngful input regarding how our hospitals and major ambulatory care sites and services can better serve their diverse communities; and improved coordination of Montefiore's community health efforts with those of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, includi ng the Institute for Community and Collaborative Health and the Hispanic Center for Excellence. The goals an d directions of Montefiore's Office of Community and Population Health coincide with and reinforce those articulated by the State DOH in its revise d approach to the Community Service Plan. B. Enhancing Community Access to Health Insurance Montefiore Medical Center has taken a proactive approach to conducting outreach and education of individuals in the community that might be eligible for health insur ance coverage through the New York State of Health - New York's Health Insurance Marketplace. Montefiore's planning focused on two key constituencies - external Bronx and lower Westchester Community and internal Montefiore staff. 3 Externally, Montefiore 's strategy was to work with our partners in the community to sponsor and execute outreach and education events throughout our catchment area. To date, Montefiore has participated in or helped to sponsor six different educational events targeting different members of the Bronx and Lower Westchester Community specifically related to the Marketplace, with more to come. Partners have included elected officials, other providers (in particular funded Navigators in the Bronx, such as Bronx Community Health Networ k and Community Service Society of New York), health plans, and others. In addition, Montefiore created several resources for patients that are used throughout the institution and provided at community -based events, including: Printed over 2 ,500 flyers an d tri-folds on the New York State of Health, in both English and Spanish, provided at events and in physician offices and clinics for patients. Created a patient -facing webpage on Montefiore's internet site describing the Exchange and posting useful materi als. Launched a series of E -Screens across all campuses which provide a snapshot of important information on the Marketplace. Conducted PR and press on the Exchange targeting both English and Spanish regional press outlets. Internally, Montefiore's goals were 1) to educate associates who will have interaction with patients who may have questions; 2) to educate associates who will be a source of information for their communities. To that end, Montefiore launched a series of associated education and awarene ss efforts: Developed a seminar on the Basics of the New York State of Health. o This seminar has been delivered (or is scheduled to be delivered) in -person to staff across the institution at health centers, to social workers, call center employees, and ot her various departments upon request. o The presentation has been recorded in voice -over webinar format, and is to be made available online through Montefiore's intranet site for associates. Montefiore Intranet Site - Montefiore created an internal web page where information about the Exchange, Navigator and In -Person Assistance programs, free internet action sites and other important information is made available to associates. Internal Periodicals - Articles and information were included (or will be in cluded) in Montefiore's internal periodicals, such as Montefiore Update, Inspired Medicine, and using Montefiore's internal networking engine, Yammer. Finally, Montefiore expects to train over 100 associates that currently are employed as Medicaid Specia lists and Financial Aid specialists to become Certified Application Counselors (CAC). In doing so, these individuals will be permitted by the State to actually help patients enroll in health coverage through the Marketplace. Montefiore has also submitted paperwork to become a CAC training site, which will be an important resource for newly hired Montefiore staff as well as other community -based organizations in the Bronx and lower Westchester that also need to have staff trained. 2. Hospital Service Are a A. Description of Service Area Montefiore has identified the Bronx as its primary service area. More than 85% of Montefiore's hospitals' discharges are residents of the Bronx, and it is within this geographic 4 area that Montefiore has distributed the vast majority of its community -based primary care and specialty ambulatory services. Defining a \" Hospital Service Area\" for Montefiore, however, is not as straightforward as it may be for a freestanding community hospital, which is aligned with and serves a d iscrete geographic community. To begin with, Montefiore operates four hospitals (Moses, Weiler and Wakefield Hospitals , and the Children's Hospital at Montefiore), each of which serves as a \"community hospital\" for quite different communities in the Bronx. An additional division of Montefiore is an ambulatory care facility, which includes a freestanding emergency department at Westchester Square. In addition, each hospital has a nearby specialty ambulatory care center; and serves as a referral center for the Bronx and the wider region, serving patients who need specialty ambulatory and inpatient care. Beyond its hospital campuses, Montefiore operates a large number of in -community services sites. Montefiore operates over 2 5 community -based primary care c enters, located in communities across the Bronx and southern Westchester. Each of these primary care centers has its own service area, providing comprehensive primary care services to a specific population drawn from its surrounding community, tailoring i ts services to the needs of the patients and communities it serves. Montefiore also operates a range of programs focusing on the needs of special populations: Montefiore's School Health Program (MSHP) provide comprehensiv e primary care to a population of elementary, middle and high school students throughout the Bronx. Founded in 1983, the MSHP is the largest and most comprehensive school -based health program in the country, and a major community outreach program for child ren living in the Bronx. Currently, the MSHP provides a range of medical, mental health, 5 reproductive and health promotion services to 25,000 students who make over 8 0,000 visits per year. Together, Montefiore and Einstein operate an 11 -site substance abus e treatment program that offers drug treatment and rehabilitation services and comprehensive primary care to a population of 4,500 recovering substance abusers in communities across the Bronx. Finally, Montefiore provides a wide array of targeted outreach services to at -risk populations within its service area, including programs serving the homeless and victims of domestic violence, as well as services to homebound and/or fragile seniors in community -based settings throughout the Bronx. The Bronx is a lar ge and diverse urban setting, with many sub -populations and communities that evidence tremendous variation from one to another. Those communities are served by many providers - hospitals/systems, and community health centers - with overlapping service areas. General concepts like \"service area\" and a \"service area population\" based on a simple geographic definition (e.g. a set of zip codes) are difficult to apply in a setting like the Bronx, or to a health care delivery system like Montefiore. In such a set ting, one must focus on the specific health needs of specific populations, in specific communities, working with specific partners. That has been Montefiore's historical approach to developing and operating its programs of community health, and that is the approach we have taken in developing this Community Service Plan. B. Population of the Bronx According to the 2012 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census, the Bronx with 1.4 million residents is the nation's poorest urban county; the poverty rate is 3 1% (compared to 19.4% city -wide) and median income $32,450 (compared to $51,270 city -wide). There are 44.5% of Bronx children living below poverty, also one of the highest child poverty rates in the United States. There are 7.37% of Bronx households on pu blic assistance, twice the percentages in New York City (4.15%) and New York State (3.40%). There are 84.18% of Bronx students eligible for reduced -fee and free lunch programs. The Bronx unemployment rate of 11.9% is one of the highest unemployment rates i n the country. Despite the high poverty and unemployment rates, 27% of Bronx residents ages 25 and older have received their high school diploma or GED, higher than citywide (24%) and statewide (26.9%) attainment rates. The Bronx is ethnically diverse. It s population is 54.3% Hispanic, 33.2% African -American, 10.6% White, 3.7% Asian, and 3.3% Other. Almost one -third (34.7%) of its residents are foreign -born and 40.7% of the births are to foreign -born mothers. Among these immigrants, more people speak a fo reign language at home (predominantly Spanish) than speak \"only English.\" Its new immigrants come from diverse corners of the globe (in order of their numbers): Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, Ecuador, Guyana, Ghana, Honduras, Italy, Trinidad & Toba go, and Bangladesh. The Bronx was New York City's first borough to have a majority of people of color and is the only borough with a Latino majority. Only three counties in the eastern United States have a lower portion of Non -Hispanic whites and only one has a higher proportion of Latinos. The Bronx is also the youngest county in New York State with 39.2% children and one of only five U.S. counties with more than 30% single family households. 6 Before HRSA's 2008 regulation changes designating Health P rofessions Shortage Areas (HPSAs), almost half (45%) of our population lived in federally designated HPSAs; now the Bronx is qualified as a Whole County HPSA. C. Health Status of the Bronx The Bronx has been an epicenter of the asthma, HIV, and drug epidemic s and also has excess mortality rates from heart disease, stroke, and diabetes compared to city -wide and national averages. As the Bronx mortality rates remain significantly high, the number of physicians in the Bronx continues to dwindle. Mortality Rates : According to the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Vital Statistics of New York State report in 2011, the Bronx has a higher age -adjusted mortality rate (639.8 per 100,000) than New York City (622.7 per 100,000) as a whole. According to t he Community Health Rankings in 2010, the Bronx ranks as a county with one of the highest mortality rates in New York State. From the list of 62 NY counties with the lowest to highest mortality outcome (with 1 as the lowest and 62 as the highest), the Bron x ranked at number 60. The leading cause of death among Bronx residents is due to coronary heart disease (206.1 per 100,000). Asthma : According to the New York City Department Of Health's (NYCDOH) Community Health Survey in 2011, 17.9% of total Bronx a dults reported that they had asthma. The percentage of Bronx adults with asthma was higher than the New York City percentage of 11.9%. According to the NYSDOH, the average (age -adjusted) rate of asthma emergency department visits per 100,000 from 2008 -2010 was 231.4 in the Bronx, significantly higher than the New York City rate of 131.5 and statewide rate of 87.1. The age-adjusted death rate due to chronic lower respiratory diseases among Bronx residents was 25.6 per 100,000 in 2009; higher than the New Yor k City rate of 18.1. In 2010, the Bronx rate increased to 29.9; remaining higher than the NYC rate of 20.9. Diabetes : According to the NYCDOH, 13.1% of adults in the Bronx reported that they were diagnosed with diabetes in 2011. 15.2% of Bronx adults re ported that they were diagnosed with diabetes in 2012. From 2011 -2012, the diabetes percentage among Bronx adults remained higher than the citywide diabetes rate of 10%. According to the NYSDOH, the average (age -adjusted) rate of diabetes hospitalization per 10,000 from 2009 -2011 was 399.1 in the Bronx, significantly higher than the New York City rate of 270.5 and statewide rate of 226. T he age -adjusted dea th rate due to diabetes was 28 per 100,000 Bronx residents in 2009 ; higher than the New York City rat e of 19.5 and statewide rate of 16.6. In 2010, the death rate among Bronx residents decreased to 26.8 . Despite the decrease in death rate due to diabetes among Bronx residents in 2010, the Bronx rate remained higher than the NYC rate of 20.2 and statewide rate of 16.6 . 7 Health Insurance : According to the New York State Department of Health, 19.79% of Bronx adults did not have health insurance in 2011, higher than the national rate of 15.1%. During the same year, 4.37% of Bronx children did not have health insurance, lower than the national rate of 7.5%. Physician Shortage : In 2013 , the Health Resources and Services Ad ministration (HRSA) considered nine population groups and eight facilities in Bronx County to be Primary Care Health Professions Shortage A reas (HPSAs). This marks an increase in th e number of population groups (four in 2011 to nine in 2013) and a decrease in the number of service areas ( four in 2011 to zero in 2013) and facilities ( ten in 2011 to eight in 2013) considered to be HSPAs in 201 1. In 2013 the following nine population groups were considered HPS As: Medicaid Eligible \u2014Fordham/N orwood, Medicaid Eligible \u2014 Highbride, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Hunt s Point/Mott Haven, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Morris Heights, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Morrisania, Medicaid Eligi ble\u2014Soundview, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Tremont, Medicaid Eligible \u2014West Farms, Medicaid Eligible \u2014 Parkchester/Throgs Necks. In 2013 , the following service areas were considered HPSAs: Highbridge, Huntspoint/Mott Ha ve, Morris Heights, Morrisania. 3. Public Partic ipation In the past, the main organizational approach that Montefiore used to gain input and community involvement is through a variety of community advisory boards (CABs). Montefiore worked extensively with representatives of the affected communities thro ugh these CABs to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services. Beyond the formal structure that Montefiore established to gain input from the communities it serves, the medical center participates in a variety of org anized partnerships and collaboratives, working with other providers in the Bronx, the NYCDOHMH, community -based organizations in the Bronx and members of the community in planning and developing initiatives aimed at improving the health of the people of t he Bronx. Montefiore has developed additional approaches to the assessment of community needs and health priorities and to the establishment of partnerships with community organizations. The Office of Community and Population Health developed a communi ty level approach involv ing relevant organizations, which are in the specific community and are interested in the particular health issues being addressed. This provides for a closer alignment between the community level goals of Montefiore and the organ izational goals of the community organizations . This approach is t he Collective Action to Transform Community Health (CATCH) Program , which is a community level coalition bringing together four aspects of the community that may have a significant impact on community health. 8 The four elements are: Partner Role Montefiore/ Albert Einstein College of Medicine Coordinating community site Able to provide sample data to represent sample of the community and results of interventions within a smaller timeline NYC District Public Health Office Provide data, epidemiological support, access to NYCDOH programs and access to the NYCDOHMH Community Health Profiles survey Local Community Board Represent the interests of local community, local business and local gover nment in the implementation of any intervention Local Community Based Organizations Provide direct representation of the constituency to be reached through the interventions and a base for community initiated interventions to be supported by the other coa lition members Through collaboration, this four part coalition, working in individual communities delineated by the Montefiore Medical Group primary care site located within a specific neighborhood, identifies interventions that can be worked on both col laboratively and independently to transform the community's health. Using data collected through Montefiore, the D istrict Public Health Office and other sources, the impact on the community's health b y the interventions implemented can be measured and ana lyzed. 4. Assessment and Selection of Health Priorities Collaborative Process and Criteria to Identify Priorities The process to identify at least four priorities evolved out of a series of conversations initially held between Montefiore and the New Yor k City Department of Health as a part of identifying the Take Care New York 2016 Priorities. In reviewing the full list of items, it was very clear that many of their targeted areas, such as Healthy Eating: Active Living, Tobacco Free Living, and Children and Youth agenda items were areas that there was inter -organizational synergy. Through collaborations with large stakeholder partner groups and awarene ss of the status of Bronx County, as the county with the lowest ranking health status in New York State (62 out of 62), as reported in the 2013 County Health Rankings from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , stakeholder groups have agreed that tackl ing issues impacting improved nutrition, increased physical activity and tobacco -use cessation efforts would b e where the greatest impact could be achieved. Two New York State Priority areas were then chosen, to Prevent Chronic Disease and to Promote Health Women, Infants and Children . According to the 2012 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census , 54.3% of the population is Hispanic, 33.2% African -American, 10.6% White, 3.7% Asian, and 3.3% Other. As the borough with the smallest non -Hispanic White population in New York City, focusing on disparities is inherent in everything that Montefiore accomplishes. The priority areas selected and each o f the planned interventions focus on specific priority populations and address the ethnic and cultural disparity defined in the indicator s for the population served by Montefiore. 9 Data Sources Multiple data sources were used to support the identification and selection of the priority items identified, selected, and reviewed with partners. The data sets that were used to identify the issues of concern beyond experience and direct observation are listed below. The co mprehensive report of the tabulated Bronx data summarized for this Community Service Plan is provided in Appendix B. New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Bronx County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 2013 -2017 Findings are provided by 2010 Bureau of U.S. Census data. The Census data is collected every 10 years using a detailed survey method that counts every resident throughout the U.S. Detailed information provided by the Census survey results describe each U.S. community' s entire population, including cross -tabulations of age, sex, households, families, relationship to householder, housing units, and race/ethnic groups. This NYSDOH report also includes data and the 2017 targets for numerous indicators for the five major pr evention agenda areas: preventing chronic diseases; promote a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promote mental health and prevent substance abuse; and, prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine -preventable disease and health care -associated infections. The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYSDOH Public Health Priority Areas report can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013 - 2017/about.htm . The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) This comprehensive database was established in 1979 as a result of cooperation between the heal th care industry and government. SPARCS collects patient level data on hospital discharges, patient characteristics, diagnoses and treatments, and health care services. This database system also collects data on charges for every hospital discharge, ambula tory surgery patient, and emergency department admission in New York State. This database features the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9), an official set of codes used by physicians, hospital s, and allied health workers to indicate diagnosis for all patient encounters. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's DRG (Diagnosis -Related Groups) coding system is also featu red in the SPARCS data. DRGs group patients by diagnosis, treatment, age, and other characteristics. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category. Detailed information on the SPARCS data can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/ . NYS Community Health Indicator Reports Reports were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The NYS Cance r Registry was established in 1976 to track statewide data of all patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected from this registry include exposure risks, stages at diagnosis, treatment information, and death rates. Each time a person is diagnosed with a tumor, the hospital(s) where that person is diagnosed and/or treated is required by the Public Health Law Section 2401 to report information about the person and tumor to the Cancer Registry within six months of patient diagnosis. The most recent year for which data on new cases and cancer deaths are available is 2010. Detailed information on the NYS Cancer Registry can be found at 10 http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/ . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non -institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. The survey is conducted in all 50 states and U.S. territories. New York State has participated annually since 1985. Statewide representative samples are collected monthly and aggregated into yearly datasets. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ . The 2010 data is the latest Bronx -specific BRFSS data illustrated by the NYSDOH. New York City Department of Health and Hygiene (NYCDOH) Community Health Survey The Community Health Survey (CHS) is an annual telephone survey that provides essential data used by the NYCDOH to monitor the health of New Yorkers, evaluate the outcomes of public health initiatives, and guide policy decisions. The survey provides citywide and borough -specific estimates of health indicators and risk factors. Each year, approximately 9,000 adults ages 18 and older are randomly selected to participate in the CHS. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much m ore are all available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/survey.shtml . County Health Rankings This project is a collaboration between the Robert Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Additional data measures used in the rankings were provided by surveys and databases from other organizations such as the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Dartmouth Institute, U.S. Census Bureau, and U. S. Department of Agriculture. This database generates health rankings of every U.S. county and illustrates the correlations between local health outcomes, health factors, and socioeconomic factors. The county rankings are based on summary scores calculated from individual data measures. The overall Health Outcomes summary score consists of data on the county's mortality and morbidity. The overall Health Factors summary score consists of data on the county's health behaviors, clinical care, social and econom ic factors, and physical environment. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the County Health Rankings can be found at http://www. countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach . Community Health Needs Assessment This project was developed by the Advancing the Movement organization and the Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) as a web -based toolkit designed to hospit als, state and local health departments, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities. County -level data retrieved from institutions such as the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Public Health Institute are formulated into customized data reports. The Full Health Indicators Report illustrates the health needs assessment profiles of U.S. counties using local demographics, socioeconomic factors, physical environment data, clinical care data, health behavior factors, and health outcomes. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the Community Health Needs Assessment can be 11 found at CHNA.org . NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) This survey is conducted through an ongoing collaboration between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Department of Education (DOE), and the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The New York City's YRBS is part of the CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Based on the protocol developed by CDC, the survey has been conducted in odd -numbered years since 1997 to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth in New York City. Students complete a self -administered, anonymous questionnaire that measures a variety of behaviors, including tobacco, alcohol and drug use, unintentional injury and violence, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The results are representative of public high school students in grades 9 through 12. The NYC YRBS can provide prevalence data for the city as a whole, for each of the five boroughs starting in 2003, and since 2005 for three high -risk neighborhoods - the South Bronx, North and Central Brooklyn, and East and Central Harlem in Manhattan - where the DOHMH has its District Public Health Offices (DPHOs). The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYCDOH's YRBS can be found at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/youth -risk- behavior.shtml . CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance This report documents statistics and trends for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States through 2011. This publication is intended as a reference document for policy make rs, program managers, health planners, researchers, and others who are concerned with the public health implications of these diseases. The surveillance information in the latest report is based on the following sources of data: (1) notifiable disease repo rting from state and local STD programs; (2) projects that monitor STD positivity and prevalence in various settings, including regional Infertility Prevention Projects, the National Job Training Program, the STD Surveillance Network, and the Gonococcal Is olate Surveillance Project; and (3) other national surveys implemented by federal and private organizations. The STD surveillance systems operated by state and local STD control programs, which provide the case report data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syp hilis, are the data sources of many of the figures and most of the statistical tables in this publication. Detailed information on the CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/default.htm . NYSDOH's Annual HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report The Annual Surveillance Report presents recent data on newly diagnosed HIV cases and persons living with diagnosed HIV infection in New York State. Twenty -two sets of tables are grouped by major geographic division (New York State (NYS), New York City (NYC), NYS excluding NYC, Ryan White Regions1, NYC boroughs). Most sets feature three tables on separate pages - (A) living HIV and AIDS cases, (B) new HIV diagnoses and (C) new AIDS diagnoses. The historical table (Table 1) includes HIV and AIDS diagnoses, and deaths among persons with AIDS. This report is produced by the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Epidemiology (BHAE), AIDS Institute, New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH ). Access to this publication is available through the Internet at the 12 following address: http://www.nyhealth.gov/diseases/aids/statistics/index.htm . American Community Survey (ACS ) Developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS is an ongoing survey that collects annual data on the major characteristics of communities throughout the U.S. The data collected is categorized into four categories: social, economic, demographic, and housing . Social characteristics include topics such as education, disability status, and health insurance status. Economic characteristics describe the income, employment status, and poverty level of U.S. communities. Demographic characteristics include age, sex, and race/ethnicity information. Housing characteristics include topics such as occupancy and vacancy, monthly rent, and household size. Approximately 3.5 million U.S households are randomly selected to participate in the ACS each year. The 2012 data is th e most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and more detailed information are available at https://www.census.gov/acs/www/ . Community Engagement For each of these priority areas, different groups were engaged. Within the Prevent Chronic Disease Priority three subsets of groups participated. Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults According to the NYSDOH, 68% of Bronx adults were report ed to be overweight or obese between 2008 and 2009. This is higher than the reported rates in both New York City (57.9%) and New York State (59.3%). The NYCDOH Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2011) found that the Bronx had the highest rate of teen obesity of all five boroughs with 14.8% of teens reported obese. New York City has a teen obesity rate of 11.6%. The Bronx also had the highest percentage of teens that were overweight but not obese of all five boroughs, with 16.9%. For the Priority Area - Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults , a new group was conceptualized in April of 2012 when Dr. Steven Safyer submitted an opinion commentary through one of the local New York City periodicals http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/winning -obesity -battle -article -1.1056892 detailing the strategies he proposed would lead to victory in the battle over obesity. This call to action mobilized New York City Department of Heal th and Mental Hygiene leadership to call for a meeting and jointly in partnership with the Bronx Borough President, the Honorable Ruben Diaz Jr. and New York State Senator Gustavo Rivera - (D) 33rd District, the decision was made to gather through leaders on this issue to define and work on solutions. Fifteen sector issue key stakeholder organizations were invited to participate in the initial meeting held on June 25, 2013. The leaders were: Organization Leaders 1. Office of the Bronx Borough President The Honorable Ruben Diaz, Jr. Melissa Cebollero 2. New York State Senator: The Honorable Gustavo Rivera 3. Montefiore Medical Center: Dr. Steven Safyer, President & CEO 4. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene: Commission er of Health, Dr. Thomas A. Farley 5.

Greater New York Diabetes Association 18. New York State Health Foundation, Jim Knickman 19. Greater New York Hospital Assoc. Lloyd Bishop Amy Osorio This group was supplemented with staff from each of the lead organizations. At this meeting, after a presentation from the four principals and clinical experts for the New York City Department of Health and Mental hygiene and Montefiore Medical Center, this group agreed to tackle c ollectively and collaboratively the issues surrounding obesity in c hildren and adults through the Bronx Campaign to Prevent and Control Obesity. Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure According to the NYCDOH Community Health Survey (2012), 15.8% of adults in the Bronx reported being current smokers as compared to 15.5% of New York City adults reported being current smokers . As tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States, accounting for 19% of these deaths, more than obesity, infections (including HIV/AIDS), motor vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse combined, we have selected Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Toba cco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure as the second focus area . Montefiore will continue with its strong supportive partnership with Bronx BREATHES ( BRonx Einstein Alliance for Tobacco Free Health and Environmental Services) . Bronx BREATHES was established in 2004 as the Bronx Tobacco Cessation Center and is one of nineteen designated tobacco cessation centers in New York State, funded by the New York State Department of Health Bureau of Tobacco Control. Montefiore participates in the Bronx BREATHES Monthl y Staff and Partnership meeting, which is led by the Bronx BREATHES staff and its Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvin 'Hal' Strelnick, and attended by representatives of the following partner organizations: 14 Albert Einstein College of Medicine American Canc er Society Bronx Community Health Network Bronx County Medical Society Bronx CREED Bronx Lebanon Hospital Bronx Lesbian & Gay Health Resource Consortium Bronx Psychiatric Center Clinical Directors Network Emblem Health Plan of New York Health Peopl e Jacobi Medical Center Lehman College -Department of Nursing Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Montefiore Medical Center Morris Heights Health Center Morrisania Diagnostic & Treatment Center New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene North Central Bronx Hospital NYC Coalition for a Smoke -Free City Office of the Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. Project Samaritan AIDS Services Segundo Ruiz Belvis Diagnostic & Treatment Center South Bronx Asthma Partnership St. Barnabas Hos pital The Bronx Health Link Urban Health Plan At the last meeting of the group, on October 14, 2013, Montefiore's commitment to continue addressing tobacco related concerns as a part of its Community Service plan was roundly approved as it would cont inue to support the strides that the coalition has made in reducing tobacco use across multiple populations in the Bronx. These successes include: Provided approximately 240 smokers with Nicotine Replacement Therapy. Provided training on tobacco cessat ion in patients to 963 providers Reduced smoking so that from 2002 to 2008 the Bronx had reduced its adult smoking rate by 32% (from 25.2% to 17.1%, respectively), second only to much richer Manhattan (21.1% to 13.8% or a 34.6% reduction) among the five bo roughs In 2007 and 2009 Bronx teens had the lowest smoking rate among the five boroughs (6.2% and 6.7%, respectively) and the biggest reductions since 2003 (51%). (Surveys are only conducted in odd numbered years.) Bronx BREATHES has helped eliminate th e ethnic/racial disparities in smoking rates and nicotine replacement therapy in the Bronx. The Bronx also has the highest portion of physician -referred callers to the NYS Quitline among the five boroughs. Montefiore was the first hospital in the Bronx t o achieve Silver Star designation as a part of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Health Hospital Initiatives Tobacco Cessation program. Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinica l and Community Settings The Bronx has New York City's highest rates of pre -diabetes, diabetes and it is suspected to have equally high rates of undiagnosed diabetes among its 1.4 million residents. Montefiore, as the University Hospital for the Albert Ein stein College of Medicine was selected as one of the initial 27 clinical centers across the nation selected to participate in the original Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study which found that participants who lost a modest amount of weight through diet ary changes and increased physical activity sharply reduced their chances of developing diabetes. Participants in the lifestyle intervention group - those receiving intensive 15 individual counseling and motivational support on effective diet, exercise, and beh avior modification - reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent. This finding was true across all participating ethnic groups and for both men and women. Lifestyle changes worked particularly well for participants aged 60 and older, reducing the ir risk by 71 percent. About 5 percent of the lifestyle intervention group developed diabetes each year during the study period, compared with 11 percent of those in the placebo group. The DPP's results indicate that millions of high -risk people can delay or avoid developing Type 2 diabetes by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. (National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse). Montefiore has embraced implementation of the national YMCA of New York City's Diabe tes Prevention Program (Y -DPP) to arrest the development of this chronic disease within our population. In partnership with the YMCA of New York City we began referring our patients into the Y's in the Bronx. Additionally, the health education staff at M ontefiore ha s been trained by the YMCA of NYC to facilitate the Y -DPP program and as of October 2013, Montefiore has the largest group of patients enrolled and processed through the Y -DPP program as compared to any other health system in New York City. Du e to this successful collaboration, we were invited to participate in the South Bronx Community Referral Task Force (SBCRT). The SBCRT 's membership includes representatives from the following organizations as well as three private clinician practice gr oups: YMCA's DPP City Harvest Montefiore Medical Center Cornell Cooperative Extension Lincoln Hospital Bronx Health Reach St. Simon Stock Roman Catholic Church Hope of Israel Senior Center Shape Up New York City Dr. Essen Dr. Patel Uptown Medical Group In agreement with this membership , Montefiore has selected Diabetes Prevention as its measure for increasing access to high quality diabetes preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings, which is a reaffirmation and expansion of t he work we proposed in the 2010 -2013 Community Service Plan where the organizational focus was on pediatric diabetes. Maternal and Infant Health As one of the largest delivery hospitals in the Bronx, while we have demonstrated a strong commitment to mater nal and infant health, mothers in the Bronx continue to report lowered ongoing breastfeeding rates. Montefiore has invested to improve maternal and infant health, including a partnership with the March of Dimes to reduce rates of low birth -weight and prema ture births, and operation of one of the city's largest WIC programs, providing health education and nutrition support to poor mothers, infants and children. Montefiore has embraced the Latch On NYC program at each of our delivery hospitals, which has bee n formally endorsed 16 by the New York State Department of Health, Greater New York Hospital Association, Academy of Family Physicians, New York County Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics, District II, New York State and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, New York State Chapter. In partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Montefiore is one of twenty -six hospitals participating in the partnership. 5. Three Year Plan of Action The four areas selected by Mont efiore (and the corresponding designation s in the Prevention Agenda 2013 -2017: New York State's Health Improvement Plan ) for submission in this Community Service Plan are as follows: Under the Priority Area - Prevent Chronic Disease 1. Reducing Obesity In Ch ildren and Adults a. Goal 1.0.1 - Reduce the percentage of children who are obese b. Goal 1.3 - Expand the role of healthcare and health service providers and insurers in obesity prevention 2. Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Second hand Smoke Exposure a. Goal 2.2.2 - Increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line b. Goal 2.2.2 - Decreasing the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older 3. Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventi ve Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings a. Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate populations Under the Priority Area - Promote H ealthy Women Infants and Children 4. Maternal and Infant Health a. Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization The plan of action for each focus area is described in the fo llowing sections: Prevent Chronic Disease Focus Area 1: Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults In continuation of the efforts proposed in the 2010 -2013 Community Service Plan, Montefiore will continue to apply its efforts to the prevention, control and dissipation of obesity in children and adults. Goal 1.0.1 - Reduce the percentage of children who are obese Strategic Plan: To address the significant issue of obesity reduction in children, Montefiore has partnered with the New York City Department of He alth and Mental Hygiene, the Honorable Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., and New York State Senator, 33rd District Gustavo Rivera (D) to convene a group of strategic industry leaders across healthcare, government, retail, faith -based, community, muni cipal and civic groups to collectively address obesity in the borough of the Bronx. Through the formation of the Bronx Campaign to Prevent and Control Obesity, it is the 17 collective belief that the five agreed upon measures can advance the borough in decre asing obesity. Goals & Objectives: The Campaign has several key interventions that can be used by the various partners to ensure that there is a consistent message delivered across the community related to obesity. The key interventions below, which have multiple sub elements, will be used to direct the borough wide obesity prevention and reduction message. The goals presented below are a part of the larger borough -wide initiative in which Montefiore intends to contribute in meaningful ways. Key Interven tion 1: Launch health promotion and education campaigns Key Intervention 2: Improve worksite food and physical activity environments Goal s: Fully adopt NYC Food Standards in 9 Bronx hospitals Adopt NYC Food Standards at 50 other large employers Key Inter vention 3: Increase healthy eating opportunities in retail settings Goal s: 350 retailers adopt Shop Healthy Bronx changes Have a minimum of five retail food distributors adopt Shop Healthy changes Distribute a t least 20,000 additional Health Bucks Key In tervention 4: Increase physical activi ty in schools and the community Goal s: Have approximately 4,000+ Bronx elementary teachers trained in classroom physical activity programs Work with approximately twenty affordable housing sites, schools and community groups champion and implement active design improvements Key Intervention 5: Increase obesity -related inte rventions in healthcare centers Goal s: Increase current level of referrals and bring on board 20 additional health centers that refer to YMCA Diabet es Prevention Program ( Y-DPP) Work with twenty health centers to promote healthy eating and active living through electronic medical records (EMR), prescr iptions for prevention and more. The diversity in the group's membership means that not every organizat ion will work on every intervention ; however there is a commitment to unify the message for Key Intervention 1. Evidence Base: There have been numerous studies supporting the five key interventions that have been conducted not only by the New York City De partment of Health and Mental Hygiene, as well as the national Let's Move Campaign, and the efficacy of the YMCA's Diabetes prevention Program, among others. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : For the following Key Interventions, the larger org anization has planned for a longer time frame than is covered through the Community Service Plan time period of 2017, for the achievement of several of these goals. However, it is our anticipation to make significant progress as indicate on these interven tions for reporting through 2017. 18 Key Intervention 1: Launch health promotion and education campaigns Key Intervention 2: Improve worksite food and physical activity environments Performance Measure: Reduce Obesity in the Bronx by 10% Key Intervention 3: Increase healthy eating opportunities in retail settings Performance Measure: Reduce the percentage of Bronxites who consume one or more sugar sweetened beverages a day by 30% Key Intervention 4: Increase physical activi ty in schools and the community Performance Measure: Decrease the percentage of Bronxites who report no fruit or vegetable consumption by 30% Key Intervention 5: Increase obesity -related inte rventions in health care centers Performance Measure: Decrease the percentage of Bronxites who rep ort no physical activity in the past 30 days by 15% Goal 1.3 - Expand the role of healthcare and health service providers in obesity prevention Strategic Plan: As this Objective 1.3.2: increase the percentage of infants born in NYS hospitals who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization is closely aligned with the Priority Area Preventing Chronic Disease, Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively b reastfed during the birth hospitalization , we have detailed the plan in that section, located below. Focus Area 2: Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure Goal 2.2.2 - Increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line Goal 2.2.2 - Decreasing the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older Strategic Plan: Montefiore has been successful at increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit-Line with our inpatient populations as we have been able to document 100% contacts for patients at discharge with provision of the New York State Quit -Line information. In 2012, this covered over 50,000 unique adult, aged over 18 lives. We have also been tremendously successful with the expansion of the smoke free campus to cover all of our locations in addition to our acute care hospitals and have remained an ardent support of supplemental nicotine replacement therapy in the community as demonstrated by Montefiore's annual distribution of NRT across the Bronx. Goals & Objectives: The goal is to increase the rate of unique callers from across our ambulatory populations and within the communities that our ambulatory facilities are located in by enhancing t he training of physicians and increasing the quantity and visibility of the education we provide in the Bronx . Evidence Base: The evidence base for the expansion of smoking cessation programs especially using the New York State Tobacco Control program is substantial. Bronx BREATHES, our partner in this activity, as well as the Partnership for a Smoke Free Bronx are state and federally funded entities. The measures of these activities are constructed within the framework established by the New York City D epartment of Health and Mental Hygiene's Healthy Hospital Initiative and the results will be evaluated through the NC Prevention Partners, a national leader in tobacco cessation evaluation. 19 Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets The performance meas ures associated with the increasing of unique callers to the quit line and the decreasing of smoking prevalence in adults 18 year and older are: Performance Measures (Increasing Unique Callers): Number of callers referred to the quit line as documented in the Electronic Medical Record data Incorporate quit line information on patient discharge information Receive reporting through Bronx BREATHES of referral of patients through the Fax to Quit program to enhance the number of calls/contacts with the Quitli ne Performance Measures (Decreasing the smoking prevalence in adults) : Increasing the provision of pharmaceutical Nicotine Replacement Therapy by appropriate clinical staff to individuals who desire to eliminate tobacco use. Increasing the prominence of ad vertising and traditional and social media messaging to increase the likelihood of appropriate messaging reaching individuals with appropriate readiness levels to quit smoking Timeframe targets: As Montefiore is pursuing Gold Star Status, through the New Y ork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Healthy Hospital Initiative, having achieved both Bronze and Silver Star Status, this is an important activity for the hospital. We anticipate being able to attain this status by 2015, and to maintain it through 2017. Focus Area 3: Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorect al cancers especially among disparate populations Strategic Plan : Montefiore has selected to focus on i ncreasing screening rates for diabetes especially among disparate populations through the increased implementation of and referral to the YMCA of New York City's Diabetes Prevention Program (Y-DPP) across Montefiore Medical Center's Montefiore Medical Group sites, while continuing participation in the South Bronx Community Referral Task collaboration to increase the number of community available sites for Y-DPP. Goals & Objectives: The YMCA's Diabetes Prevention Program helps those at high risk adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles and reduce their chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The goals of the program are to: Reduce body weight by 7 % Gradual ly increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week In a classroom setting conducted either in the community or in the clinical setting, a trained lifestyle coach will instruct participants on how to change their lifestyle by learning about healthy eating, physical activity and other behavior changes over the course of 16 one -hour sessions. The topics covered include nutrition, getting started with physical activity, overcoming stress, staying motivated, and others relevant to the group. After the initial 16 core sessions, monthly meetings continue for up to a year for added support to help with maintenance of the progress they have achieved. Blood glucose monitoring is a part of the clinical visit and is not 20 monitored specifically within the Y -DPP group. However, the patient's physician received progress reports at four weeks, nine weeks and 13 weeks to incorporate the education provided in the program into the patients overall primary care services. Evidence Base: The Y -DPP Community Program Implementation is supported by multiple studies including the Translating the D iabetes Prevention Program into the Community: The DEPLOY Pilot Study conducted by Ackermann et al (2008) and YMCA Model Adapting the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Inter vention for Delivery in the Community by Ackerman and Marrero (2007 ). The YMCA Diabetes Prevention program is based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion (CDC), which showed that by eating healthier, increasing physical activity and losing a small amount of weight, a person with pre -diabetes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by 58%. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : Perform ance Measures: The performance measures associated with the implementation of the YMCA of New York City's Diabetes prevention program are as follows: Number of patients referred into the Y -DPP program, or other approved DPP program Duration of Y -DPP partic ipation Percentage reaching body weight target Percentage reaching physical activity target Number of patients referred to Y -DPP that demonstrate decreases in A1c in aggregate Time Frame Targets: The Montefiore implementation is currently focused on six Mo ntefiore Medical Group sites, however, in 2014 , it is the intention to expand to another four Montefiore Medical Group sites and by 2017 have all sites with eligible adults referred to the program. As New York and other states are currently examining offer ing access to the DPP programs as a covered benefit, this timeline may be accelerated. Promote Health y Women Infants and Children Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exc lusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization Strategic Plan & Goals Montefiore Medical Center has committed to achieving the goals of the Baby Friendly Hospital initiative and has signed on to the New York City Department of Health's Latch -On NYC Initiative to support breastfeeding mothers and to increase the proportion of women that are achieving the World Health Organization's target rate of having the first six months of an infant's life with exclusive breastfeeding. Initiative Objectives: The ob jectives of the Latch on NYC initiative are as follows: 1. Montefiore will enforce the New York State hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula feeding unless medically indicated and documented within the infants medical record 21 2. Provide physical restriction to infant formula by hospital staff including the tracking of infant formula distribution with the health department 3. Discontinue the distribution of free promotional formula 4. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formu la promotion materials in any hospital location. The objectives of the Baby Friendly Hospital are: 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implemen t this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from thei r infants. 6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast -milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in - allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples t o breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center. Evidence Base: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) developed and launched in 1991 as a pro gram of the World Health Organization and UNICEF is a part of the global effort to support and enable mothers to initiate breastfeeding their babies, with the recommendation for exclusively breastfeeding infants for their first six months of life. This in itiative works to the care of pregnant women, new mothers and their infants in hospitals and other health providing institutions due to research and clinically reported improved lifelong outcomes in health for both the breastfed infant and the mother. Add itional information about the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative can be found here http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/ . Latch -On NYC, an initiative of the New York City Department of Health, is a local effort wi thin the New York City CDC that has encouraged all NYC maternity hospitals to make a voluntary commitment to support mothers who choose to breastfeed by providing additional support to breastfeeding mothers and minimize practices that can interfere with th at choice such as supplementing breastfeeding infants with formula, unless medically indicated or at the mother's specific request. Participating hospitals also pledge to end the distribution of promotional formula and materials during the hospital stay an d at discharge. Supporting this institutional initiative is a public awareness campaign to promote the health benefits of breast milk, and to inform women of their right to receive education, encouragement and support to breastfeed their babies if they cho ose to do so. When hospitals stop promoting infant formula, mothers are more likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies. The evidence supporting this initiative is strong. An evaluation of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation data has sho wn that after the Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) hospitals discontinued providing infant formula samples at hospital discharge and implemented other practices to support breastfeeding, the exclusive breastfeeding rate at eight weeks following deliv ery increased by 21%, with no change in rates for mothers delivering at non HHC facilities. 22 Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : In 2012, over 6,300 infants were delivered at Montefiore, with over 2,400 of those infants delivered women defined as low income. Performance Measures : Identification of the following Exclusion criteria Delivery Type Skin to Skin Contact Labor Pain Management Type of Infant Feeding through Hospital Stay Pacifier Use Rooming In Previous Breastfeeding Experience & Success (If Applicable) Feeding Intent Barriers to Breastfeeding (for non -exclusive mothers only) Development of the following: Written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. Train all health care staff in the skills necess ary to implement this policy. Educational materials and messaging that inform pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding Initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Lactation maintenance education during separation from infant Establishment of breastfeeding support groups for referral upon discharge Time Frame Targets: The time frame established for achievement of the baby friendly hospital designation is 2017. Achievement of the entire Latch on NYC protocol is also expected to be achieved by 2017. Montefiore has established a Breastfeeding Committee that contains an inter -organizational, interdisciplinary membership from Montefiore, Jacobi Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Supplementary membership is held by the Assistant Commissioner of the Bronx District Public Health Office and the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Maternal and Infant and Reproductive Health at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. 6. Dissemination of the Plan to the Public The plan to disseminate the delivery of the Montefiore Medical Center 201 4-2017 Community Service Plan report to the public will occur across a number of platforms: The Community Service Plan will be posted to the www.montefiore.org website at the specific address http://www.montefiore.org/documents/CSP2014 -2017.pdf It can also be found through accessing the general www.montefiore.org site and clicking the Community Reports tab located in two areas of the face page, both under the Community tab or by scrolling to the bottom of the page where Community Reports is provided as hyperlinke d text which can take a viewer directly to the report. The Community Service Plan will be mailed out in hard copy to members of the Montefiore Board , as well as provided to community leaders and elected officials. To facilitate this distribution, a c opy of the direct link is also provided specifically to the distribution link of the Office of the Bronx Borough President, which maintains the borough's largest electronic 23 communication list and can provide dissemination beyond the traditional healthcare partners. A QR code for the link to the report will be made available for print materials to facilitate ease of access to the report. The QR code, accessible through most smart phone readers, for the site is provided below. Montefiore will announce thr ough its multiple social media platforms the availability of the Community Service Plan which will be available through the following feeds: o Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/montefioremedica lcenter o This reflects an e xpansion of the ways in which the Community Service Plan has been distributed as technological advances allow for broader distribution. As we move forward, additional reports, including the Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan, which will supplement the delivery of the Community Service Plan , will be found and distributed through the same pathway. 7. Maintaining Engagement As Montefiore has selected multiple areas in which to address health priorities, the plan for each group is diff erentiated below and each group will operate on a separate schedule. To take advantage of our core activities, Montefiore has in place standing advisory boards that address operational concerns in both the Acute and Ambulatory Care environments that revie w and inform, from a community perspective, on the implementation of these activities. There are also multiple formal committees operated by Montefiore, and in which Montefiore is a participant or coalition member that serve as opportunities for ongoing engagement. In Focus Area 1 - Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults; Goal 1.0.1 - to reduce the percentage of children who are obese, we will continue to operate through the school wellness councils and work within the 21 school based health centers that are a part of Montefiore to address educational and implementation concerns. Through the B'N Fit program, we will connect with the participants behavioral group and the parents support group to keep ongoing dialogue about obesity prevention initiativ es. Data from the B'N Fit site http://montekids.org/bnfit will also be shared to inform the response to the work that is occurring. For Goal 1 -3 - increase the percentage of children and adolescents ages 3 -17 ye ars with an outpatient visit with a primary care provider or obstetrics/gynecology practitioner during the measurement year, who received appropriate assessment for weight status during the measurement year, we will work with the Bronx Community Healthcare Network's (BCHN) Quality Improvement Committee to monitor compliance with the numbers of children across healthcare providers whose weights are assessed. 24 For Goal 1.4 - Expand the role of public and private employers in obesity prevention, we have aligne d with the national Partnership for Quality Care, whose membership includes a national labor -management partnership of twenty -one organizations to establish the benchmarks for the development of a culture of health in the workplace. 1199 SEIU United Healt hcare East Daughters of Charity Health System Dignity Health Greater New York Hospital Association Group Health Cooperative HealthPartners Jackson Health System Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles County Department of Health Services Maimonides Medical Center Montefiore Medical Center Partners Healthcare Service Employees International Union SEIU Healthcare Minnesota SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania SEIU Healthcare 1199NW SEIU United Healthcare Workers -West SEIU Local 1991 Committee of Interns & Residents of SEIU Healthcare Steward Health Care (formerly Caritas Christi Health System) West Penn Allegheny Health System Through this national benchmarking process we are able to maintain and expand the manner in which we continue to expand the role of public and private employers in obesity prevention. In Focus Area 2 - Reducing Illness Disability and Death related to toba cco use and second hand smoke , to maintain engagement in this area, we will work with the Bronx BREATHES coalition and the Partnership for a Smoke Fre e Bronx to measure and document the progress on Objective 2.2.1 - increase the number of unique callers to the NYS Smokers' Quitline; Objective 2.2.2 - decrease the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older, and Objective 2.2.3 - increase the utilization of smoking cessation benefits among smokers who are enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care. Additionally Montefiore is pursuing the established New York City Healthy Hospital Initiative Tobacco Program's Star Advancement Program which pr ovides an additional review of the data against national tobacco cessation program initiatives. As one of the member institutions of the Healthy Hospital Initiative, we serve as a model institution for the borough. In Focus Area 3 - Increasing Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventative Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings, Objective 3.3.1 - increase the percentage of adults with arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes who have taken a course or class to learn how to manage their condition, to maintain this goal , we will expand our partnership with the YMCA of New York City's Diabete s Prevention Program (DPP) , as well as the newly granted Diabetes Prevention Program offerings through Emblem Health, and any of the other newly arising approved DPP programs. Montefiore will continue to participate in the collaboration established through the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's South Bronx Community Referral Task Force, which provides monitoring and evaluation of data submitted through the various DPP programs across the Bronx. The fourth area we are addressing is in the priority area Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children. In Focus Area 1of the section - Maternal and Infant Health, Objective 2.2. 1 - increase the percent of infants born in NYS who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization, 25 we anticipate the maintenance of this work externally through the collaboration with the Latch - On NYC partnership established through the New Yo rk City Department of Health and supported through the Greater New York Hospital Association. Within Montefiore, as we have two active campus based breastfeeding initiatives, we will continue to monitor the breastfeeding initiation compliance rates and pu rsue recognition as a baby friendly hospital. Through the various collaborations for the multiple initiatives that we are undertaking, each has both an internal committee structure to monitor compliance with our own patient populations and an external com mittee structure to provide a comparative analysis of our institutional progress against borough -wide and/or citywide rates and present opportunities to track our progress and make mid -course corrections as appropriate. 8. Financial Aid Program Montefior e has a charity care program which is a model program, providing outreach, enrollment assistance and charity care. Staff informs all patients receiving services who are uninsured or underinsured about the program. Information on the financial aid policy a nd procedures is provided to patients, in both English and Spanish, including brochures available in all the patient service areas, information posted on the intranet and internet, and information on the bills sent out to patients. When a patient requests a financial aid consultation, we set up an interview, send out an application to be completed, or interview patient at time they present if they have required documentation on hand. Montefiore assists all walk -in patients from the community with their inquiries and will complete a Medicaid application whether or not they have already been seen at one of our facilities. We believe all patients that are eligible should be guided through the application process. Our program first attempts to assist the patient in getting enrolled in a state program. We recognize that if they are enrolled they will be able to fill their prescriptions and see physicians. Montefiore has made major investments in manpower to support the patient through this process. We have staff l ocated at all our facilities who can complete an application and send it to HRA. Our success can be measured by the number of patients who were enrolled in the Medicaid program (excluding patients enrolled in PCAP) . If a patient gets enrolled in Medicaid, but the enrollment does not cover the period of time the service occurred, the payment for that treatment episode is considered charity care. We believe our approach to financial aid for patients improves the access to care and the quality of care becau se patients will not be hesitant to see their primary care physician and in turn reduces the use of the emergency room for their non -emergent care. We believe that this has been our greatest success. The financial aid program has also provided patients w ith access to a primary care provider, since there are no longer concerns about insurance coverage. This ultimately has a positive effect throughout our community. Appendix A - Data Sources New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Bronx County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 2013 -2017 Findings are provided by 2010 Bureau of U.S. Census data. The Census data is collected every 10 years using a detailed survey method that counts every resident throughout the U.S. Detailed information provided by the Census survey results describe each U.S . community's entire population, including cross -tabulations of age, sex, households, families, relationship to householder, housing units, and race/ethnic groups. This NYSDOH report also includes data and the 2017 targets for numerous indicators for the f ive major prevention agenda areas: preventing chronic diseases; promote a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promote mental health and prevent substance abuse; and, prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine -preventable disease and health care -associated infections. The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYSDOH Public Health Priority Areas report can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013 -2017/about.htm . The Statewide Planning and Resea rch Cooperative System (SPARCS) This comprehensive database was established in 1979 as a result of cooperation betw een the health care industry and government. SPARCS collects patient level data on hospital discharges, patient characteristics, diagnoses and treatments, and health care services. This database system also collects data on charges for every hospital disch arge, ambulatory surgery patient, and emergency department admission in New York State. This database features the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9), an official set of codes used by physicia ns, hospitals, and allied health workers to indicate diagnosis for all patient encounters. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's DRG (Diagnosis -Related Groups) coding system i s also featured in the SPARCS data. DRGs group patients by diagnosis, treatment, age, and other characteristics. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category. Detailed information on the SPARCS data can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/ . NYS Community Health Indicator Reports Reports were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). T he NYS Cancer Registry was established in 1976 to track statewide data of all patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected from this registry include exposure risks, stages at diagnosis, treatment information, and death rates. Each time a person is diagn osed with a tumor, the hospital(s) where that person is diagnosed and/or treated is required by the Public Health Law Section 2401 to report information about the person and tumor to the Cancer Registry within six months of patient diagnosis. The most rece nt year for which data on new cases and cancer deaths are available is 2010. Detailed information on the NYS Cancer Registry can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/reg istry/ . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non -institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. The survey is conducted in all 50 states and U.S. territories. New Yor k State has participated annually since 1985. Statewide representative samples are collected monthly and aggregated into yearly datasets. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ . The 2010 data is the latest Bronx -specific BRFSS data illustrated by the NYSDOH. New York City Department of Health and Hygiene ( NYCDOH) Community Health Survey The Community Health Survey (CHS) is an annual telep hone survey that provides essential data used by the NYCDOH to monitor the health of New Yorkers, evaluate the outcomes of public health initiatives, and guide policy decisions. The survey provides citywide and borough -specific estimates of health indicato rs and risk factors. Each year, approximately 9,000 adults ages 18 and older are randomly selected to participate in the CHS. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentatio n and much more are all available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/survey.shtml . County Health Rankings This project is a collaboration between the Robert Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Additional data measures used in the rankings were provided by surveys and databases from other organizations such as the National Center for Health Statist ics, CDC, Dartmouth Institute, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. This database generates health rankings of every U.S. county and illustrates the correlations between local health outcomes, health factors, and socioeconomic factors. T he county rankings are based on summary scores calculated from individual data measures. The overall Health Outcomes summary score consists of data on the county's mortality and morbidity. The overall Health Factors summary score consists of data on the co unty's health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the County Health Rankings can be found at http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach . Community Health Needs Assessment This project was developed by the Advancing the Movement organization and the Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) as a web -based toolkit designed to hospitals, state and local health departments, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities. County -level data retrieved from institutions such as the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Public Health Institute are formulated into customized data reports. The Full Health Indicators Report illustrates the health needs assessment profiles of U.S. counties using local demographics, socioeconomic factors, physical environment data, clinical care data, health behavior factors, and health outcomes. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the Community Health Needs Assessment can be found at CHNA.org . NYC Yo uth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) This survey is conducted through an ongoing collaboration between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Department of Education (DOE), and the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The New York City's YRBS is part of the CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Based on the protocol developed by CDC, the survey has been conducted in odd -numbered years since 1997 to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth in New York City. Students complete a self - administered, anonymous questionnaire that measure s a variety of behaviors, including tobacco, alcohol and drug use, unintentional injury and violence, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The results are representative of public high school students in grades 9 through 12. The NYC YRBS can provide prevalence data for the city as a whole, for each of the five boroughs starting in 2003, and since 2005 for three high -risk neighborhoods - the South Bronx, North and Central Brooklyn, and East and Central Harlem in Manhattan - where the DOHMH has its District Public Health Offices (DPHOs). The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYCDOH's YRBS can be found at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/youth -risk-behavior.shtml . CDC's Sexually Tr ansmitted Disease Surveillance This report documents statistics and trends for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States through 2011. This publication is intended as a reference document for policy makers, program managers, health planners, researchers, and others who a re concerned with the public health implications of these diseases. The surveillance information in the latest report is based on the following sources of data: (1) notifiable disease reporting from state and local STD programs; (2) projects that monitor S TD positivity and prevalence in various settings, including regional Infertility Prevention Projects, the National Job Training Program, the STD Surveillance Network, and the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project; and (3) other national surveys implement ed by federal and private organizations. The STD surveillance systems operated by state and local STD control programs, which provide the case report data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are the data sources of many of the figures and most of the s tatistical tables in this publication. Detailed information on the CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/default.htm . NYSDOH's Annual HIV/A IDS Surveillance Report The Annual Surveillance Report presents recent data on newly diagnosed HIV cases and persons living with diagnosed HIV infection in New York State. Twenty -two sets of tables are grouped by major geographic division (New York State ( NYS), New York City (NYC), NYS excluding NYC, Ryan White Regions1, NYC boroughs). Most sets feature three tables on separate pages - (A) living HIV and AIDS cases, (B) new HIV diagnoses and (C) new AIDS diagnoses. The historical table (Table 1) includes HI V and AIDS diagnoses, and deaths among persons with AIDS. This report is produced by the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Epidemiology (BHAE), AIDS Institute, New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). Access to this publication is available through the Internet at t he following address: http://www.nyhealth.gov/diseases/aids/statistics/index.htm . American Community Survey (ACS) Developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS is an ongoing survey that collects annual data on the major characteristics of communities throughout the U.S. The data collected is categorized into four categories: social, economic, demographic, and housing. Social characteristics include topics such as education, disabilit y status, and health insurance status. Economic characteristics describe the income, employment status, and poverty level of U.S. communities. Demographic characteristics include age, sex, and race/ethnicity information. Housing characteristics include topics such as occupancy and vacancy, monthly rent, and household size. Approximately 3.5 million U.S households are randomly selected to participate in the ACS each year. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report.

Internally, Monte fiore's goals were 1) to e ducate associates who will have interaction with patie nts who may have questions; 2) to e ducate associates who will be a source of information for their communities. To that end, Montefiore launched a series of associated educati on and awareness efforts: Developed a seminar on the Basics of the New York State of Health. o This seminar has been delivered (or is scheduled to be delivered) in -person to staff across the institution at health centers, to social workers, call center employees, and other various departments upon request. o The presentation has been recorded in voice -over webinar format, and is about to be made available online through Montefiore's intranet site for associates. Montefiore Intranet Site - Montefiore create d an internal webpage where information about the Exchange, Navigator and In -Person Assistance programs, free internet action sites and other important information is made available to associates. Internal Periodicals - Articles and information were includ ed (or will be included) in Montefiore's internal periodicals, such as Montefiore Update, Inspired Medicine, and using Montefiore's internal networking engine, Yammer. Finally, Montefiore expects to train over 100 associates that currently are employed as Medicaid Specialists and Financial Aid specialists to become Certified Application Counselors (CAC). In doing so, these individuals will be permitted by the State to actually help patients enroll in health coverage through the Marketplace. Montefiore ha s also submitted paperwork to become a CAC training site, which will be an important resource for newly hired Montefiore staff as well as other community -based organizations in the Bronx and lower Westchester that also need to have staff trained. 2012 Community Service InventoryContents Nutrition, Physical Activity and Tobacco Prevention Programs ................................................ 3 Bardonia Health Day .................................................................................. 3 B'N Fit ........................................................................................................ 3 Bronx-CATCH, Collective Action to Transform Community Health .............. 3 Office of Community Health ....................................................................... 4 Office of Community Relations ................................................................... 4 To Your Health: Zumba Bronx ..................................................................... 4 Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program ............................................ 5 Bronx BREATHES ........................................................................................ 5 Diabetes Programs ................................................................. 6 Diabetes Club ............................................................................................. 6 Diabetes Disease Management .................................................................. 6 Diabetes Management: PROMISED ............................................................ 6 Diabetes in Pregnancy Program ................................................................. 7 Heart Health Programs ........................................................... 8 CHF Disease Management ......................................................................... 8 Heart Center Corporate Programs .............................................................. 8 Heart Month ............................................................................................... 8 Women's Heart Health Center .................................................................... 8 Cancer Programs .................................................................... 9 CHAM Oncology Groups ............................................................................
