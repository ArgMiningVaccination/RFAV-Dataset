Current inventories are required by OR -OSHA Laboratory and Hazard Communication standards, Oregon Fire Code, and ot her federal and state mandates.

You may exclude: Water Non-hazardous buffers, sugars and salts (solid or liquid form). Growth media without toxic (to humans) components. Non-toxic biochemicals (e.g., nucleotides, enzymes, protein extracts, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.) . Commercial assay kits. Biological specimens (e.g., cell lines, blood or body fluids, antibodies, microorganisms, etc .). Radioactive materials reported under an OSU Radiation Use Authorization. Hazardo us waste. Retail products used for routine household -like activities (cleanser, dish soap, bleach, etc.) with a duration and frequency of exposure that is equivalent to a consumer's home use, and which do not appear on any of the lists in the next section .

Toxins or synthetic origin (e.g., diphtheria toxin, conotoxins, endotoxins, cholera toxin, etc.) Controlled substances ( DEA listed materials ). Chemicals of Interest ( Dept. of Homeland Security listed materials ). Any other hazardous substance, not listed in previous bullet points, that has an NFPA 704 or HMIS hazard rating of greater than or equal to 1 and is stored in quantities of >50 grams or >5 0 milliliters.
