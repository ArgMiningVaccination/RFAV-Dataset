It's only when our detox mechanisms become overloaded that the process becomes less efficient and symptoms may occur. Toxins may be internal or external in origin. Pollution or pesticides in our food source put undue stress on our detox organs, the kidneys and liver. Improper digestion and imbalanced gut ecology provide internal forms of toxins in the way of metabolic by-products stemming from certain bacteria which have toxic side effects and therefore impact negatively on overall health by compromising detox pathways. It has been suggested that toxic overload contributes to more serious conditions such as auto - immune diseases, inflammatory/rheumatoid arthritis and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The goal of this program is to gently and slowly cleanse your body of toxins that add an extra burden so serious diseases like these can be avoided. This program should turn your liver into a healthy, cleansing machine. \"Tremendous increase in energy and focus. Complete loss of cravings, anxiety, etc. Lost 24 pounds, 5% of body fat, 2-3 inches in waist!!!!! Easy to follow, even on big travel schedule. Will do it again.\" -Jim A. West Norwalk, CT 02/05/2008 \"I loved the convenience of the program. I will do it every 6 months\". -Ron M. Old Lyme, CT 03/12/2008 Mental Detoxification: The cleansing of our mind of negative thought patterns is essential to health and physical detox - ification and can aid in this process. Emotionally, detoxification helps us uncover and express hidden frustrations, anger, resentments and fear and replace them with forgiveness, love, joy and hope.DETOXIFICATION RELAX... BREATHE...GO FOR WALKS... ENJOY THE CHANGE OF SEASON... THIS IS A TIME FOR YOU TO CARE FOR YOUR UNIQUE SELF... YOU ARE A PRIORITY, IF ONLY FOR THIS SHORT TIME.Detox Program FAQs Will it be uncomfortable? There is bound to be differing opinions about the change in diet but this detox is designed to be gentle and easy to follow. Remember, it is not a fast, nor is it a colon cleanse, which are very harsh on your system. You will be eating plenty of food and the shakes are pleasant tasting. You may feel a slight withdrawal in the first few days if you are giving up a lot of caffeine or a lot of sugar. PaleoCleanse is a scientific formula, a \"medical food\", which will assist you through some of the challenging days. Have faith, it will pass, and it will all be worth it! Will I be in the bathroom all day? It is very important to consume extra water while detoxifying to help flush out toxins. Therefore, most people urinate more often than usual on this program. Will I lose weight? This detox program is not designed to be a weight loss program. However, many people lose weight during the course of their detox program. Some of the reasons for this weight loss include: lower than usual caloric intake due to having shakes for meals, taking sugar out of the diet, decreased consumption of allergenic foods such as wheat and dairy and release of toxins from fat stores. Will I get headaches? Some people experience headaches during the first few days of their detox due to withdrawal from sugar and caffeine. Remember, the week prior to detox you will be decreasing intake of these substances to minimize discomfort. The PaleoCleanse powder will assist your body in cleansing out these substances as quickly and efficiently as possible. Can I exercise? You may exercise normally (monitor yourself, of course). Some days you may feel fatigued. On these days, you may want to limit yourself to gentle movement such as walking, stretching or yoga, etc. Should I continue with my regular vitamins? PaleoCleanse contains many vitamins and other nutrients to help meet your daily requirements. You may suspend natural supplements during the detox if your health care practitioner agrees, but continue to take any medically prescribed pharma ceuticals. Ask your health care practitioner if you have any specific questions. What about organic produce? Fruits and vegetables that are consistently the most contaminated with pesticides should be purchased organic. These include: Celery Apples Bell Peppers Kale/Collard Greens Peaches Blueberries Spinach Potatoes Strawberries Nectarines Cherries Grapes (Imported) If organic varieties are not available, fresh fruits and vegetables that consistently have the lowest levels of pesticides are the safest choices for conventionally grown produce.

There are complex cellular detoxification mechanisms that are constantly at work for you all day, every day. Natural and synthetic chemicals are processed by this com - plex system of cells, organs, and organ systems to keep you healthy in the face of a vir - tually constant barrage of toxic material. Our program is an excellent tool to improve your detoxification in the short term. The following suggestions will help you keep your body's toxic burden low and your detox mechanisms working for the long haul. Notes on Plastic Heating foods in plastic releases harmful chemicals. You should never heat food in plastic...use glass or ceramic instead. Skin Brushing To aid in lymphatic drainage, use a dry, natural fiber shower brush or loofah to massage your entire body before you shower or bathe. Start at the toes, and gently scrub using circular motions toward your heart. Clean Water Public tap water is often contaminated. Drink and cook with only pure filtered water and consider adding a filter to your shower. Microwave Ovens Although the convenience of microwaves is indisputable, this method of heating can disrupt chemical linkages in otherwise healthy foods and decrease the nutritional value. Heat on a stovetop or oven whenever possible and use a cast iron pan. Avoid Teflon and synthetic non-stick coatings. Exercise One of the best ways to increase your metabolic activity is to simply use your body. Daily exercise has innumerable benefits including building lean muscle mass which helps you burn more calories at rest. Consider jumping on a mini trampoline for 3-5 minutes a day to give a boost to your health and vitality. Sweating also releases toxins. 5Fun and Easy Tips For Enhancing the Detox Drink 1 cup of hot water with 1/4 lemon and 2 pinches of cayenne pepper first thing upon waking (on an empty stomach). This is very simple but you would be amazed how many people say they can't live without it once they start! Use a 'dry brush' to massage your entire body before getting into the shower. Use a circular motion and work towards the heart. Then shower or bathe. This facilitates circulation and toxic elimination through the skin. Take a warm bath with Epsom salt added to soothe, relax and detox. Additionally you may rub on the salt with a warm, wet washcloth in bath or shower-very invigorating. Jump on a rebounder (mini trampoline) for 3-5 minutes at a time. This shakes up your whole body and is particularly useful for stimulating your lymph drainage system, thereby moving those toxins OUT! Try your own 'hydrotherapy' in the shower by alternating hot/cold. This stimulates circulation and your immune system. You can also do a sauna/cold shower/sauna etc., if you belong to a gym. This is not for the squeamish, but it is very invigorating! You'll feel like a million bucks when you're done. Of course, just a sauna and a shower are beneficial as well.1 2 3 4 521 Day Detoxification Meal Replacement Titration Schedule Days 2x/day1 serving 2x/day1 to 2 Tbsp per to 2 per day2 Days 12-13One am pkt One pm pkt 1 1/2 scoops 2x/day1 serving 2x/day1 to 2 Tbsp per day1 to 2 per day2 Days 14-18One pkt One pm pkt scoops 2x/day1 serving 2x/day1 to 2 Tbsp per to 2 per day2 Days 19-21One pkt One pm pkt scoop 2x/day1 serving 2x/day1 to 2 Tbsp per day1 to 2 per Support Cool PaleoFiber *** PaleoCleanse*Number of Shakes/day PaleoGreens **** * One serving of PaleoCleanse is 2 scoops. ** One serving of PaleoMeal is 1 scoop.
