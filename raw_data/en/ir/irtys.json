Please be seated.4 My name is George Hastings. I'm a Special 5 Master of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. To my6 left is Special Master Denise Vowell, to my right is7 Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith, and together8 we would like to welcome you all to a special9 evidentiary hearing of the United States Court of10 Federal Claims.11 I'll apologize for the scratchy throat this 12 morning. Hopefully I'll be a little better, but that13 will help me keep my opening statement perhaps a14 little shorter here this morning.15 I want to start by saying that today we are 16 here really for two purposes The first purpose of17 course of the hearing that we begin today is to hear18 the claims under the Vaccine Act of two particular19 children. That's Jordan King and William Mead, two20 boys who suffer from autism and certain other medical21 conditions. The first purpose of this hearing then is22 to determine whether the autism disorders of Jordan23 King and William Mead and their other related24 conditions were vaccine caused.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 6 of 2886 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888However, there is a second very important 1 purpose of this hearing. That is, Jordan and William2 are two of about 5,000 children who suffer from autism3 or similar disorders and who have filed compensation4 claims under the Vaccine Act. These 5,000 claims have5 been grouped together in a joint proceeding known as6 the omnibus autism proceeding.7 The committee of attorneys who represent the 8 Petitioners in the omnibus autism proceeding have9 designated Jordan's and William's cases as two of the10 test cases in that proceeding. Therefore, in this11 hearing today and over the next three weeks we will12 hear not only about Jordan's and William's particular13 disorders, but also extensive expert testimony14 concerning the Petitioners' second general causation15 theory; that is, the general theory that thimerosal-16 containing vaccines acting alone can directly cause17 autism or contribute to autism.18 As some of you may be aware, last year the 19 Petitioners presented their first general causation20 theory. In this hearing then the Petitioners present21 their second theory, which focuses exclusively on the22 thimerosal-containing vaccines as a possible cause of23 autism.24 These two purposes for the hearing explain 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 7 of 2887 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888why up here on the bench you see three Special Masters1 and not just one. All three of us Special Masters are2 here in order to hear the general causation testimony3 to be presented during this hearing, and then each of4 us will apply that general causation evidence to5 decide a particular individual test case under the6 Vaccine Act.7 I will decide the test case of Jordan King . 8 Special Master Campbell-Smith will decide the case of9 William Mead . A third individual case was also 10 scheduled to be heard during this trial to be decided11 by Special Master Vowell, but that family recently12 chose to withdraw from this particular trial.13 Therefore, a third testimony case relating 14 to this theory of causation is in the process of being15 selected, and Special Master Vowell will hear the16 individual evidence in that case sometime later this17 year and then decide that third case, again applying18 the same general causation evidence developed during19 this trial.20 I want to begin this hearing thus by 21 acknowledging certain very important people who are in22 the courtroom today: The families of the injured23 children. With us today we have William Mead's24 mother, Ms. Shirley, and several members of the Mead25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 8 of 2888 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888family. We thank you folks for being here with us1 today. Later this week we will also have members of2 the King family and other members of the Mead family.3 All three of us want to extend our sympathy 4 to all those families. Clearly both these families,5 as with all of the families of autistic children, have6 been through some difficult times. They are certainly7 deserving of sympathy, but they are also deserving of8 great admiration for the way they have coped with9 their children's disorders.10 We thank these families for generously 11 agreeing to have their cases designated as test cases12 in the omnibus autism proceeding. Members of each of13 the two families will be testifying in this hearing14 later this week. Again, we thank all the King and15 Mead family members for their participation in this16 hearing.17 We also wish to thank the counsel for both 18 sides who will be presenting your evidence during this19 hearing. We know that they have worked enormously20 hard to prepare for this hearing, and we appreciate21 that hard work. We also thank the expert witnesses22 who have agreed to testify before us.23 We thank the Judges of the Court of Federal 24 Claims for the Federal Circuit who have generously25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 9 of 2889 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888allowed us to take over one of their courtrooms for1 the next three weeks. We thank the U.S. Marshals and2 all the other wonderful employees of both of the3 Courts housed in this building who have assisted us so4 well in preparing for and conducting this hearing.5 Next we thank all of you here in the 6 courtroom for being here. We welcome all of you7 again. Finally, we note that a number of people are8 listening to this hearing at this time by means of9 telephone conferencing and that a number of other10 people will listen to the audio portion of this11 hearing by downloading that audio off the internet. 12 We welcome all of you who may be listening to this13 hearing by those means as well.14 For those of you who will be here or be 15 listening to this hearing for more than just today, we16 would like to give you a brief roadmap for the17 proceeding. After today we will begin at 9 a.m.18 Eastern time each day. We will take a lunch break of19 about one hour probably sometime around 1 p.m. We20 will adjourn each day probably sometime around 5 or21 6 p.m., but sometimes earlier or sometimes later22 depending on the witness schedule for the day.23 Next, I note that during this hearing the 24 three Special Masters will be taking turns at25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 10 of 28810 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888presiding over the hearing. During the family1 testimony specific to the Jordan King case I will 2 preside, and during the family testimony concerning3 the William Mead case Special Master Campbell-Smith 4 will preside. During the general causation hearing,5 which is going to be most of the testimony, we will6 rotate the task between the three of us of presiding.7 Finally, I note that all of us here are 8 guests of the Federal Circuit in this courtroom. 9 Please, and this goes for counsel, witnesses, as well10 as spectators in the courtroom. Please don't consume11 any food or drinks of any type in this courtroom.12 With that, we're ready to start the case. 13 I'll turn first to the Petitioners' counsel, who will14 present an opening argument on the Petitioners'15 behalf. Please proceed. Mr. Powers, will it be you?16 MR. POWERS: Yes, it will, Special Master. 17 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Please go ahead, 18 sir.19 MR. POWERS: Thank you, Special Master 20 Hastings and Special Master Campbell-Smith and Vowell. 21 Thanks also to everybody who has joined us live and22 telephonically and also good morning to counsel for23 the Department of Justice sitting up here along side24 us in front of the bar.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 11 of 28811 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888My name is Tom Powers. I'm the attorney of 1 record for both Jordan King and William Mead . I'm 2 also, along with Mr. Williams, my law partner and3 co-counsel at table here, representing the Petitioners4 Steering Committee. That's the group of attorneys5 that represent the interests of the 4,800 plus6 families who have claims in the omnibus and the7 presentation of the general causation evidence in the8 test cases that have come before us and in the test9 cases that are before us today.10 Special Master Hastings might have been 11 sharing my notes on opening because I did want to talk12 about what the hearing is about, and the first two13 things on my list were the ones that the Special14 Master identified.15 The first, as an attorney, are the ones that 16 are frankly most important to me. Those are the cases17 of the two clients that came to us seven years ago now18 to represent them on behalf of their children for the19 thimerosal mercury-induced injuries that they suffer,20 for the regressive autism that they believe and we21 believe and that we think the science supports are22 related to the appearance of their regressive autism23 symptoms, so obviously the hearings today and the24 proceedings today are the beginning of the formal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 12 of 28812 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888resolution of the claims of two very important people,1 Jordan King and William Mead.2 It is also important and something that 3 we're very aware of as we take the stand today that4 we're speaking on behalf of 4,800 other children who5 have similar claims in the program. This is general6 causation evidence that all of those families can7 avail themselves of as they move forward to resolve8 their individual claims, important claims to every9 single one of those families.10 There is, however, a third purpose of these 11 proceedings, and that is a very important one in terms12 of public policy and what goes on outside this room13 and outside the decisions that will be written in14 these particular cases, and that's a decision about 15 science and a debate about the science because while16 we have lawyers who are advocating positions, we have17 experts who are offering opinions on both sides, and18 those opinions certainly differ, often very19 strikingly.20 Ultimately what this is about is the 21 science, and what this case is about is not the22 science necessarily of vaccines strictly. That is,23 the families here are not taking the position that24 vaccines generally or conceptually are a bad thing. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 13 of 28813 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888This is not an antivaccine case that you're going to1 hear over the next three weeks. This is a case that2 is focusing specifically on a mercury-based3 preservative, thimerosal, that at this point in time4 fortunately is largely a relic of history.5 It's a relic of history largely because it 6 was an uncontrolled experiment on a huge population of7 children, a huge exposure across a large population8 over a long period of time over a substance that, as9 you will hear particularly in Mr. Williams' portion of10 this opening that we'll be dividing, is scientifically11 supported to be related to the appearance of these12 symptoms.13 Over the last year and particularly in the 14 first round of test cases beginning with the Cedillo15 case last June, it appears to be the position of the16 Department of Health and Human Services that these17 cases are implicitly sending a public message that18 vaccines might be dangerous and therefore that the19 message would get out to the public that people should20 avoid vaccine and immunization rates should drop and21 that we'll see outbreaks of infectious diseases.22 But again we need to focus not on that 23 rhetoric. It's almost like an imaginal line of24 rhetoric that focuses from the government's side25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 14 of 28814 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888exclusively on got to be pro vaccine and support1 immunizations. The guns on the imaginal line are so2 focused on that message that it's important that the3 Special Masters and the larger public health community4 understand that what we're talking about for the next5 three weeks and in hundreds of these claims is a6 mercury-based preservative that's no longer out there.7 Unfortunately, it still is in the flu 8 vaccine, and most doses of the flu vaccine, and that9 application of thimerosal quite frankly, based on the10 science that Mr. Williams is going to describe, that11 application of thimerosal ought to be in the dustbin12 and of history as it is in the rightfully scheduled13 pediatric vaccines.14 During the course of the many years that 15 these cases have been litigated, one of the16 unfortunate consequences of the Department of Health17 and Human Services' position that they're going to18 focus their attention on a rigid pro vaccine/pro19 immunization message and ignore issues around mercury20 toxicity, mercury exposure and thimerosal exposure is21 that we've seen a commingling of interest between the22 pharmaceutical industry and the vaccine manufacturers,23 the health maintenance organizations and the24 Department of Health and Human Services.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 15 of 28815 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888The consequence of that has been to cut off 1 at the knees the essential scientific inquiry that2 needs to happen to make informed public health3 decisions about immunization policy, but, just as4 important, they've cut off at the knees the5 opportunity to develop and push out into the public6 the science that needs to be out there so that people7 have confidence in the immunization program and have8 confidence that their vaccines are not only effective,9 but safe.10 There are a number of examples. The Special 11 Masters are familiar with some of these because we've12 been arguing these issues for years. There is the13 issue of access to the Vaccine Safety Data Link. It's14 a large, robust link database that independent15 researchers can go into and link vaccine exposures to16 a whole range of health outcomes.17 Beginning in 2003, the Petitioners have 18 asked in various settings to get access to data within 19 the Vaccine Safety Data Link. We learned early on20 that the federal government has outsourced or21 privatized the management of the Vaccine Safety Data22 Link, what was designed to be a public resource to23 generate public information about public health24 policy. They privatized it and are spending money25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 16 of 28816 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888paying the trade organization for the health1 maintenance organizations to sit over and administer2 the Vaccine Safety Data Link.3 The HMOs have refused access to the data 4 link to allow independent researchers to explore some5 of the possible associations that are at issue in6 these cases. The government has refused access to7 external researchers. There's no access at all to8 outcome data for children after 2000.9 In 2005, the Institutes of Medicine had a 10 hearing and issued a report urging better public11 access and better public utilization of this rich,12 robust, unique database, and a lot of those policies13 have not been implemented by the Department of Health14 and Human Services.15 There are studies that have been proposed 16 and haven't been done. We've heard for years now that17 there was, for example, a study on thimerosal exposed18 and nonthimerosal exposed children in Italy to look at19 potential associations between exposed children and20 unexposed children and health outcomes. We've never21 seen the study that the federal government supposedly22 was doing, and four years ago when we took depositions 23 they were saying that those were going to be out in24 about two years.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 17 of 28817 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888We still haven't seen the study that is 1 looking at an association between thimerosal exposure2 and autism and autism spectrum disorders. It's3 getting pushed out year after year after year. The4 science is needed, and the science isn't available.5 About a year ago the National Institutes of 6 Environmental Health Sciences convened an expert panel7 and recommended two very specific studies. One was8 using the VSD to extend forward in time and in a9 larger population the study that Dr. Verstraeten did10 and published in 2003 in Pediatrics looking at an 11 association between thimerosal exposure and12 neurodevelopmental outcome.13 That recommended study by the HHS' own 14 entity, own agencies, hasn't been done. There was a15 recommendation by that expert committee to do a study16 of twins and siblings and looking at exposures and17 outcomes. That study hasn't been done.18 In 2004, when the IOM was looking at this 19 issue, they asked the pharmaceutical industry simply20 to provide information that would provide people the21 pure data on when thimerosal truly was out of the22 nation's vaccine supply to get an idea of what the23 exposure was in the pediatric population during that24 slow phase-out of thimerosal as a preservative that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 18 of 28818 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888began in the year 2000. The IOM report said that the1 pharmaceutical industry would not provide that2 information.3 This is science that needs to be available. 4 It's science that shouldn't be locked up behind the5 rhetorical position of defending litigation. It's6 important that the Department of Health and Human7 Services be less focused on trying to prevail here and8 more focused on developing the science to build public9 confidence in vaccines and to have safe vaccines with10 safe ingredients.11 This idea that information isn't accessible 12 continues even within the litigation, however. The13 Special Masters may know, and this was discussed14 before the Cedillo hearing publicly, that it took 15 about a year for the Department of Health and Human16 Services to agree to make these test case hearings17 generally open to the public.18 There was a concession made by the 19 Department of Health and Human Services in a case that20 we had identified as a potential test case for hearing21 during this round of general causation proceedings,22 and the Department of Health and Human Services has23 taken the position that the details of that24 concession, the contents of the decision that might25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 19 of 28819 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888inform how people who have clients from the program1 evaluate their case and move their case forward and2 get resolution, they're taking the position that that3 is confidential and cannot be disclosed publicly. 4 Again, it's a focus on trying to prevail in the5 litigation and not a focus on good science, safe6 vaccines and public confidence.7 Now, Mr. Williams is going to in a little 8 bit more detail walk everybody through the elements of9 the Petitioners' theory of general causation, but I'm10 going to do a very condensed version of that to give11 the Special Masters and particularly people who are12 here in person and attending a very quick roadmap to13 how we will be laying out the case and how the14 evidence is going to be coming in in this case.15 The first point that we're going to make is 16 that neuroinflammation is a hallmark of regressive17 autism. The second point that we're going to make is18 that neuroinflammation leads to what Dr. Kinsbourne19 has called the overactivated brain. Now,20 neuroinflammation and overactivation in the brain is a21 model. It's a useful model for explaining the22 appearance of autistic symptoms and particularly the23 symptom of regressive autism.24 We'll also be putting on evidence that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 20 of 28820 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888anything that can trigger neuroinflammation1 potentially can be a trigger for the symptoms of2 regressive autism. Specifically we'll be looking at3 the thimerosal issue and mercury, and we'll put on4 evidence that inorganic mercury -- this is the Hg22 or 5 Hg2+. You'll see it written different ways. 6 Inorganic mercury is an agent that can trigger7 neuroinflammation. Specifically, inorganic mercury8 from thimerosal accumulates in the human brain. It9 accumulates and it persists.10 You'll also hear evidence that environmental 11 exposures, a number of them are now known to cause or12 contribute to the appearance of autistic symptoms, and13 you'll hear evidence that a gene/environment14 interaction is a likely culprit in many, many cases of15 autism; that is, the 88 to 90 percent of the cases16 where there's no single identifiable genetic cause17 there's a gene/environment interaction that's going18 on.19 What we will conclude through the evidence 20 on general causation is that thimerosal-containing21 vaccines belong on the list of potential environmental22 factors. If you have a list of environmental factors23 that might contribute, thimerosal-containing vaccines24 belong on that list for consideration whenever one is25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 21 of 28821 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888evaluating what might have caused regressive autism in1 a child where all the other known causes have been2 ruled out through differential diagnosis. Those are3 the elements of the Petitioners' general theory of4 causation.5 I want to start wrapping up my comments by 6 talking a little bit about the testimony you're going7 to hear in the two individual cases. So if where we8 are at the end of general causation is with a new9 candidate really on the list of candidates for the10 etiology of regressive autism, you're going to hear11 evidence that in Jordan King's case and William Mead's12 case these two boys have that differential that has13 been performed by their treating doctors, by the14 expert doctor, Dr. Mumper, who is the expert in15 treating autistic children who has evaluated the16 medical records.17 What they will tell you is that each of 18 these boys, and these are important facts. Each of19 these boys developed normally and typically, meeting20 all of their developmental milestones well into and21 after their first year of life.22 You'll also hear testimony that within the 23 first year of life they received a significant24 exposure to thimerosal. They received a full round of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 22 of 28822 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal, containing1 mercury before their first year of life. You'll also2 hear that their symptoms of autism emerged only after3 that full round of thimerosal had been administered.4 Both of these boys have been diagnosed with 5 regressive autism, and regressive autism is really6 characterized by three key things. This is the7 testimony that you'll hear. First, I've alluded to8 there's a period of normal, typical development for at9 least a year going into the second year with no10 obvious signs or symptoms of an autism spectrum11 disorder. Both of these boys, from the testimony in12 the medical records, meet that criteria.13 The second element of regressive autism is 14 that at a point in time they actually lose, and this15 is where the term regressive comes from. They lose16 previously acquired skills. They lose the ability to17 interact socially. They lose the ability sometimes to18 speak, either losing discrete words or entirely losing19 the ability to speak, so they regress in terms of the20 skills they've already developed.21 But just as importantly, they develop new 22 symptoms that were never there before, often23 behavioral symptoms, self-stimulatory behavior or24 stimming, as you might have seen it referred to in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 23 of 28823 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888some of the medical records: Odd facial tics, odd1 vocalizations, brand new symptoms that weren't there2 before. So you're presented with a very clear before3 and after picture, and those are the pictures you're4 going to see in both of these cases.5 Based on that and the standard that you 6 apply here in the vaccine program on causation,7 Petitioners believe that we will have satisfied our8 burden of proof by showing a medically reasonable9 theory of causation that's scientifically supported by10 the peer reviewed, published scientific literature. 11 It is a logical scientific theory. Every element12 follows in logical sequence, cause and effect, leading13 to the appearance of regressive autism.14 There's a temporal relationship between the 15 administration of the thimerosal in these vaccines16 between day one and the end of 12 months and the later17 appearance of symptoms after 12 months. All of those18 elements will have met on the proof that I've just19 described, and based on that both of these boys ought20 to be entitled to compensation in this program.21 But in addition to putting on that evidence, 22 you will hear additional evidence about why we know23 that each of these boys was particularly susceptible24 to the environmental insult that they received through25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 24 of 28824 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888thimerosal injection because certainly not every child1 who received that same load of shots developed2 symptoms like Jordan's or like William's or developed3 symptoms of any problem at all.4 That goes back to the gene/environment 5 interaction. A lot of the genetic issues are unknown,6 but we can see some indirect and circumstantial7 evidence in the medical records of both boys that8 first off they have a problem getting mercury out of9 their body. They cannot excrete mercury and protect10 their brain from the environmental insult of mercury11 provided by thimerosal as well as other children can,12 so you'll see evidence of that.13 You'll also see evidence that both boys, 14 particularly in the couple of years after their15 diagnosis, their systems were undergoing oxidative16 stress, and that's going to be important evidence to17 listen to in light of Dr. Deth's testimony that you're18 going to hear.19 We absolutely can see that this is indirect 20 evidence because the direct evidence is not available. 21 Evidence that children have ongoing neuroinflammation22 in the brain is often only available via autopsy or23 brain biopsy, and that's obviously not going to happen24 in these cases. Evidence that inorganic mercury is25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 25 of 28825 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888actually sequestered in the brain, the same thing. 1 It's generally autopsy and biopsy tissue sampling that2 is not going to be done and hasn't been done in these3 cases.4 So the evidence is indirect and it is 5 circumstantial, but it is supportive of the general6 theory of causation and supports awards of7 compensation for both of the boys here and, as you8 apply it to other cases down the road and you'll look9 for similar evidence, when you see evidence in those10 cases you also apply the general causation evidence11 here and reach the same conclusion that those cases12 ought to be resolved with compensation for those13 particular children too.14 Before asking Mr. Williams to talk in a 15 little more detail about causation, I do want to make16 a brief comment about the tone, frankly, of some of17 the expert reports that we saw from HHS and some of18 the attacks on the experts that we have appearing19 here. I would be remiss if I don't speak up on behalf20 of the families and the people that are treating them.21 There are doctors out there, Dr. Mumper 22 included, who are, quite frankly, pushing the23 envelope. They're pushing the envelope because the24 traditional medical establishment has been telling25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 26 of 28826 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888them there's no known cause. There's no known cure. 1 There's nothing you can do. Cope with it.2 These families, as you know from hearing 3 testimony in the other test cases and the testimony4 you're going to have here, are doing more than cope. 5 They're working hard to recover their kids, and they6 can only do it with the help of doctors like Mr.7 Mumper and Dr. Green, who is the treating doctor. He8 won't be testifying, but you've seen his medical9 records in Jordan's case and in William's case. These10 are doctors who are willing to challenge the11 establishment on behalf of their patients.12 I recall in the Cedillo hearing Dr. 13 Wiznitzer, when I asked him on cross-examination if he14 believed children with autism and regressive autism15 could be cured and could they recover and how he could16 explain how some of the kids seemed to get better; not17 all the way, but at least partway. He said well, they18 just grow out of it.19 This is not something that kids are growing 20 out of. This is something that they are fighting21 their way back from. Their regressions are something22 that present a battle. Their allies in their battle23 are doctors like Dr. Mumper.24 Again, I just think it's a shame that the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 27 of 28827 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888tone of some of the attacks that get right up against1 the line that borders on offensive and the disdain2 that some of the folks involved in the litigation seem3 to have for people who are putting their necks and4 their careers on the line to help these kids.5 When somebody says well, these were covered 6 kids, that's just anecdotal, not scientifically robust7 evidence. All of those anecdotes are our clients, so8 to those, to the attorneys, to the families, it's not9 an anecdote. It's a child, and it's a child that's10 made progress of varying degrees, and that's the11 evidence you'll hear here.12 Again, I'm going to turn this over to Mr. 13 Williams. What these hearings are about are about the14 science, the medicine, the integrity of the vaccine15 program, a transparent process that builds public16 confidence in the vaccines and ultimately a safe17 immunization schedule for all children. Thank you.18 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Thank you, Mr. 19 Powers.20 Mr. Williams, please go ahead. 21 MR. WILLIAMS: Special Masters, counsel, 22 thank you for the opportunity to make this brief23 opening statement. I'm going to briefly run through24 the scientific evidence that you're going to hear over25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 28 of 28828 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the next three weeks and show you just a handful of1 articles, what I think are probably the three or four2 most important studies and articles that you will see3 again and again throughout these three weeks.4 Let me begin by summarizing again what our 5 theory is in this logical sequence of steps from the6 vaccines with mercury in them to the inflammation in7 the brain that leads to regressive autism. Thimerosal8 delivers inorganic mercury to the brain. I'm going to9 show you an infant monkey study in a minute that was10 set up to mimic the infant vaccine schedule in this11 country, and what it established was that inorganic12 mercury accumulates in the brain of these children.13 When that inorganic mercury is in the brain 14 it leads to oxidative stress for two reasons: One,15 because of the neuroinflammation itself. As these16 immune cells are activated, they release all kinds of17 chemicals that cause oxidative stress and make it18 harder for the brain to function, but in addition we19 also know some of the mercury, some of this inorganic20 mercury, accumulates in neurons itself, and when it's21 in the neurons it directly leads to oxidative stress.22 When a neuron is stressed out from too much 23 oxygen -- it doesn't have enough antioxidants24 available -- it doesn't function correctly. It25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 29 of 28829 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888doesn't die, but it doesn't work right. This is not1 something that we've made up here. I'm going to show2 you right now a paper that is one of the most3 comprehensive reviews of how neuroinflammation can4 lead to autism.5 This is a paper entitled Autism at the 6 Beginning. It's written by a group of scientists from7 California who run one of the largest research centers8 in the world on the neurobiology of autism. Eric9 Courchesne is the lead author.10 At the beginning of this paper he describes 11 a case of regressive autism. He says: Autism begins12 in many ways. On the second page he describes a case13 of clearly pure regressive autism, a little girl who14 develops absolutely normally until she's 14 or 1515 months old and then suddenly loses her language16 skills, loses her social attention skills and, as Mr.17 Powers describes, starts to develop lots of new18 symptoms. Thus, autism begins.19 He cites literature to show that in one case 20 cited the autism began early, rapid and unmistakable. 21 You could see it before the kid was six months old. 22 That happens in most autistic cases, but then in a23 small handful of cases you get this kind of sudden24 regression.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 30 of 28830 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Now, this is a diagram out of the article 1 itself that shows the brain structure, the complexity2 of the brain at the time a child is born and at one3 month and at six months and at two years. The4 thimerosal injections occur in between each one of5 those pictures. There's a thimerosal injection in6 these children right after they're born. There's some7 more between one and six months, and there's some more8 between six months and two years. The inorganic9 mercury accumulates all around those cells in these10 children's brains as time goes on.11 Let's go to the quote, Scott. 12 This is just a description in the paper 13 itself of the diagram that I just showed you. These14 are actual pathological brain drawings from autopsied15 children.16 Okay. Next slide, Scott. I don't think we 17 need to show that one.18 Now, these children also, we know from 19 autopsies of autistic children, get too many neurons20 in some parts of their brains. The program that's set21 up to make their brains grow correctly somehow goes22 awry and they get too many neurons. What this paper23 explains is how neuroinflammation, this activation of24 the brain's innate immune system, can lead to too many25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 31 of 28831 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888neurons.1 It's triggered by adverse events that ignite 2 the neuroinflammatory reactions reported by Vargas. 3 Now, they're citing this Vargas paper, which you'll4 also see. I'm not going to show that to you now, but5 Vargas is a study from Johns Hopkins of autopsied6 brains from autistic children that found7 neuroinflammation in every one of them. Since then,8 as you'll see, there's been other studies published9 that have confirmed that.10 Next? 11 This is still from the Courchesne paper. 12 Vargas found evidence of astroglial and microglial13 activation and neuroinflammation in both the white and14 gray matter in samples from the cerebellum.15 Okay. Next? Next paragraph? 16 In all three regions there was enlargement 17 of astroglial cell bodies and their processes. 18 Microglial activation -- these are immune cells in the19 brain -- was present in the cerebellum, in the20 cerebral cortex and its underlying white matter, and21 it had pronounced microglial activation with a loss of22 some neurons.23 In some parts of the brain you get too many 24 neurons. In other parts of the brain you get too few. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 32 of 28832 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888It's because the programming of how that brain grows1 that I showed you from the diagram over time. Between2 birth and two years, the brain grows four times as3 large as it is when the child is born, just enormous4 organization and connection and cell growth going on,5 and if you get inflammation while that's happening it6 disturbs the whole orchestration.7 Now, this is how he explains that 8 neuroinflammation can cause these structural changes,9 but he not only says it can explain these structural10 changes. It can explain the functional changes too.11 The next paragraph, Scott, I believe has a 12 quote about that.13 Excess glial production or activation have 14 the potential to produce any or all of the previously15 discussed microstructural findings, but also you'll16 see he talks about here it also could underlie17 theories of autism based on functional imaging18 studies, so neuroinflammation from birth to two can19 cause structural changes in the way the brain is20 getting organized and connected, and it can also cause21 functional changes.22 Actually, this Johns Hopkins group is now 23 working on ways to try to attack the functional24 neuroinflammation as a way to potentially cure autism.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 33 of 28833 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Next? Next slide, please. 1 This paper also goes on to point out that 2 these inflammatory reactions are going to be3 identified. Some trigger is going to set them off. A4 chemical pathogen like a measles virus, or you'll hear5 evidence of other viruses. There are studies that6 show malaria at the age of two or three can induce7 autism in children.8 You'll hear evidence of lots of postnatal 9 viral infections that can lead to neuroinflammation10 and autism, as well as chemicals that can do it. I'm11 going to show you one in a second.12 Okay. Let's go on. 13 Now, we know that inorganic mercury can 14 ignite this neuroinflammatory process because of a15 series of studies done in Seattle at the University of16 Washington in the mid 1990s on adult monkeys. You're17 going to see these studies over and over again. I'm18 not going to go through them in detail now, but I just19 want you to see the first page of each one.20 This was a whole series of adult monkeys 21 that were given very low doses of methyl mercury, low22 doses that were intended not to provoke any kind of23 acute reaction, and then they sacrificed the monkeys24 at different times over a period of 18 months.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 34 of 28834 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888What they found, these studies all together 1 found that methyl mercury will enter the brain. It2 will then have the methyl group detach and it will3 form Hg++, this inorganic mercury, and the inorganic4 mercury accumulates in the brain over time and is5 trapped there. It doesn't leave.6 They estimated the half life of inorganic 7 mercury in the brain of these adult monkeys to be in8 years, literally in years because it's so bound up9 with molecules in there and in these neuro microglial10 cells that it turns them on, but it can't get it out11 of the brain so it's trapped there.12 Let's show the next one, Scott. 13 This is another. They published five 14 separate papers out of this single study on adult15 monkeys. This is talking about the changes in the16 glial cells in one part of the brain of these monkeys.17 Next? Next, Scott? 18 This is the paper where they looked to see 19 whether it was organic mercury or inorganic mercury in20 the brains of these monkeys, and what they found was21 that it was inorganic mercury.22 Here's another paper from that study where 23 they confirmed that it was inside the glial cells, the24 astroglial cells and the microglial cells, where the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 35 of 28835 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888demethylization took place. In other words, where the1 inorganic mercury was formed was inside those cells.2 Okay. Next one, Scott? 3 And they also then looked to see if the 4 number of cells changed in the brains of these5 monkeys, and they found that they did. The microglia6 -- those are the immune cells where this mercury is7 trapped -- multiplied and proliferated and became8 activated and was still activated at the very end of9 the study after 18 months.10 But moreover, they found a decrease in the 11 number of astrocytes, which is another type of glial12 cell in the brain. The astrocytes provide vital13 function and support to neurons, and what they found14 was that as this inorganic mercury accumulated in the15 brain it not only activated the microglia, but it16 reduced the number of these supportive astrocytes.17 You'll see the details of these studies as 18 we present the evidence and as we cross-examine the19 defense witnesses next week.20 Okay. Next? 21 So those adult monkey studies establish that 22 the methyl mercury was demethylated, changed to23 inorganic mercury which was trapped in the brain and24 which activated neuroinflammation, proving that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 36 of 28836 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888inorganic mercury in the brain will activate1 neuroinflammation.2 Now, this same group of researchers got a 3 grant to do this infant monkey study I told you about,4 and what's very, very important for this proceeding is5 that one of the authors of this study, this infant6 monkey study, is Tom Clarkson, who is a defense7 witness.8 Now, he's not going to come this month. 9 Apparently we're going to hear from him in July, but10 he's a co-author of this paper, which we think is11 probably the single, central most important paper in12 the trial. I highlighted his name there so you can13 see that he was one of the authors of this paper.14 Let me summarize quickly what this shows. 15 Yes. Let's go here first. The inorganic form of16 mercury was readily measured in the brain of the17 thimerosal-exposed monkeys. They had both infant18 monkeys they fed methyl mercury to, and they had19 infant monkeys that they injected thimerosal into.20 There's a quote that shows where it 21 simulated the vaccine schedule, Scott. I wanted to22 show that one for sure. I think it was on the prior23 page.24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Just for the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 37 of 28837 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888record, this article is the Burbacher 2005 article.1 MR. WILLIAMS: Yes. Thank you, Your Honor. 2 I should identify them better for the record.3 Now, there's a quote that shows the 4 simulation if I can find it. It's on the first page,5 Scott, in the right-hand column. Yes. Right here.6 The dosages and schedule of the 7 administration of mercury were chosen to be comparable8 with the current immunization schedule for human9 newborns, taking into account that the monkeys grow10 four times as fast. Again, this is a defense expert11 who wrote this and who helped to design this study.12 Now let's go to the chart of the blood. One 13 of the things, the defense reports are full of how14 rapidly ethyl mercury is cleared from the blood15 compared to methyl mercury in these children. The16 same thing happened with the monkeys. This is a chart17 of the blood levels of mercury after each injection.18 You can see that this is in nanograms per 19 milliliter. That's the measure they have chosen. Our20 experts will explain later how these concentrations21 are picked, but the point is blood levels are very22 high after the injection, but then cleared. Within23 seven days they return almost to baseline.24 And then another injection happens. The 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 38 of 28838 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888blood levels go up. They come back down again in1 seven days, over and over again until at the end you2 can see that the mercury from the blood is cleared3 very fast in these monkeys. The same thing happens4 with human infants.5 However, the inorganic mercury that got into 6 the brain doesn't leave. This is the chart. The7 purple shows you what happens to the inorganic mercury8 after each injection. The first injection you get up9 to about four nanograms per milliliter, but then even10 though it clears out of the blood it doesn't leave the11 brain.12 The second shot, you get another bump up in 13 inorganic mercury; the third shot another bump; and14 the fourth shot another bump to where the infant15 monkeys in these studies at the end of the study had16 16 nanograms per milliliter on average in their17 brains, and the half-life was the same as in the adult18 monkeys. It didn't change. It's there. It's going19 to be there for years.20 Now, they haven't yet released the data on 21 the activation of the brain cells in this study. That22 work is being done and it isn't available yet, but we23 know from the adult monkey studies what inorganic24 mercury will do, and this is in the same dose level as25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 39 of 28839 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the adult monkey study. Let me show you that quote.1 Scott, it's the one that says: Five years. 2 It's on the right-hand side of this. Yes, that's it3 right there.4 The effects of the adult monkeys, and this 5 is Dr. Clarkson again endorsing the validity of those6 five adult monkey studies that I showed you to begin7 with, saying that the effects of the adult monkeys8 were associated with brain inorganic levels only five9 times higher -- only five times higher -- than in the10 infant monkeys.11 You're going to hear I think lots of studies 12 that show the developing brain, the developing infant13 brain, is probably 10 times more sensitive to the14 effects of mercury than the adult brain, and yet we15 only have a difference of five times here between the16 measured levels of inorganic mercury in these brains.17 Dr. Clarkson also endorses the general 18 nature of our theory.19 Scott, if you look at the last thing here? 20 This article notes, referring again to the 21 Vargas autopsy study: It is important to note that an22 active neuroinflammatory process has been demonstrated23 in the brains of autistic patients, including a marked24 activation of microglia.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 40 of 28840 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So these authors put all this together in 1 the way that I've been trying to explain to you to say2 that inorganic mercury is delivered to the brain with3 these injections of thimerosal. It accumulates in the4 brain and it activates microglia, and if you activate5 the immune system in the brain with neuroinflammation6 you can cause regressive autism.7 Okay. Next, Scott? 8 I'm not going to take the time now to show 9 you these autopsy studies, but since the Vargas study10 was published in 2005 there was another study on11 autopsies of autistic children published this last12 year, Lopez-Hurtado, which found exactly the same13 thing. They found neuroinflammation in all the brains14 of these autistic children.15 And then recently, literally recently -- in 16 fact, one study was just published this week -- an17 autopsy study of children with autism that found again18 neuroinflammation, which seems to be the hallmark of19 the autistic brain.20 Next slide? 21 Now let me say something about epidemiology. 22 The defense reports are full of citations to the23 various epidemiology studies that have been done in24 Europe and elsewhere on thimerosal and vaccines and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 41 of 28841 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888whether there's been some change in the rate of1 autism.2 We're going to have Dr. Greenland here soon 3 to explain this in great detail, but not one of these4 studies has ever looked at regressive autism. There's5 going to be some dispute about what percentage of6 autistic children in the grand spectrum are truly7 regressive, but the general consensus I think you're8 going to hear is it's 15 percent or less.9 What Dr. Greenland will explain to you is 10 that it's 15 percent or less of the cases, and you're11 looking at all cases of autism. You can't see a12 change in regressive autism in these studies. The13 studies are just simply uninformative on the question14 of whether thimerosal vaccines are related to15 regressive autism.16 There is no published case control study on 17 regressive autism. There's no cohort study on18 regressive autism. As I've just explained, none of19 the ecologic studies that look at patterns and trends20 have ever looked at regressive autism.21 Now, there are a number of environmental 22 toxins that are going on the list of possible causes23 of autism, and one of the more recent ones is a drug24 called Terbutaline. Terbutaline is a drug given to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 42 of 28842 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888pregnant mothers to try to stop premature labor so the1 baby isn't born too preterm. It's not used very much2 any more because now it's been accepted it causes3 autism.4 It's given in the typically sixth to eighth 5 month, so very late of the second trimester up to the6 third trimester of pregnancy. There's a case control7 study that you'll see a lot of later in the trial by8 Connors, et al. This is the same group, by the way,9 at Johns Hopkins that did some of the autopsy studies.10 Connors, et al. They did a study on twins 11 and siblings, and what they found was that if there12 was an autistic child and his twin or sibling was13 given Terbutaline, they were two to four times as14 likely to get autism as the twins or siblings of15 autistic children who weren't exposed to Terbutaline.16 So that has now put Terbutaline on the list 17 of toxic agents that can cause autism. Guess what18 mechanism they've now figured out Terbutaline uses to19 cause autism? It's neuroinflammation. The same group20 again did an animal study on Terbutaline trying to21 figure out what is it about Terbutaline that can lead22 to autism, and what they found is it caused this same23 type of neuroinflammation and it caused behavioral24 changes in these rodents.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 43 of 28843 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888You'll see that in detail, but here's an 1 example of another agent that's known to cause autism2 late in pregnancy, near the time of birth, and causes3 it through the neuroinflammatory process.4 Okay. Next slide? 5 Let me run through just really quickly more 6 for the audience than for the Special Masters who our7 experts are going to be. We're going to have Sander8 Greenland, our epidemiologist; Vasken Aposhian, whom9 is Richard10 Deth, who is a research pharmacist; Marcel Kinsbourne,11 whom you know, a pediatric neurologist; and then Dr.12 Elizabeth Mumper, a pediatrician who runs a clinic13 that treats hundreds and hundreds of autistic14 children.15 Let me just summarize quickly. Marcel 16 Kinsbourne, as you probably know, is the author of the17 chapter on childhood neurodevelopmental disorders,18 including autism, in this book, which is the leading19 textbook of pediatric neurology in the country. In20 all seven editions of this book, he's been the author21 of that chapter.22 Dr. Greenland is the co-author of this book, 23 which is the leading textbook on epidemiology methods24 taught in graduate schools around the country. This25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 44 of 28844 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888is the second edition of the book. The third edition1 just came out and I won't have a copy until tomorrow,2 but again we have one of the leading textbook authors3 on the subject who's coming here to address you.4 Dr. Aposhian is a world-recognized authority 5 on toxicology that you've heard of many times before. 6 Dr. Deth has performed and published many of his own7 studies on thimerosal and neurons and how thimerosal8 can lead to oxidative stress. And then finally Dr.9 Mumper is the medical director for the Autism and10 Research Institute and manages a large clinic that11 treats autistic children.12 Now, there's a debate between the sides here 13 as to whether autism is totally genetic or whether14 there has been an increase in the rate of autism over15 the last many years. I think we will be able to16 convince you that the epidemic is real, that the17 increase is real.18 First of all, there's no such thing as a 19 genetic epidemic. If autism was all genetic, you20 wouldn't see a change in rates. You can only see an21 increase if something is triggering it, so it's an22 interaction between the environment and the genetic23 susceptibilities of these children.24 There's been no change in the criteria for 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 45 of 28845 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888regression. The defense experts all try to say well,1 it's just an expansion of the criteria for diagnosis2 or it's just better ascertainment of the cases. We3 really don't have an increase in autism. We just have4 a better awareness of it and are better able to5 diagnosis it.6 That doesn't make sense for regressive 7 autism because a true regressive autistic case is so8 dramatic nobody would miss it. It's not like they9 could have overlooked hundreds and hundreds of10 regressive autistic cases over the last 20 years.11 And yet the percentage of autistic cases 12 that are regressive has not changed. It's really13 pretty much stayed the same over 20 years, which means14 the regressive cases have increased, but if the15 regressive cases have increased, that has to be a real16 increase. They couldn't possibly have missed17 regressive cases.18 So there is genetic susceptibility. 19 Obviously we know there's a genetic component to your20 susceptibility to the autism spectrum disorder. We21 know that several environmental factors have already22 been identified as triggers of autism, and even23 Respondent's scientists will acknowledge that some of24 these environmental factors are triggers. Some25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 46 of 28846 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888viruses are triggers. Some drug agents like1 Terbutaline are triggers. I already actually went2 through the Terbutaline example so I won't go through3 it again.4 Another very important concept is in every 5 study of mercury disposition in animals, in rodents,6 in primates and in humans there is always a wide7 individual variation in how much mercury gets out of8 the blood, how much mercury goes into the brain. If9 you're injecting several million kids with the same10 level of mercury, you're going to have a wide11 distribution of effects. Some kids can clear it very12 quickly and some kids can't.13 We believe it's the kids who are at the high 14 end of the curve who are the ones that have the most15 trouble clearing mercury, and we know from all the16 studies that there's always some animals or some17 humans that are in that category. Those are the ones18 that are at most danger of having the inorganic19 mercury trapped in the brain in higher quantities and20 causing this neuroinflammatory process.21 Okay, Scott. 22 And then there's another reason why some 23 children are especially vulnerable. At birth there's24 a wide variability in how mature the liver is at25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 47 of 28847 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888clearing mercury. Some kids are born with a much more1 mature biliary functioning system than others.2 The blood-brain barrier develops from birth 3 to three, four, six months of age, and it varies4 tremendously between kids. Some kids have a much5 better blood-brain barrier when they're born than6 others.7 We know that some kids don't excrete mercury 8 as fast as others. We know some don't detoxify it as9 fast as others, and we know that some kids don't have10 the full antioxidant metabolism that's required for11 healthy neuronal function and so they're at risk for12 any provocation of stress on the neurons from13 oxidative stress. In other words, they're equipped to14 handle some oxidative stress, but they can't handle15 excess oxidative stress as well as most children can. 16 You're going to see evidence of that.17 So we believe you will be convinced when 18 we're done that thimerosal injections during infancy19 are a substantial contributing cause of20 neuroinflammation and the resulting symptoms of21 regressive autism.22 And then just one quick note about the legal 23 standard for causation in the program. We know we24 have to prove a medically plausible theory of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 48 of 28848 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888causation, and I believe we're going to do that. We1 know we have to prove a logical sequence of cause and2 effect, and I think we're going to be able to do that.3 And we of course have to show a temporal 4 relationship between the exposure and the injury. As5 Mr. Powers explained, these two kids in this case6 didn't develop any symptoms until after they got this7 whole range of doses of inorganic mercury.8 That's the end of our opening statement. 9 Thank you very much for your attention, and we'll get10 on with the science.11 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Thank you very 12 much, Mr. Williams.13 For the government, did you have an opening 14 statement?15 MS. RICCIARDELLA: Yes, we do, sir. 16 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Please go ahead. 17 MS. RICCIARDELLA: Could we also switch the 18 computers, please?19 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Ms. Ricciardella, 20 please go ahead when you're ready.21 MS. RICCIARDELLA: Thank you. Good morning. 22 My name is Lynn Ricciardella, and I, along with my23 colleagues at the Department of Justice, represent the24 United States.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 49 of 28849 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Special Masters, I've been working on the 1 autism omnibus litigation for the Department of2 Justice for over four years, and during that time I3 have looked at hundreds of pages of medical records in4 my autism cases, as have my colleagues here today.5 In every case those records tell the same 6 message, and that is how dedicated and loving the7 parents are to their autistic children. It shows what8 lengths parents will go to and what sacrifices they9 will willingly make to help their autistic children.10 That recognition extends not just to the 11 parents. In the majority of cases that I've reviewed,12 the records show that the extended family is also13 intimately involved in that child's care, so I'd like14 to take this opportunity to open today with an15 acknowledgement from all of us at the Department of16 Justice, along with our colleagues at the Department17 of Health and Human Services, that we have tremendous18 respect for the families who have to deal day in and19 day out with autism and who do so courageously and20 admirably.21 I also want to echo Special Master Hastings' 22 sentiments and especially acknowledge the Mead and the23 King families for graciously allowing their cases and24 their children's medical conditions to serve as the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 50 of 28850 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888test cases in this litigation. Thank you.1 Now, as you are undoubtedly aware, Special 2 Masters, the issue of whether vaccines cause autism3 has understandably garnered much public attention, and4 with regard to the cases pending in this Court5 specifically there has been much discussion and6 rhetoric espoused in the public by those who have7 formed a judgment through misinterpretation of the8 evidence or by ignorance of it.9 Respondent, however, has chosen to litigate 10 our case inside the courtroom in the proper context11 before the three of you who have the extremely12 important job of deciding these cases. We have13 decided to litigate our case not with supposition or14 accusation, but with good, solid, reliable evidence. 15 As we did for Theory 1, we intend to provide you with16 good, solid, reliable evidence that you can apply not17 just to these two cases, but to most, if not all, of18 the pending cases in the omnibus.19 Now, what is good, reliable evidence? Well, 20 the United States Supreme Court has already said what21 it is in Daubert . It's evidence based on research 22 with those who have specific training and experience23 in the subject matter being discussed. It's24 hypotheses that have been tested. It's opinions that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 51 of 28851 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888rise above the level of pure speculation. It's1 evidence of research that's been reduced to writing,2 exposed to the peer review process, scrutinized,3 discussed and replicated.4 It's testimony from experts who have 5 experience in the specific area for which they're6 testifying, experts who treat autistic children,7 experts who research autism, who research the8 behaviors of autism and the neuropathology and the9 neuroanatomy of autism, experts who research specific10 types of mercury and experts who actually treat11 mercury poisoning.12 Now, Respondent will present testimony from 13 some of the world's most prominent experts in their14 field. Unlike Petitioners' experts who broadly15 speculate about an unlimited universe of scientific16 possibilities, Respondent's experts root their17 opinions in decades of meticulous, specialized18 research.19 You'll hear experts from Respondent who are 20 experts in toxicology who each possess their own21 individual expertise, but who all ground their22 opinions on the most well-recognized and well-23 established tenants of toxicology, namely dose, form24 of exposure and root of exposure. These renown25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 52 of 28852 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888toxicologists will explain how Petitioners' experts1 directly and indirectly ignore scientific foundations,2 replacing scrutinized evidence with novel theories and3 speculative hypotheses.4 You will learn that the mechanisms of damage 5 hypothesized by Respondent's experts have never been6 validated and are not accepted by the rest of the7 scientific community. You will hear from neurologists8 who focus their research on the neuropathology and the9 neuroanatomy of autism.10 However, no one has conclusively found or 11 discovered the neuropathological origins of autism. 12 Each expert will confront that the findings reported13 in the literature indicate that the pathogenesis of14 autism arises in the early stages of brain development15 in utero.16 Now, the neuropathology of mercury toxicity 17 has also been studied, and it's not consistent with18 the findings that have been reported in relation to19 autism. You will hear that there is no20 neuropathological evidence whatsoever that thimerosal21 could injure the brain in a way that would result in22 autism.23 You will hear from the world's experts in 24 the diagnosis, treatment and research of autism. You25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 53 of 28853 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888will hear from the experts who actually write the1 criteria that the rest of the world uses to diagnose2 autism. You will hear from experts who have a3 particular expertise in regressive autism. They will4 tell you it's not rare, and there is no evidence5 whatsoever that there are any biological differences6 between regressive autism and nonregressive autism.7 You will hear from Respondent's experts in 8 epidemiology who will explain that multiple, credible9 studies have been done in different countries using10 different methodologies, but they all come to the same11 conclusion: There is no association between12 thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.13 Special Masters, it's very important to keep 14 in mind what the issue before the Court is in this15 litigation. This issue is about thimerosal-containing16 vaccines administered to children. This issue is not17 about whether mercury is good or bad. This issue is18 not about whether any form of mercury is good or bad.19 Let's be clear. The allegation levied in 20 this litigation is whether these children developed21 now we're hearing regressive autism because of22 exposure to a specific form of mercury by way of a23 specific route of administration given at specific24 times and in specific amounts.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 54 of 28854 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Now, as you consider the evidence I'd like 1 you to please keep in mind four essential concepts. 2 The first is what is the substance being discussed? 3 This case is about thimerosal, which is 50 percent4 ethyl mercury. Now, as Mr. Williams went on at great5 length, a lot of Petitioners' case is now about6 inorganic mercury. As you reviewed the Petitioners'7 expert reports, you saw that a lot of them rely on8 methyl mercury. This case is about ethyl mercury.9 Pay particular attention to the way in which 10 Petitioners' experts conveniently move between the11 different types of mercury. Well, there are different12 types of mercury, but none has ever been shown to13 cause autism.14 The second concept I'd like you to keep in 15 mind is dose. This case is about exposure to small16 quantities of ethyl mercury administered to children17 at specific times, usually at birth, at two months, at18 four months and at six months of age. Again, pay19 close attention to Petitioners' evidence. A lot of it20 will concern very high dose, continuous exposure to21 methyl mercury.22 Now, nobody here disputes the fact that 23 mercury can be harmful, and nobody here disputes the24 fact that mercury is a neurotoxin, but Respondent's25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 55 of 28855 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888experts will explain the importance of dose in1 assessing the risk of chemicals.2 Every substance can be harmful to humans in 3 sufficient doses, including water, salt or oxygen. 4 The dose of thimerosal administered in a routine5 childhood vaccine, however, is thousands, if not tens6 of thousands, times smaller than the amounts of7 thimerosal known to elicit adverse effects in humans.8 Now, as we heard a lot during the first 9 theory of causation, the most fundamental tenant of10 toxicology is that dose makes the poison, and that's11 why the proper focus of this litigation should not be12 whether mercury is a neurotoxin. It is. The proper13 focus of this litigation should be whether ethyl14 mercury is neurotoxic at the specific levels contained15 in childhood vaccines.16 Now, the third concept to keep in mind is 17 who is the exposed subject? This case concerns human18 beings, specifically children administered thimerosal-19 containing vaccines postnatally. This case is not20 about in vitro studies. Petitioners will rely on in21 vitro studies performed in petri dishes or studies22 done in animals, but once again this case concerns23 humans.24 The fourth and final concept I'd like you to 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 56 of 28856 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888keep in mind is critically important, and that is what1 is the clinical outcome that's being discussed? This2 case is about autism. This case is not about the3 death of snail neurons in a petri dish when thimerosal4 is placed directly on top of them. This case is not5 about high doses of methyl mercury that could6 potentially cause subtle neurological signs and7 symptoms. This case is about autism.8 Special Masters, in the six years since the 9 Court created the omnibus autism proceeding10 Petitioners' hypothesis has not moved beyond the realm11 of pure speculation. It was a relatively new12 hypothesis back in 2002 when the Court created the13 OAP. It's no longer new.14 If you recall, the Petitioners asked that 15 the hearings in these cases be delayed because they16 said the science was continuing to evolve. They were17 right. The science did evolve, and this issue has18 been studied, investigated and tested not just here in19 the United States, but by the worldwide scientific20 community, and every time it has been looked at it has21 been rejected.22 Now, Mr. Powers talked this morning about a 23 scientific debate. There is no scientific debate. 24 The debate is over. There's no scientific25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 57 of 28857 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888controversy. The only controversy is the media1 controversy, propelled by those groups who were2 founded on the premise that vaccines cause autism or3 by those groups who promote and advocate experimental4 therapies for autism such as chelation. The credible5 scientific community has already spoken on this issue6 and has rejected it.7 Now, Mr. Powers talked also about the need 8 for this case to be about science. That is absolutely9 correct, but to appreciate how radical and10 unscientific Petitioners' hypothesis is it's important11 to look at the origin of that hypothesis.12 Now, where would you think that origin to 13 have originated? Perhaps within medical experts from14 within the autism community? Logical, but that's not15 what happened. Perhaps within the toxicological16 community, experts who specialize in ethyl mercury or17 who treat mercury poisoning. That's not what happened18 either.19 Would you at least have expected the 20 hypothesis to originate within the medical or21 scientific community at large? You'd be wrong. Would22 you ever have expected the hypothesis to originate23 with a marketing consultant? That's exactly what24 happened.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 58 of 28858 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888There was nothing in the scientific 1 literature until the year 2000 when a woman named2 Sallie Bernard, who is not a medical professional --3 she's a marketing consultant and the mother of an4 autistic child. She published an article entitled5 Autism, A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning. Now, she6 wrote the article in 2000, but she published it in7 2001 in a journal called Medical Hypotheses . 8 Now, this was not a peer reviewed article 9 that appeared in a journal of known repute. Let's10 take a look at how the journal describes itself. 11 We've taken this directly off of the journal's12 website. Under the Aims and Scope section it states:13 Medical Hypotheses takes a deliberately 14 different approach to review. Most contemporary15 practice tends to discriminate against radical ideas16 that conflict with current theory and practice. 17 Medical Hypotheses will publish radical ideas so long 18 as they are coherent and clearly expressed.19 Special Masters, you heard a lot of 20 testimony during the Cedillo trial and the three 21 trials in Theory 1 how the peer review process is22 really the bedrock of scientific credibility. Well,23 the editors at Medical Hypotheses don't agree. 24 Here's what they have to say about the peer 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 59 of 28859 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888review process: Traditional peer review can oblige1 authors to distort their true views to satisfy2 referees and so diminish authorial responsibility and3 accountability. Instead, the editor of this journal4 is going to be a chooser, not a changer. In other5 words, the journal is going to assume that the author6 is correct rather than have the peer review process7 assess that credibility and reliability.8 That's not all the journal says about the 9 articles that it will publish. It says: Even10 probably untrue papers may be judged worth publishing11 if they contain aspects, ideas, perspectives, data12 that are potentially stimulating to the development of13 future science. Even probably untrue articles.14 There's another section on this website 15 entitled Guide for Authors. It explains that if you16 want an article published in this journal you have to17 pay for it. You have to pay a page charge. The18 papers won't be published until payment is received. 19 So if you want an article published in Medical 20 Hypotheses you can. It can be radical, it can be 21 unsubstantiated, and it can probably even be untrue. 22 You just have to pay for it yourself.23 Now, when the Bernard article came out in 24 2001, the groups that had been advocating for a link25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 60 of 28860 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888between vaccines and autism started to dangerously1 promote the idea that thimerosal in vaccines was2 creating an autism epidemic in this country, and thus3 began their running indictment of the CDC, the CDC's4 vaccination policies and their continuous accusation5 against our nation's immunization program.6 Because of the enormous public health 7 concern generated by these accusations, the scientific8 and medical community became involved. In 2001, the9 Institute of Medicine asked its Immunization Safety10 Review Committee to look into the issue.11 Now, in 2001 the IOM's committee did not 12 just focus its attention on autism. That was one of13 the outcomes it looked at, but in 2001 they looked at14 a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, and here's15 what the conclusion that the 2001 committee said it16 stated the evidence was at the time:17 That it was inadequate to accept or reject a 18 causal relationship between exposure to thimerosal19 from vaccines and the neurodevelopmental disorders of20 autism, ADHD and speech or language delay. The 200121 committee specifically recommended that additional22 studies be done, particularly epidemiological studies.23 Well, the Safety Review Committee of the IOM 24 met again in 2004, on February 9, 2004, and by this25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 61 of 28861 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888time the issue of thimerosal in vaccines had become1 highly publicized. They invited the public to address2 the committee to express its viewpoint. Many of the3 hypotheses relied upon by Petitioners in this4 litigation were presented to the IOM in 2004 and5 rejected by it.6 Now, between the time the committee wrote 7 its 2001 report and convened again in 2004, multiple8 credible studies had been done. As I mentioned9 before, they all came to the same conclusion: There10 was no association between thimerosal-containing11 vaccines and autism.12 This time, in 2004 the committee 13 specifically focused on just the neurodevelopmental14 disorders of autistic spectrum disorders or autism for15 short. They made a variety of conclusions, and here's16 what they had to say about causality: The committee17 concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a18 causal relationship between thimerosal-containing19 vaccines and autism. Now, that was the strongest20 possible conclusion available to the committee.21 They also made a conclusion with regard to 22 the biological mechanisms that underlie this23 hypothesis, and here's what they said: In the absence24 of experimental or human evidence that vaccination,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 62 of 28862 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888either MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal,1 affects metabolic, developmental, or other2 physiological or molecular mechanisms that are3 causally related to the development of autism, the4 committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to5 date are theoretical only.6 Now, the committee did recommend that 7 further research be done to look into the possible8 causes of autism. Here's what they said about what9 that focus of research should be: It should be10 directed towards those lines of inquiry most supported11 by the current state of knowledge. The vaccine12 hypotheses are not currently supported by the13 evidence.14 While the committee strongly supports 15 targeted research that focuses on better understanding16 the disease of autism, from a public health17 perspective the committee does not consider a18 significant investment in studies of the theoretical19 vaccine/autism connection to be useful at this time.20 Special Masters, it's been four years since 21 the IOM came to those conclusions, and in those four22 years the evidence continues to increase to support23 that conclusion. As I mentioned earlier, the24 hypothesis of thimerosal and autism has been studied25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 63 of 28863 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and tested, and not just here in the United States. 1 It's been tested by the worldwide scientific2 community, and the hypothesis has been resoundingly3 rejected.4 The following are just a sample of those 5 scientific organizations that have rejected this6 hypothesis: The World Health Organization, the7 Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of8 Pediatrics, the European Medicines Agency, which9 comprises 30 member countries, the Centers for Disease10 Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug11 Administration, the Canadian Pediatrics Society, the12 Canadian National Advisory on Immunization. Again,13 this is just a sample of the many organizations that14 have rejected this hypothesis.15 How did Petitioners' experts deal with the 16 worldwide scientific community against them? They17 said well, they weren't looking at the right evidence. 18 They argue that the evidence relied upon by the19 scientific community doesn't apply to a very rare,20 very small, genetically susceptible subgroup of21 children who develop regressive autism only as a22 result of thimerosal-containing vaccines. But that23 hypothesis is only as reliable and credible as the24 evidence upon which it is based.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 64 of 28864 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Now, once again this concept is also not 1 new. Mr. Powers talked about government rhetoric to2 worry about and to keep emphasizing how these cases3 pending in the omnibus will affect our nation's4 immunization program. Well, it's not just government5 rhetoric. The IOM in 2004 was concerned about it too. 6 Here's what they said about this hypothesis of genetic7 susceptibility:8 The benefits of vaccination are proven, and 9 the hypothesis of susceptible population is presently10 speculative. Using an unsubstantiated hypothesis to11 question the safety of vaccination and the ethical12 behavior of those governmental agencies and scientists13 who advocate for vaccination could lead to widespread14 rejection of vaccines and inevitable increases in15 incidences of serious infectious diseases.16 Now, having failed to find the validity they 17 need in the scientific community, Petitioners now turn18 to the legal one. But the first pronouncement that19 vaccines cause autism should not come from the20 courtroom. It should come from science.21 I'd like to end this morning with the oft 22 cited quotation from the venerable Judge Posner of the23 Seventh Circuit. He said: The courtroom is not the24 place for scientific guesswork even of the inspired25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 65 of 28865 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888sort. Law lags science. It does not lead it.1 Special Masters, the scientific community 2 has considered and rejected the allegations before you3 in this litigation. So too should this Court. Thank4 you.5 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Thank you, Ms. 6 Ricciardella.7 MR. POWERS: Special Master, I know we 8 didn't use the full hour. If we could have a very9 quick, five minute rebuttal opening?10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Go ahead. 11 MR. POWERS: Thank you. Very specifically, 12 I just wanted to address a couple of things because I13 think it's important to keep some of this in14 perspective.15 The discussion you heard from Respondent on 16 the 2004 IOM. It's important to remember several17 things about the 2004 IOM. Mr. Williams described and18 showed to you and you've reviewed in evidence a series19 of papers, important scientific papers from reputable20 researchers in peer reviewed, published, indexed21 scientific and medical journals that were not even22 considered by the 2004 IOM.23 When one looks at the bibliography of the 24 2004 IOM you won't see, for example, what we've25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 66 of 28866 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888identified as a critical study -- that's the 20051 Burbacher/Clarkson infant monkey study -- because the2 study hadn't been done. You won't see cited the3 Vahter and Charleston papers. Those are the adult4 monkey studies that Mr. Williams described from the5 mid 1990s.6 You won't see any of that work in the IOM, 7 and in fact the quote from the IOM about the8 physiological mechanisms that have been examined did9 not include the neuroinflammatory process. The IOM10 never saw it because they hadn't been done yet. The11 brain autopsy studies. They haven't seen the studies12 that came out in 2005, 2007 and 2008.13 We reviewed the Petitioners' master 14 reference list that was submitted to the Court, and15 approximately 275 of the articles on that list were16 published after the October 2004 IOM report was17 issued. The 2004 IOM report was a snapshot in time,18 and science is not a snapshot. Science is a movie,19 and it moves forward and moves forward by hypotheses20 being offered and tested.21 The other point I wanted to make is about 22 the difference between speculation and hypothesis23 because too often Respondent uses those terms24 interchangeably. When Petitioners are talking about a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 67 of 28867 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888hypothesis, we're talking about a hypothesis that1 means an idea that explains the known facts, an idea2 that can take a disparate set of facts, organize them3 in a consistent way and offer an explanation of, in4 this case, a mechanism that is consistent with the5 known facts and, just as importantly, can help predict6 some facts that may come down in the future.7 So it is more than speculation. These are 8 hypotheses that are testable. They are subject to9 studies that use their conclusions as the null10 hypothesis. They're replicable, and over time they11 will be replicated if, particularly in the clinical12 area, money goes into the research.13 One can't help but notice with the huge 14 number of expert witnesses that the Respondent has15 brought into these cases and the tens of thousands,16 perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars being spent17 to bring those witnesses in in the litigation context,18 is perhaps some of that money could go to support19 clinical trials and case control, placebo, blinded20 trials of some of the medical interventions just as an21 example of public health resources that could be used22 in a different way outside the litigation to answer23 scientific questions and to address the health of24 these kids.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 68 of 28868 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888That 2004 IOM, since it's a big part 1 apparently of the Respondent's position, needs to be2 put in context. I know that in the 2005 infant monkey3 study that was authored by the lead investigator was4 Thomas Burbacher at the University of Washington and5 Dr. Clarkson, who has been identified as Respondent's6 witness was the co-author on there.7 It's important to note towards the end of 8 that study that there's a comment in there about the9 2004 IOM. There's a comment that explains the10 conclusion, the approach the 2004 IOM took: It's11 difficult to understand, given our current limited12 knowledge of the toxicokinetics and developmental13 neurotoxicity of thimerosal, a compound that has been14 and will be continued to be injected into millions of15 newborns and infants.16 So the credible, reliable, peer reviewed 17 published researchers, including at least one on their18 side of the case, have identified a weakness in the19 2004 IOM. As I said in my opening, you can't cut20 science off at the knees, and we propose that the 200421 IOM closed the chapter on this issue before the story22 really started to get told.23 The story that you will hear in this 24 hearing, the presentation and the evidence, is a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 69 of 28869 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888scientifically sound description about ongoing story,1 and we don't know what the end is going to be, but we2 do know that where we are today is that we have a3 mechanism of injury that meets the standards of4 causation in this program, and there is medical5 evidence that these two children satisfy this burden6 and are entitled to compensation.7 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Thank you, Mr. 8 Powers.9 Well, we've heard from attorneys this 10 morning. Are we ready to start with the expert11 witnesses?12 MR. WILLIAMS: I think we are. Dr. 13 Greenland?14 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Dr. Greenland, 15 could you please take the witness chair? Please have16 a seat, sir. I'll ask you to raise your right hand.17 Whereupon, 18 SANDER GREENLAND 19 having been duly sworn, was called as a 20 witness and was examined and testified as follows:21 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Please go ahead 22 then, Mr. Williams, when you're ready.23 DIRECT EXAMINATION 24 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 70 of 28870 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Good morning, Dr. Greenland. 1 A Good morning. 2 Q Before we go into your qualifications, you 3 prepared a couple slides that just summarize what your4 general opinion is that you're going to be discussing5 today?6 A I have. 7 Q Okay. Let's just put up there what your 8 main point is, and if you would just explain it,9 please?10 A Well, the epidemiologic literature has not 11 ruled out the possibility that thimerosal-containing12 vaccines -- I'm going to call them TCVs -- are13 associated with a prespecified type of autism of a14 regressive form.15 I want to emphasize that what I'm testifying 16 about is the limitation of the epidemiologic evidence. 17 That's strictly my narrow scope of expertise and the18 statistics surrounding it.19 MR. WILLIAMS: Next slide? 20 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Mr. Williams, 21 before we go on to the next slide --22 MR. WILLIAMS: Yes? 23 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: You've got a 24 series of slides that he'll be talking about here?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 71 of 28871 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888MR. WILLIAMS: Yes. 1 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Do you have paper 2 copies of that presentation?3 MR. WILLIAMS: I don't know how many. We 4 only have two right now.5 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. Let's 6 mark one of them. What we did in the last trial I7 think was very helpful. We'll mark these things. 8 This will be Petitioners's Trial Exhibit No. 1.9 MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. 10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: We'll place them 11 into the record, and then later on if the witnesses12 and counsel can help to do this as you go from Slide 113 to Slide 2 to Slide 3, if you could mention we're now14 going to Slide 3. Then later on when we go back and15 read the transcript we can follow along. It will be16 much easier to follow the testimony if we have that17 roadmap.18 Let's go ahead and mark that. We'll give a 19 copy later on to the court reporter.20 MR. WILLIAMS: Who does the marking? 21 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Well, we'll mark 22 it later. We know what this one will be, Petitioners'23 Trial Exhibit 1.24 MR. WILLIAMS: All right. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 72 of 28872 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888//1 (The document referred to was 2 marked for identification as 3 Petitioners' Exhibit No. 1 4 and was received in 5 evidence.) 6 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Go ahead, Mr. 7 Williams.8 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 9 Q Okay. One more slide about the main points 10 of your testimony, and then we'll go into your11 qualifications, okay?12 A Okay. Well, in published control studies 13 that I have seen, but not analyzed, clearly regressive14 autism is very uncommon, as the expert, Dr. Fombonne,15 and we'll get to his calculations, as he said.16 Hence, even if the studies had separated the 17 clearly regressive cases, a true association could18 easily have been missed. They hadn't done that,19 however.20 Q Okay. We're going to go through that in 21 more detail just in a moment, but let's turn to your22 qualifications if you would, and this is now the23 fourth slide in the set.24 A Okay. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 73 of 28873 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q I told the Court that you were the co-author 1 of this book. Is that the truth?2 A That's correct. 3 Q Okay. And there's a new edition of this 4 that has just come out?5 A That's correct. 6 Q And is this textbook used around the country 7 and the world?8 A It is. It is. 9 Q And you are an author on over 300 peer 10 reviewed articles?11 A That's correct. 12 Q Okay. Slide 5. Are you a Professor of 13 Epidemiology and Statistics at UCLA?14 A Correct. 15 Q How long have you been there? 16 A I've been at UCLA on the UCLA faculty since 17 1979.18 Q And are you frequently invited to give talks 19 and presentations around the world on epidemiological20 methods?21 A That's correct. And also statistics. 22 Q And also statistics. All right. Slide 7. 23 You have a Doctorate in Public Health from UCLA?24 A That's correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 74 of 28874 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q So you were there before you started working 1 there?2 A That's correct. 3 Q Explain what these executive committees are 4 and so forth, please.5 A Well, Society for Epidemiologic Research is 6 the largest society of epidemiologists in the world7 today. I've served on the executive committee of that8 society.9 I've also been chair of the Epidemiology 10 Section of the American Statistical Association, which11 is the largest statistical society in the world today.12 Q And then I guess this is coming to Slide 7 13 next. You've been a consultant in epidemiology and14 statistics for many different governmental agencies15 and private corporations?16 A That's correct. 17 Q We don't have the whole list here? There's 18 a lot longer list than this?19 A Much longer. 20 Q And then you've been an investigator 21 yourself on many grants and contracts --22 A That's correct. 23 Q -- for NIH and other prestigious 24 organizations?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 75 of 28875 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Q And then we're ready for I think Slide 9. 2 Slide 8? Okay. Slide 8.3 Again, just some more of your 4 qualifications. You've been a referee for some of5 these journals. Are these major journals in the6 field?7 A They are. 8 Q Explain what these two journals are or three 9 journals are in the last section for us.10 A Well, American Journal of Epidemiology is 11 the most widely circulated, largest journal of12 epidemiology in the world as far as I know, and13 Epidemiology is maybe number two. 14 And then Statistics and Medicine is one of 15 the biggest medical statistics journals in the world,16 probably the biggest, and the European Journal of 17 Epidemiology is the main journal in Europe on the 18 continent.19 Q Okay. Now let's turn to what you've 20 prepared to talk about today. We'll go to what is now21 Slide 9. Is that right? Okay.22 I'll just let you explain this, and I'll 23 interrupt you from time to time if I think there's24 some clarification that needs to be done.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 76 of 28876 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes. Well, autism, like many other 1 diseases, is largely unknown causation and includes2 neurologic diseases of adults such as MS and ALS has3 clinically recognizable subtypes with distinct4 development trajectories and possibly different5 etiologies. What it has in common with these diseases6 is that by and large there is not an accepted7 mechanism that's been worked out in detail about how8 these diseases arise.9 An association between TCVs and regressive 10 autism, especially clearly regressive autism, would11 have been seriously diluted in all the available12 epidemiologic studies, if there were such an13 association.14 Q By diluted, what do you mean by diluted? 15 A Well, that I hope to clarify in the upcoming 16 slides.17 Q Okay. 18 A The association, if present, would be 19 submerged in the other types.20 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 10. I see. The 21 slides are marked on the screen. They're not marked22 on my copy. I'll be able to do this better now.23 A This says 10 on my screen. 24 Q Yes, it is Slide 10. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 77 of 28877 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Right. Should I continue? 1 Q Yes. 2 A Well, specificity of an association means 3 that an exposure has little or no association with the4 majority of types in a disease category, but some5 association with one or a few of those types.6 If a highly specific association is present, 7 failure to separate the types can severely dilute the8 association of the exposure with the disease category9 to the point that it can become undetectable.10 Q You just can't see it in the numbers, right? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q Okay. Slide 11? 13 A Regressive autism may include cases without 14 early developmental abnormalities. This is15 acknowledged by quite a bit of the peer reviewed16 literature and also testimony given in this case by17 Dr. Fombonne.18 Q In his report, right? 19 A In his report. 20 Q Right. 21 A I'm calling them clearly regressive cases 22 simply for lack of a better term. Such cases would be23 a minority of regressive cases and thus a small24 minority of all cases of autism, so even if something25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 78 of 28878 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888called regressive cases is common, but certainly not1 the majority of cases, then clearly regressive cases2 would become quite uncommon.3 Q And you've gone back to Dr. Fombonne's 4 report and pulled some information out of that that5 helps to illustrate your point, right?6 A That's correct. 7 Q Okay. Let's look at that. 8 A Next slide. 9 Q The next slide. There we go. 10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: And now we're on 11 Slide No. 12.12 MR. WILLIAMS: Slide 12. 13 THE WITNESS: Dr. Fombonne argues that 14 regressive autism is common enough to be detectible in15 available studies. He estimates there it's around 2016 percent of cases could get that label.17 On the other hand, he cites data that 72 18 percent of cases of regressive autism are not clearly19 regressive, so that means that clearly regressive20 cases are only 20 percent times 72 percent of all21 cases. That would be six percent of the total.22 He calculates that figure and gives it in 23 his report as an upper bound. He actually expresses24 skepticism that it's that high a percentage.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 79 of 28879 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888//1 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 2 Q So he's suggesting that the percentage of 3 clearly regressive cases may be less than six percent4 of all ASD diagnoses?5 A He seems to state it more strongly than 6 that; that he doubts that it's as high as six percent7 is my impression.8 I will say here that not being an expert in 9 Dr. Fombonne's area, I'm relying on his testimony here10 and the literature he cites, which I've gone back and11 examined it and it points to.12 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 13. 13 A Well, to take an example of what I'm talking 14 about with this dilution issue, suppose that TCV is15 associated with a twofold increase in the risk of16 clearly regressive autism. I'm just picking that17 number because it's often chosen as a boundary point. 18 Because it is that number or I'm claiming that or it's19 more or less, but just to take a number that's often20 used. It's a nice, round figure.21 Suppose that it's not associated with any 22 other type. It's only associated with clearly23 regressive autism. Suppose also that without TCV24 exposure the associated type represents only six25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 80 of 28880 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888percent of the disease category and that the total1 number of cases in the category would be 100. I'm2 taking this figure of six percent from Dr. Fombonne's3 report, and that's the upper bound.4 Q Okay. Now we're on Slide 14. 5 A Then, without the exposure, the number of 6 cases with the associated type would be 100 times .06,7 100 times six percent, which is six.8 Q So out of 100, you would expect six cases 9 roughly of clearly regressive autism?10 A That's correct. That's without the 11 exposure. We're assuming this is without the exposure12 they're six percent.13 With the exposure, however, the number of 14 cases of clearly regressive autism would double to 1215 if it doubled the risk.16 Q Right. 17 A And that would be in excess of six cases 18 over the original six.19 Q Okay. Let's go on to Slide 15. 20 A This excess produced by the vaccine would 21 result in a total of 100 plus six or 106 cases, which22 is only a six percent increase in the overall risk of23 the disease.24 This six percent increase translates to a 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 81 of 28881 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888risk ratio of only 106 over 100 or 1.06. This1 corresponds to Dr. Fombonne's upper bound so that if I2 took a number more in accord with what he seems to3 express is more likely it would be even less than that4 1.06, something even closer to one.5 Such a small risk ratio is already beyond 6 detection by epidemiologic studies of autism or of7 most topics for that matter. Epidemiology is simply8 too crude a tool to be able to detect -- increases in9 risk of this order are even closer to one -- except in10 extraordinarily rare instances.11 Q Now we're going to Slide 16. 12 A Some studies consider more broad categories 13 than autism. Some consider the category of autism14 spectrum disorder or, even more broadly, developmental15 disorders. These are some of the studies cited by Dr.16 Fombonne.17 If they're looking at a broader category 18 than general autism then clearly regressive autism19 would constitute an even smaller percentage of these20 categories, so an association of TCVs with one of21 these categories would be diluted even more than in22 the above examples, which means the risk ratio from23 this doubling of risk of clearly regressive autism24 would be even closer to one than that 1.06 we25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 82 of 28882 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888calculated in the previous slide.1 Q And even more difficult to see in any 2 epidemiological studies?3 A In that case it would be beyond detection by 4 epidemiologic means.5 Q Okay. Next slide, Slide 17? 6 A If 28 percent of cases of regressive autism 7 are clearly regressive, and this is one minus the 728 percent that Dr. Fombonne cited from his study. The9 28 percent remaining are clearly regressive, and TCV10 effects are limited to the clearly regressive type. A11 study of TCVs among all regressives would still be12 unlikely to detect the association.13 Time/trend studies of general autism, which 14 have been cited extensively in this situation, would15 be unable to detect a specific association of TCVs16 with clearly regressive autism because a diluted17 association, something as small as I was illustrating,18 would be submerged by the large background trends19 reported.20 Q Okay. Go to Slide 18. 21 A Now, genetic factors in regressive autism do 22 not rule out or even argue against TCVs as a cause.23 Q Okay. Why not? 24 A Even when genetic factors must be present 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 83 of 28883 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888for the disease to occur, they in no way limit the1 importance of other factors. A classic example is2 PKU, a genetic disorder which requires presence of3 dietary phenylalanine to produce mental retardation.4 Q And PKU is genetically based? 5 A It's a genetically based disease. That's 6 well established, and it's also well established that7 the mental retardation that can arise from it can be8 prevented by restricting dietary phenylalanine.9 Q And that's an example of a postnatal type of 10 brain problem that's caused by an environmental agent,11 correct?12 A That's correct. It's a prenatally 13 determined condition, but it's the postnatal exposure14 that determines the retardation.15 Q All right. Now let's go to Slide 19. 16 A Now, I feel it's important to discuss this 17 concept of statistical nonsignificance because it18 arises so much in litigation, as well as in scientific19 debates, and it seems to be widely misused and20 misunderstood even by experts.21 This is a topic that I and several of my 22 colleagues have lectured about all over the world, a23 major problem in the scientific literature. Failure24 to detect an association is what this means,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 84 of 28884 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888statistical nonsignificance. It is not a1 demonstration of no association. It only shows that2 no association -- I should have put that in quotes, no3 association -- is one among many possibilities that4 are compatible with the data.5 Now, the compatibility term used there is by 6 conventional and effectively arbitrary standards, but7 I'm not going to talk about those standards today. 8 I'll just adopt them like everyone else and simply9 discuss why even following those standards we have to10 be careful to understand that failure to detect an11 association is not a demonstration of no association.12 Whenever one considers statistical 13 significance or nonsignificance one should ask what14 other possible levels of association are also15 nonsignificant. These are given by confidence16 intervals.17 Q Okay. The next slide starts to illustrate 18 these, correct?19 A Yes. 20 Q This is Slide 20. All right. 21 A So to discuss their relation, suppose a 22 study reports a risk ratio of 1.00, no association23 observed at all, but with 95 percent confidence limits24 of .5 and 2.0, so one-half to two.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 85 of 28885 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888These limits would indicate that the 1 observed risk ratio is not significantly different at2 the conventional .05 level from a risk ratio as small3 as .5 or as large as two. That means that all the4 values within this range would not be rejected by the5 same statistical test that did not reject the 1.0. No6 association, and so in effect using this standard they7 would all still be in the running according to this8 criterion.9 Q Just because the relative risk nominally 10 comes out at 1.0 or even 1.2, if the confidence11 intervals are much wider than that there could be12 other values if you did the study again?13 A They wouldn't even have to be much wider. 14 What one needs to understand very carefully about15 epidemiologic studies and statistical studies of that16 sort is that they leave open a broad range of17 uncertainty. They're simply not within their power.18 Those studies do not have the ability in a 19 scientific sense to rule out these other options or20 possibilities.21 Q Okay. Slide 21 now. 22 A So another way of putting this example is 23 that chance alone could have easily produced the24 observed risk ratio of one even if the study were25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 86 of 28886 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888perfect, even if these were not just epidemiologic1 studies based on records of all their problems.2 It's never the case that these studies are 3 perfect, but even if they were perfect chance alone4 could have easily produced the observed no association5 if the true risk ratio were .5 or two.6 Q Okay. Next slide? 7 A Now, another crucial point is that 8 significance tests and confidence intervals ignore9 nonrandom errors. Hence, confidence intervals should10 be taken as showing the absolute minimum range of risk11 ratios compatible with the data.12 In other words, they're giving, and this has 13 been stated in the literature, the peer reviewed14 literature by Paul Meier, who was a renown medical15 statistician from the 1950s and 1960s. The Kaplan-16 Meier test is named after him and one of his17 colleagues.18 He said these should be taken as showing the 19 absolute minimum range of values compatible with the20 data. They're only giving you what would be your21 uncertainty left if the study were absolutely perfect. 22 They must be widened to account for nonrandom sources23 of uncertainty.24 When you examine them, think of that core 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 87 of 28887 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and moving out what blurs it out even further, such as1 differences in doses in different persons and cohorts2 as an example of one source of difference among the3 studies here.4 Q That means the confidence intervals, if you 5 think of them in the abstract, would be even wider6 than the nominal statistical ones?7 A That's correct. 8 Q Now Slide 22. Did you review the 9 epidemiological studies on mercury-containing vaccines10 in neurodevelopmental disorders that were cited by the11 defense and then look for any more you could find?12 A Yes. 13 Q What did you conclude from that review of 14 the epidemiological literature on mercury-containing15 vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders?16 A I didn't find any published or see any 17 published, peer reviewed, controlled epidemiologic18 study of TCVs and regressive autism per se. All19 studies that I saw identified -- that is failed to20 separate -- regressive autism from other types of21 autism, and certainly none of them looked at clearly22 regressive autism in a controlled epidemiologic study.23 Q Okay. Slide 24? 24 A Here are the studies that I saw identified, 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 88 of 28888 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888given some credibility by most of the reviewers,1 including Dr. Fombonne.2 Q That's just the list of them? 3 A That's just the list. 4 Q You're going to go through them in a second, 5 I take it?6 A Right. 7 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, 25. 8 A The study by Hviid, reported risk ratio for 9 any TCV. This is any exposure versus none, so it10 didn't matter if the doses were incomplete and so11 forth, if there was an incomplete vaccination series.12 It reported a .85 with 95 percent confidence 13 limits of .60 and 1.2 and a risk ratio for the highest14 dose category -- now going to the highest dose15 category where they receive three doses of mercury-16 containing vaccine. That was a point estimate of .96,17 but the 95 percent limits were from .63 to 1.47, so18 the results from that study would allow for19 substantial association with clearly regressive20 autism.21 Q In other words, this study by itself is not 22 at all incompatible with a true effect of TCVs on23 purely regressive autism?24 A That's correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 89 of 28889 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Okay. It doesn't rule it out? 1 A Not at all. 2 Q Okay. Slide 26. 3 A It's important to note that I think the 4 children in the study have roughly half the total5 mercury exposure in early childhood from the vaccines6 as in the American vaccination schedules, so the study7 should be expected to exhibit a weaker association of8 TCV with autism than would an American study if there9 were such an association. Its confidence limits10 should be expanded accordingly.11 Q And now Slide 27, the next study? 12 A The Andrews study from 2004 had 95 percent 13 limits of .88 and 1.12.14 Again, the vaccination schedules that I saw 15 reported in this study correspond to roughly half the16 American schedule, so again it would be expected to17 exhibit a weaker association with autism than would an18 American study, and its confidence limits would have19 to be expanded accordingly to apply to the American20 children exposed to the schedules.21 Q Okay. And then the next slide on this 22 study? These are two more studies?23 A Two more studies cited. One, Heron, was 24 another UK study. It reported no analyses for autism25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 90 of 28890 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that I saw, and another by Jick and Kaye, again among1 UK subjects, where the confidence interval was from .72 to 3.3.3 Again, these are using studies that are 4 looking at a population that had lower than American5 doses according to what I read in these reports and6 others.7 Q Now we're going to go to Slide 29, which is 8 about the Verstraeten study done in the U.S.9 A Okay. Well, the confidence intervals in 10 this study were wide, ranging from .62 to 1.46 and at11 the highest category .55 to 3.48.12 The conclusion reached by the first author 13 was an association between thimerosal and neurological14 outcomes could neither be confirmed nor refuted, and15 therefore more study is required. He stated that in a16 letter to Pediatrics following the study. 17 Q Let me ask you. If the defense experts and 18 the defense lawyers argue that this series of studies19 we've looked at provide convincing evidence that20 there's no association between thimerosal-containing21 vaccines and clearly regressive autism what would you22 say about that assertion?23 A I'd say I'm not convinced. I would say that 24 it doesn't. The epidemiologic evidence as I've25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 91 of 28891 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888described it here for the dilution reason that I've1 given -- if I take into account all the uncertainties2 associated with these studies, both the statistical3 error, the summary confidence interval that I would4 get combining these studies and then take into account5 the dose differences and what's not understood about6 the dose differences, that I could not possibly rule7 out the kind of small risk ratio overall that we saw8 before arising from a relatively large risk ratio for9 clearly regressive autism, using the figures that Dr.10 Fombonne gives in this report.11 Q Okay. Now, these studies that we looked at 12 were virtually all -- I guess they all were --13 ecological studies. None of them were case control14 studies, right, the ones we've been looking at?15 A No, no. These are all controlled 16 epidemiologic studies. One was a case control study. 17 I believe the others were based on cohorts so far. 18 These were controlled epidemiologic studies.19 Q These were the controlled studies? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Now you have a discussion of the ecologic 22 studies coming up?23 A Yes. 24 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 30. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 92 of 28892 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Well, then there were other studies that 1 have been cited or I saw cited that we would call2 ecologic studies in epidemiology. It's important to3 distinguish these studies from what I call controlled4 studies in the earlier slides. They're not considered5 adequate substitutes for controlled studies, and6 they're especially unable to reliably distinguish7 small associations from no association.8 I'm citing a book chapter by Morgenstern, 9 the chair of the Epidemiology Department at University10 of Michigan, and also another book chapter that I11 wrote for a CDC volume in 2004 where we cite extensive12 literature.13 It's been known for many decades that these 14 studies can produce completely misleading results very15 easily because they don't disaggregate people and16 identify individually whether a person who got a17 particular exposure such as a vaccination got the18 particular outcome being studied, such as autism.19 Q There's no connection to individual exposure 20 in these studies?21 A By their nature, they lack data connecting 22 the outcomes of the individuals with autism to their23 exposures, such as vaccination.24 Q Okay. Slide 31? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 93 of 28893 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Here are three major ones that I have seen 1 cited. They did not analyze regressive or clearly2 regressive autism cases that I saw, and specific3 association of TCVs with clearly regressive autism, if4 it existed, would have been completely submerged so I5 would say these studies really have virtually no6 evidential value regarding this particular issue on7 clearly regressive autism.8 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide about 9 Fombonne's study in particular.10 A Looking at Fombonne's study in more detail, 11 it analyzed PDD, pervasive developmental disorder,12 which is a much broader category that subsumes autism,13 as well as other disorders, so its results are even14 more diluted than the other ecologic studies.15 As the authors note, not all children in the 16 exposed cohorts of the study were exposed to17 thimerosal, leading to further dilution. This is18 another problem with the study.19 Q Okay. The next slide, still on the same 20 study. Slide 33 now.21 A Well, from the data presented there would be 22 about 60 cases of general autism in the study, so only23 about a dozen cases of regressive autism and perhaps24 only four clearly regressive.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 94 of 28894 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Now, regardless of whether that's so, I 1 would say regardless of that the article was2 uninformative about possible association of TCVs with3 regressive autism, and a reanalysis of the study data4 would not be capable of detecting such an association5 if it existed.6 Q Just because of the imprecision of the 7 study?8 A Of all the problems that we named before: 9 It's ecologic, it's looking at PDDs, and we have a10 situation in which there would not be enough clearly11 regressive autism to elevate the risk enough to be12 detected beyond the statistical noise level.13 Q Okay. So taking all of these studies 14 together, what do they mean with respect to the15 question here as to whether TCVs cause clearly16 regressive autism?17 A Well, because the currently published 18 evidence cannot rule out a very small association of19 TCVs with autism, and by that I mean something very20 close to one, like 1.06 or even closer to one as we21 saw before.22 Therefore, that evidence cannot rule out an 23 association of TCVs with clearly regressive autism,24 even a risk ratio of two, so the question of whether25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 95 of 28895 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888TCV is associated with clearly regressive autism1 remains unanswered by the current epidemiologic2 literature.3 Q Let's do a little math here for a second. 4 Suppose the real risk of clearly aggressive autism5 tied to the full American schedule is in the range of6 1.06 to 1.1, something like that, a six to 10 percent7 increase in risk.8 Even if it's not detectible by these types 9 of studies, if 40 million children receive that10 vaccination schedule throughout the '90s you're still11 talking about quite a few number of kids, aren't you,12 that would be affected?13 A Yes. 14 Q It would be essentially six percent of 40 15 million at risk, wouldn't it?16 A Well, no. The six percent refers to the 17 case series. The six percent would be applied over18 and above the number of autism cases that would be19 seen, not to the 40 million.20 Q Okay. 21 A But to however many cases that 40 million 22 would be expected to generate.23 Q Well, we could do the math, and we're still 24 talking probably hundreds and hundreds of cases that25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 96 of 28896 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888would not be detectible by these studies?1 A I would expect. 2 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, 35. 3 Now, here I will comment on some aspects of 4 Dr. Fombonne's report. In relying on it and his5 expertise in his specialty to discuss these issues, I6 tried to look closely at his citations and go back to7 the literature he was citing.8 I found that some of the citations were 9 unaccompanied by any evaluation of the statistical10 strength of the study cited. The strength of those11 studies -- I'll discuss that a bit more -- is related12 to the confidence intervals that we would get from13 them if we indeed calculated or could calculate them14 or the authors had given them to us.15 I do that in one case where there was enough 16 data for me to do that. The studies turn out to 17 largely not have enough statistical power or precision18 to rule out a hypothesis that there is a link between19 the TCVs and clearly regressive autism.20 I also found that some of the arguments 21 given and studies cited have little or no bearing on22 whether TCVs could cause regressive autism, and I23 found some citations that do not show what they're24 cited as showing. Now, this is with all due respect25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 97 of 28897 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888to Dr. Fombonne.1 I think that these problems, he was not 2 aware of them is my reading of the document and I3 think was doing this quite innocently, but it relates4 to the very problem I was discussing in the beginning5 of people failing to realize that it's important to6 see confidence intervals and put things in context of7 all sources of uncertainty when looking at studies8 like this, but now I'd like to give some examples of9 these problems that I noted.10 Q Okay. Slide 36. 11 A For example, he claims at paragraph 38, and 12 here's a direct quote: Unusual acceleration of head13 growth was seen with similar frequency in the14 regressive group as compared to the early onset group. 15 Then he cites a study by Webb and colleagues in 2007.16 This finding again illustrates both the 17 presence of objective developmental abnormality before18 the regression and the similarities between the19 regressive and nonregressive groups. That's his20 quote. That's what he says.21 I went and looked at the Webb study very 22 closely just to get a sense of how it was showing23 this, and I saw that it provides poor statistical and24 epidemiologic evidence and no logical support for the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 98 of 28898 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888idea that TCVs do not affect autism risk.1 Here is the reasons: On the statistical 2 side, the Webb article had only 28 cases of autism3 spectrum disorder total and only 11 classified as4 regressive, far too few to statistically detect all5 potentially important differences.6 If we consider the clearly regressive autism 7 type, which Dr. Fombonne argued was not maybe a third8 or a fourth of all the regressive types, there would9 only be two or three clearly regressive cases in this10 whole study.11 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 38. 12 A Then another problem is that the prevalence 13 of cases classified as regressive was 39 percent in14 the article. That's about two to three times the15 prevalence as cited by experts that I read and16 articles that I read, including Dr. Fombonne.17 That suggests that many or most of the 18 regressive cases in this study were not truly19 regressive. When that happens, when you have this20 incorrect classification of cases, that would obscure21 any real differences between true regressiveness and22 other cases.23 Now, I would note that in the study they 24 base their classification of regressive, as I recall25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 99 of 28899 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888correctly, on parental report. There was no further1 follow-up as was done in some of the DOJ2 investigations is my understanding, so then it's not3 surprising that they would end up with quite a few4 more autistics classified as regressive than you would5 see in a more careful study.6 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 39. 7 A Then there's the logical issue. This may be 8 the most subtle point, but also perhaps the most9 important. Even if regressive cases exhibited the10 same head growth and abnormalities as the other types,11 would it actually count against the possibility that12 TCV can cause regression? The answer is no.13 The abnormality may mark a susceptibility to 14 autism, a susceptibility that had been triggered early15 in most cases and later in regressive cases, so as16 with the PKU example it's possible to have a17 retardation trigger earlier or later. Somebody with18 PKU, with that genetic deficiency, if they start19 consuming phenylalanine they'll develop brain problems20 and retardation at any number of ages depending on21 when that exposure occurs.22 Q And the next slide, Slide 40? 23 A Now, the reason why I emphasize this logical 24 problem is because it applies very broadly to the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 100 of 288100 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888cited literature. Considering again that paragraph of1 Dr. Fombonne's report, he states:2 An evaluation of 163 autistic children with 3 regression showed that 72 percent were not developing4 normally before the regression, and he cites a study5 by Richler, et al. This is where the 72 percent I6 used in the earlier calculation came from.7 He goes on to state: Thus, abnormal 8 development can be documented in children with9 regressive autism before the regression occurs, even10 though the parents are unaware of it.11 Q Okay. Go to the next slide, 41. 12 A Well, first that second sentence, the 13 concluding sentence, ignores that the cited study14 could not document abnormalities in the other 2815 percent of 163 regressive cases. Thus, it only serves16 to document that clearly regressive cases appear to17 occur. It actually documents too that if we take it18 at face value that there are a minority of regressive19 cases who are a minority of all autistic cases.20 The study, the 28 percent, it does not even 21 argue against TCVs causing regression in other cases22 since children showing abnormalities could include a23 population vulnerable to TCV effects. It's simply not24 bearing on the issue here.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 101 of 288101 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Let's go to the next slide, 42. You're 1 talking now about another study that Dr. Fombonne2 cites.3 A Another study that Dr. Fombonne cites later 4 by Nelson, in paragraph 61 he cites it, and he's5 talking about assertive biomarkers of prenatal6 anomalies.7 Dr. Fombonne states: In 99 percent of 8 children with autism, levels of at least one of these9 substances, referring to these biomarkers, which are10 not overt clinical signs or symptoms. They're11 something that has to be measured through a test. At12 least one of these substances exceeded those of all13 controlled children among the autistics.14 Although the results were not specific to 15 autism, they point unequivocally toward prenatal16 anomalies in children with autism or intellectual17 impairment.18 Q Okay. Go to the next slide, 43. 19 A Even if this assertion were accepted at face 20 value it would not in any way detract from the21 possibility or even the plausibility that TCVs can22 cause clearly regressive autism.23 Such effects could arise precisely because 24 certain subclinical anomalies are present, leaving the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 102 of 288102 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888child vulnerable to TCV effect. They could even be1 clinical anomalies, but I just inserted subclinical2 there because that's what they were discussing were3 biomarkers.4 Q So they could just be biomarkers of 5 susceptibility?6 A That's correct. They could be. 7 Q As opposed to biomarkers of developed 8 autism?9 A That's right. 10 Q Okay. Slide 44. 11 A But then when I looked more closely at the 12 Nelson article it examined only 69 cases of autism13 spectrum disorder. That's the broad category. So any14 failure to find biomarker differences among autism15 subtypes could be a simple consequence of insufficient16 numbers of subtypes.17 Again, there were no confidence intervals 18 given and no way to evaluate how much uncertainty19 would be left by these small numbers, but they must be20 very small. There can't be many clearly regressive21 autistics in a series of 69 cases of autism spectrum22 disorder. There would just be a few.23 Now, the last example I want to give and the 24 most problematic for me is that other data cited by25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 103 of 288103 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Dr. Fombonne do not show what he asserts they show. 1 Again, I'm not saying he's distorting the literature. 2 I think he simply made the mistake of not looking at3 what I'm about to go over.4 Q Okay. Slide 45? 5 A He says in paragraph 41, and in 121(e) he 6 also cites this study: Testable predictions could be7 made if TCVs were hypothesized to be such an8 environmental trigger.9 First, the parents of children with 10 regressive autism born in the 1990s were exposed to11 much smaller doses of thimerosal and vaccines than12 were their children. Thus, if the above postulate13 were true, referring to the hypothesis that the TCVs14 are an environmental trigger, if that postulate were15 true we would expect to see a lower rate of autism in16 these older individuals than in relatives of17 nonregressive autistic children.18 But that is not the case, so he asserts that 19 there is the same rate of autism in these older20 individuals as in relatives of nonregressive autistic21 children, and he cites a study which is extensively22 cited elsewhere by Lainhart, et al. in 2002.23 Q Okay. And the next slide, 36? Go ahead. 24 A I went and examined that study carefully 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 104 of 288104 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888since it seems to be pivotal to his argument. It1 turned out that it compared only 18 parents of cases2 labeled as regressive to 70 parents of cases labeled3 as nonregressive.4 Now, based on the figures that he was giving 5 I would expect, first of all, that among the cases of6 these 18 parents labeled as parents of regressive7 there would only again be perhaps what, four or five8 that would be parents of clearly regressive cases, so9 these are very small numbers. Also, they compared10 rates of broader autism phenotype, not autism, as Dr.11 Fombonne states.12 Furthermore, five of the 18 parents of the 13 regressive and 23 of the 70 parents of the14 nonregressive had autism phenotype according to this15 study. Thus, the parents of regressive cases did in16 fact exhibit a slightly lower rate than parents of17 nonregressive cases.18 Q Is that the opposite of what he said? 19 A Well, it's not the opposite. The opposite 20 would be if they had more, but he said there was no21 difference, and in fact it was slightly lower going in22 the direction of what he was saying it wasn't doing.23 Q Okay. All right. Next slide? 24 A Well, I don't want to capitalize on that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 105 of 288105 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888oversight because the Lainhart data are too scanty to1 draw any reliable conclusion.2 From there what they published, their 3 numbers, I was able to calculate a 95 percent4 confidence limit for the difference using methods that5 are in many textbooks, including our own. The limits6 that I got were very broad, minus 30 percent to about7 plus 20 percent.8 Regardless, there are other ways of 9 calculating these limits and they could come out10 differently, but not so much different that it would11 change this conclusion. The data are quite compatible12 with the possibility that parents of regressive cases13 had much lower rates of autism phenotype than parents14 of other autistics, so the actual data do not show15 what Dr. Fombonne cited them as showing, which is no16 difference.17 Q Okay. Slide 48. Now you're going to give 18 some responses to Dr. Goodman's report, another of the19 defense epidemiology experts.20 A Correct. Now, this report was very 21 problematic for me because I think that it was very22 distorted. Unlike Dr. Fombonne's report, it was23 saying many things which I would question whether Dr.24 Goodman could get up and defend in a scientific25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 106 of 288106 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888meeting before an audience of his peers, including1 myself among them.2 It presents absence of evidence as if it 3 were evidence of absence. It exaggerates the4 information content of the available evidence, and it5 insinuates that any view departing from his own6 preferred conclusion are unscientific. This should be7 his own preferred conclusion.8 He makes these arguments based on specious 9 analogies with astrology and unsupported claims about10 mechanisms, claims that have no supporting evidence at11 all.12 Q You go into some more detail in the next 13 slides on this points, right?14 A Yes. 15 Q Slide 49. Let's go to 49. There we go. 16 A Here's an example of the kind of exaggerated 17 claims made in his report. He says: The totality of18 current epidemiologic evidence strongly supports the19 conclusion that thimerosal-containing vaccines are not20 related to the development of autistic disorder.21 Q Okay. Next slide? 22 A Let's look at that. Nowhere in his report 23 does he define what it means for epidemiologic24 evidence to strongly support a conclusion of no25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 107 of 288107 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888effect.1 There's a good reason that he doesn't. 2 There's no agreement among scientists about what kind3 of evidence is required for strong support or what4 strong support means, especially for a null hypothesis5 and a null association of the sort we're debating here6 and especially in epidemiology.7 I hold that epidemiologic evidence can only 8 rarely inarguably, strongly provide strong support --9 again, there are words dropped here -- to claims of no10 effect, and the TCV/autism controversy is not one of11 those rare instances. I've stated that before, and12 I'll state it again in counter to what he's claiming.13 Q All right. Let's go to the next slide, 51. 14 A Nowhere does Professor Goodman account for 15 the potential problems of the studies he cites. He16 does a lot of hand waving citing Bradford Hill and17 saying how these studies couldn't have major problems,18 but he doesn't even discuss the major problem of these19 studies in trying to make an inference about the cases20 that we're discussing.21 Instead, he presents results of the studies 22 in a table and argues that their statistics should be23 taken at face value and combined. He presents no24 estimate of the uncertainty that would be warranted if25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 108 of 288108 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888methodologic issues such as the difference in dose1 levels between the different countries in which these2 studies were conducted, if those were allowed for.3 Q He doesn't even talk about dose differences? 4 A I didn't see where he made any accounting 5 for it. He made mention in passing.6 Q Okay. Slide 52? 7 A He presents no further analysis to show that 8 these studies rule out subtype effects. None of the9 data he presents concerns subtypes, so he doesn't even10 go through the kind of calculations that I was11 discussing earlier.12 Instead, he claims that the combination of 13 studies which show high precision, as does Dr.14 Fombonne in his paragraph 121(f), both fail to15 recognize that the dose differences among the studies16 would lead to wider confidence limits than they17 expect, wide enough to allow for an overall risk ratio18 of six percent, which I want to remind us that that's19 the upper bound that Fombonne put on the increase from20 clearly regressive cases if there was a doubling of21 risk of those.22 Q Okay. The next slide is more about Dr. 23 Goodman's report. 24 A He further argues that the regressive 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 109 of 288109 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888subtype is scientifically unfounded, a scientifically1 unfounded category akin to astrologic sign, in flat2 contradiction to numerous experts and studies,3 including Dr. Fombonne at paragraph 83 where he4 recognizes that subtype and the Richler study which5 provides evidence that it's real.6 They recognize the subtype as a legitimate 7 clinical entity by virtue of having cases that have no8 earlier symptoms that they could detect. I think his9 arguments here are nothing more than rhetorical10 nonsense.11 Q Slide 54 shows some of those. 12 A Astrologic sign has no resemblance to TCV. 13 TCV involves direct injection into the body. In14 contrast, astrologic sign refers to stars light years15 away.16 The fact that TCV is injected, that fact has 17 fueled concerns about its impact whereas it's the18 enormous distance of the stars and the planets that19 make astrology seem so outlandish. If astrology was20 replaced by something talking about an exposure in the21 house like fumes emitted from carpets it wouldn't be22 an outlandish topic.23 He cites this Peto study that's famous, but 24 that study isn't about what's going on here. It25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 110 of 288110 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888concerns artifacts arising from analysis of multiple1 subgroups, many subgroups in clinical trials. Here2 are 12 astrologic signs, and we know that by chance3 when you examine a lot of subgroups you're bound to4 find some things that are statistically significant,5 even if there's nothing going on.6 But the point at issue for me today and here 7 and in the literature that I have been citing is about8 a single subgroup within a subgroup that's been talked9 about at length in the literature, regressive autism,10 and then that smaller subset which hasn't been talked11 about in as much length, but appears to exist from the12 Richler study and even seems to be conceded by Dr.13 Fombonne.14 Q Okay. And by the small group, the small 15 subgroup within the small group, you're talking about16 the truly regressive autism?17 A Yes. 18 Q Yes. Okay. All right. Let's go to the 19 next slide, Slide 55.20 A So to go on about how ridiculous it is and 21 to call into question his credibility here, and I mean22 to intentionally. There's not even a speculative23 mechanism as to how the stars or planets could24 influence individual health.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 111 of 288111 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Whereas mechanisms have been proposed 1 whereby which thimerosal could affect regressive2 autism. For example, in Kinsbourne's report on3 general causation. Now, I am not saying that those4 mechanisms are real. I am not saying that they are5 generally accepted. I am not saying anything of that6 sort. I'm simply pointing out that people who have7 worked in this area have presented these mechanisms.8 They have been criticized. I'm well aware 9 of that. I am not an expert in that area. I'm not10 here to comment on that. It's simply the fact that11 there is nothing approaching that regarding astrology,12 and that analogy he's drawing as far as I'm concerned13 is something that would belong in a bad political14 campaign, not in science.15 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 56. 16 A Then he goes on and invokes fictional -- 17 they're completely fictional scientific principles18 claiming that arguments are scientific only if that19 patient is distinguishable from a larger subgroup on20 the basis of a recognized causal or mechanistic21 factor.22 This distinction based on disease phenotype, 23 e.g. regressive autism, are only meaningful if that24 phenotype is shown to be associated with a different25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 112 of 288112 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888causal pathway or has a fundamentally different1 biology than other phenotypes.2 Q Okay. 3 A That's on page 9 of Professor Goodman's 4 report.5 Q And you say that what he's arguing there is 6 not scientific at all?7 A Not at all. 8 Q Slide 57? Go on. 9 A All he's asserting here is that in the 10 absence of evidence we should dismiss anything that11 fails to conform to this prejudice regarding12 mechanisms.13 In particular, he's claiming that we should 14 assume the same mechanism is operative among distinct15 disease types whenever we don't know the mechanisms16 that cause a disease. If you go back to the previous17 slide to take his quote directly if you can --18 Q Let's go back. 19 A I'd like to make this point. 20 Q Let's go back to Slide 56. 21 A He says: Distinctions based on disease 22 phenotype are only meaningful if that phenotype is23 shown associated with a different causal pathway.24 He's stating as a general principle. Where 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 113 of 288113 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888was this principle when people started to distinguish1 leukemia subtypes? Dr. Goodman is an oncologist,2 among other things, so he should well know that people3 were distinguishing subtypes of leukemia based on4 observable differences before anybody had any good5 idea on the sources and causes of leukemia.6 Even today, all the causes of leukemia are 7 not well mapped out. Most of the cases do not have an8 identified risk factor, even though there are some9 causes that are known like intense ionizing radiation.10 People throughout medicine distinguish phenotype and11 even recognize that the mechanisms could be different,12 in fact may well be different, based strictly on13 observed differences, different types.14 Gradually, as medical science progresses, 15 for example, people started to recognize that there16 were different subtypes of lung cancer. That was17 before people finally realized that there was one18 particular subtype that was dramatically increased by19 smoking where you're talking about a relative risk of20 10 or 20. It wasn't even an accepted association21 until the 1960s or 1950s at the earliest. Doctors22 were still promoting cigarettes as health aids clear23 up to 1950.24 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide. I guess 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 114 of 288114 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-488858 is what we want to go to now.1 A Well, actually we didn't -- 2 Q What slide would you like? 3 A Well, we'll go on to the next one. 4 Q Okay. Slide 58. 5 A So to see why Dr. Goodman's claim has no 6 scientific substance, it's important to understand7 that the causes of autism in general, let alone the8 regressive type, are not understood in any way that9 has been demonstrated empirically, nor are the10 mechanisms.11 As a profound demonstration of the ignorance 12 of autism experts, these experts have failed to13 conclusively identify the causes of the rise in14 reported autism incidence and have failed to predict15 its continuing course.16 Now, I'm not saying that the rise in autism 17 incidence is real or part of a diagnostic issue. Dr.18 Fombonne seems to be convinced that it's largely19 diagnostic. It may well be, but at this point there20 seems to be disagreement remaining in the literature21 regardless of what people say about TCVs about what22 are all the factors responsible for this increasing23 report of incidence of autism. Nobody has been able24 to predict how its course is going to go successfully.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 115 of 288115 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 59. 1 A Dr. Goodman claims that absent any evidence 2 one way or another we should simply assume that early3 autism and regressive autism are caused by identical4 mechanisms. This is the strong assertion in need of5 proof.6 He has basically shifted the burden of proof 7 away from a strong assertion that they are the same8 mechanism and towards an admission that perhaps9 they're not the same mechanism or perhaps there are10 some mechanisms they share and others that they don't.11 Dr. Goodman offered no evidence that the 12 mechanisms behind the two types are identical because13 there is no such evidence. This argument is just14 coming from his authority. It's not scientific. I15 don't take that because I'm Dr. Greenland. I'm Dr.16 Greenland. You should take my word for it. You17 should look at the evidence. He doesn't give any. As18 far as I can see, there isn't any.19 Q Okay. Let's go on to the next slide. 20 A So as I said, he attempts to shift the 21 burden of proof to those who would allow -- simply22 allow -- that different disease types could involve23 mechanistic differences. I think his claims are24 nonsense in both scientific and every day terms.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 116 of 288116 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888It is open minded and hence scientific to 1 allow for the full range of possibilities, including2 differences in effects, in the face of such extensive3 ignorance about the mechanisms of autism development. 4 It's unscientific to assert that there is no5 difference in mechanism when there is no understanding6 of mechanism or very little.7 Q All right. I think that summarizes your 8 testimony. We have a couple slides again just to make9 your main points again. If you would reiterate those,10 please?11 A So again the epidemiologic literature has 12 not ruled out the possibility that thimerosal-13 containing vaccines are associated with a prespecified14 type of autism of the regressive form, and that's been15 my point.16 Not to say that there is such an 17 association, but simply that the evidence that I am a18 qualified expert to discuss doesn't rule out that19 possibility.20 Q Okay. 21 A And specifically upon which controlled 22 studies have not analyzed clearly regressive autism. 23 Clearly regressive autism is very uncommon, so there24 are very small numbers of cases in the studies to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 117 of 288117 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888date.1 Hence, even if the studies have separated 2 the clearly regressive cases or even if we got their3 data and could separate them out, a true association4 could easily be missed -- could have been missed and5 could easily be missed -- because the numbers aren't6 there at this point.7 MR. WILLIAMS: Okay. Thank you very much. 8 That's all the questions I have.9 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. Let me 10 ask. It is now 12:30. Do you want to go ahead and11 start with your cross-examination of Dr. Greenland?12 MR. MATANOSKI: No. We'd rather break for 13 lunch if we may.14 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Okay. Had you 15 talked with the Petitioners about the issue of the16 break for lunch?17 MR. MATANOSKI: Yes. Yes, we did, and we 18 both acknowledge that we could shorten it a bit. We19 thought maybe 45 minutes.20 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Forty-five 21 minutes?22 MR. POWERS: Forty-five minutes, which puts 23 it about 1:15.24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: 1:15. All right. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 118 of 288118 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888MR. MATANOSKI: If I may? 1 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Go ahead. 2 MR. MATANOSKI: Could I ask for a copy of 3 the 62 pages of slides --4 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Yes. I wanted to 5 discuss that.6 MR. MATANOSKI: -- for the lunch break so 7 that we could take a look at those?8 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Right. Just for 9 those folks who are at home, we are going to take a 4510 minute lunch break and start again at 1:15. We're off11 the record at this time.12 (Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the hearing in 13 the above-entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene14 at 1:15 p.m. this same day, Page 119 of 288119 GREENLAND - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888//1 //2 //3 //4Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 120 of 288120 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N 1 (1:20 p.m.) 2 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Good afternoon, 3 folks. Please be seated.4 For those of you who are at home, we are 5 about to begin the afternoon portion of the6 proceedings today. We have Dr. Greenland back in the7 witness chair, and the Respondent was going to begin8 cross-examination of Dr. Greenland.9 Go ahead when you're ready. 10 MS. RICCIARDELLA: Thank you 11 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: It will be Ms. 12 Ricciardella here.13 Whereupon, 14 SANDER GREENLAND 15 having been previously duly sworn, was 16 recalled as a witness herein and was examined and17 testified further as follows:18 CROSS-EXAMINATION 19 BY MS. RICCIARDELLA: 20 Q Good afternoon, Dr. Greenland. 21 A Good afternoon. 22 Q Now, your expert report in this litigation 23 is written very carefully. You were very precise in24 the way in which you stated your position, and I want25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 121 of 288121 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888to be clear for myself and for the Court what you were1 saying and what you weren't saying in your report.2 Now, my understanding of what you're saying 3 is that even though the body of epidemiologic4 literature has found no association between5 thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum6 disorders, it's still theoretically possible that such7 an association exists with a small subgroup, namely8 those who develop regressive autism, correct?9 A I would change one word order there, and 10 that's --11 Q Go ahead. 12 A -- the epidemiologic data has not found an 13 association, but the rest I would say yes.14 Q But it's theoretically possible that it 15 still exists in a small subgroup, regressive autism? 16 What I'm actually understanding you to say today is17 clearly regressive autism. Is that correct?18 A Correct. 19 Q And you did a variety of calculations in 20 your report to show theoretically how high that risk21 could be, correct?22 A Correct. 23 Q Now, you did state in your report on page 16 24 that the brief overview given above, meaning of the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 122 of 288122 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888epidemiologic studies that had been done to date,1 supports the idea that the association of you say MCV. 2 I say TCV. When you say TCV you know what I'm talking3 about?4 A Yes. 5 Q It's a mouthful to say thimerosal-containing 6 vaccines, so I'll use the acronym. The association of7 TCV with autism is small or nonexistent. Do you8 recall writing that in your report?9 A Yes. 10 Q Do you still agree with that? 11 A Yes. 12 Q Now, there have been a few studies that have 13 purported to find an association between thimerosal-14 containing vaccines and autism, and you refer to those15 in your report as ostensibly positive studies. I'm16 referring to those done by Dr. Mark Geier and his son,17 David.18 A Yes. 19 Q Have you reviewed those studies? 20 A I have read them. 21 Q Okay. And you noted though that those 22 studies have been criticized by other reviewers,23 correct?24 A Correct. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 123 of 288123 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Have you formed your own assessment of those 1 studies?2 A I concurred with the reviewers. This is why 3 I did not include them in my review.4 Q You found those studies to be not credible? 5 A I would put it as deficient in methodology 6 such that I would not count them as evidence if others7 were willing to go along with that.8 Q Now, Doctor, if there was indeed an 9 increasing incidence in the overall number of autism10 cases that some have termed an autism epidemic and if11 it was shown that thimerosal-containing vaccines were12 the reason for that increasing incidence, would that13 increase likely be picked up by the epidemiologic14 studies?15 A If it was restricted to a subgroup then it 16 wouldn't have.17 Q No. I'm not talking about subgroups. I'm 18 just talking about there's been a purported autism19 epidemic. If there's really indeed an increasing20 incidence in the number of autism cases that some have21 termed an autism epidemic, would that be detected22 epidemiologically?23 A I think I'm not understanding your question. 24 Please restate it.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 124 of 288124 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q If there was an increasing incidence in 1 autism, if the number of cases of autism were2 increasing tenfold, for instance, and if that increase3 were due to thimerosal-containing vaccines, would that4 be picked up by epidemiologic studies?5 A Yes, a tenfold increase certainly would be. 6 Q And would you agree that the body of 7 epidemiological literature has not supported the8 hypothesis of an autism epidemic?9 A My understanding is that there is an 10 increasing diagnosis of autism. The cause of that,11 whether it's diagnostic changes or actual changes in12 the occurrence of the disease, seems to be a matter of13 convention from my understanding.14 Q I'm asking hypothetically. If indeed it was 15 shown that there is an autism epidemic, would you16 agree that the epidemiological literature does not17 support the hypothesis that an epidemic is caused by18 thimerosal-containing vaccines?19 A I would agree. 20 Q I want to be clear about your opinion in 21 this case or in this litigation. Is your opinion22 predicated on the assumption that children with23 clearly regressive autism have an elevated risk due to24 thimerosal, and children with nonregressive autism25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 125 of 288125 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888have little to no elevated risk due to thimerosal?1 A Which portion of my opinion? Some parts 2 make the assumption for the calculations that I made3 that the risk was only increased by thimerosal for4 those with clearly regressive, but other parts of my5 argument didn't refer to that assumption.6 Q In the slide presentation that you presented 7 during your direct testimony, some slides referred to8 regressive autism as being the subgroup under9 consideration, and some slides referred to clearly10 regressive autism.11 Which one are you saying is purportedly 12 associated or that the epi studies have been unable to13 detect?14 A Well, the general argument is that if there 15 is a subgroup that is as uncommon as, for example,16 clearly regressive autism would appear to be then 17 whatever that subgroup may be the epidemiologic18 studies could not have picked up an increase in risk19 in that group if it had been confined to that group,20 even if it was a large increase.21 Q So if the risk is confined to that group the 22 clearly regressive autism, are you assuming then that23 there is no elevated risk to any other group, any24 other cases of autism?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 126 of 288126 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A In the calculations I made, yes. 1 Q Now, Doctor, you don't claim in your report 2 and I don't understand you to be claiming here today3 that you have any expertise in autism, do you?4 A I am not claiming that. 5 Q And you are not claiming in your report or 6 here today that you have any expertise in regressive7 autism in particular, correct?8 A I am not claiming that. 9 Q How do you define regressive autism? 10 A Simply by whatever definition is being used 11 in a report. I go along with it, not being an expert12 in the --13 Q What report? 14 A It depends on which study we're talking 15 about. For example, one of the reports -- I forget16 the primary author -- described regressive autistic17 cases among their case series. Well, several did.18 For the purpose of analyzing that report, I 19 would then simply accept whatever the authors were20 using, as well as Dr. Fombonne when he would discuss21 the matter as well.22 Q Now, on page 1 of your report you call 23 regressive autism a prespecified type of autism. Why24 did you use the term prespecified?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 127 of 288127 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That was with respect to the idea that it 1 might have been defined after the fact solely based on2 exposure to thimerosal.3 Q After what fact? 4 A After the introduction rather of the 5 hypothesis that TCVs cause autism.6 Q Who told you about that hypothesis? 7 A I don't remember when I first read of it. I 8 remember seeing things in the news long ago, but I9 don't recollect exactly.10 Q And who told you that? Where did you hear 11 that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause regressive12 autism only?13 A I don't recall where I first saw that. 14 Q Now, Doctor, did you present in your report 15 any evidence that regressive autism is a form of16 autism that is biologically distinct from any other17 cases of autism?18 A I did not. 19 Q And can you present any evidence that would 20 lead you to distinguish regressive autism biologically21 from nonregressive cases of autism?22 A I would have to rely entirely on other 23 experts.24 Q And you didn't present in your report any 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 128 of 288128 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888evidence that the causal risk factors for regressive1 autism are different than the risk factors for other2 cases of autism, correct?3 A That's correct. 4 Q Can you tell us what the risk factors for 5 autism are in general?6 A I know that there is supposed to be some 7 syndromes, genetic syndromes that are associated with8 it, but that most of the cases, from what I'm read,9 are supposed to be sporadic, of unknown origin.10 Q And can you offer evidence that shows that 11 thimerosal is a risk factor for autism, regressive12 autism, but not for other cases of autism?13 A I cannot. 14 Q Are you aware of any published literature 15 stating that regressive autism is caused by16 thimerosal-containing vaccines?17 A Could you repeat that, please? 18 Q Certainly. Are you aware of any published 19 literature that states that regressive autism is20 caused by thimerosal-containing vaccines?21 A Well, I'm aware of published literature that 22 states that.23 Q Where? Which literature? 24 A Well, it appears to me that the Geiers, for 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 129 of 288129 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888example, make this type of claim, so if you say just1 published literature --2 Q Besides the Geiers, are you aware of any 3 other literature that makes that claim?4 A Well, I've certainly read other items, 5 writings -- not necessarily peer reviewed or6 scientific -- that made these claims.7 Q But you can't recall today what those are? 8 A No. 9 Q Are you aware of any study that has 10 suggested the hypothesis?11 A No. Excuse me. No. Let me correct that. 12 I'm certainly aware of the Geier study and so forth.13 Q The Geiers' epidemiological studies that you 14 agreed had methodological problems?15 A That's correct. 16 Q Doctor, if I understand your opinion in this 17 litigation, you're not stating an opinion as to the18 likelihood that such a regressive subgroup exists19 that's uniquely susceptible to thimerosal-containing20 vaccines, are you?21 A That's correct. I'm not. 22 Q And you're not claiming here that it's been 23 scientifically shown that the subgroup exists, are24 you?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 130 of 288130 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A That's correct. 1 Q So your opinion is not that the subgroup 2 actually exists. You're saying that it's theoretical3 possible that it exists, correct?4 A Well, no. There is some evidence and 5 support in, for example, the study cited by Fombonne,6 by Richler, which apparently looked for background7 factors in the regressive autistic cases.8 Q Did they talk about thimerosal? 9 A No. 10 Q I'm talking about the subgroup of regressive 11 autism that's uniquely susceptible or I should say12 clearly regressive autism because that's what you're13 focusing on today.14 A Yes. 15 Q The subgroup of clearly regressive autism 16 that's uniquely susceptible to thimerosal-containing17 vaccines. You're not saying that it actually exists?18 A I misunderstood your compound. 19 Q No problem. 20 A What I was stating there was that it appears 21 from the literature there is a clearly regressive22 subgroup, and on the other hand I am not aware of any23 literature that supports the idea that there is a24 clearly regressive subgroup specially susceptible to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 131 of 288131 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888thimerosal, but my comment was simply that that hasn't1 been investigated so there isn't evidence bearing on2 it.3 Q Okay. But you're saying that if such a 4 subgroup does exist it's rare enough that it has gone5 undetected by the epidemiologic studies, correct?6 A That's the way it looks to me. 7 Q Doctor, theoretical possibilities though are 8 applicable to any study, aren't they?9 A Certainly. 10 Q I mean, we could refute known associations 11 or lack of associations just based on hypothetical12 subgrouping of the study subjects, can't we?13 A Well, perhaps I could give an example since 14 I'm not 100 percent clear on what you're asking, but15 to take an example that would I think make it obvious16 with smoking and lung cancer.17 This is an association which is enormous, 18 and people noticed associations of smoking with lung19 disease as far back as the 1600s when tobacco began20 spreading in Europe, but it took all the way into the21 1960s before the Surgeon General went so far as to22 recognize it as a health hazard and published a report23 on that.24 Nonetheless, to this date we also know and I 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 132 of 288132 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888think fewer people realize that most smokers don't get1 lung cancer, and we don't know why. We don't know2 what it is about particular individuals in every3 detail, in every case at least, that leads to them4 getting lung cancer when they do smoke.5 So even though it's something that is very 6 well known, there is still to this day and after a7 half century of intensive research much unknown, which8 would be an issue, for example, if this was one of the9 cases in which people were suing tobacco companies10 because of their disease. In fact, it's arisen.11 So there always remains even in a case as 12 extreme as that where there's centuries of observation13 and a half century of intense scientific research and14 well-recognized causation. Even in a case like that,15 to this day there are points of contention. That's16 how science is in reality. It's supposed to affirm17 for all time 100 percent knowledge with medical18 science.19 Q Right. I think you're saying what I was 20 suggesting. To take your example of smoking and lung21 cancer, I could say yes, studies have shown an22 association between smoking and lung cancer, but I can23 say to you well, Doctor, how do you know nobody has24 ever looked at whether smoking causes lung cancer in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 133 of 288133 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888tall men with brown hair.1 Or I could define the subgroup to say no one 2 has ever looked at the association between smoking and3 tall men not just with brown hair, but with dark brown4 hair. You could take it on and on, correct?5 A Well, what I would expect more to hear, and 6 in fact this is something that people talk about, is7 what is it about the vast majority of smokers who8 smoke heavily through their life and don't get lung9 cancer?10 The search is there for the genes that would 11 identify those who do and those who don't get lung12 cancer, so indeed there's a focusing on subtypes, but13 not brown hair. I haven't heard that used as a risk14 factor of autism.15 Q Well, because it's a ridiculous example, and 16 it's ridiculous because I haven't offered you any17 explanation as to why tall men with brown hair are18 somehow different than the populations that have been19 studied, correct?20 A Correct, but there are factors where there 21 are theoretical explanations, and people continue to22 pursue these issues.23 Q Now, Doctor, I understand your opinion is 24 that the epidemiologic studies don't disprove the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 134 of 288134 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888hypothesis that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause1 clearly regressive autism, correct?2 A Correct. 3 Q But you're not saying, are you, in this 4 litigation that the studies proved the hypothesis5 either, are you?6 A Correct. Definitely not. 7 Q And in your report you don't actually state 8 the likelihood of an association between thimerosal-9 containing vaccines and clearly regressive autism, do10 you?11 A No. 12 Q Doctor, is there any evidence that clearly 13 regressive autism is more likely than not caused by14 thimerosal-containing vaccines?15 A I'd say all the evidence that I've seen 16 discussed has some bearing on it, so --17 Q I didn't ask about bearing. I asked is 18 there any evidence that it's more likely than not that19 thimerosal-containing vaccines cause clearly20 regressive autism?21 A You said any evidence. My specialty is 22 epidemiologic evidence, so if you would narrow it to23 that?24 Q Well, how about epidemiologic evidence? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 135 of 288135 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Epidemiologic evidence? Then I would agree 1 with your statement.2 Q Doctor, as a member of the scientific 3 community do you believe that clearly regressive4 autism is caused by thimerosal-containing vaccines?5 A I don't have any belief one way or the 6 other.7 Q Do you have any belief one way or the other 8 that autism is caused by thimerosal-containing9 vaccines?10 A I do. 11 Q Okay. What's your belief? 12 A Well, let me -- 13 Q I'm talking about autism in general. 14 A Autism in general. That if there is an 15 effect, I would bet that if there is an effect it must16 be concentrated if there is. Notice the hypothetical,17 please. It must be concentrated in a very small group18 to have gone undetected to this point in time.19 Q But you can offer no evidence that such a 20 group exists, correct?21 A That's correct. 22 MS. RICCIARDELLA: Thank you. I have no 23 further questions.24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Any redirect? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 136 of 288136 GREENLAND - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888MR.

I had an academic position at 6 Vanderbilt University, and I resigned that tenure7 track position to have the opportunity to work with a8 man who a year later got the Nobel Prize -- it was9 very valuable to me -- to learn biochemical genetics,10 enzymology and basic biochemistry from Arthur11 Kornberg, one of our best biochemists.12 Q Now turning to Slide 4, have you published a 13 number of articles in the peer reviewed literature?14 A Yes. I don't keep track. I would say over 15 200, but in my CV I don't put numbers. I've also been16 the associate editor of a number of journals and have17 peer reviewed many, many papers for various journals.18 Q And is your work still cited frequently in 19 textbooks and other scientific literature?20 A Yes, and we were very pleased to hear from 21 the editor of Chemical Research and Toxicology , which 22 is sponsored by the American Chemical Society, that in23 the year 2006 the most downloaded article for this24 journal was an article by me and my wife.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 140 of 288140 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And has a lot of your published work dealt 1 with heavy metal toxicology?2 A Yes, almost completely. 3 Q All right. Now, did you prepare an outline 4 of what you're going to talk about today?5 A Yes. Would you like me to go over it? 6 Q I think it would be helpful very quickly, 7 yes.8 A All right. 9 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: That's on Slide 5, 10 is it not?11 MR. WILLIAMS: Yes, Slide 5. There's 12 Introduction. I want to begin with an introduction in13 which I'll define evidence-based toxicology. No. 2,14 Basic comments regarding modern toxicology;15 introductory remarks regarding autism spectrum16 disorders;17 A brief review of mercury toxicology; methyl 18 mercury, thimerosal and ethyl mercury; brain19 concentrations of mercury and autism; and the first hypothesis: One21 cause of autism is cells cannot thimerosal ethyl mercury.23 The second hypothesis: Terbutaline is an 24 example of a teratogen that can cause some types of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 141 of 288141 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888autism via a neuroinflammation mechanism. Under this1 we'll discuss Terbutaline. We were going to discuss2 teratogens. I think we may have taken that out. I'm3 not sure. No. 9, Thimerosal and ethyl mercury. Pink4 disease we took out. We didn't have a chance to5 change that. And then I'll present a summary.6 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 7 Q Okay. Now, on Slide 6 there are a number of 8 definitions of measures. I don't want to take the9 time to go through this now, but we prepared this for10 reference purposes later if we need to come back and11 figure out how to convert one measure of a12 concentration to another. Is that right?13 A Yes. Yes. 14 Q Okay. Let's leave that be for now. We may 15 need to come back to it.16 All right. Slide 7. You prepared this. 17 Would you go ahead and explain why you wanted to --18 A Yes. I wanted to make some comments that I 19 think are relevant.20 First of all, science by definition is a 21 search for the truth. Autistic children are not22 normal. What is or are the abnormality or23 abnormalities at the molecular level of autistic24 children we do not know.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 142 of 288142 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888What do first class scientific investigators 1 do when they don't know? They formulate a hypothesis. 2 That is the purpose of my testimony; to formulate a3 probable hypothesis that thimerosal is involved in4 some manner, either directly or indirectly, either5 prenatally or postnatally in the etiology of autism6 specifically affecting the brain.7 Q Okay. Now, you used the term earlier 8 evidence-based toxicology. What is evidence-based9 toxicology? This is on Slide 8.10 A Most of my testimony and slides are not my 11 expert opinion. I want to make it very clear. What12 I'm presenting are the data, the evidence or comments13 from peer reviewed papers or from symposium that have14 usually been peer reviewed.15 Throughout this testimony, these peer 16 reviewed comments are in dark blue font. My personal17 expert opinion when I do occasionally put it forth is18 in red font. As many slides as possible are labeled19 or include a literature reference, so again it's not20 my opinion on those slides.21 Most of my testimony and slides therefore 22 deal with a relatively new term; that is, evidence-23 based toxicology. I'm presenting you what other24 experts have written in peer reviewed articles.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 143 of 288143 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Now, you also have some comments you want to 1 make about modern toxicology.2 A Yes. May I have the next slide, please? 3 The next slide, please?4 Q This is Slide 10. 5 A Slide 10. Now, let me say at this point 6 that many people don't understand that people in7 science have disagreements, and even though the8 disagreements are based on how they interpret9 something differently there is no disrespect intended10 and so under no circumstances --11 For example, I've known Tom Clarkson for 12 years, and I have a tremendous respect for him. 13 Obviously I have different opinions, as he does, on14 certain factors that will be presented, but I want to15 make it clear that these are differences in16 interpretations, not meant to be personal in any way.17 So let's say does dose determine the poison? 18 We now know in 2008 other factors also determine the19 poison, and now I'm quoting from the classic textbook20 in toxicology from a chapter written by Robert Goyer,21 a toxicologically oriented pathologist, and Tom22 Clarkson, who is one of the Respondent's, and in this23 chapter, which is chapter 23, I've taken Table 3-1 out24 verbatim.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 144 of 288144 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888It points out: Factors influencing toxicity 1 of metals; interactions with essential metals;2 formation of metal protein complexes; age and stage of3 development; lifestyle factors; chemical forms4 aspeciation; immune status of the host. These are5 factors that influence the toxicity of the metal.6 As the next slide will point out, this is a 7 chapter again in the same textbook, a different year I8 think, by Melinsky and Klaassen. Klaassen is one of9 the most eminent toxicologists we have in this10 country. He's probably on more national committees,11 more government advisory committees, than anyone else12 that I know in toxicology.13 I quote now: As we described earlier, the 14 most critical factor influencing toxicity is not15 necessarily the dose, but rather the concentration of16 a xenobiotic at the site of action, a xenobiotic being17 a foreign chemical by definition. Xenobiotics are18 delivered to most organs by the systemic circulation. 19 Therefore, the fraction of a chemical that reaches the20 systemic circulation is of critical importance in21 determining toxicity.22 Several factors can greatly alter the 23 systemic availability, including 1) Limited absorption24 after oral dosing; 2) Intestinal first pass effect; 3)25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 145 of 288145 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Hepatic first pass effect; and 4) Mode of formulation,1 which affects, for example, the dissolution rate, how2 the stuff comes to part or goes into solution, or3 incorporation into the micelles for lipid-soluble4 compounds.5 All substances are poisons. This is a 6 direct quote. There is none which is not a poison. 7 The right dose differentiates poison. That's by8 Paracelsus, who lived between 1493 and 1541.9 Toxicology has progressed since then. It's 10 almost 500 years, all right, so again dose is not the11 only factor that determines the poison and we'll come12 back to this over and over again during this13 presentation.14 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 12, 15 please.16 A This is on the web, the IOM, the Institute 17 of Medicine Forum on Autism -- not on vaccines, but on18 autism -- and the Environment, which was held in April19 2007. This is a quote from Phillip Landrigan, who is20 a professor of pediatrics and also an epidemiologist21 at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, one of the best we22 have:23 Chemicals in the environment can injure the 24 human brain. Children are especially vulnerable to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 146 of 288146 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888brain injury caused by chemicals, and this1 vulnerability is generally greatest during the nine2 months of pregnancy and the earliest years of life. 3 The brain injury caused in children by chemicals is4 sometimes symptomatic, but more often produces a range5 of abnormalities that impair function and that can be6 detected only through special testing.7 The next slide, please? Children are not 8 little adults. We try teaching our students that over9 and over again. Children are not little adults. As10 shown below, it takes a premature neonate on the11 average almost four times longer to get rid of a12 chemical.13 What is plotted here on the left is 14 children's half-time relative to adults, half-time15 being how long it takes to get rid of half of the16 concentration. On the bottom we're plotting the17 various stages. As you can see, especially when you18 look at the first bar graph, that's almost four times19 greater than what would be called normal at the number20 one level.21 Next slide, please? 22 Q Let me just ask you on this one, though. 23 A Yes? 24 Q The third bar over is the bar for children 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 147 of 288147 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888who are one week to two months of age.1 A Yes. 2 Q Is that still statistically significant 3 above an adult's ability?4 A Yes, it is. It is. If you go back to the 5 original paper you'll see it is. That's the third6 one. Yes.7 Q Okay. All right. Now, you have some 8 remarks prepared about autism spectrum disorder, going9 to Slide 15.10 A Yes. Now, if you remember from your college 11 chemistry or college physics, a spectrum consists of12 well-defined bands.13 Next slide, please? And this is the visible 14 spectrum that you see with very definite colors from15 one end to the other.16 The next slide, please? Now, as far as 17 autism spectrum disorders are concerned, there are no18 bands, and most clinicians will admit this; that we19 have Asperger's, the high functioning ASD kids, at one20 end and severe autism, the very barely functioning21 children, at the other end, but in between there is22 not very much.23 This has caused Dr. Spence, who is at the 24 National Institutes of Health, to say we need a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 148 of 288148 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888standardized definition of autism and related1 disorders. This is one of the major problems in2 trying to define these different kinds of autism3 spectrum disorder.4 Next slide, please? 5 Q This is Slide 17. 6 A Autism is a complex disorder. Autism is a 7 multi-system disorder whose outcome is likely to be8 more profoundly impacted by the environment than any9 other disorders and diseases. This is put forth by a10 professor at the University of California-Davis again11 at this superb IOM autism workshop that was held last12 year.13 Three percent of all developmental defects 14 are attributed to exposure to toxic chemicals. 15 Twenty-five percent of all developmental defects may16 be due to a combination of genetic and environmental17 factors.18 Next slide, please? 19 Q Slide 18. 20 A Now, I introduced this slide because I think 21 it says a number of things. This again was presented22 at the Institute of Medicine workshop. Again, it's on23 the web as a recording of that workshop.24 Autism is estimated to cost $3.2 million per 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 149 of 288149 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888child over a lifetime. Using the conservative1 estimate in the United States of 500 children means2 the epidemic will cost society close to $2 trillion. 3 $2 trillion. Many families are on the brink of4 bankruptcy as they struggle to get insurance and the5 medical attention their children need.6 Recently clinical investigations have 7 identified numerous co-morbid disease states in8 children with autism. These include other disorders9 that go along very often with autism:10 Immune system abnormalities; inflammatory metals, including mercury and lead; chronic viral,15 fungal and bacterial infections; and also, as I put in16 and added to this, microglial activation in the brain,17 which we'll also speak about in a few minutes.18 Q Okay Can you tell us what you mean by 19 oxidative stress?20 A Because of a number of physiological 21 challenges or exposures, the body begins to make free22 radicals. These free radicals are very reactive23 chemical substances, and they can damage the structure24 of DNA, they can damage the structure of proteins, and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 150 of 288150 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888they can damage other structures, so it's a very1 critical kind of injury that one likes to prevent, and2 one can prevent that by giving antioxidative stress3 protection.4 Q Are there recommended diets and recommended 5 therapies for people who suffer from oxidative stress?6 A It depends on what you mean by recommended. 7 If you mean are there alternative medicine sources? 8 Are there health food store sources? Yes.9 There are only one or two that established 10 medicine would recommend, but we have natural11 mechanisms in our body that try to overcome these free12 radicals, these oxidative stress phenomena.13 Q All right. Let's go to the next slide, No. 14 19.15 A I think you want 20. Is it 20? 16 Q Slide 20. I have a different numbering 17 system.18 A This is taken from the Journal of Science . 19 I find diagrams and figures much more instructive than20 numbers and tables, all right, and so let me just21 point out to you some of the genetic terms of22 inversion, insertion, deletion and copy number23 variation.24 If you look at the lower right-hand corner 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 151 of 288151 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of this slide you'll see the reference. We have a1 gene A, B, C. That could even be three different2 parts of a gene, or this whole thing could be a3 chromosome. It doesn't matter. We're talking about4 genetic information now.5 Now, what is normal is the reference A, B, 6 C. When an inversion occurs it means C, for example,7 will be put before A rather than after B. This does8 happen. Chromosomes are known to have this happen to9 them, and disease are known to be caused by this.10 An insertion is when some extra genetic 11 information or extra DNA information is inserted, as12 you see with the letter D for dog in the second to the13 right. Below that is deletion, which is quite14 obvious. In this case we've taken B out.15 Then of course copy number variation is 16 again another known cause of a number of disorders,17 and here you see we've put in -- the person who put18 this diagram together or figure together for Science 19 added four copies of C rather than one copy of C.20 Q All right. Let's go to Slide 21. 21 A Again at the IOM forum, Lipkin, a very good 22 scientist from Columbia University: To emphasize that23 our working model for autism is one with three24 dimensions where a genetic susceptibility,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 152 of 288152 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888environmental triggers and temporal contacts act in1 concert to cause disease. It's not just genetics.2 Q And again the blue is not your opinion? 3 A Yes. 4 Q That's the opinion of the scientist 5 presenting at this IOM conference?6 A Exactly. Exactly. 7 Q Okay. Let's turn to mercury toxicology 8 then.9 A A brief review of mercury toxicology. Next? 10 Q Slide 23. 11 A This shows the influence of the mother and 12 other sources for mercury exposure of infants. In the13 mother we have methyl mercury from fish. We also have14 methyl mercury from chicken. Now, some of the15 Respondents did not realize that or forgot what they16 had learned earlier.17 The next slide, which please don't show yet. 18 The next slide will give just one reference to the19 showing that there is methyl mercury in chickens. 20 There is methyl mercury in chickens because this21 country imports chopped up or pulverized fish bones22 and pulverized fish products to feed the fowl.23 I did a study. The Government of Chile 24 asked me to go down and look at some people. One time25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 153 of 288153 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888we did a very large study of arsenic exposure. I saw1 this huge mound by the port, and it was probably the2 height of a 10-story building. I asked my host what3 is that? He said oh, that's chicken feed that we are4 going to send to America.5 I said but what is it made of? He said oh, 6 that's our waste products, stuff we don't want, the7 fish bones and other things that are ground up. This8 is where the methyl mercury in chickens in this9 country come from. There are many papers dealing with10 this. They're not read very often.11 We have mercury from amalgam, from the 12 mother's amalgams. We have thimerosal ethyl mercury13 from vaccines that the mother may have had. These14 forms of mercury all can pass the placenta and get15 into the fetus.16 In addition, a child from the mother will 17 get thimerosal, especially if the child is being18 breast fed. The child will get thimerosal ethyl19 mercury from its own vaccines. They will get methyl20 mercury from breast milk, methyl mercury from fish,21 methyl mercury from chicken, methyl mercury from22 amalgams of the mother and of course the vaccines that23 the child has been given if the child was given24 vaccines containing thimerosal.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 154 of 288154 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Is it fair to say, do you think, that 1 virtually all children born in the United States have2 some exposure to mercury whether they get it in3 vaccines or not?4 A I think that's correct. I think that's 5 absolutely correct.6 Q And that load can vary from region to region 7 and diet to diet?8 A That's correct. When I referee journal 9 articles some new investigators will say this mercury-10 free human or this mercury-free animal, and what we'll11 always say is what is the evidence they're mercury-12 free? No one can really give that evidence. There's13 always some of this in us.14 Q Okay. Then on the next slide you give your 15 reference.16 A This is just one of many references. 17 Q Okay. Slide 25. 18 A Okay. Again, I must apologize for reading 19 this or reading many of these slides because if I were20 giving my expert opinion I could extemporaneously say21 this.22 There's nothing more boring to a student in 23 a university than to hear a professor reading a24 lecture, but I think it's essential that I read it so25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 155 of 288155 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that you know the exact words that the peer reviewed1 expert -- not me -- is saying. If we were in the2 university setting I could throw in some dirty jokes,3 but this is not allowable here, of course, just to4 brighten things up.5 Q Well, in this one you're quoting one of the 6 Respondent's experts, right?7 A Pardon? 8 Q In this one you're quoting one of 9 Respondent's experts?10 A Yes. Yes. Anyway, here we go. This is 11 Clarkson, again a good friend of mine. I've12 entertained him in my home with his wife. Tremendous13 respect for the man. We both get along very well,14 even though he's Respondent's.15 Classification of Mercury Species or Forms. 16 The mercury species are sometimes classified17 chemically as inorganic and organic. The inorganic18 would include by this chemical classification19 elemental mercury, which is Hg0, in the form of a 20 liquid or the vapor; mercuric mercury, Hg+2; and 21 mercurous mercury, Hg+1. 22 Elemental mercury, Hg0, exists in liquid 23 form at room temperature. Vapor from the liquid,24 which we call mercury vapor, is more hazardous than25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 156 of 288156 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the liquid form. The liquid form has very little, if1 any, toxicity if it gets into the stomach, for2 example, but the vapor is different.3 The toxicological classification of mercury 4 compounds used by many toxicologists is based on their5 toxicological properties, and here we break them down6 into elemental, inorganic and organic. In this7 classification, although elemental mercury is8 inorganic, it is put into a separate category because9 of the many different toxicological properties.10 Q If you swallow liquid mercury it basically 11 passes through without being absorbed, true?12 A Essentially. There are many cases in the 13 literature, interesting cases. They used to put14 mercury, liquid mercury, into tubes when they wanted15 to block the exit from the stomach. They would put16 the mercury in there to give it some weight. It would17 go down, and it would block anything from going out of18 the stomach.19 There are a number of cases when the balloon 20 broke and they had mercury there and it stayed there21 for quite some time or stayed in the intestines. 22 There were absolutely no toxicological effects. Many,23 many papers in the literature deal with this.24 Q Whereas as you say, if you inhale elemental 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 157 of 288157 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mercury vapor then you can have toxicological effects?1 A Yes. If you inhale elemental mercury the 2 vapor is very quickly taken up in the lungs. It3 passes quickly into the blood, is transported very4 rapidly to the blood-brain barrier.5 Since it's lipid soluble it needs no special 6 mechanism. It just diffuses across the blood-brain7 barrier and gets into the brain where it's converted8 to mercuric mercury very quickly.9 Q Okay. I guess we've covered everything on 10 that slide.11 A I think so. 12 Q Let's go on to Slide 26. 13 A Exposure at toxic levels to inorganic 14 mercury usually occurs in an occupational setting and15 is not a danger to the general public. This is still16 the statement of the experts. Now comes my statement17 in red. This statement deals with external exposure,18 not endogenous inorganic mercury production in the19 body.20 It's different if the mercury production is 21 in the brain. If the mercury from methyl mercury is22 demethylated it gives mercuric mercury, and then it23 becomes a real problem. The organic species of24 mercury would include methyl mercury, thimerosal,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 158 of 288158 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888ethyl mercury and some phenylmercury compounds, all of1 which we know quite a bit about.2 Exposure. The major source of mercury vapor 3 in the atmosphere is a natural degassing of the4 earth's crust. The atmospheric mercury is distributed5 globally and eventually is converted to a water6 soluble form and returned to the earth's surface by7 rain.8 Methyl mercury in fish is found in a water- 9 soluble, protein-bound form. Inorganic mercury is10 also found in food. The sources are known, and it11 does not amount to very much.12 Next slide, please? 13 Q Slide 27. 14 A Mercury vapor emitted from dental amalgam is 15 the main source of mercury vapor affecting the general16 public. In fact, mercury vapor emitted from dental17 amalgam is the main source of mercury exposure to the18 general public. Mercury levels in the general19 atmosphere and in drinking water are so low they're20 not important.21 Deposition and toxicokinetics, elemental 22 mercury, swallowed liquid mercury, is only slowly23 absorbed from the GI tract -- we said that -- and is24 generally of no toxicological significance.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 159 of 288159 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Mercury vapor is readily absorbed from the 1 lungs. The mercury becomes dissolved in the blood and2 diffuses to all the tissues in the body. It is highly3 diffusible and lipid-soluble.4 Q Let me ask you a question about coal-fired 5 power plants. Do they release mercury into the air?6 A They do. As far as the mercury in the 7 general environment is concerned, something like 708 percent of it comes from coal-powered utility plants.9 Q Excuse me. It's not distributed equally all 10 around the area of the plant, is it?11 A No. It's highly concentrated. The closer 12 you are to the plant the greater the amount of mercury13 that you're going to inhale, but I think Landrigan14 showed in his El Paso study by the time you get a mile15 away from the plant the concentrations were quite low.16 Q And what form of mercury is that that comes 17 out of the coal plant?18 A Elemental mercury. Elemental mercury. 19 Q In vapor? 20 A In the vapor form, yes. 21 Q Yes. 22 A Primarily. Deposition and toxicokinetic. 23 We've gone through most of that.24 Q Yes. Let's go to Slide 28, I think. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 160 of 288160 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Again continuing with Goyer and Clarkson's 1 chapter, mercurous mercury exposure is rare, but it2 happens in, for example, pink disease. These3 compounds have a low solubility in water and are4 poorly absorbed from the GI tract. In certain cases5 the compound or the mercurous mercury can decompose to6 Hg0 and one atom of Hg+2. Very little is known 7 regarding disposition of mercurous mercury in the8 body.9 Now, mercuric mercury is a real culprit. 10 Absorption from the GI tract of mercuric compounds in11 food for humans is about 15 percent, whereas for12 methyl mercury it's 90 to 95 percent, if not higher. 13 There's also a difference in the distribution between14 red cells and plasma.15 For inorganic mercury, the ratio of cell to 16 plasma is two to less than one, but for methyl mercury17 it's 10, so there's 10 times more found in the red18 cells or in cells in general than in plasma. 19 Therefore, 10 times more mercury in red blood cells20 than plasma.21 After exposure to mercuric mercury or 22 mercury vapor, the greatest concentration of mercury23 is in the kidneys. Methyl mercury has a greater24 attraction to the central nervous system, especially25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 161 of 288161 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the posterior cortex.1 Q The posterior cortex meaning the back of the 2 outside of the brain?3 A Yes. 4 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide, No. 30. 5 Excuse me. No. 29.6 A Yes. I think just the last sentence here is 7 probably worth taking the time to read. Dental8 amalgam. Fillings in girls and women of reproductive9 age should be used with caution to avoid increased10 prenatal mercury exposure.11 Q And again this isn't your opinion. This is 12 a published opinion?13 A Everything in blue is the opinion of a 14 published expert that I've taken sometimes word for15 word from a published article, a peer reviewed16 article.17 Q Okay. Now, earlier in opening I showed the 18 Special Masters that series of five papers that came19 out of Seattle on the adult monkeys. Have you20 prepared some slides about those studies?21 A Yes. It may begin with the next one. I'm 22 not sure.23 Q I think it is. 24 A Yes. Okay. This is one of those papers by 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 162 of 288162 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Vahter and Burbacher is also. There's a list of1 distinguished authors of this set of papers.2 Monkeys were given methyl mercury for six, 3 12 or 18 months orally or mercuric chloride continuous4 for three months. I want to be certain that we5 understand that in these studies a subtoxic dose was6 given because we're going to talk about eventually the7 difference in mechanism between a subtoxic dose and a8 toxic dose or a small dose via a large dose of methyl9 mercury and the different mechanisms that are probably10 involved.11 It took about four months to reach blood 12 steady state. The blood total mercury elimination,13 T1/2, was 26 days. The blood inorganic mercury, which 14 was primarily mercuric mercury, was about seven15 percent of blood total mercury.16 Brain inorganic mercury, again primarily 17 mercuric mercury, was nine percent of total brain18 mercury at six to 12 months and by six months after19 exposure had stopped. Six months after exposure had20 stopped. Seventy-four percent of the total brain21 mercury in these monkeys was inorganic mercury.22 Q Let me stop you. Let's explain what is 23 total mercury versus its component parts in these24 kinds of studies.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 163 of 288163 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes. When these people used to do an 1 analysis by a now relatively old-fashioned technique2 at the time, absorption, they would measure the total3 mercury, and that's inorganic mercury plus organic4 mercury. Then they would measure I think -- it5 slipped my mind. Let's say they would measure6 inorganic mercury, and the difference between7 inorganic and total would be organic mercury.8 These are old studies. Today we do it 9 entirely different. These studies in the old days10 would take weeks to get the answers, whereas we have11 the basic equipment in my laboratory. We could do in12 less than one day what they did in a month.13 Q Yes. What I'm trying to make sure we get 14 across is that if the Special Masters see a term total15 mercury, that would include both organic and16 inorganic, right?17 A Yes. Yes. Absolutely. 18 Q And if it's inorganic or organic it would be 19 specified as one or the other?20 A Yes. Yes. 21 Q Okay. 22 A Yes. 23 Q Now, you were explaining that in the group 24 of monkeys that were fed methyl mercury for 12 months25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 164 of 288164 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and then they stopped feeding them and then waited six1 more months before they sacrificed them and looked at2 their brains, their inorganic mercury continued to go3 up in percentage, right?4 A Exactly. 5 Q Why was that? 6 A Because the methyl mercury was slowly 7 demethylated to mercuric mercury, and mercuric mercury8 cannot pass the blood-brain barrier either way to any9 great extent.10 That mercuric mercury, almost every first 11 year biochemistry student knows if you want to inhibit12 an enzyme and you don't know what to use, if you use13 mercuric mercury it's probably going to work because14 mercuric mercury is a classical enzyme inhibitor,15 especially if the enzyme has a thiol, an -SH group, in16 the active center.17 If the mercuric ion ties up that -SH group, 18 usually as we'll point out later in a very important19 paper, the activity, enzyme activity, will be20 completely inhibited.21 Q Now, in this study did these investigators 22 try to estimate the half-life in the brain of that23 mercuric mercury?24 A Yes. Let's see. Where is it here? Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 165 of 288165 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888The brain inorganic mercury elimination, T1/2, was a 1 matter of years. I mean, methyl mercury got out in a2 matter of weeks or months, but there are some people3 that think it's not a matter -- it's many, many, many4 years.5 I'll tell you at one point where a number of 6 studies have been published where a farm animal ate a7 methyl mercury fungicide, one in New Mexico. It was8 in a Coke bottle. He tipped it over and lapped it up. 9 Two days later the farmer killed that animal and fed10 the meat to his children. One child died quite soon. 11 Another one lived until she was 21 years of age.12 At 21 years of age, at the autopsy they took 13 the brain out and did a mercury analysis. The14 inorganic mercury at that time, in fact the total15 mercury, was 100 times above normal, and most of it16 was inorganic mercury, so inorganic mercury really17 stays in the brain a long, long time.18 Q Is that evidence that what happens in humans 19 is similar to what happened in these adult monkeys?20 A Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. 21 Q The methyl mercury can transfer into the 22 brain past the blood-brain barrier?23 A We know. We know this from the Clarkson 24 studies in Iraq. We know it from the Minamata studies25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 166 of 288166 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888in Japan. We know it from many studies in animals1 that methyl mercury will form a bond with amino acid2 cysteine, and that molecule, that cysteine methyl3 mercury molecule, looks like another amino acid called4 methionine.5 This cysteine methyl mercury compound will 6 be taken up by the methionine transport carrier7 protein, and it will get methyl mercury into the brain8 that way.9 Q Once the methyl mercury is in the brain it 10 can come back out again too, can't it?11 A Pardon? 12 Q The methyl mercury can come back out again? 13 A It's a much slower mechanism, and we really 14 don't know what that mechanism is. Some of us think15 that it's because of being bound to glutathione, but16 the mechanism, as you can see, or the half-time is --17 let's see.18 The brain inorganic mercury half-time is a 19 matter of years, as we say. No. We want the methyl20 mercury half-time. It's around here someplace.21 Q I know it's in the paper. 22 A Yes. It's someplace in here. I'm sorry. I 23 thought we had it here.24 Q We may have that on another slide. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 167 of 288167 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A It's a matter of 30 or 40 days, maybe 50 1 days.2 Q Okay. So the methyl mercury half-life in 3 the brain is 30 or 40 or 50 days, which would mean4 after a year or so it's essentially all gone.5 A A lot of it is gone, yes. 6 Q Whereas the inorganic mercury that's 7 produced in the brain by the breakdown of methyl8 mercury, that stays there for years?9 A That stays there for years. 10 Q Let's go to Slide 31. This is still the 11 same paper from Dr. Vahter, right?12 A Yes. It more or less points out -- 13 Q Well, this is what I was just asking you 14 about.15 A Yes. 16 Q What does it say? After it estimates the 17 half-times in blood of 50 to 80 days, what does it say18 then?19 A In human subjects exposed to methyl mercury, 20 mean half-time in blood of 50 to 80 days with21 considerable variation between individuals have been22 reported. They give the references to this.23 The high blood mercury level in heavy 24 individuals indicate methyl mercury is distributed to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 168 of 288168 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888fat to a limited degree, so if you don't have very1 much fat it gives rise to a higher dose of methyl2 mercury per lean body weight.3 In other words, if the methyl mercury 4 doesn't go into fat because there's less fat around,5 there's going to be more methyl mercury in the blood6 and more methyl mercury going in the tissues.7 Q Some of these monkeys in the study were 8 especially heavy, right?9 A Yes. 10 Q And in those heavy monkeys they were still 11 basing the dose on the total body weight, right?12 A Yes. 13 Q So they got more methyl mercury than the 14 lighter monkeys, but their blood level got much15 higher, right?16 A Yes. 17 Q And why is that again? 18 A Because in those animals with less fat then 19 the blood level is going to be higher because there's20 not enough fat for the methyl mercury to go into from21 the blood.22 Q And then you have another paper here cited 23 by a Swedish author.24 A Yes. It just points out again that dietary 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 169 of 288169 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888lipids affect whole body retention and relative organ1 distribution of methyl mercury and inorganic mercury. 2 It means that diet is important.3 Q Another variable in how much mercury -- 4 A Another variable. Yes, sir. 5 Q All right. Slide 32. What was the point of 6 this paper?7 A All right. This is a very recent paper, 8 year 2008, a very important paper.9 When you talk to most people, even those 10 with experience in mercury research, and you ask them11 what does mercuric mercury do to the brain -- we know12 it's there; what does it do -- most people will say13 well, it ties up sulphydryl groups.14 What does that mean? Well, there are 15 sulphydryl groups in proteins. Can you be more16 specific? Well, they'll say what do you mean? Being17 an enzymologist I'll say what enzyme specifically is18 methyl mercury or is inorganic mercury, mercuric19 mercury, inhibiting in the brain?20 There have been very few good studies along 21 these lines for a variety of reasons until this study22 came out. Now, in this study they took a thioredoxin23 system. Now, they were able to use enzymes that were24 made by DNA recombinant technology so there's no25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 170 of 288170 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888contamination with other enzymes.1 One of the axioms of enzymology is don't 2 waste clean thinking on dirty enzymes. Don't waste3 clean thinking on impure enzyme fractions. 4 Recombinant DNA enzymes are very, very pure. You5 don't have to worry about contamination there.6 And so essentially what they showed here was 7 that, first of all, let me say the thioredoxin system8 is critical for cellular stress response, protein9 repair and protection against oxidative stress. 10 Mercuric mercury or mercuric chloride, which contains11 chloride, mercury inhibited12 recombinant rat thioredoxin reductase with IC50. 13 That's the concentration that would cause inhibition14 of 50 percent of the activity, so that's a15 quantitative term, the IC50. 16 It had IC50 values of 7.2 and 19.7 nanomoles 17 respectively. That means that mercuric mercury was18 more inhibitory than methyl mercury. Overall mercury19 inhibition was selective towards a thioredoxin system. 20 The latter system consists of thioredoxin reductase,21 which has selenol cysteine in its active center and22 thioredoxin, which are widely distributed in the main23 organs and tissues and are also synthesized in nerve24 cell bodies and transported to synaptic terminals.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 171 of 288171 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Fully reduced human thioredoxin bound 1 mercury and lost all five free thiols and lost2 activity after incubation with dimers were very inhibitory.6 Q Now, is the mercuric chloride going to break 7 down in this system into Hg++? 8 A Momentarily you must say, but I think I have 9 a slide. It may be the next one. It's the next one. 10 We'll get back in just a minute.11 Q Yes. You're right. The next slide does 12 discus this. Let's go to 33.13 A We can wait. Let me just say that you asked 14 mercuric chloride breakdown. Yes, it does break down,15 but we don't have free mercury ions or free arsenic16 ions or free metal ions floating around in the blood,17 the plasma or in cells.18 They are attached very quickly to sulphydryl 19 containing compounds like glutathione, like cysteine,20 another -SH containing amino acid, and also proteins21 that have -SH, have cysteine, either in the active22 center or in the outer structural part, so it breaks23 down, mercuric chloride, to mercuric ion. That24 mercuric ion is very quickly bound to something, so25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 172 of 288172 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888there's no free mercuric ion floating around for two1 or three days.2 Q Is this the same type of mercuric mercury 3 that we talked about in the adult monkey studies4 that's left in the brain?5 A Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Now getting back 6 to this. In particular, the remarkable potency of the7 mercury compounds to bind to selenol-thiol in the8 active site of thioredoxin reductase should be a major9 molecular mechanism of mercury toxicity.10 I was the author of a chapter on the 11 toxicology of methyl mercury in I think it was the12 year 2000 National Research Council monograph that was13 written, and I wish we had that sentence because at14 that time we could just say mercury tied up an -SH15 group.16 Here it says: In particular, the remarkable 17 potency of the mercury compounds to bind to selenol-18 thiol in the active site of thioredoxin reductase19 should be a major molecular mechanism of mercury20 toxicity. I agree 100 percent with these authors.21 Q And this was new information just this year? 22 A Year 2008. I think it was last month. It 23 was just published. The page number just came out24 within the last week. It was prepublished and put on25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 173 of 288173 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the web first.1 They also performed human tissue culture 2 studies and lysate studies, and now I want to say in3 my own words the results of this research are very4 pertinent and important. The thioredoxin system is of5 course in the brain and most tissues. It appears to6 be uniquely sensitive to mercuric mercury and methyl7 mercury. It is unfortunate the ethyl mercury was not8 investigated in this system.9 Q All right. Now we want to talk a little bit 10 about the different forms of organic mercury here.11 A The next slide, please? 12 Q Slide 35. 13 A This is the chemical formula for thimerosal. 14 If you look at the left side of the molecule it says15 CH3. You'll see mercury. The bond between the16 mercury and sulfur is cleaved very quickly in the17 body. It's metabolized very quickly to yield ethyl18 mercury. It's this ethyl mercury that does most of19 the traveling in the blood and gets across the blood-20 brain barrier.21 The next slide, please? I don't know 22 whether it's necessary to read all of this. It points23 out the difference in solubility. Ethyl mercury has a24 solubility of 1.4 times 10 to the minus four grams per25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 174 of 288174 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888100 milliliters of water, and that can be compared to1 not one gram per milliliter of water, but 100 grams of2 thimerosal per 100 grams of water. A tremendous3 difference in the solubility.4 Next slide? 5 Q When thimerosal or merthiolate was 6 formulated, why were they interested in having a7 soluble form of mercury? Is that part of its8 preservative stance?9 A Let me stop for a second. Merthiolate, 10 which is also thimerosal, breaks down to ethyl11 mercury. No one really knew at the time. It was12 claimed that thimerosal and/or merthiolate was13 bacteriostatic. It would stop the growth of bacteria.14 But in the latest slide I'll point out what 15 the FDA now says about it; that that isn't necessarily16 so. Can we have the next slide perhaps?17 Q Yes. Slide 37. 18 A So thimerosal is rapidly metabolized to 19 ethyl mercury. The statement is taken from one of Tom20 Clarkson's articles.21 Q Okay. And then the next slide, 38? 22 A Here we go. Ethyl mercury or methyl mercury 23 do not just float around free in body fluids and24 cells. They have a high affinity for binding to and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 175 of 288175 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888are transported thiol-containing compounds such as1 proteins.3 does thiol mean? 4 A It's an -SH group. It's a radical. It has 5 a valence. It can form a chemical bond with carbon6 compounds, carbon atoms.7 Q And the S in the -SH is sulfur? 8 A S is for sulfur. H is for hydrogen. The 9 hydrogen is very reactive. It will come off very10 quickly, especially in the presence of oxygen or11 something like mercuric mercury or methyl mercury,12 which will react with it very quickly.13 Q Okay. All right. The next slide, Slide 39? 14 A Now, the safety and efficacy of thimerosal 15 have been questioned by the FDA as shown in the16 following slides.17 Q Okay. Slide 40? 18 A Slide 40 states, and this is now from the 19 Federal Register : Rule will be based on page 11 of 20 the Federal Register 436 published January 5, 1982, 21 which states: The panel concludes -- this is an FDA22 panel. The panel concludes that thimerosal is not23 safe for over-the-counter topical use because of its24 potential for cell damage if applied to broken skin as25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 176 of 288176 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888allergy potential.1 More importantly, in my opinion, but it 2 states here, it is not effective as a topical3 antimicrobial because its bacteriostatic action can be4 reversed. I'm going to make this comment, but it's5 really one that Congressman Burton made once on a6 committee that I was involved in. He said: If they7 did not think it was safe enough to apply topically to8 adults, what evidence did they have for its safety for9 injection into children?10 The next slide, please? This is again in 11 the Federal Register . A ruling came out by the FDA. 12 It came out October 11, 2005. It's effective April 1,13 2007, about a year ago, and I quote:14 A number of active ingredients have been 15 present in over-the-counter drug products of various16 uses as described below. However, based on evidence17 currently available there are inadequate data to18 establish general recognition of the safety and19 effectiveness of these ingredients for the specified20 use.21 Now, there are about 200 compounds that they 22 list in this Federal Register , and one of them, 23 thimerosal, was quoted as one of these ingredients.24 Q Okay. Now let's go to some studies about 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 177 of 288177 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888what happens to thimerosal in infants.1 A The major studies in infants -- not all of 2 them -- have been done by Pichichero from the3 University of Rochester. I think, but I don't4 remember whether Clarkson is one of the co-authors of5 these papers.6 It deals with mercury concentration and 7 metabolism in infants receiving vaccines, and8 essentially they gave to infants age six months and9 younger vaccines that contained thimerosal. They list10 the vaccines. The first group received vaccines11 containing thimerosal, but then 21 control infants12 received thimerosal-free vaccines that were available.13 They state: We obtained samples of blood, 14 urine and stools three to 28 days after vaccination. 15 Estimated blood half-life of ethyl mercury was seven16 days, although they changed that number in a17 subsequent number.18 Their interpretation? Administration of 19 vaccines containing thimerosal does not seem to raise20 blood concentration of mercury above safe levels in21 infants. Ethyl mercury seems to be eliminated from22 blood rapidly via the stools after parental23 administration of thimerosal in vaccines.24 My comment: This sample size is highly 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 178 of 288178 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888unlikely to capture the full range of human variation1 in handling mercury exposure.2 The next slide, please? This is the 2002 3 paper, the same paper. This shows you some of the4 variation. Now we're plotting blood mercury in5 nanomoles per liter versus days since the last6 vaccine. The dark or the triangles -- I think they're7 called diamonds -- are for infants of age two months,8 and six months are shown by the squares.9 As you can see, in one case, the very high 10 one, you have 20 nanomoles of mercury per liter of11 blood, and in other cases you're down to almost 2.5 so12 you almost have a tenfold -- almost a tenfold --13 variation in how children respond to injections of14 vaccines containing thimerosal.15 Q Now, this was on 40 infants. If you had 16 done this study on 4,000 infants would you expect the17 range to be even wider?18 A Probably. Probably. From everything that 19 we know that we've seen, I think it would be much20 wider. We'd have much more.21 Next slide? This is in the most recent or 22 more recent Pichichero paper done in Argentina with23 newborn infants in this slide. This is now a time24 course, days since the last vaccination, and again you25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 179 of 288179 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888see the huge variation, anywhere a little above zero1 to eightfold or eight nanograms per mil. There's2 variation. You've got to expect that in children or3 almost any human as far as the way they handle4 mercury.5 Q Even at 30 days after vaccination, there was 6 still a range of values for them.7 A Yes. Yes. 8 Q Does that show that not all children will 9 process the mercury as fast as others?10 A I'm sorry? 11 Q What does that show about the children if 12 the range varies at 30 days?13 A Well, they're processing it differently 14 because they probably have some difference in their15 metabolism, which may be genetically determined.16 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide. 17 A This again shows the same sort of thing in 18 two month old infants, and again you'll see the19 variation is anywhere from a little bit above zero to20 five nanograms per milliliter here. Again there's21 variation.22 Out at the end at 30 days since the last 23 vaccination you're almost as bad as you were at the24 very beginning with a very high outlier, again showing25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 180 of 288180 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that individuals handle mercury differently. There's1 no set response.2 Q Okay. And then the next slide, please? 3 A Again it shows the six month old infants. 4 So you're getting variation all the time no matter how5 old the kids are. You're getting variation. Here6 it's between zero and five at the beginning.7 Q Okay. Slide 48. This is still the 8 Pichichero 2008 paper, correct?9 A Yes. What did we want to say about this? 10 Oh, yes. In the earlier paper, the 2002 paper, these11 same authors claimed that the blood half-time for the12 mercury was seven days. Now for some reason or other13 they've cut it down by half to 3.7 days.14 Again, this shows the variation not only -- 15 I mean, these studies I think were done in the same16 laboratory or parts of them were anyway, and it shows17 the variation that can occur when you're measuring18 mercury and/or a group of people responding19 differently to mercury.20 It's amazing that it took 30 days for blood 21 mercury to return to prevaccination levels, so when22 you say that mercury leaves the body very quickly23 after vaccination to me in the life of an infant 3024 days is a long time.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 181 of 288181 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888It was addressed, as Pichichero himself 1 states in this paper, that some methyl mercury was2 detected in all the blood samples of the young3 children.4 Q So they had some background methyl mercury 5 exposure too?6 A Yes. 7 Q If they had a difference in processing ethyl 8 mercury, would you expect a difference in processing9 methyl mercury? Would that be independent?10 A Based on what we know, both of them would be 11 demethylated. That's about the major similarity that12 I would venture at this present time. Ethyl mercury13 would be demethylated to mercuric mercury, and the14 methyl mercury would be demethylated to mercuric15 mercury.16 Q Once the ethyl group or the methyl group is 17 taken off of an organic mercury compound what's left18 is the same thing, right?19 A Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. 20 QH g++? 21 AH g++, which is going to react with something 22 very quickly.23 Q Okay. Slide 50? Wait a minute. We didn't 24 finish Slide 49. I'm sorry.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 182 of 288182 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A We should make a note that as far as now 1 it's my opinion. These were supposedly normal2 children that Pichichero dealt with. They were not3 autistic children -- they were too young -- or they4 were not autistic prone children who may process5 mercury in vaccines differently.6 No mass balance data was given. By mass 7 data I mean if you give 10 milligrams of something to8 a human being you want to know where that 109 milligrams went to. You either want to find 1010 milligrams in the urine and the feces, or if you don't11 find the 10 milligrams, you find only five milligrams12 in the urine and feces, then you're going to say13 there's five milligrams that stayed in the body14 someplace.15 The next question would be where did those 16 five milligrams go? In this case they don't know. 17 How much thimerosal ethyl mercury was given is known,18 but what percent of the dose was eliminated was not19 stated and experimentally could not be determined20 because of the protocols they used.21 How much ethyl mercury stayed in the brain 22 or in other tissues? They don't know. They didn't23 try to do that. The authors state they were unable to24 determine the fate of the mercury after it leaves the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 183 of 288183 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888blood. They're now talking the mercury that came from1 thimerosal. No mercuric mercury was determined.2 The paper is flawed, and I think the next 3 slide -- yes. Now, this is an independent4 evaluation. The Pediatrics Journal , which does not 5 take letters indiscriminately. The letters to the6 editor that you send in to the Pediatrics Journal are 7 peer reviewed and then published if the editor thinks8 they're worth publishing, so the citation really is9 Pediatrics post publication peer reviews, March 30, 10 2008.11 Dr. Indech discusses invalidating 12 assumptions of the Pichichero paper, and I quote: 13 While the methodology admits the underlying assumption14 that lowered levels of these chemicals result from15 body elimination of them, perhaps the more rapid16 decline in measurement levels of ethyl mercury is due17 to stronger, undetectable binding to tissues in the18 central nervous system.19 The pharmacokinetics of such a process would 20 be identical to that observed, yet such a process may21 give rise to autistic symptoms whereas total excretion22 from the body would not. In short, simply because the23 levels decline you can't make the assumption that the24 toxin has been eliminated from the body. The paper is25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 184 of 288184 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888fundamentally flawed. End of quote.1 Q In fact, if the same thing happened in these 2 infants that happened in the infant monkeys what would3 you expect? Would you expect some of this mercury to4 end up in the infants' brains?5 A Absolutely. No question about it. I think 6 Burbacher did show that the thimerosal injected via7 vaccines -- whatever he did with the thimerosal. 8 Actually it was direct injection of thimerosal, I9 think. That much of the mercury did end up in the10 brain.11 Q By the way, are you aware of any way under 12 current technology that you could measure the amount13 of mercuric mercury in a child's brain?14 A A living child? 15 Q A living child. 16 A Absolutely there's no way we can do it. I 17 thought we had a way, and I called some people up who18 are very good with this sort of thing and they said19 no, no way.20 Because there are ways of measuring lead in 21 our bones by putting our forearms in a sort of machine22 and it will tell you how much lead I have or a child23 has in his bones. I thought we could use that same24 thing for mercury in the brain, but they said25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 185 of 288185 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888absolutely not. We cannot measure the amount of1 mercury in a human living brain.2 Q Because in this trial we're not going to 3 have any evidence directly of inorganic mercury in the4 brains of these two boys, but is that because nobody5 could do it?6 A You can't do it because they're alive. We 7 have autopsied data where that has been done, as we'll8 point out later, papers that we'll quote of children,9 autistic children who died and at autopsy the brains10 were removed and the mercury, both inorganic and11 organic mercury, was determined.12 Q But you can't do it in a living child's 13 brain?14 A Absolutely not. We're not Nazis. 15 Q Okay. Slide 51. 16 A Well, in preparation for what's coming: 17 Thimerosal pharmacokinetics obtained -- Pichichero, et18 al -- using nonautistic children are not the same as19 those expected from autistic children. The latter20 appear to have different efflux kinetics as we point21 out in later slides.22 Q All right. And now we're going to go to a 23 discussion of brain concentration of mercury species,24 correct?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 186 of 288186 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes. 1 Q Okay. This is a paper from the National 2 Institutes of Health in Bethesda published in the year3 2004, a paper that really has withstood the criticism4 of time, Mercury Concentrations in Brain and Kidney5 Following Ethyl Mercury, Methyl Mercury and Thimerosal6 Administration to Neonatal Mice.7 The main objective of this study was to 8 define and compare mercury concentrations in the9 organs of neonatal animals exposed to methyl mercury10 or thimerosal. The toxicity of these two mercury11 species in a neonatal animal model is believed to be12 similar to humans with respect to organic mercury13 pharmacokinetics.14 Q Now, just for purposes of the audience, 15 neonatal means newborn?16 A Yes. Yes. 17 Q Okay. 18 A For a period of one or two months I think it 19 is.20 Q Okay. 21 A For the mice it would be different. For a 22 short period of time.23 Q Okay. 24 A Neonatal mice seem to be the best rodent 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 187 of 288187 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888model to study thimerosal disposition in order to1 closely mimic human exposure. Mice exhibit methyl2 mercury brain-blood ratios of about one, closer to the3 three to 10 ratio seen in primates, than the ratio in4 rats estimated by Magos in 1986.5 Again let me point out Magos is a very good 6 investigator of mercury toxicity. I don't know him7 personally, but he has a superb reputation for doing8 very good work, but 1986 is different than the year9 2004 as these studies were done. Science progresses.10 The fact that we no longer think that rats 11 are better to use, that rats are not better to use, is12 not meant to be an insult to Magos. It's just that13 times change. We get more information. Magos is a14 superb investigator. He's one of the Respondent's.15 Q Let's stop. I want to have you explain what 16 is this blood-brain ratio they're talking about here17 or brain to blood I guess it is. Yes. They call it18 the brain to blood ratio. What does that mean?19 A It's the concentration of whatever species 20 of mercury, usually total mercury, you're concerned21 about, the concentration in the brain versus the22 concentration in the blood. That ratio is used by23 some people. I myself never use it. Used by some24 people as an indication of how the body handles these25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 188 of 288188 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mercury compounds.1 For example, the reason we don't think the 2 rat is a good model anymore is the rat hemoglobin has3 more sulphydryl groups that mercury will bind to and4 stay in the blood than the human hemoglobin and so it5 makes the science more complicated. We have a6 confounding factor if we do studies with rat blood.7 Q Would you agree that studies on primates 8 would be a better indication of what probably happens9 in humans than studies on rats?10 A No question about it. I think most people 11 would agree with that.12 Q They use rats because they're much less 13 expensive, right?14 A Yes. And at one time they were the animal 15 of choice for experimental studies, but times change. 16 We learn more as we go on.17 Q Okay. I interrupted you as you were going 18 through Slide 53.19 A Yes. In mice it was three to four days for 20 a steady state. More than 80 percent of the mercury21 in hair in this study was found to be in the form of22 organic mercury. Blood mercury in these mice was23 found to be primarily in the organic form. They did24 other tissue analysis.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 189 of 288189 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Next slide? This shows some of the data. 1 Again, some of the data was lacking, but this is a2 table that I made up using their data. It shows you3 that .6 percent of the delivered dose of methyl4 mercury ended up in the brain of these mice.5 When they gave thimerosal 0.2 percent and 6 when they gave ethyl mercury 0.39 percent, but much7 more percentage-wise of the ethyl mercury ended up in8 the kidney than did in the case of methyl mercury or9 thimerosal.10 Next slide, please? 11 Q Okay. Slide 55. 12 A Let's see. For each compound -- thimerosal, 13 ethyl mercury, methyl mercury -- the percent of14 mercury that reached the brain was significantly more15 in young mice as compared to mature mice, so in young16 mice the blood-brain barrier probably is not matured17 as much as in the older mice.18 In all cases, the level of mercury that 19 reached the adult brain following an IM injection was20 less than 0.1 percent of the total administered dose. 21 When compared to levels at 24 hours, mercury22 concentration at seven days post dosing were23 significantly decreased in the blood, while24 concentrations within the brain and kidney remained25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 190 of 288190 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888relatively constant.1 In this paper they state with references, 2 and this is going to be a matter of disagreement as we3 go through this paper or as we go through all these4 talks. In this paper they state with reference that5 while methyl mercury gets into the brain by diffusion6 plus active transport of the methyl mercury cysteine7 complex, ethyl mercury does not form such a cysteine8 complex and does not get in that way, but diffuses9 more readily across the blood-brain barrier.10 Now, Clarkson will quite rightly say, as he 11 said in his written form, that we don't know how ethyl12 mercury gets across the blood-brain barrier. It may13 use the cysteine complex, but as he himself says we14 don't know. The experiments have not been done.15 Q We don't know how it gets across, but we 16 know that it does get across?17 A Yes. Absolutely. 18 Okay. Next slide, please? Now we go on to 19 another study, Zareba, and I think he is from20 Clarkson's group also. In the blood of neonatal male21 mice total mercury concentrations after thimerosal22 were slightly lower than those after methyl mercury,23 reaching statistical significance only at day one. 24 The rate of decline of blood levels was roughly25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 191 of 288191 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888similar in both.1 In hair, the total mercury content was 2 approximately two times higher in methyl mercury than3 the thimerosal treated group. In the brain, which4 we're really interested in. In the brain, organic5 mercury levels were significantly lower, approximately6 three to fourfold -- we're talking about organic7 mercury now -- in the thimerosal group than in the8 methyl mercury exposed group.9 In other words, the organic mercury in the 10 thimerosal group was decreasing much faster in the11 brain than in the methyl mercury group. This could be12 due to either its conversion to mercuric mercury or to13 it being pushed out of the brain.14 It goes on to say: Inorganic mercury levels 15 of the brain were similar in both groups except for16 the first day after exposure. However, in the17 thimerosal exposed animals, inorganic mercury18 accounted for a higher fraction, 12 to 22 percent --19 notice the variation; 12 to 22 percent of total20 mercury -- whereas in the methyl mercury group it did21 not exceed 10 percent of the total mercury.22 Q Now, they gave these mice all the same dose, 23 right?24 A Yes. Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 192 of 288192 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And yet there was almost a twofold variation 1 after one week in how much inorganic mercury was in2 the brain of the thimerosal exposed mice?3 A Yes. 4 Q Why was that? Why is that? Why is there 5 such a wide variation?6 A I guess that's based on the individual 7 genetics of the animal or the human if you're talking8 about humans. It could be due to difference in9 susceptibility. It could be due to a different rate10 of metabolism. It could be due to many factors.11 Next slide, please? 12 Q Okay. Slide 57. 13 A Again, this is a continuation. For total 14 mercury in the blood for approximately five percent of15 the dose was similar for ethyl mercury and methyl16 mercury, but the subsequent fate of mercury in the17 body differed.18 Brain organic mercury was higher for methyl 19 mercury, three to fourfold, as compared to ethyl20 mercury. Brain levels of inorganic mercury was about21 the same in both cases, unlike the infant monkey22 study. There's bound to be variation, variability23 between species also.24 For kidney, inorganic mercury was three to 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 193 of 288193 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888four times higher for thimerosal than for methyl1 mercury, which confirms other studies, including2 humans. Much higher accumulation of inorganic and3 organic mercury in the liver in the thimerosal mice4 than in the methyl mercury ones.5 It took about three or four days for a 6 steady state to occur, and more than 80 percent of the7 mercury in the hair was in the organic form. Blood8 mercury is primarily in the organic form.9 Q Now, you referred to Dr. Magos before. 10 There's a paper he published in 1985 that keeps11 getting cited over and over again. We're going to12 discuss that now.13 A Yes. 14 Q If you would turn to Slide 58? 15 A Keep in mind this is a paper published in 16 1985. Keep in mind that thimerosal was not on the tip17 of everyone's tongue at that time, all right? 18 Vaccinations were not being questioned with thimerosal19 in them.20 He compared methyl and ethyl mercury by 21 giving them by mouth, so the ethyl mercury is not22 given by IM, all right, as vaccinations are given. In23 addition, rats were used. In a later paper they state24 that mouse is a better model for studying mercury25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 194 of 288194 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888toxicity than is the rat. We've discussed this before1 that times change as we get more knowledge.2 The authors state that one of the first 3 toxic effects of methyl mercury is weight loss. In4 this paper they stated that ethyl mercury caused a5 greater weight loss than did methyl mercury. This is6 one example of greater toxicity for ethyl mercury from7 Magos' own paper.8 Ethyl mercury is also more renal toxic than 9 methyl mercury. Mercuric mercury can contribute, and10 he states in this paper and gives evidence. Mercuric11 mercury can contribute to injury of ganglion cells12 also.13 Q Okay. 14 A Next slide, please? They go on to state 15 there were little differences in the neurotoxicity of16 methyl mercury and ethyl mercury when effects root ganglia or coordination disorders were18 compared.19 Parenthetically, one of the problems in the 20 past has been people concentrated on pharmacokinetics21 or toxicokinetics of thimerosal, ethyl mercury and22 methyl mercury and did many, many studies with this23 and so in the literature the statement creeps in that24 there are vast differences between methyl mercury and25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 195 of 288195 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888ethyl mercury.1 That's not necessarily so. The 2 pharmacokinetics can be different, but the toxic3 effects in many ways are similar. I'll show this in4 the subsequent slide that will list all these one by5 one. The mercuric mercury formed extraneously from6 alkyl mercury can contribute to the injury of ganglion7 cells.8 The authors also use mercury concentrations, 9 cerebral damage, histochemical visualization as10 indication of a toxic or lack of toxic effect of ethyl11 and methyl mercury. These effects or measurements12 that they used in 1985 are not as sensitive as enzyme13 activity inhibition as far as the thioredoxin paper14 that I quoted for the year 2008 earlier in this talk.15 In 1985 when this paper was published, 16 neuroinflammation was not examined since the term17 neuroinflammation -- very shocking. The term18 neuroinflammation did not appear in the medical19 literature until the year 1994-1995. I still can't20 get over it. When I was first told this I didn't21 believe it.22 If you go back to PubMed and do any kind of 23 literature survey, before 1994 you cannot turn up the24 word neuroinflammation, but now it's a word used all25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 196 of 288196 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the time, especially by the Zimmerman group, a very,1 very good research group at Johns Hopkins University.2 Next slide, please? You went the wrong way. 3 Yes. Here we are.4 Now, a paper that's quoted very often, 5 Mercury by Ip, et al. Mercury Exposure in Children6 With Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Case Control Study. 7 I quote: Thus, the results of our cohort study with8 similar environmental mercury exposure indicate that9 there is no causal relationship between mercury as an10 environmental neurotoxin and autism.11 This paper is quoted over and over again, 12 and there are subsequent papers that rely on this13 paper. This article has a major error in it, and I14 will now point out the error again which appeared in a15 peer reviewed journal.16 Paper by DeSoto and Hitlan, Blood Levels of 17 Mercury are Related to the Diagnosis of Autism: A18 Reanalysis of an Important Data Step. I wish to19 emphasize again, Special Masters, this is not my20 opinion I'm giving you. I'm reading directly from the21 paper, a peer reviewed paper in Journal of Child 22 Neurology . 23 We have reanalyzed the data set originally 24 reported by Ip, et al. in 2004 and found that the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 197 of 288197 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888original P value was in error and that a significant1 relation does exist between the blood levels of2 mercury and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.3 Moreover, the hair sample analysis results 4 offer some support for the idea that persons with5 autism may be less efficient and more variable at6 eliminating mercury from the blood. The underlining7 emphasis I added, but this is a direct quotation.8 Now, the editor of this journal said in a 9 note that he submitted, and I again quote: But as the10 editor-in-chief of the Journal of Child Neurology , it 11 is troubling to note that the article, Ip, et al., has12 errors not only in the reporting of the statistical13 findings, but also in something as simple as a listing14 of the age range of the subjects.15 My comment: Please note, the article being 16 criticized is cited on the previous side, the Ip side.17 Q Now, let me ask you. 18 A Yes? 19 Q This 2004 Ip study that was comparing the 20 blood levels of mercury in autistic kids and21 nonautistic kids. What they reported initially was22 there was no difference in the blood levels of23 mercury. That's been cited as evidence that mercury24 is not linked to autism by many, many people, right?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 198 of 288198 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes, sir. 1 Q Including at least one of the Respondent's 2 experts in this case?3 A Yes, sir. 4 Q But in 2007 these people in a peer reviewed 5 paper reanalyzed that data and found that in fact6 statistically significant was autistic kids had more7 mercury in the blood, right, so it turns out the study8 actually shows the opposite of what it was originally9 published for?10 A Yes. Yes. 11 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 62. 12 A So what happens to the organic mercury that 13 enters the brain?14 Next slide, please? Now, this one slide are 15 my comments just to bring things in perspective. The16 literature supports this. Ethyl mercury, methyl17 mercury and elemental mercury are converted to18 mercuric mercury, Hg++, in the brain. The mercuric 19 mercury reacts with thiols of enzymes and Thiols and sulphydryls are synonymous21 terms.22 Thus, mercuric mercury is a well known 23 enzyme inhibitor and has been used as a research tool24 for that purpose for many years. Does it inhibit a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 199 of 288199 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888crucial enzyme the brain; for example, Mercuric mercury also reacts with selenium 3 compounds to form mercury selenide. The latter4 compound is very insoluble. It has been claimed to be5 nontoxic because of its insolubility, but this witness6 -- I was at a small, closed symposia of 20 people that7 were brought in to analyze the mercury selenide8 significance, and when people told me that mercury9 selenide is free of toxicity I asked them what is the10 evidence for this and they said well, it's insoluble.11 I said that's no evidence. Have you done 12 any radioactive studies to show that it doesn't go13 anywhere but completely out of the body? They said14 no. Do you have any enzyme studies at low15 concentrations that would show some biological16 activity? No. Then why do you say that mercury17 selenide is free of toxicity; that the mercury is now18 bound and therefore cannot do anything? The answer is19 it's insoluble.20 For most of the people there, even those 21 people that had worked and heard this before, they22 were willing to agree that there is not enough23 evidence. There is no evidence in the literature that24 shows whether mercury selenide is or is not toxic.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 200 of 288200 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888So anyone who in the early literature said 1 well, we see these black spots when we do some2 analytic studies, and those black spots are mercury3 and selenium tied up. In those days they used to say4 before we knew about the mercury selenide what do you5 mean by black spots being mercury and selenide? What6 form of mercury? What form of selenide? They said7 oh, we don't know, but we think it happened. The8 science behind mercury selenide is virtually9 nonexistent as far as any toxicity or what its10 function is in the body.11 In regards with which protein or selenium 12 compound mercuric mercury binds, it is accepted that13 mercuric mercury remains in the brain for a very, very14 long time. Those are words used almost exactly by15 Vahter. Also, the inorganic mercury in the brain of16 the adult monkeys provoked glial activation and17 astrocyte death.18 Q Now you're talking about the adult monkey 19 study from Seattle --20 A Yes. 21 Q -- that resulted in those five papers that I 22 showed in the opening statement, right?23 A Yes. Next slide, please? 24 Q Okay. This is a paper involving examination 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 201 of 288201 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of the brains of who?1 A These are people in Greenland who eat a lot 2 of fish, and they did a superb study on mercury3 accumulation in brains from populations exposed to4 high and low dietary levels of methyl mercury.5 Concentration, chemical form and 6 distribution of mercury in brain samples from7 autopsies. They have a tremendous number. I've8 forgotten what the end was, but it's in the hundreds9 if I remember correctly. Their conclusion is this10 suggests a slow transformation of methyl mercury to11 inorganic mercury in the brain. The autometallography12 demonstrable mercury was primarily located in the13 glial cells.14 All right. My comments is that this is a 15 study of humans; that they're looking at human brains16 at autopsy time of people in Greenland, some who ate a17 lot of fish and therefore high exposure to methyl18 mercury and some who ate just a small amount of fish19 with low exposure. We'll come back to the20 significance of this later on.21 Q But these people, when they died after a 22 lifetime of eating fish they had a lot of inorganic23 mercury in their brain?24 A Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 202 of 288202 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q And it was in the glial cells? 1 A Yes. Most of it was in the glial cells, 2 yes.3 Q Okay. Slide 65. 4 A I think we've sort of gone over this before. 5 This is the '94 study. We can go on to the next one,6 I think.7 Q Okay. Yes. We've already talked about this 8 paper on a couple slides.9 A Yes. 10 Q Now, this next paper on 66, this is yet 11 another one of those five studies --12 A Yes. 13 Q -- that came out of the same adult monkey 14 study, right?15 A Yes. The major point of this paper is that 16 monkeys' inorganic mercury may be the proximate form17 of mercury causing changes in astrocytes (support cell18 growth and are sources of neuronotrophic factors) and19 microglia, which create neurotoxic agents in the20 population of cells. Both astrocytes and microglial21 accumulate inorganic mercury. It just goes on and on.22 The loss of astrocytes and increase in 23 activated microglia in the thalamus may have impact on24 the function and survival of neurons in thalamus after25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 203 of 288203 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888they've been exposed to methyl mercury.1 Q So this monkey study found that the 2 inorganic mercury in the brain which was activating3 these glial cells could well be creating harmful4 effects. Is that right?5 A Yes. Well, they found that it was 6 concentrated in the glial cells, and we know that7 mercuric mercury certainly is not the best thing to8 have in the cell. It can cause a lot of damage.9 Q Okay. 10 A This is another one. 11 Q Now, the next slide, 67. This is yet 12 another one of those five papers that came out of that13 same adult monkey study.14 A I hate to read the whole thing. Would the 15 Special Master like me to read all of it?16 Q Well, let me ask you this. Look at the 17 second bullet point.18 In the monkeys that had been exposed for 12 19 months and then they were left alive for six months20 with no additional methyl mercury exposure, what21 happened to their glial cells?22 A Seventytwo-percent in the six months, 152 23 percent in the 12 months and 120 percent in the 1824 month methyl mercury exposed group, and the number of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 204 of 288204 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888reactive glia in the clearance group remained1 elevated.2 The inorganic mercury exposed group showed a 3 165 percent increase in the number of reactive glia.4 Q One group of these monkeys they fed 5 inorganic mercury to and the rest of them got methyl6 mercury, and both groups ended up with inorganic7 mercury in their brain --8 A Yes. 9 Q -- activating glial cells? 10 A Yes. 11 Q Okay. Let's go to the next slide. 12 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Let me make a 13 comment.14 THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. 15 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Actually, people 16 in the audience were chuckling at my facial reaction17 to your question, Dr. Aposhian, whether I wanted you18 to read all of this particular slide. The answer in19 general is no, I don't have any particular desire to20 hear you read things.21 What our hope here was we wanted expert 22 reports in written form. We would sit there and read23 it in our offices, and then the oral testimony is24 where you would get into emphasizing what's important25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 205 of 288205 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888there or go over nuances or answer questions that we1 had about the written, but I think in general just2 reading everything you've got here doesn't do us any3 good.4 THE WITNESS: All right. 5 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: We can read. 6 THE WITNESS: Okay. 7 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Go ahead, Mr. 8 Williams.9 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 10 Q Okay. Well, let's look at this Gallagher 11 paper for a minute, and let me try to ask you what's12 important about it.13 This again is a 1982 paper, and it's looking 14 at the structural effects of mercuric chloride and15 methyl mercury. Now, mercuric chloride. Again, is16 a way to deliver inorganic mercury to these17 animals?18 A It is a way of delivering inorganic mercury 19 to animals.20 Q Mercuric mercury. Right. 21 A Pardon? And directly into the brain. These 22 are injections directly into the brain, okay?23 The major point is that in spite of the 24 distinctive clinical syndromes in these two classes of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 206 of 288206 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mercury compounds, mercuric chloride and methyl1 mercury have, they are capable of inducing neuronal2 necrosis in the brain.3 Q Because some of the Respondent reports 4 suggest or claim that inorganic mercury is harmless in5 the brain, that it's sequestered there and it's okay6 for it to be there, right?7 A That's what some people think. 8 Q Is this paper consistent with that view? 9 A It's not consistent because when they 10 injected the mercuric mercury directly into the brain11 they got a neuronal necrosis and so it's a direct12 effect of the mercuric mercury.13 I want to apologize to the Special Masters. 14 I thought evidential toxicology would be a different15 way of doing it. I suppose I should have given the16 usual spontaneous rendition.17 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Well, you need to 18 do whatever way you feel is more explanatory.19 THE WITNESS: Okay. 20 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I'm just telling 21 you that it helps us for you to tell us what in here22 is important.23 THE WITNESS: Okay. Fine. Okay. 24 //25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 207 of 288207 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888BY MR. WILLIAMS: 1 Q Okay. Let's go to Slide 70, please. Now, 2 this is a very recent paper reviewing the role of3 thiols, dithiols, nutritional factors and interacting4 ligands in the toxicology of mercury. We've heard you5 describe thiols as being the sulfur hydrogen groups.6 A Yes. 7 Q They're on many enzymes, right? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Dithiols are just two of them? 10 A That's two of them, yes. 11 Q Okay. And what are ligands? What are 12 interacting ligands?13 A That's something that they would react with, 14 what the metal would bind with.15 What's important in this slide is that for 16 short-term -- they're discussing short-term high dose17 -- that there have been studies with high doses and18 low doses of methyl mercury, and they point out for19 short-term high dose methyl mercury toxicity as used20 by Magos in 1985 the approximate toxic agent is most21 likely methyl mercury itself due to the high dose22 delivered resulting in a direct toxic effect before23 demethylization of the methyl mercury occurs.24 However, for chronic low dose like those 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 208 of 288208 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888five studies that we've discussed from Seattle -- the1 Charleston, the Vahter studies -- in those low dose2 exposures by Charleston and Vahter the proximate toxic3 agent is most like inorganic mercury due to both on4 the one hand its long-term accumulation in the brain5 and extremely long half-life therein.6 I think this is a very important paper in 7 pointing out the differences between high dose and low8 dose methyl mercury.9 Q And this paper also concludes that the 10 result of that adult monkey study showed that11 inorganic mercury was a toxic agent in the brains of12 those monkeys, right?13 A Yes. 14 Q Can you say yes out loud? 15 A Pardon? 16 Q You just nodded your head. 17 A I'm sorry. Yes. 18 Q The court reporter didn't hear that. 19 A Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. My apologies. 20 Q Okay. Now, did you make an overall slide 21 that compared methyl mercury and ethyl mercury?22 A I think -- I hope -- it's the next one. 23 Q I think it's No. 71. 24 A Okay. Yes. All right. I sat down and 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 209 of 288209 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888thought of information. I wanted to try to compare1 these because again and again I was so wrongly2 impressed with everyone saying these two compounds,3 methyl mercury and ethyl mercury, are so different.4 But what everyone was describing early in 5 the game were the pharmacokinetics are different. 6 They really had no evidence that the toxicity was that7 different.8 Q And by pharmacokinetics you mean what? 9 A What happens, how rapidly the blood level 10 goes up or down, how it's distributed, where it goes11 in the body. Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics deal12 with numbers, the quantities expressing what happens13 to a compound in the body essentially in quantitative14 terms as to where it goes, not necessarily what its15 toxic effects are. Pharmacokinetics usually deal with16 numbers rather than symptoms. Usually. There are17 exceptions.18 So here we have a column for methyl mercury 19 and ethyl mercury. Both of them are organic20 mercurials. Both of them induce neuronal necrosis,21 and the references to these are in the slides. If I22 added the references in every case it would be a very23 cumbersome slide.24 Metabolized to mercuric. They're both 25Case 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 210 of 288210 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888metabolized to mercuric mercury. Cause weight loss,1 Magos, et al. in 1985. Cause less weight loss, methyl2 mercury. Ethyl mercury causes greater weight loss,3 which is one of the first signs of organic mercurial4 toxicity.5 Less renal toxicity for methyl mercury. 6 Greater renal toxicity for ethyl mercury. There was7 little difference in the neurotoxicity of methyl8 mercury and ethyl mercury on the dorsal root ganglia9 or coordination disorders according to Magos, and the10 same thing was true in the methyl mercury column.11 Toxicokinetics. Different than ethyl 12 mercury in normal children or infant monkeys. Methyl13 is different than ethyl. In the ethyl mercury column14 toxicokinetics are different than methyl mercury in15 normal children or infant monkeys.16 The brain inorganic mercury level is lower 17 and persistent. The main thing is it's lower from18 methyl mercury. Methyl mercury doesn't stay in the19 brain long enough to get as much inorganic mercuric20 mercury. The brain inorganic mercury level is higher21 and persistent for ethyl mercury. It probably is22 because ethyl mercury is converted much more rapidly23 to inorganic mercury in the brain than is methyl24 mercury.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 211 of 288211 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Brain organic mercury level is higher, but 1 temporary. Brain organic levels for ethyl mercury is2 lower, but temporary. Frequency of human cells with3 chromosome aberrations. Not significant for methyl4 mercury. They are significant for ethyl mercury.5 Oral exposure versus IM exposure. Methyl 6 mercury can cause cerebral palsy and mental7 retardation. It can cause autism. Ethyl mercury can8 cause autism. Methyl mercury crosses the blood-brain9 barrier using the methionine carrier protein, and the10 ethyl mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier by11 diffusion and/or other means.12 Q Okay. Let's go on now to a brief discussion 13 of how all this relates to biology and autism.14 A All right. 15 MR. WILLIAMS: Go on to Slide 73, Scott. 16 THE WITNESS: Okay. This is a slide from 17 Dr. Swedo from the NIMH. I like this slide. I like18 colorful things anyway.19 Idiopathic means we don't know, so although 20 we have a small number of cases of autism that we know21 have a genetic defect and we have a small number that22 are teratogens, let me just say for the Court a23 teratogen in the dictionary will say a teratogen24 chemical causes monster formation or abnormal25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 212 of 288212 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888childbirth.1 Teratogens have an effect in utero. By 2 definition, they only affect an embryo once the egg3 has been implanted, whereas a mutagen reacts with the4 DNA and can occur before implantation. So teratogens5 have their action in utero.6 The next slide? The pathogenesis of autism, 7 again from Dr. Swedo. We have a genetic defect which8 will cause a neuronal dysfunction and damage and will9 give autism. Now, each one of these colored ellipses10 I guess just have a few words in them, but there's a11 tremendous amount of work to be done in elaborating12 each one.13 The next slide, please? This is a plausible 14 pathway for ethyl mercury toxicity. It's built on one15 that we showed in the Cedillo trial, but we've changed 16 it to some extent here.17 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 18 Q I think the changed one is 76. 19 A Yes, I think you're right. 20 Q I think this is the one from Cedillo . 21 A Yes. Let's go to 76 then. This one was 22 supposed to be -- here we are.23 So here we have thimerosal, ethyl mercury. 24 This ethyl mercury will be converted to mercuric25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 213 of 288213 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mercury in the brain. That can cause1 neuroinflammation. It can have an effect on2 developmental windows of various organs in the body in3 the child. You have neuroinflammation going on to4 encephalopathy and regressive autism.5 We bring in hypersusceptibility here as we 6 pointed out or will point out in I think a subsequent7 slide, the Woods study that shows at least 15 percent8 of the population handles porphyrins or mercury has an9 effect in changing the porphyrin and10 porphyrin metabolism.11 Next slide? Okay. What's important here? 12 We know there's a brain growth phenotype in ASD, and13 inflammatory response has also been described in other14 parts of the brain. We have the decreased cellular15 Purkinje neurons and cerebral cortex changes that have16 been reported by many investigators.17 Next slide? 18 Q Now, the next slide is one of the autopsy 19 studies --20 A Yes. 21 Q -- on autistic children, correct? 22 A Yes. This came out again this year, 2008, 23 and it points out again that there's an increased24 density of glial cells for autistic children. There25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 214 of 288214 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888is a decreased neuronal density, and then there are1 various signs of oxidative stress which can be shown2 by doing various tests. There were also differences3 in some glial cells.4 As the Special Master said, you can go on to 5 read this later. Next slide, please?6 Q Well, let me stop you. 7 A Yes? 8 Q Go back to the bottom point here, Area 22. 9 This paper was selecting areas of the brain that they10 suspected would be involved in some of the aspects of11 autism, right?12 A Yes. 13 Q And in Area 22 what did they find? 14 A They found the greatest increase in glial 15 cells, the greatest neuronal decrease and the greatest16 increase of nonspecific cells containing lipofuscin,17 which is an indication of oxidative stress.18 Q What is lipofuscin? 19 A It's a complex I want to say fat protein. I 20 don't remember exactly what it is, but I remember I21 have it in my notes.22 Q Okay. We can ask Dr. Kinsbourne. And then 23 briefly we refer to the Vargas paper, which I'm sure24 was discussed in Cedillo . That's another autopsy 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 215 of 288215 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888study of autistic children.1 A Yes. Their findings indicate that innate 2 neuroimmune reactions play a pathogenic role in an3 undefined proportion of autistic patients.4 Q Innate neuroimmune reactions. They're 5 referring there to the glial cells, aren't they?6 A Yes. Yes, they are. 7 Q In the brain? 8 A In the brain. 9 Q Okay. Now let's go to the next slide. 10 A This might be of interest to the Special 11 Masters. It was certainly of interest to me. It12 doesn't have anything to do with autism, but it shows13 you what can happen with mercury and how it can14 surprise clinicians if clinicians keep their mind open15 and look for causes or differences in various16 pathological conditions.17 They are studying idiopathic dilated 18 cardiomyopathy, and they've studied the amount of19 mercury and other metals. In controls, the mercury20 was eight nanograms per gram. In people with this21 disorder there was 178,400 micrograms, so that's22 almost 20,000 times more in these IDCM.23 So this indicates that mercury can 24 concentrate in specific tissues or organs of the body,25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 216 of 288216 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888even if mercury blood levels are found to be in the1 normal range. This is a very interesting paper2 because a lot of people missed it.3 There's a tremendous amount of mercury. I 4 mean, that's roughly 178 micrograms of mercury in this5 heart tissue that they found, and this will be of6 importance later on when we talk about mercury efflux7 disorders, but here is certainly a case where these8 people or this person -- I've forgotten what it was --9 could not get mercury out of their heart cells. No10 question about it. One hundred and seventy-eight11 micrograms compared to a control of .008 micrograms.12 Next slide, please? 13 Q Okay. Now, you refer to a mercury efflux 14 disorder. What do you mean by a mercury efflux15 disorder?16 A One cause of autism is the cells cannot 17 efflux mercury. That is, there is no mechanism for18 getting mercury out of the cell. The normal mechanism19 by which mercury gets out of the cell usually is that20 it ties up the glutathione, and the glutathione21 mercury complex moves out of the cell.22 Q All right. 23 A In the mercury efflux disorder, it implies 24 that there's mercury in the cell and it can't get out25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 217 of 288217 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of the cell so the mercury concentrations in the cells1 increase.2 I'd like to give the evidence for this. The 3 next slide, please?4 Q Now, you discussed Wilson's disease at some 5 length in the Cedillo trial, didn't you, as an 6 example?7 A I don't remember, to be actually honest with 8 you. I thought we did not, but I know we discussed9 it.10 Q Well, quickly, Wilson's disease is an 11 example of another metal efflux disorder, correct?12 A Yes. I'll make it very short. In Wilson's 13 disease, copper cannot leave certain cells, and the14 copper accumulates in the cells and it becomes very15 toxic to the cell.16 Until John Walsh, a neurologist at Cambridge 17 in England, thought about using chelating agent people18 with Wilson's disease would die very, very early in19 life, but because of John Walsh and other people20 subsequently who used the penicillamine and other21 chelating agents to get the copper out of their22 tissue, this at the time and still is one of the few23 genetic diseases that is treatable. These people now24 live to at least 40 or 45 years of age.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 218 of 288218 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888I wanted to tell you that there is another 1 good example of an efflux disease, well documented in2 the literature, called Wilson's disease or3 hepatolenticular degeneration.4 I think you can skip the next. Keep going. 5 Okay.6 MR. WILLIAMS: We've been going almost two 7 hours here without a break.8 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Do you want to 9 take a break?10 MR. WILLIAMS: Yes. I probably have about 11 20 more minutes, I think, 20 or 25 minutes to go.12 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Okay. Let's take 13 a 15 minute break. We'll be back at 4:00.14 (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) 15 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. We're 16 back on the record for the additional direct17 examination of Dr. Aposhian. Dr. Aposhian, you're18 still under oath.19 Mr. Williams, please go ahead when you're 20 ready.21 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 22 Q While we're waiting for the slide man to get 23 here, let me ask you. In this next section of your24 testimony we're going to cover some examples of ways25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 219 of 288219 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888in which autistic children process mercury different1 than normal children, right?2 A Yes. 3 Q Okay. And is that what you call your 4 evidence for a mercury efflux disorder?5 A Yes. 6 Q Okay. The first example is hair? 7 A Yes. 8 MR. WILLIAMS: The next slide, Scott? 9 THE WITNESS: Oh, here we are. This is a 10 study done by Holmes, Blaxill and Haley. Haley is11 head of chemistry at University of Kentucky or was at12 the time the study was done.13 Amy Holmes, a private practitioner who 14 treated autistic children, and she knew the questions15 about mercury that were unanswered as far as autistic16 children, and she knew about mercury in hair, and she17 remembered that most parents keep the samples of first18 haircuts of the child, so she convinced them and19 control people to bring in the baby haircuts.20 The next slide will show the results. The 21 autistic group, and this is now Mercury Levels in22 First Baby Haircuts. The autistic group was 0.47. 23 The control group was 3.63. Now, this study has been24 criticized because the control group, 3.63, is too25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 220 of 288220 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888high as compared to the normal population.1 One thing one must remember is to get 2 controls for autistics is a very difficult job for all3 people interested in autism research. You can always4 get autistic kids, whether it's hair or some other5 way, but to try to get age matched and sex matched6 samples is extremely difficult. But even if we look,7 if we forget the 3.63 and say that what the normal8 population is is usually about 1.0, you still have9 twice as much mercury in the hair of controlled10 children.11 In addition to this -- now, this was done to 12 atomic absorption -- the next slide I think will show13 the results of the MIT group where they used neutron14 activation analysis, a different kind of technique for15 measuring hair mercury. This also is an abstract of a16 paper given at the American Nuclear Society.17 Now, most societies peer review abstracts. 18 Whether this was done here I don't know.19 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 20 Q Well, let me just ask you though. We've got 21 two studies on the hair of autistic children compared22 to controls. What did they find? Were they23 consistent with each other?24 A Yes, they were consistent, both groups, 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 221 of 288221 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888although the second one was a smaller sample. They1 both found that autistic children had less mercury in2 their hair than their control or so-called normal3 children.4 Q And from a toxicology points of view, what's 5 the significance of that difference?6 A The significance is that there is less 7 mercury in these cases in the blood and therefore8 probably more mercury in the cells; that the mercury9 cannot get out of the cells.10 The work of James also shows that autistic 11 children have glutathione concentrations in their12 blood, and this also means that there would be less13 glutathione in the cell to bring out the mercury.14 Q Is this evidence that autistic children tend 15 to retain mercury compared to controls?16 A This is one kind of evidence that can be 17 interpreted as meaning that autistic children have18 more mercury in their cells than nonautistic children.19 Q Okay. Now, the next example you were going 20 to talk about was the Ip and DeSoto study again. 21 We've already talked about that.22 A Yes. I just want to bring your attention to 23 the last sentence. Let me just read it: Moreover,24 the hair sample analysis results offer some support25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 222 of 288222 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888for the idea that persons with autism may be less1 efficient and more variable at eliminating mercury2 from the blood.3 Q Okay. We had talked about Ip with respect 4 to blood levels before. We're now talking about the5 Ip study on hair levels, right?6 A Yes. 7 Q And it was also consistent with the Holmes 8 and the MIT study. Okay.9 And then there's another example of 10 chelation therapy if we go to Slide 89.11 A Yes. 12 Q Now, explain quickly what chelation is. 13 A Sure. 14 Q You've had some experience with chelation? 15 A Yes. Metals, as I've told you earlier, are 16 bound to proteins and other substances in the body. 17 They're not floating around free. So in order to get18 rid of metals you want to put something in the body19 that's going to have a greater affinity for that metal20 than the ligand or the protein that's holding onto the21 metal in the body.22 And so by giving a chelating agent, if it's 23 the right chelating agent it will have a greater24 affinity for that metal or the metal will have a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 223 of 288223 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888greater affinity for it than for the ligand or the1 protein to which it is attached in the body.2 The term chelate comes from the Greek word 3 chelos or claw, and essentially a chelating agent4 forms a five membered ring, a claw if you will, with5 the metal and makes that metal more water soluble. 6 Since it becomes more water soluble it is excreted7 much more quickly and in larger amounts than if no8 chelating agent was given.9 Q Okay. And this study by Bradstreet and 10 others was a study of chelation in autistic children?11 A Yes. What they did was give DMSA. We're 12 involved in the FDA approval of this. DMSA was used13 originally. The FDA approval is for children with14 lead levels of 45 micrograms or greater per deciliter15 of blood, and DMSA is given to get the lead out of the16 body. It also can be used for off-label studies as we17 say because its safety has been proven. DMSA will18 also mobilize mercury and bring mercury out of the19 body in the same way.20 What Bradstreet did was to give DMSA, this 21 water soluble chelating agent, to autistic children22 and control children and, depending on which figure23 you look at or which table you look at, you find a24 very definite increase, anywhere from a three to25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 224 of 288224 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888eightfold increase in mercury excretion when the1 autistic children were given DMSA chelating agent2 versus the control children. This is an indication3 that there was more mercury coming out.4 Now, let me again say this study has also 5 been criticized. All these studies have been6 criticized. There are very few studies in science7 that we cannot criticize. One of the exercises in8 most graduate schools is to give a student a paper and9 say we want you to report what's good and what's bad10 about this. These are peer reviewed studies.11 You can always find something wrong with a 12 study. This one has been criticized because they said13 the number of controls was too small. They also said14 there was bias in picking the controls, but the fact15 remains the paper appeared in a peer reviewed journal. 16 The fact remains it's been reported many times, both17 personally at meetings and in the literature, that18 DMSA does increase the mercury excretion as compared19 to controls.20 Q And is the result here consistent with the 21 hair studies we talked about?22 A Yes, it is. It's consistent with a greater 23 body burden, a greater amount of mercury in the cells.24 Q All right. Then let's skip to Slide 92, 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 225 of 288225 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888please. What is this study?1 A Okay. This is an unpublished study from our 2 laboratory. We just haven't had time to publish it.3 We have for most of the cases 16 autistic 4 children with 22 controls about the same ages. For5 mercury in particular we had 14. There are some6 urines that just got lost in the shuffle, or there7 were some contaminated urines that were not used. For8 autistic children there are 14 for mercury studies. 9 There are 14 children and 22 controls.10 The equipment that we use, the latest 11 equipment there is available, simultaneously12 determines within 10 minutes all of these metals on13 one urine sample, so we don't have all the14 manipulation errors that many people have that are15 doing atomic absorption where they do one metal at a16 time.17 What we notice here is that the only 18 significant difference between autistic children and19 control children is the mercury excretion. Here we20 have P less than 0.03. There's another slide which I21 forgot to bring with me that shows even a greater22 difference with mercury, but there certainly is less23 mercury coming out of children, autistic children, who24 are not given chelating agents than normal children.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 226 of 288226 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q So again is this consistent now with the 1 hair study and the Ip blood study?2 A It's what we would expect, yes. We were 3 very excited to find this result. This has been4 presented at a number --5 Q We have seen five or six studies -- 6 A Pardon? 7 Q -- which show that autistic children seem to 8 retain more mercury than nonautistic children.9 A Yes. Yes. 10 Q Again, we talked about DeSoto, but there is 11 one quote from DeSoto I think you wanted to show on12 Slide 93. Do you see the underlined part?13 A Yes. In the DeSoto paper, just let me read 14 the last part of it. Under Figure 1, they point out15 the variability found in circulating levels of mercury16 in hair, so kids are different. There's a wide17 spread.18 Also, what is underlined. This is 19 consistent with the idea that autism may be partly20 related to a lesser ability to rid the body of21 neurotoxins such as mercury, so again this fits.22 If I can have the next slide, which I think 23 is the baby teeth? Yes. No. This is another one.24 Q Yes. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 227 of 288227 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A This we've talked about already, I think. 1 Q We've talked about that one. 2 A Yes. 3 Q Let's go on to the next one. 4 A Yes. I think we skipped the baby teeth, 5 which must have been two or three back there. Adams.6 Essentially this paper shows --7 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Now what are you 8 talking about, Doctor? Which slide?9 THE WITNESS: Pardon? 10 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Which slide are we 11 on, or what are you talking about?12 THE WITNESS: We're now on Slide -- 13 MR. WILLIAMS: This is Slide 95, Special 14 Master.15 THE WITNESS: Yes. 16 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 17 Q This slide is a study of the difference 18 between boys and girls in the way they retain mercury?19 A Yes. What they're measuring here is the 20 amount of mercury excreted in the urine over a period21 of time with children.22 The black spots, these children have 23 amalgams in their mouth. The white spots or open24 circles, these children have composites used for25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 228 of 288228 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888dental fillings rather than mercury.1 Q The amalgams have mercury? 2 A The amalgams are mercury fillings. 3 Q And we know that mercury vapor comes off 4 amalgams.5 A It's well accepted even by the American 6 Dental Association that mercury is emitted from these7 amalgams.8 Q And does this study first show that both 9 types of kids, boys and girls, if they had amalgams10 did they have more mercury coming out or less mercury?11 A What it shows is if they had amalgams in 12 both cases more mercury was being excreted than if13 they had composites, number one.14 Q Okay. 15 A Number two, more importantly, if you look at 16 the red arrows it shows that by the seventh year the17 boys are excreting less mercury than the girls are,18 which is an indication that the boys are retaining19 more mercury than the girls are.20 That's what the interpretation of the 21 authors is. Boys retain mercury more than girls by22 not excreting as much of the mercury.23 Q Okay. Now, I think you're right that the 24 slide about the tooth study somehow got dropped out of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 229 of 288229 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888here, but why don't you just briefly describe the1 tooth study to the Special Masters?2 A The study by Adams. We know from the work 3 of Needleman, who used baby teeth as an indicator of4 biomarker for lead, so Adams thought he would look at5 baby teeth to use as an indication of mercury.6 The amount of mercury or metal in the teeth 7 is a reflection of how much is in the body at one time8 or another. Adams found that the mercury in the teeth9 of autistic children was at least twice as much as the10 mercury in the teeth of nonautistic children, again11 indicating that these children, these autistic12 children, have more mercury in their tissues and in13 this case in their teeth, which are certainly14 considered to be a tissue or an organ.15 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Just for the 16 record, I think there's a Slide No. 90 that refers to17 Adams, as Special Master Campbell-Smith just pointed18 out to me.19 MR. WILLIAMS: I knew it was in his report. 20 THE WITNESS: Can we go back, Scott, to 90? 21 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: I think you just 22 described it.23 MR. WILLIAMS: Slide 90 does discuss the 24 teeth though. You're right. Thank you for pointing25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 230 of 288230 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888that out.1 THE WITNESS: Because that study again has 2 been criticized, the tooth study. As they say when3 you go to meetings, it hasn't been confirmed. That4 doesn't mean someone tried to confirm it. It means5 that no one tried to do the exact experiment.6 In one of these studies we cite, the editor 7 of that journal, the Journal of Child Neurology , made 8 a big point of saying that people don't get glory by9 trying to repeat other people's studies, and the NIH,10 National Institutes Health, of our government does not11 give money to investigators to repeat other people's12 studies.13 And so the idea that the Adams work should 14 be minimized because it has not been repeated is just15 pure propaganda. It doesn't belong in scientific16 argument.17 BY MR. WILLIAMS: 18 Q Okay. Now one more. Let's go to Slide 97, 19 please. I'll ask this question. Have there been some20 studies that have now identified at least one genetic21 marker of susceptibility to this mercury efflux22 problem?23 A Yes. Woods from Seattle and his associates 24 have shown genetic polymorphism of the coproporphyrin25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 231 of 288231 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888gene -- actually the oxidase gene -- and has shown1 that 15 percent of the population, of the dental2 population in this case, have a different reaction to3 mercury than do the rest of the dental population.4 This finding represents the first report of 5 a polymorphism. In other words, something has been6 changed in the gene that modifies the effect of7 mercury on a biological process, and they are now8 proposing that this be used for a biomarker of mercury9 exposure. It's a very readily testable phenomenon.10 Q And is it your opinion that in the children 11 that we've seen that have more mercury in their blood,12 less mercury in their hair, more mercury in their13 teeth, do they probably have genetic differences from14 the others too?15 A I think there's no question. Most people 16 would say they must have genetic differences to have17 those kinds of results.18 Q Okay. Let's go to your second hypothesis 19 quickly about Terbutaline. That's on Slide 98, if you20 would.21 A Terbutaline is an example of a teratogen 22 that can cause some types of autism via a23 neuroinflammation mechanism.24 Q Okay. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 232 of 288232 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A The next slide points out that Terbutaline 1 has been a drug that has been used in the clinic to2 arrest preterm labor in women. We're not talking3 about animals now. We're talking about pregnant4 women.5 It has been shown that the critical period 6 corresponds to the second and third trimester in the7 human fetus. The human fetus is exposed to8 Terbutaline, and if there is a predisposition to9 having the damage there's a greater chance that the10 child will have autism. It causes decomposition of11 central nervous function like that reported in autism.12 Q Okay. I showed in the opening statement an 13 animal model of this Terbutaline toxicity, and Slide14 101 I think has that paper on it.15 A Yes. 16 Q If you would go to that? 17 A Yes. Results from animals can be used to 18 trigger studies of human populations for exposure and19 outcomes, and there is a paper by Zeratte I think from20 the Hopkins group, if I remember correctly.21 Results are overstimulation of the 22 adenoreceptor during an early critical period. 23 Results are microglial activation associated with24 innate neuroinflammatory pathways and Page 233 of 288233 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888abnormalities similar to what is seen in autism.1 Q When it says similar to what is seen in 2 autism it's referring to those autopsy children of3 autistic children?4 A Yes. Yes. 5 Q The Vargas paper and the Lopez-Hurtado paper 6 and so forth?7 A Yes. Yes, sir. 8 Q And then is this microglial activation the 9 same thing that happened to the adult monkeys in the10 adult monkey study --11 A Yes. 12 Q -- with the inorganic mercury in their 13 brain?14 A Yes. Inorganic mercury did cause that. 15 Q Okay. Let's go quickly to your summary 16 slide on 106, please, and summarize your opinions here17 if you would.18 A I don't think it's necessary to repeat the 19 first one --20 Q Okay. 21 A -- because we don't know about species of 22 mercury, but I think it's necessary to speak about the23 Carvalho, et al. study, in particular the remarkable24 potency of the mercury compounds to bind the selenol-25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 234 of 288234 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888thiols in the active site, and thioredoxin reductase1 should be a major molecular mechanism of mercury2 toxicity.3 The first hypothesis: One cause of autism 4 is that cells cannot efflux mercury, including5 thimerosal, and the DeSoto paper goes on to confirm6 that. That is a rebuttal of the Ip paper.7 The second hypothesis: Terbutaline is an 8 example of a teratogen that causes some type of autism9 via a neuroinflammation mechanism. Again, the Zeratte10 and other papers show that the behavior of11 abnormalities after Terbutaline are similar to autism.12 In my opinion, based on 55 years' experience 13 of being an independent biomedical research14 investigator funded by the federal government and15 private foundations, the first and second hypotheses16 are scientifically reasonable and probable.17 Q Now let me ask you this question. Do you 18 have an opinion as to whether or not injections of19 thimerosal in vaccines in human infants would deposit20 measurable amounts of inorganic mercury in the brains21 of those kids?22 A What would happen would be the thimerosal 23 would be broken down to ethyl mercury. The ethyl24 mercury would cross the blood-brain barrier, and in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 235 of 288235 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888the brain that ethyl mercury would be de-ethylated to1 give inorganic mercury or mercuric mercury which would2 stay in the brain.3 Q Just as it did in the infant monkeys? Is 4 that right?5 A The infant monkey study, certainly a whole 6 batch of them, including the most recent -- I think7 2005 -- Burbacher paper.8 Q And do you hold that opinion to a reasonable 9 medical scientific probability?10 A Yes, I do. 11 MR. WILLIAMS: Thank you very much. That's 12 all I have.13 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. Do any 14 of you have questions for Dr. Aposhian at this point?15 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Not at this point, 16 no.17 SPECIAL MASTER CAMPBELL-SMITH: Not at this 18 point.19 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. Let me 20 ask one question, Dr. Aposhian, before we go on and21 see what the Respondent wants to do at this point.22 Now, you filed an expert report with us back 23 on August 30 of last year. I don't know if you recall24 preparing that.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 236 of 288236 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888THE WITNESS: I remember preparing it and 1 having a very short period of time to prepare it2 because someone dropped out because of cancer.3 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. A 4 number of the articles that you talked about today5 were included in here?6 THE WITNESS: Some of them were. Some of 7 them of course have been published since then.8 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Right. Of course, 9 articles that have been published since you wrote this10 report couldn't very well be in this report. I11 understand that.12 In general, did you put in all the articles 13 that you at the time thought were important to the14 issue?15 THE WITNESS: At that time I wrote that 16 article I put in the papers that I thought at that17 time were important.18 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. 19 THE WITNESS: I really haven't kept track, 20 but it's sort of like preparing a lecture or at a21 symposia. You never finalize it until the minute22 before you walk in and give it, and so there are23 always changes to be made, especially over the last24 almost year. I'm sure there are papers.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 237 of 288237 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888If the question is are there papers here 1 that are quoted that were not quoted in the initial2 report, the answer is yes.3 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Tell me why. I 4 mean, obviously aside from the obvious ones that were5 published since then.6 THE WITNESS: Yes. Let's see. I don't know 7 how to put this without making it personal.8 I've had two members of my family seriously 9 ill. When I was asked to participate in writing that10 report they were not ill. Shortly thereafter they11 became ill, and I had I think a month from the time12 that I think it was Dr. Lusier who dropped out because13 he had cancer, so I had a very limited time to prepare14 that report, whereas I had much more time to prepare15 this talk. Does that answer your question, sir?16 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Based on Special 17 Master Hastings' questions, I have a couple follow-up18 questions, Dr. Aposhian.19 Were you ever asked to prepare a 20 supplemental report; that is, a rebuttal report?21 THE WITNESS: I don't think so. I didn't 22 see the Respondent's reports until maybe a month ago. 23 I don't remember the exact timing, but I certainly was24 not asked to prepare a rebuttal, and there's nothing25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 238 of 288238 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888in here that I can think of except -- well, actually1 the rebuttal about this poison determined the dose, if2 anything that was rebuttal to what was brought up in3 the Cedillo trial. 4 I must actually state that -- how should I 5 put it -- I certainly would like more time to read the6 Respondent's reports. To my knowledge, I did not7 prepare any kind of rebuttal to the present8 Respondent's reports, to the best of my knowledge.9 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: So you were not 10 aware that there was a March deadline or early April11 deadline to file rebuttal reports?12 THE WITNESS: I don't know. I honestly 13 don't know. You can't imagine what it's like to have14 two people in your family seriously ill.15 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Oh, yes, I can, Dr. 16 Aposhian.17 THE WITNESS: Okay. We don't believe in 18 health care providers. We think the family should19 take care of their own, and so I just don't remember20 the timing. I'm sorry. But I know no one asked me to21 prepare a rebuttal.22 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: Well, let me phrase 23 it this way then.24 Your slides are dated 5-12-08 at least on 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 239 of 288239 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Petitioners' Trial Exhibit 2. Is that when these1 slides were prepared?2 THE WITNESS: Excuse me? 3 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: These slides, 4 Petitioners' --5 THE WITNESS: Yes. These slides, they were 6 prepared yesterday. Honestly.7 When did I begin? This is May. I think I 8 was told in April or the end of February when the date9 of this trial was set and so it would be my normal10 inclination in any talk that I was preparing to give11 anywhere that I would try to bring it up to date and12 try to improve to the best of my ability to give the13 best talk that was most relevant.14 SPECIAL MASTER VOWELL: I have nothing 15 further.16 THE WITNESS: Have I done something wrong? 17 I'm not sure.18 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: No. I think 19 you've answered our questions.20 THE WITNESS: Okay. 21 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Mr. Matanoski, how 22 do you propose to proceed at this point?23 Obviously Dr. Aposhian did cover some of the 24 topics that were covered in his expert report and some25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 240 of 288240 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888topics that weren't covered in his expert report. Do1 you want to cross him on the topics that he did cover? 2 How do you propose that we proceed at this point?3 MR. MATANOSKI: We have about two and a half 4 hours of cross-examination based on his expert report. 5 It seems that some of the testimony we didn't get6 today was matters that were in his expert report. I'm7 not sure how much of that --8 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Do speak up. 9 MR. MATANOSKI: I'm sorry. I'm having the 10 same problem with my voice that you are, sir.11 I believe we probably would still be at 12 about two and a half hours to cover some of the topics13 that he covered today which were covered in his expert14 report.15 Then there are some new questions that have 16 suggested themselves obviously based on things that17 he's covered today, although as I mentioned in our18 bench discussion they may be the subject of further19 proceedings or motions I should say after this trial20 or during this trial.21 So we could go ahead and forge ahead with 22 what we have, which would be about two and a half23 hours. We're prepared to do so, sir.24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Why don't we make 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 241 of 288241 APOSHIAN - DIRECT Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888some use of our time? Why don't we begin your cross-1 examination?2 MR. MATANOSKI: Very well, sir. Could we 3 then have a brief break for Ms. Renzi, who will be4 doing it, to get her notes together? I mean brief,5 sir.6 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. How 7 much time do you need?8 MR. MATANOSKI: Ten minutes, sir. 9 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. 10 MR. MATANOSKI: Thank you. 11 (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) 12 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Good afternoon 13 again. Please be seated.14 To those listening at home, we're again back 15 for the last segment of our proceedings this16 afternoon. Dr. Aposhian is still on the witness17 stand.18 Let me mention a couple things before we 19 start with Ms. Renzi's questions here. First, that we20 thought it would be a good idea, given we have two21 witnesses scheduled for tomorrow, that we would get22 some of Dr. Aposhian's cross in today.23 If you have a logical breaking point at some 24 point before 6:00 I think we don't want to go past25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 242 of 288242 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-48886:00 today. If you have a logical breaking point at1 some point prior to that, Ms. Renzi, let us know. 2 Maybe we'll stop at that point.3 The other point being just to say for the 4 record that as Mr. Matanoski mentioned earlier, we did5 have a conference at the bench earlier today. As he6 alluded to, at that point there was raised a motion7 that was filed in the King case and perhaps in the 8 Mead case too, but it's relevant to both. 9 It was filed on Friday afternoon 10 electronically having to do with a reference to a11 number of medical articles, over 200 medical articles,12 that were filed last week that were new to the case13 filed by the Petitioners, cited by them, that were not14 previously discussed in expert reports of either side15 and raising that issue, the issue of what to do about16 that and asking that the Petitioners be prevented from17 making reference to these articles in their own expert18 direct examination.19 The representation had been last week at a 20 status conference that the purpose of filing these21 articles was to make them available for cross-22 examination of the Respondent's experts.23 Mr. Matanoski did mention that some of those 24 articles had been raised today in the examination of25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 243 of 288243 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Dr. Aposhian and perhaps in Dr. Greenland as well, in1 the direct examination of him, and that the government2 was considering filing an additional motion seeking3 additional relief here.4 Again, we note that we will hear that motion 5 whenever you want to present it, or you can file it in6 writing. We'll wait to hear exactly what you have in7 mind, but obviously a couple of our questions to Dr.8 Aposhian were addressed to that issue. We'll wait for9 what the government proposes to do about that issue10 explicitly at this point.11 What that, Ms. Renzi, whatever questions you 12 had for Dr. Aposhian this afternoon, go ahead and go13 for it at this point.14 MS. RENZI: Thank you, Special Master. 15 CROSS-EXAMINATION 16 BY MS. RENZI: 17 Q Good afternoon. 18 A Good afternoon. 19 Q Dr. Aposhian, you said you were currently a 20 professor at the University of Arizona?21 A I'm professor emeritus. I retired on 22 January 31 to take care of my wife and other people in23 my family, but I still have an active laboratory with24 funding for research for two more years.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 244 of 288244 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Do you know if you're listed on the 1 University of Arizona website as a faculty member or a2 professor emeritus?3 A Excuse me? 4 Q Do you know if you're listed on the 5 University of Arizona website as either a member of6 faculty or as a --7 A I don't have the faintest idea. I don't 8 read that sort of stuff, but I do have letters that I9 can send you from the president of the university and10 from the medical school people saying that I have11 emeritus status. I would never dare say anything that12 was not so.13 Q Okay. Are you listed as a professor at the 14 Pharmacology School of Medicine? Do you know that? 15 Do you have emeritus status there as well?16 A For the last 32 years I've been listed in 17 the catalog of the medical school as Professor of18 Pharmacology.19 Q Do you know Glen Sipes, the chair of the 20 Pharmacology Department at the University of Arizona?21 A Excuse me? 22 Q Glen Sipes. Do you know Glen Sipes? 23 A Yes. I know Glen Sipes very well. 24 Q Is he a well-respected toxicologist? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 245 of 288245 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Of course he's a well-respected 1 toxicologist.2 Q And do you know a man, John Sullivan, at the 3 University of Arizona?4 A I don't know him personally. I know of his 5 reputation. He's a very good clinical toxicologist.6 Some people use the term medical 7 toxicologist, but I think the board, and again you can8 correct me. I think the board uses the term clinical9 toxicologist.10 DR. JEFFREY BRENT (From the gallery): The 11 board uses the term medical toxicologist.12 THE WITNESS: It changed then. Okay. 13 Because two of the members at the University of14 Colorado spent time in my laboratory, and one of them15 took time off to study for her board exams in clinical16 toxicology.17 BY MS. RENZI: 18 Q Now, you're not a medical doctor. Is that 19 correct?20 A That's absolutely correct. 21 Q And you're not a medical toxicologist. Is 22 that correct?23 A It depends on how you define the term 24 medical toxicologist. I was brought in by the Chinese25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 246 of 288246 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Government. I was brought in by the Chilean1 Government. I was brought in by the Inner Mongolian2 Government as a pro bono consultant to deal with a3 population of people who were drinking water with4 elevated levels of arsenic.5 Q But you don't have -- 6 A Excuse me. Let me continue. 7 Q Okay. 8 A And so I took a team with me, and I was the 9 person responsible for everything. I was the person10 that wrote up the reports. I dealt with humans.11 Now, am I a medical toxicologist? I don't 12 like the term. I'm a toxicologist.13 Q But you don't have a medical degree to be 14 called a medical toxicologist?15 A I have no medical degrees, as I've told you 16 before.17 Q That means you're also not a neurologist. I 18 that correct?19 A Pardon me? 20 Q You're not a neurologist? 21 A Obviously I can't be a neurologist when I 22 don't have an M.D.23 Q Do you consider yourself qualified to 24 comment on the neurological aspects of autism?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 247 of 288247 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A It all depends on what parts of the 1 neurological aspects you're talking about, but I would2 certainly take second place. I would prefer that a3 medical neurologist answer such questions.4 Q Are you an immunologist? 5 A I'm not an immunologist. 6 Q Do you consider yourself qualified to opine 7 on the immunology as it relates to autism?8 A Again, it depends at what level you're 9 speaking of. If you want me to go into the very fine10 levels of immunology as far as applying to humans, I11 would certainly not want to speak that way.12 I am a basic science bench investigator. I 13 work at the lab bench, and I go study populations of14 people at the invitation of governments throughout the15 world.16 Q Have you ever published a peer reviewed 17 article on mercury in the immune system?18 A No, I have not. 19 Q Have you ever published a peer reviewed 20 article on autism?21 A We are now in the process of writing a 22 review article that we've been asked to write by an23 international journal as a toxicologist's view of24 autism. I expect the article will be finished25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 248 of 288248 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888sometime this summer.1 That was an invitation for the article. We 2 did not ask to do it. They invited us to do it. An3 invitation.4 Q Have you ever published a peer reviewed 5 article on thimerosal toxicity?6 A I don't remember whether some of our 7 abstracts -- I would say no.8 Q Have you ever published a peer reviewed 9 article on ethyl mercury toxicity?10 A On what? 11 Q Ethyl mercury toxicity. 12 A Not published, but we've given many talks at 13 symposium. The Institute of Medicine invited me. I14 actually did not want to go.15 They invited me in I think in was 2004 I 16 think it was to speak at one of their vaccine17 committee meetings on \"A Toxicologist's View of Autism18 and Thimerosal\".19 Q Do you consider yourself an expert in 20 autism?21 A I consider myself an expert on the 22 relationship of mercury to autism.23 Q And when did you acquire that expertise? 24 A When? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 249 of 288249 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Yes. 1 A Let me tell you the story. In I forget 2 whether it was 2002 or 2003 I had a call from the3 administrative assistant to Congressman Burton of the4 House Government Oversight & Regulation Committee. I5 think it's called that.6 At that time the administrative assistant -- 7 she actually -- asked me whether I would come and talk8 to the committee on mercury toxicity. I said9 certainly, but why are you interested in mercury10 toxicity? This was probably five years ago I would11 say. They said we're really interested in autism, and12 there's mercury involved. I said okay.13 I went home and decided I really didn't know 14 what autism was. I have two daughters who have PhDs15 in clinical psychology. I called them and I said what16 is autism? They in fact were delighted to know17 something that their father did not know and so I18 first learned about autism at that time.19 Since then there have been many 20 organizations like the Institutes of Medicine and21 other organizations that wanted someone who had more22 or less a fresh view of autism that was not part of23 any establishment as far as autism is concerned and so24 in the last five years I've become very interested in25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 250 of 288250 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888autism.1 Q Are you aware of the Diagnostic and 2 Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, otherwise3 known as the DSM-IV?4 A I'm aware of it. 5 Q What are the criterion for an autism 6 diagnosis?7 A I would certainly open up the book and read 8 them.9 Q You don't know them? 10 A There are regulations that I don't know. 11 That's some of them. I can talk about other12 regulations I don't know either. If it's something13 that you can find on the web or in a book there's no14 sense of memorizing, especially since you don't use it15 every day.16 What we were concerned about was all our 17 autistic subjects in our urine studies were classified18 by a physician by the usual standards that you've just19 mentioned and the other standards for autism.20 Q You've published several articles on 21 chelation. Is that correct?22 A I would say many people think my major 23 contributions since 1979 have dealt with chelation.24 Q Would you agree that you're not qualified to 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 251 of 288251 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888diagnose or treat a person with ethyl mercury1 toxicity?2 A I have never claimed I have been. 3 Q Would you agree that you're not qualified to 4 diagnose or treat a person with any form of mercury5 toxicity?6 A It all depends now on how you want to define 7 diagnosis. Very often a physician will call me and8 say Vas, we have this case here and the urine9 mercuries are this much. The blood mercuries are such10 and such. We've done a biopsy, as the case just11 happened now, of someone's gut and we want to know12 whether you think it's worth doing a mercury analysis13 or you think this person may have mercury toxicity.14 What I usually say, as they well know, is 15 John, Joe, whatever your name is, I'm not a physician,16 as you know, but based on what you've told me it seems17 to me that that person is mercury toxic.18 But would I stand up in a Court of law and 19 say hey, I'm an expert in diagnosing humans? No, I20 would not because if you're going to deal with humans21 on a diagnostic and treatment basis -- not a research22 basis, but a diagnostic and treatment basis -- then23 you should be an M.D.24 Q I want to move on to dose. You quoted today 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 252 of 288252 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888from Casarett & Doull, the book on toxicology,1 correct?2 A Yes. 3 Q Would you agree with the statement that's in 4 that book that no other metal better illustrates the5 diversity of effects caused by different chemical6 species than does mercury?7 A Are you asking me whether I agree with this? 8 Q Yes. 9 A I have no disagreement with it. 10 Q Would you agree that different species of 11 mercury have different toxicological properties?12 A I'm sorry? I didn't hear you. 13 Q Do different species of mercury have 14 different toxicological properties?15 A That was I think quite apparent from the 16 talk I gave or my testimony earlier.17 Q Could you please define dose for me? What 18 is dose?19 A Dose means different things to different 20 people. If you're a scientist and are concerned about21 dose then you'll want a quantitative value that tells22 you how much you are giving to a certain animal or23 human being.24 You want a quantitative value, and that 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 253 of 288253 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888quantitative value could be milligrams or grams. It1 could be milligrams per kilogram. It depends on who2 is prescribing, and I don't prescribe to humans, of3 course.4 Q Would you agree that any substance could be 5 toxic to humans based upon a dose?6 A The point I have tried to make in the 7 testimony is that dose is not the only criterion for8 toxicity; that many other criterion come into play9 when you discuss toxicity, and that was shown in at10 least two or three of my slides from the textbook that11 you have just quoted.12 Q What is the principle of dose response? 13 A Dose response usually means -- not all the 14 time -- that as you increase the dose you increase the15 response, or as you decrease the dose you decrease the16 response usually in a fairly straight line, but, as we17 know, especially in the case of arsenic toxicity that18 when you get down at lower levels it goes off the19 straight line.20 Q Is it still your opinion that the principle 21 that dose makes the poison is no longer accepted by22 the general toxicological community?23 A That's not what I said. It is one of the 24 factors that determines toxicity, but it is not for25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 254 of 288254 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888anyone to get up and say dose determines the poison. 1 It's a very limited way of looking at toxicology, a2 very limited way of looking at a poison.3 There are many factors in that very chapter 4 that you quoted with Goyer which I presented earlier5 and you have copies of various other things that6 affect the toxicity. It's not only dose that affects7 toxicity.8 Q So that principle is no longer accepted by 9 the general toxicological community? Is that what10 you're saying?11 A I don't consider it a principle. It's 12 something that man in 1400 or 1500 said, and anyone13 who thinks that toxicology has not progressed enough14 to change and have a different view about someone's15 statement in the year 1490 or whatever it is I think16 has a very limited outlook on medicine and science.17 Most of the people that I know, Sipes 18 included, would say dose is one of the factors that19 determines toxicity or determines poison. It's not20 the only factor.21 Q Would you agree that in toxicology a 22 threshold dose is expected before a particular outcome23 is observed?24 A Before? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 255 of 288255 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q That you would have a threshold dose before 1 a particular outcome is observed?2 A I don't know what kind of generalization 3 you're trying to make. I certainly know that response4 is related to dose, but dose is not the only thing5 that determines response. Is that clear?6 Q We'll move on. How much ethyl mercury is 7 there in a thimerosal-containing vaccine? How much8 ethyl mercury is there in a thimerosal-containing9 vaccine?10 A It depends on which vaccine it is. I think 11 in one case -- I can't remember which vaccine -- it's12 12.5 micrograms if I remember correctly. In the other13 case of a vaccine it's 25 micrograms.14 Q And I know you had this on your slide 15 presentation earlier. How many micrograms are there16 in a milligram?17 A There are a million micrograms in a -- I'm 18 sorry. There are 1,000 micrograms in a milligram. 19 Isn't that what it said?20 Q Yes. 21 A Okay. Thank you. 22 Q And how many micrograms are there in a gram? 23 A There should be a million micrograms in a 24 gram.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 256 of 288256 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Dr. Aposhian, is it scientifically valid to 1 compare the doses of ethyl mercury that are in a2 thimerosal-containing vaccine, and I'll use TCV from3 now on if that's okay.4 In a TCV, is it right to compare those 5 doses --6 A I don't like the term TCV. I don't like 7 abbreviations. Would you mind saying the whole thing? 8 We have computers now that can print things up very9 carefully, and I think it's much clearer if we don't10 use abbreviations, if you don't mind.11 Q If you would like me to say it, that would 12 be fine.13 A Thank you. I appreciate that very much. 14 Q I'll repeat the question then. Is it 15 scientifically valid to compare doses of ethyl mercury16 that are contained in a thimerosal-containing vaccine17 to the exposures of methyl mercury that occurred in18 Iraq and Minamata?19 A It all depends on what you mean by compare. 20 If you're saying do you want to see if each of them is21 toxic, yes. If you want to say is one more toxic than22 the other, I'm not sure you can do that, so I'd like23 to ask that you ask me if possible a more specific24 question.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 257 of 288257 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Can you compare the 12.5 micrograms that are 1 contained in a thimerosal-containing vaccine to the2 doses that were exposed to the people who ate the3 grain in Iraq and who consumed the fish in Minamata?4 A No question about it. I now understand your 5 question. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.6 Q Okay. 7 A My apologies. 8 Q No. That's my question. 9 A Okay. There is no comparison. The amount 10 that was used, the exposure in Iraq was much, much11 higher.12 We were talking in the talk I gave earlier 13 in I think it's the Rooney paper explained the14 differences between a chronic high dose and a chronic15 low dose. Certainly if you want to talk about chronic16 doses the exposure of children getting vaccines would17 be considered to be a chronic low dose whereas the18 Iraqi people being exposed to the various forms of19 mercury in the flour that the U.S. Government gave20 them, that would be considered a chronic high dose.21 Q Do you agree that the researchers in Iraq 22 and Minamata established a dose/response relationship23 in their studies?24 A I've got to be very careful here because the 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 258 of 288258 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Minamata studies are so old. My guess is yes, they1 did, but I just don't remember the particular paper2 with the particular dosage, but I'm sure Tom Clarkson,3 knowing how he works, did establish. I would suspect4 that Tom Clarkson did establish a dose/response curve5 in Iraq.6 Q Have you read the 1973 Bakir article, 7 B-A-K-I-R?8 A Which one? I've read all the Iraqi 9 articles, and some of the names I have difficulty10 remembering.11 Was that the one? There was one -- I'm not 12 sure whether Clarkson was the first author or he was13 -- which showed that depenicillamine was one of the14 best ways of getting rid of mercury in the blood. Is15 that the article you're talking about?16 Q I'm talking about an article that was filed 17 on Petitioners' Master List 178. We can hand you that18 article if you'd like to see it.19 A Yes, I would like to see that article, 20 please.21 (Pause.) 22 A This is a very old article. I'm not sure I 23 remember reading everything about it, but I do24 remember that when it came out I read it and maybe a25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 259 of 288259 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888couple times since then, but not recently.1 What would you like me to address in this 2 article?3 Q Do you recall the threshold dose of mercury 4 that was observed in Iraq before effects of toxicity5 were observed?6 A I don't recall at all. 7 Q I want to refer you then to page 238 of that 8 article.9 A Page 238. 10 Q Okay. I think it's the top center column. 11 We have it up on the screen as well.12 A Excuse me. You're talking about Figure 7? 13 Q I'm talking about the paragraph that's 14 highlighted. It should be on your screen, sir.15 A Oh, I'm sorry. 16 Q It says: Nevertheless, the threshold value 17 of 25 to 40 milligrams of mercury as computed for18 parasthesis agree remarkably well with the threshold19 figure of 30 milligrams of mercury computed by the20 Swedish expert committee from data on the Japanese21 epidemics.22 Would you agree then from that article that 23 there was a threshold value of 25 milligrams of methyl24 mercury?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 260 of 288260 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A I agree that nevertheless, the threshold 1 value of 25 milligrams of mercury was computed for2 parasthesia agrees remarkably well with the figure of3 30. Is that what you're asking me?4 Q Yes. 5 A I have no argument. 6 Q Now, the threshold value of 25 milligrams. 7 A Yes? 8 Q What is that equal to in micrograms? 9 A Twenty-five milligrams would be 25,000 10 micrograms.11 Q In either one of those epidemics, either in 12 Minamata or in Iraq, was there an increase of autism13 reported as an outcome of the affected populations?14 A No one even thought of autism in those days. 15 You should ask Tom Clarkson, who is a fantastically16 good scientist. People have asked him that, and his17 response is no one thought about autism in those days.18 I think most people did not know what autism 19 is. I think most medical students were not taught20 anything about autism, so it's not surprising that no21 autism cases turned up.22 Q Do you know if the clinical effects then 23 that were reported in either the Iraq or Minamata24 study resembled autism? Even if we didn't know what25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 261 of 288261 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888autism was, were any of the elicited effects1 clinically significant for the diagnosis of autism?2 A Well, as I remember, and again it's been a 3 long time since I looked at these studies, but as I4 remember there were cerebral palsy like effects that5 they found. You've read the article more recently6 than I have.7 There was certainly without any question 8 central nervous effects on young children and children9 that were born.10 Q Do these clinical effects resemble autism? 11 A Since I wasn't there and did not examine the 12 children or wasn't there when a physician examined13 them, I just don't feel comfortable answering that14 question one way or the other. I would be guessing at15 it.16 Q Could you clarify your opinion as it relates 17 to the thimerosal-containing vaccines we're discussing18 today? Does dose matter in these cases whether19 thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism?20 A Certainly when you consider that a child 21 over a short period of time relatively, it's possible22 for him or her to get 187 micrograms of mercury.23 That's a large dose for a child who has a 24 very low body weight so on a per kilogram basis my25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 262 of 288262 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888scientific assumption, based on the data I have so1 far, would be that those amounts of thimerosal could2 cause autism in some children.3 Q Do you have to get the entire 87.5 (sic)? 4 A Pardon? 5 Q Do you have to get the entire series of 6 shots, the 187.5 micrograms?7 A I don't know that. Again, it depends upon 8 the susceptibility of the child and the metabolism of9 the child as to how he or she handles that mercury.10 When you talk about dose determines the 11 poison as some other people would say, you could also12 have a child with a small dose or the large dose13 having the same effect.14 Q So let's assume that your hypothesis that we 15 have a genetically susceptible child is true. Could16 12.5 micrograms cause that child to have autism?17 A If we knew that we would be able to do 18 something, but that specific question in a specific19 child we don't know the answer to. All we know is20 there appears to be a relationship between the amount21 of mercury that children are exposed to via the22 vaccinations and whether they get autism or not.23 You heard what was said this morning by the 24 epidemiologist who quite honestly and carefully25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 263 of 288263 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888debunked many of the epidemiology studies that have1 been published in the past. It was such a good2 rendition that I asked him to write a paper just on3 what he said.4 Q But you don't know the dose it would 5 require?6 A Pardon? 7 Q You don't know the dose of ethyl mercury it 8 would require for a child to have autism?9 A No. I don't think anyone does because each 10 child also would be quite different in his response or11 her response and there's tremendous variation.12 MS. RENZI: I'll just have 10 more minutes 13 of questions. Would that be okay?14 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: All right. 15 BY MS. RENZI: 16 Q Dr. Aposhian, you did not speak about this 17 today, but it is contained in your report, and I would18 like to discuss some of the aspects of your report.19 A Which? Today's report? 20 Q The report that you filed for the Court -- 21 A Yes. 22 Q -- that we believed was going to be your 23 testimony today.24 A Do you think I could have a copy? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 264 of 288264 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Sure. 1 A Thank you. Thank you very much. 2 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: For the record, 3 that's Exhibit 25, I believe.4 MS. RENZI: I think it's Exhibit 19. 5 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Dr. Aposhian's 6 report? Okay. Exhibit 19.7 BY MS. RENZI: 8 Q Dr. Aposhian, on pages 6 and 7 of your 9 report you discuss four factors that you believe can10 cause someone to be more susceptible to mercury. Do11 you have that?12 A I have the page. Beginning on page 6, No. 13 I, at the bottom.14 Q Do you mean when you say susceptible to 15 mercury, mercury toxicity?16 A Pardon? 17 Q When you say susceptible to mercury do you 18 mean mercury toxicity?19 A I'm sorry. I can't understand you. 20 Q What do you mean by susceptible to mercury? 21 A I don't see the word susceptible at all on 22 this page, on page 6. I've looked for it. In the23 bottom part that's typed I don't see the word24 susceptible at all.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 265 of 288265 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Okay. We'll call them then factors of 1 vulnerability.2 A Where are we? 3 Q We won't say susceptibility. 4 A Where are you? 5 Q I'm on page 6. 6 A All right. Many other factors are involved 7 in the vulnerability.8 Q Okay. I apologize. It was vulnerability. 9 not susceptibility.10 A Your apology is accepted. 11 Q The first of these four factors of 12 vulnerability that you say --13 A Could you speak into the microphone? Thank 14 you.15 Q The first factor that you say increases 16 someone's vulnerability to mercury. Actually, let's17 go back. Could you define vulnerability to mercury? 18 What do you mean by that?19 A You're asking me to define the word 20 vulnerability? Is that correct?21 Q Vulnerability to mercury. 22 A Yes. 23 Q The phrase that you used. Do you mean 24 mercury toxicity? What do you mean?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 266 of 288266 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A I mean their response to mercury. Their 1 vulnerability to mercury would be their response to2 mercury.3 Q And what would the response to mercury be? 4 Would it be a toxic response?5 A There's wide variation. In some people 6 there would be high levels of mercury in the blood or7 high levels of mercury in the urine or high levels of8 mercury in the hair, or some people would have,9 depending on which species, a tremor.10 There are all sorts of signs of the 11 vulnerability of an individual to mercury, depending12 on what the species of mercury is also.13 Q Okay. The first factor you say increases 14 one's vulnerability to mercury is antibiotics, and15 that's on page 6 of your report.16 A Yes. Antibiotics being used when mercury 17 exposure occurs can inhibit mercury excretion and then18 potentially increases toxicity.19 Q And you're referring to the Roland study? 20 Is that correct?21 A I'm really referring to -- I should have put 22 this down -- Ann Summers at I think it's either the23 University of Georgia or Georgia State. I don't24 remember. She went there from Mass General where she25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 267 of 288267 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888had a very distinguished career.1 She has published many papers that show that 2 not only exposure to mercury, but the number of3 amalgams in your mouth, can affect the amount of4 mercury that -- I'm sorry. The antibiotics can affect5 the amount of mercury you're excreting.6 I think that's in good peer reviewed 7 journals. I want to say proceedings in the National8 Academy of Science, but I'm not even sure which9 journal.10 Q But that's not what you relied on in your 11 report for this?12 A Again, I'm sorry to bring up a personal 13 matter. This report was written at a time in my life14 where I could not spend as much time as I usually do.15 This report was written between 4 a.m. and 16 6 a.m. every morning and so there are shortcomings. I17 take that responsibility and I apologize to the Court18 for it.19 Q Can I just ask you a question? Is the 20 Roland study that you rely on no longer valid? Is21 that what you're saying?22 A No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that 23 there have been more studies since Roland, namely Ann24 Summers and probably also Fritz Lorscheider. There25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 268 of 288268 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888have been other studies that have proven the same1 thing; that antibiotics will decrease the excretion of2 mercury.3 Q And you said with dental amalgams? 4 A Pardon? 5 Q With dental amalgams? 6 A With or without dental amalgams. Wherever 7 the mercury comes from. In many experimental systems8 they expose them to mercury vapor, and there have been9 human studies I believe that show the same thing.10 Q Now, the Roland study was a rat study. Is 11 that correct? A rodent study?12 A I don't remember the Roland study now. I 13 would suspect it was a rat study, but I'm not14 positive.15 Q You don't know the doses of methyl mercury 16 that were administered?17 A Definitely not. It's things like that you 18 can look up and read in the paper. I don't believe in19 memorizing things like that.20 Q We can hand you the paper. 21 A Sure. 22 Q Because I do have some questions on that. 23 A Sure. 24 (Pause.) 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 269 of 288269 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Thank you. Do you want this one back, or 1 should I keep this one? Thank you.2 Now, we're looking on The Effects of Diet on 3 Mercury Metabolism and Excretion of Mice Given Methyl4 Mercury, so it's mice and not rats.5 Q Okay. Mice. 6 A Thank you for bringing that to my attention. 7 Q On the top of page 402 -- 8 A Page 402. 9 Q And we can highlight that. We can put it 10 right up on the screen for you.11 A I'm on 402, but I don't know what you just 12 said. I'm on page 402.13 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Doctor, she has it 14 on the screen.15 THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. 16 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: That may be easier 17 for you.18 THE WITNESS: Much easier. Thank you. 19 BY MS. RENZI: 20 Q Would you agree that the dose was .6 21 milligrams of mercury per kilogram?22 A All right. 23 Q And wouldn't the dose of mercury be 24 equivalent to 600 micrograms per kilogram of body25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 270 of 288270 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888weight?1 A Six hundred micrograms of mercury per 2 kilogram of body weight. Is that what you asked? 3 Yes.4 Q And that 600 micrograms per kilogram of body 5 weight would be equal to a 6,000 microgram dose in a6 10 kilogram child. Is that correct?7 A Well, they're talking about mice here. I'm 8 not certain that you can just transpose a mouse dose9 to a human dose that quickly just by changing the10 weight, so I don't know what your point is.11 Q My point is the doses are not comparable. 12 Are those doses comparable to the amount of ethyl13 mercury contained in a thimerosal-containing vaccine?14 A I don't claim the doses are comparable. I 15 don't claim that's so.16 Q But you said in your report that based on 17 the Roland paper high doses of methyl mercury in mice18 inhibit the excretion.19 A What page are we on now? 20 Q I'm sorry. You said that based on the 21 Roland study that high doses of antibiotics --22 A What I say, if you're talking about page 6, 23 let's quote it correctly. Antibiotics being used when24 mercury exposure occurs can inhibit mercury excretion25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 271 of 288271 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888and thus potentially increase its toxicity.1 Q Right. But even with the administration of 2 antibiotics, weren't the doses administered to the3 mice in this study much larger than the doses that are4 contained --5 A I make no claim about dosage in this. All 6 I'm saying -- and I quote the Roland paper here,7 whatever doses they're uses. That antibiotics being8 used when mercury exposure occurs can inhibit mercury9 excretion and thus potentially increase its toxicity.10 Q So this study has no applicability to what 11 antibiotics can do to a person who's exposed to12 thimerosal through a thimerosal-containing vaccine?13 A I think what you've got to understand is 14 science changes. Sometimes it changes the way you15 want it to change, whether it's you or me, and16 sometimes it changes a different way. In this case17 these studies showed that mercury excretion was18 inhibited by giving an antibiotic.19 Now, I'm on very weak ground with the 20 following statement, all right? I wish I had known21 you would ask this. I would have been certain. There22 may even be some --23 Q It was in your report. 24 A Pardon? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 272 of 288272 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q It was in your report. 1 A No, no. Whether it's in my report or not 2 doesn't matter. I just didn't realize I had to be3 prepared for this.4 What I'm trying to say is there may be a 5 study in humans by Ann Summers -- in fact, I'll make a6 point of calling her tomorrow. Either Ann or someone7 else did some studies I think showing that when humans8 were given antibiotics that there was a decrease in9 mercury excretion. That statement is usually accepted10 by most toxicologists today.11 Q Of methyl mercury or ethyl mercury? 12 A I'm just talking about whatever mercury they 13 were using at the time. I don't remember. I'm14 certain they didn't give methyl mercury to humans in15 experimental situations to prove that.16 My guess is they gave it to probably humans 17 that were ill. They gave them an antibiotic, and they18 also did a fecal excretion and a urinary excretion of19 mercury -- that's what my guess is -- and probably20 related it to their mercury exposure. I'm not21 positive of that, but that's what comes up in the back22 of my mind.23 Q So you're not sure? 24 A I'm not sure. I'm telling you the truth 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 273 of 288273 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888when I say I'm not certain.1 Q Now the second factor you list on page 6 of 2 your report. The second factor.3 A Yes? 4 Q You state a factor may increase one's 5 vulnerability. One factor is a combination of genetic6 predisposition and a stress such as fever may increase7 the impact of the stress causing agent, and you cite8 Morton.9 A And what's your question? 10 Q The Morton article is entitled The Genetic 11 Epidemiology of Hearing Impairment. We can hand you12 that article if you would like to see it.13 A You brought up a very good point. I'll go 14 back and see what the story is. It seems ridiculous15 for me -- no abstract available. It's also possible I16 have that in my library at home.17 Q We have that article. 18 A I can't answer any more. 19 Q We have that article. I have it. 20 A Oh, is it in there? Can I see that? Thank 21 you. Is it mentioned? I'll take your word for it. 22 Is it mentioned?23 Q Well, my question to you is you mentioned 24 the article in your report.25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 274 of 288274 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Yes, but what I'm asking you is do they 1 mention stress and mercury in this report?2 Q They make no reference to mercury. 3 A Then my guess is that it was a mistake and 4 it should have been the Mutter paper immediately5 thereafter because the Mutter paper comments on the6 article, The Toxicology of Mercury and its Chemical7 Compounds, or another.8 I don't know. You have a good point. I 9 concede that point to you.10 Q So can you cite to a peer reviewed article 11 on the combination of genetic susceptibility and a12 stress with regards to thimerosal in autism? So a13 genetic susceptibility, stress, thimerosal leading to14 autism? Is that the article you did not --15 A You're talking about No. 3? Is that what 16 you're talking about?17 Q Right. Can you cite to a peer reviewed 18 article about a combination of genetic susceptibility19 and stress with regard to thimerosal and autism?20 A Now, what is your question? 21 Q Can you cite to a peer reviewed article? 22 You said that Morton doesn't apply in this case,23 correct?24 SPECIAL MASTER HASTINGS: Doctor, she's 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 275 of 288275 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888still on Point 2 at the bottom of page 6.1 THE WITNESS: I'm at that point, and I don't 2 understand what your question is. I can read the --3 BY MS. RENZI: 4 Q Okay. If the Morton article doesn't apply, 5 which you just said the Morton article should not have6 been cited, correct?7 A You're absolutely correct. 8 Q Okay. 9 A I'm certainly not perfect. 10 Q Okay. Can you cite though to a peer 11 reviewed paper that discusses the combination of12 genetic susceptibility and stress with regard to13 thimerosal causing autism?14 A I'm not certain. Let me just check one 15 thing. All these points refer not to autism, but they16 refer to the once accepted toxicology axiom that dose17 determines the poison.18 Nowhere in that first paragraph on page 6 or 19 on the second or under (1) or (2) do I see the word20 thimerosal or autism, so I don't understand what the21 point is, ma'am. I don't mean to be rude. I just22 don't understand.23 Q Sir, you put these in your report about what 24 makes people more vulnerable to mercury, and I just25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 276 of 288276 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888want to go over this for the basis --1 A But I don't say anything about thimerosal, 2 and I don't say anything about autism here.3 Q So these don't apply to thimerosal- 4 containing vaccines?5 A I don't know that. I'd have to think more 6 about that. I think that these are generally accepted7 beliefs about the vulnerability of people to mercury. 8 Antibiotics are generally now considered to inhibit9 mercury excretion.10 Certainly many people accept the idea that 11 there's a genetic predisposition to mercury toxicity,12 I think the effects of mercury, and there are a number13 of papers that prove that now.14 I haven't said anything about thimerosal and 15 autism in these lines that you're quoting.16 Q The Palmer study. 17 A Okay. Let's go to the Palmer study. This 18 study has been criticized probably quite well since19 this paper was published.20 I'm not even sure. Again, it's been a long 21 time. I'm not even sure they measured the mercury in22 the air. I just don't remember this paper well23 enough. If you have that paper I'd love to have it.24 Q Why did you cite the Palmer study? 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 277 of 288277 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A Pardon? 1 Q Why did you cite the Palmer study? 2 A The Palmer study was cited because, as it 3 says here someplace: The association between an4 environmentally related mercury, special education and5 autism rates in Texas was investigated using data from6 the Texas Education Department and the United States7 EPA.8 There was a significant increase in the 9 rates of special education students and autism rates10 associated with increases in environmentally released11 mercury. On the average, for each 1,000 pounds of12 environmentally released mercury there was a 4313 percent increase in the rate of special education14 services and a 61 percent increase in the rate of15 autism.16 Now, this study has been criticized, and 17 just again it's been so long since I read this18 article. I don't remember all the criticisms, but the19 study has been criticized I think for -- I don't20 remember whether they themselves did the mercury21 determinations or if any mercury determinations were22 actually done.23 Q Doctor, is it your opinion that mercury in 24 the air causes autism?25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 278 of 288278 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A No, but that's not the only exposure that a 1 person may have or a child may have or a mother, a2 pregnant woman, may have for mercury. It's not just3 mercury in the air.4 I think in my slides today I made it very 5 clear that exposure of humans to mercury in the air is6 not very important.7 Q The fourth factor that you list in your 8 report --9 A Let me check the reference first to be 10 certain it's correct. Yes.11 Q Okay. 12 A This is an excellent book from the new 13 Norberg group. Yes.14 Q But the fourth factor you say plays a role 15 in someone's vulnerability to poisons is diet. Is16 that correct? That's on page 7 of your report.17 A Yes, one of the points. 18 Q And you state in your report that glutamine 19 is low in autistic children. Is that correct?20 A I guess that's what I say. 21 Q What studies do you rely on for the 22 proposition that glutamine levels are lower in23 autistic children?24 A I would suggest -- it's not a very good 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 279 of 288279 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888reference -- that the new Norberg text, which is an1 excellent text that I recommend to anyone who's2 interested in metals.3 It was just published in 2007, and there are 4 chapters in there about glutamine, metals and autistic5 children, as I remember. It's a chapter in the6 Norberg book. I did not realize before that I did not7 put the page number down.8 Q You state on page 7 in your report that 9 glutamine is a precursor of glutathione.10 A Glutathione is glutamyl, cysteinyl and I've 11 forgotten the other amino acid, but glutamic acid12 certainly is part of glutathione.13 Q Is it a direct precursor? 14 A Pardon? 15 Q It's not a direct precursor as you state in 16 your report, is it, sir?17 A In order to make glutathione, you have to 18 have glutamyl cysteine is one of the precursors. In19 order to make glutamyl cysteine, you have to have20 glutamic acid.21 Q What's the basis for your opinion on that? 22 A Pardon? 23 Q What is the basis for that? 24 A Go to any basic biochemistry textbook. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 280 of 288280 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q Well, we're going to pull up the Jill James 1 paper, and that's Jill James 205. It's Petitioners'2 Master List 7.3 We'll see from the homocysteine down to the 4 glutathione. I don't see glutamine on there. Is5 glutamine a precursor to glutathione?6 A But this is not the only way of making 7 glutathione in the cell. If you look at the structure8 -- you must have someplace the structure, the chemical9 formula for glutathione. You'll see glutamyl,10 cysteinyl, glycine. I think that's what it is. Here11 we have cystathiomine. We have the cysteine. Let's12 see.13 There are other pathways. This is not the 14 only pathway for making glutathione. If you go to an15 elementary textbook of medical biochemistry you'll16 find three or four different pathways.17 Q Assuming glutamine levels are low, are 18 glutamine concentrations rate limiting in glutathione19 synthesis?20 A I don't know. 21 Q So the concentration in glutamine doesn't 22 determine the synthesis of glutathione? You don't23 know?24 A I don't know. 25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 281 of 288281 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888Q How much lower are the levels of glutathione 1 in autistic children compared to nonautistic children?2 A Say that again. 3 Q How much lower are the levels of glutathione 4 in autistic children compared to nonautistic children?5 A You have a copy of the Jill James paper. 6 It's in there.7 Q You don't know off the top of your head? 8 No? Okay. That's fine.9 A The Jill James paper published probably last 10 year or the year before.11 Q Do you know how low levels of glutathione or 12 glutamine have to be in order to inhibit the excretion13 of 25 micrograms of ethyl mercury?14 A I have no idea. I have no idea. 15 Q Does the body have mechanisms other than 16 glutathione to bind to, transport and eliminate ethyl17 mercury?18 A If you read Clarkson's articles, which are 19 good review articles on the whole, I think you'll see20 that the glutathione is considered to be the major21 pathway.22 Certainly to get mercury, methyl mercury 23 included, into the bile and into the feces it usually24 is combined with glutathione as one of the carrier25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 282 of 288282 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888mechanisms. It may also be combined with glutathione1 tied up with other proteins, but they don't know that2 yet.3 Q But there are other mechanisms? Is that 4 correct?5 A There are other mechanisms. 6 Q Could you list some of those mechanisms? 7 A Excuse me? 8 Q Could you list a few of the mechanisms? 9 A No. 10 Q I'll list some, and if you could tell me if 11 I'm correct?12 A Pardon? 13 Q Would selenium be one thing in the body -- 14 A What about selenium? 15 Q -- that would help transport, eliminate and 16 bind to heavy metals such as ethyl mercury?17 A Now you're getting into a very difficult 18 area because you're going to ask a specific question,19 so let me ask a specific question if I may that maybe20 you'd like.21 Does selenium have anything to do with the 22 excretion of mercury? Off the top of my head I would23 say no. Does selenium have anything to do with the24 detoxification of mercury? If you believe most of the25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 283 of 288283 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888people who dabble in this sort of thing, they will say1 that mercury is very reactive with selenium, and a2 mercury selenide is formed, as I think I mentioned in3 my testimony.4 This mercury selenium or mercury selenide is 5 very, very insoluble. I doubt very much. I don't6 know what the data is, but I doubt very much that7 mercury selenide comes out in the body as such because8 it is so insoluble.9 Does that answer your question at all? I 10 don't want to make things difficult, I assure you.11 Q That answers my question. I have another 12 question for you.13 A All right. 14 Q Is metallothionein something in the body 15 that binds, transports and eliminates heavy metals16 such as ethyl mercury?17 A Let's first deal with simple mercuric ions, 18 all right? There's no question that mercuric ions19 have an affinity for metallothionein. Metallothionein20 is a protein of which I think one-third of the amino21 acids are cysteines, CYSH, free sulphydryl groups.22 Metallothionein is used in the body as a 23 mechanism, number one, for inactivating cadmium. 24 Another metal may be lead and mercuric mercury is one25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 284 of 288284 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888of them. I think methyl mercury forms a different1 complex with metallothionein, and I'm not certain what2 people feel is the significance of that as far as the3 excretion.4 Certainly metallothionein is known to 5 transport certain metals from the liver to the kidney,6 but whether it does that with mercury I don't7 remember. It is not considered to be a major pathway.8 Q I want to move back to glutathione. Does 9 glutathione protect against mercury? Does glutathione10 only protect against mercury, or does it protect and11 aid in detoxifying other substances?12 A The concentration of glutathione in your 13 liver cells is 10 millimole. I mean, that's a lot of14 glutathione, a tremendous amount of glutathione. It15 is one of the major detoxifying agents in the body,16 all right?17 Does it detoxify other agents? Absolutely. 18 Not only metals, but many other agents. Glutathione19 is one of the major endogenous detoxifying agents that20 we have. Ten millimole is no small amount.21 Q It's a huge amount. Is that correct? 22 A It's huge. 23 Q So if the levels of glutathione are so low 24 as to cause --25Case 1:03-vv-00584-MBH Document 105 Filed 10/21/08 Page 285 of 288285 APOSHIAN - CROSS Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888A So low? 1 Q So low hypothetically. If your levels of 2 glutathione are so low that you cannot detoxify the3 amount of ethyl mercury in a mercury-containing4 vaccine, how could you detoxify any other substance in5 your body?6 A Who says the glutathione level is so low 7 that it cannot detoxify things? I don't know.8 What you must say is the glutathione level 9 in the plasma is very low. You're quoting Jill James10 or you're referring to Jill James' work. She did not11 do liver glutathiones. She did not do brain12 glutathiones. She did red cell. No, she didn't even13 do red cell glutathione.14 She studied plasmic glutathione, and, as I 15 and everyone else have told her, plasma does not have16 a high level of glutathione. Most glutathione is an17 intracellular compound. Very little glutathione is18 found extracellularly. I don't know whether that19 helps you or not.20 Q No. It helps me.
