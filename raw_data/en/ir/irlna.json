I never cease to be amazed by the ability of the body to grow, change, build up and break down. Coming from a family of medical professionals, I gravitated towards the healthcare field and studied Exercise Science at Capilano College and then Physical Health and Education at the University of Toronto. As a varsity athlete for both my college and university varsity volleyball teams, I experienced the transformation that occurs with dedicated high-performance training. I also experienced the deep impact of stress and burnout on my hormone health. Why Naturopathic Medicine... Finally, I arrived in the office of a Naturopathic Doctor as a last attempt to understand my hormone concerns. She spent over an hour with me, asking not only about my physical symptoms, but about my sleep, diet, digestion and how my body and mind manage stress. She was the first practitioner who connected the dots between my symptoms and laid out a clear path forward. 15 years later, now I have the privilege of guiding women to optimal health, drawing from my background in science and training in natural medicine.
