On top of everything else, we shouldn't have to deal with \"maskne\"! How to treat maskne with non-toxic skincare:", "sitename": "At Home South Shore", "date": "2020-10-29", "cleaned_text": "2020 has been tough. On top of everything else, we shouldn't have to deal with \"maskne\"! Yes, maskne is a real thing. It is a play on the words \"mask\" and \"acne\", and is characterized by any type of skin breakout or irritation caused by prolonged use of a mask. I don't know about you, but this rings true for my skin! My face has been breaking out since March, and I blame the mask! I found non-toxic skincare that is Osea Products I have tried four different non-toxic skincare lines in the past several months, but nothing made a difference until I found Osea's [Blemish-Prone Ritual](https://rstyle.me/+3Qlb08s2cr5-2R0awrWRgw). I kid you not, my skin was cleared up and glowing after only a couple of uses! This is not sponsored by Osea (I wish! lol), but I wanted to share my real life experience in hopes that others would find these amazing products. Because I didn't know if the products would live up to the hype, I started with the [Blemish-Prone Starter Set](https://rstyle.me/+sWJBMHuF0QWVtMHpB-xq3w) (which includes a vegan leather travel case!) so that I could test-drive the travel-sized versions before committing to the full-sized price. I have since bought the full-sized products and added the [Red Algae Mask](https://rstyle.me/+gRrRv5g5Mah9XSMq3QahwA) to my lineup, a face mask (the other kind) that complements the blemish-prone line. Even if you are not blemish-prone, Osea has other lines of amazing non-toxic skincare. He might get mad at me for telling you this, but I even got my boyfriend to start using Osea's [Daily Essentials Ritual](https://rstyle.me/+CdGRxbshpW12jb1Yptee9A). I bought him this kit so that I could steal the [Undaria Algae Body Oil](https://rstyle.me/+u8SZsubcaSjfEX-ugwEotw). This body oil has a cult following! Again, they have a [Daily Essentials Starter Kit](https://rstyle.me/+mqLyifuGyN56qKm0iXRAjg) if you are looking to start small. I first heard about the brand when [Osea's CEO, Melissa Palmer, was on To Be Magnetic's Expanded Podcast](https://tobemagnetic.com/expanded-podcast/2019/62). On the podcast, Melissa explains her fascinating family history in natural healing and creating non-toxic skincare products from seaweed, as well as her unusual upbringing in Topanga, CA. It's a great listen! Non-Toxic Skincare Aside from their luxurious, glass-bottled products, I love Osea because it is certified non-toxic skincare. Did you know that our skin is the largest organ in our bodies? Yes, your skin is a living, breathing organ! It is extremely important to understand what we put on our skin because up to 60% of it will be absorbed directly into our blood stream. The skincare industry is not regulated like the food industry is, and therefore not required to list their (potential harmful) ingredients. \"The average woman uses 12 beauty or skin products a day that contain over 168 (toxic) chemicals\" - Scott Faber, Environmental Working Group (EWG) If you are sensitive, the reactions to these chemicals can be immediate (allergy, skin rash, headache, etc.). However, the real danger is when your daily skincare routine allows these toxins to build up in your body over time (without giving you a warning). This can eventually lead to disease, infertility, birth defects, auto-immune issues, and cancer. Want to know if your skincare passes the test? Download the \" [ThinkDirty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/think-dirty-shop-clean/id687176839)\" app to search for your skincare products. You want the products you use to have a \"Green\" score of \"0-3\" on their scale. If caring for your own health isn't enough, all natural and non-toxic skincare is better for the environment. The chemicals from our products can get into our water and soil, and harm the plants and animals around us. I have worked hard for the last couple of years to ensure that every product in our home is non-toxic.
