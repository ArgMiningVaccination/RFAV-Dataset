SHIFT NEGATIVE PATTERNS AND STRENGTHEN NEW ONES Release, Heal, and Reconnect Life's hardships have a way of blocking our light, making us struggle to experience the joy and pleasure of living our true potential or feel open to life's great possibilities for us. Whether it's trauma, stress, loss, illness, pain, an accident, a big life change, or just old \"baggage\", life can knock us off center, lurch us into \"survival mode\", and constrict our ability to live life fully. We can walk around feeling like we hold a grudge against the world, or ourselves. We can have a hard time experiencing life's goodness, or struggle to feel we are really walking our life's path and may question our purpose. Anxiety and Depression can settle in and feel like they become separate enemies. But there is good news...these challenges may just be *symptoms.* If you treat symptoms without treating the root causes of them, they persist. I strive to help you heal at the root cause level to reduce and eliminate symptoms as much as we can, in addition to helping you manage symptoms and increase an overall positive state of well-being. The negative things which have happened in your life did at one point overwhelm your nervous system. You may have thought that you \"moved on\", but if you continue to struggle with negative patterns of thinking, feeling, or reacting, you may simply have unprocessed stress stuck in your nervous system, preventing you from moving forward and living peacefully and joyfully. The bad stuff may still be lingering in your mind and body, blocking your precious life energy and your potential. When we do the things in therapy that help strengthen us as well as shift distress at the root causes, we can change the negative symptoms, beliefs, and patterns stuck in the nervous system. The nervous system can repair and we can \"reprogram\" more positive states into it. With some time we can restore life back toward wholeness and strengthened ways of thinking, feeling, being, and doing. This is the basis for the work I do through the use of mind/body healing techniques and approaches. Sometimes...talk therapy is important, but not enough to enable healing in the deeper ways we need. I am always focused on helping clients feel positive and get relief as quickly as possible. Many times by working with guided imagery, visualization, EMDR, inner child work, or other energy psychology approaches, little shifts can be experienced right away. Other times, our systems hold on to negative memories of the past (consciously or unconsciously) so tightly that we first need to work to identify the blocks and resistance. The more therapy we engage in, the more opportunities we have for continued and deeper change and healing. It is up to you how far you would like to go. I offer convenient, virtual sessions to clients ages 23 and older, who are located in the states of Wisconsin and Florida. I look forward to helping you feel better!
