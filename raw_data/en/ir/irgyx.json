A total of 945 three-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks of both genders were randomly allocated to one of nine dietary treatments (n=105), with three replicates 35 chicks per pen, as follows: grower, developer and finisher phases) and water were provided ad libitum for 42 days. Body weights, feed intake, feed conversion values and plasma carotene concentrations were recorded weekly, and liver antioxidant concentrations were recorded at the end of the experiment. Newcastle disease (LaSota) vaccination was performed on day 22. HI titers were measured on days 14, 21, 35 and 42 to determine the effects of the antioxidants on the immune system. The addition of selenium, vitamin E, and carotenoid supplements to the commercial broiler diet significantly increased antioxidant accumulation in the liver and the plasma. All antioxidants assessed significantly improved the immune response. Selenium and vitamin E supplementation also significantly improved total carotenoid concentrations in the plasma. The carotenoids enhanced skin and meat color. None of the supplements tested influenced growth (p>0.05). Keywords: Broiler; antioxidants; carotenoids; performance; immune response; pigmentation Introduction of birds in the wild have suggested that antioxidants are a limiting factor for laying females, as supplementation with antioxidants increases their transfer to eggs, which has beneficial consequences for specific offspring traits (Biard et al., 2005Biard C, Surai PF, M\u00f8ller AP. Effects of carotenoid availability during laying on reproduction in the blue tit. Oecologia 2005;144:32-44.). Recent studies have shown that the injection of physiological amounts of antioxidants into eggs increases a major component of the acquired immune system without any adverse consequences on other offspring traits (Saino et al., 2003Saino N, Ferrari R, Romano M, Martinelli R, M\u00f8ller AP. Experimental manipulation of egg carotenoids affects immunity of barn swallow nestlings. Proceedings Royal Society London B 2003;270:2485-2489.). Still, antioxidant concentrations are lower in maternal tissue than in yolk, suggesting that mothers actively transfer these compounds to eggs (Sunder & Flachowsky, 2001Sunder A, Flachowsky G. Influence of high vitamin E dosages on retinol and carotenoid concentration in body tissues and eggs f\u00fcr Tierern\u00e4hrung 2001;55:43-52.; Surai, University Press; Rubolini M, Bonisoli Alquati A, Saino N. Early maternal, genetic and environmental components of antioxidant protection, morphology and immunity of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks. European Society for Evolutionary Biology 2006;19(5):1571-1584.). Therefore, during incubation, the incorporation of these compounds from egg yolk into the developing embryo and chick tissue (e.g., liver and blood) may substantially contribute to the antioxidant defenses of the offspring (Surai & Sparks, 2001Surai PF, Sparks NHC. Comparative evaluation effect of two maternal diets on fatty acids, vitamin E and carotenoids in the chicken embryo. British Poultry Science 2001;42:252-259.; Surai et al., 2001aSurai PF, Speake BK, Sparks NHC. Carotenoids in avian nutrition and embryonic development. 1. Absorption, availability and levels in plasma and egg yolk. Journal of Poultry Science 2001a;38(1):1-27.,bSurai PF, Speake BK, Wood NAR, Blount JD, Bortolotti GR, Sparks NHC. Carotenoid discrimination by the avian embryo: A lesson from wild birds. Comparative Biochemistry Physiology 2001b;4:743-750.; et 2003a;17:A1125-A11125.; et al., 2005aKaradas F, Surai PF, Sparks NH. Grammenidis E. Effects of maternal dietary supplementation with three sources of carotenoids on the retinyl esters of egg yolk and developing quail liver. British Poultry Science 2005a;47(2):200-208.). Despite some results have suggested that carotenoids exhibit weak antioxidant effects (Costantini & M\u00f8ller, 2008Costantini D, M\u00f8ller AP. Carotenoids are minor antioxidants for birds. Functional Ecology 2008;22:367-370.), it is clear that these molecules also have immune-stimulating functions (M\u00f8ller et al., 2000M\u00f8ller AP, Biard C, N, PF. Carotenoid- signals: Indicators of foraging efficiency, immunocompetence or detoxification ability? Avian and Poultry Biology Reviews 2000; 137-159.; nestling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) in relation to brood size and parental effort. Journal of Animal Ecology 1997;66:827-836.; 2003Saino N, Ferrari R, Romano M, Martinelli R, M\u00f8ller AP. Experimental manipulation of egg carotenoids affects immunity of barn swallow nestlings. Proceedings Royal Society London B 2003;270:2485-2489.), which are important to combat the inhibitory effects of oxidative stress on immune responsiveness (Kurien & Scofield, 2008Kurien BT, Scofield RH. M\u00f8ller for Functional Ecology 2008;22:367-370.; Galv\u00e1n et al., 2012Galv\u00e1n I, Erritz\u00f8e J, Karadas F, M\u00f8ller AP. High levels of liver antioxidants are associated with life-history strategies characteristic of slow growth and high survival rates in birds. Journal of Comparative Physiology Part B 2012;182:947-959.). However, the beneficial functions of carotenoids vary depending on their source, and there is no consensus regarding the minimum and maximum dosages in broiler diets. In the wild birds, the egg yolk and tissue concentrations of Se, carotenoids and vitamin E are many times higher than those in captive birds (Karadas et al., 2005bKaradas F, Wood NAR, Surai PS, Sparks NHC. Tissue-specific distribution of carotenoids and vitamin E in tissues of newly hatched chicks from various avian species. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 2005b;140:506-511.; Surai, 2002Surai PF. Natural antioxidants in University Press; 2002.; 2006Surai PF. Selenium health. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press; 2006.). Carotenoids have also been demonstrated to affect broiler skin color, which is an important factor for consumer acceptance in many countries (Casta\u00f1eda et al., 2005Casta\u00f1eda MP, Hirschler EM, Sams AR. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed natural and synthetic pigments. Poultry Science 2005;84:143-147.; Liu al., Wang SJ, SJ, Zhang WP, Yang Y. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed different levels of natural okra and synthetic pigments. Journal of Applied Poultry Research 2008;17:498-504.). Xanthophylls, which comprise a particular class of carotenoids, are the most prominent source of pigmentation in poultry feed (Goodwin, 1950Goodwin TW. Carotenoids and reproduction. Biological Reviews 1950;25:391-413.); however, the typical corn-and soybean-based commercial poultry diet does not supply the necessary amounts or types of xanthophylls required to produce a deep yellow skin (Casta\u00f1eda et al., 2005Casta\u00f1eda MP, Hirschler EM, Sams AR. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed natural and synthetic pigments. Poultry Science 2005;84:143-147.). Selenium (Se) is an essential trace mineral that is important for growth as a component of poultry nutrition (Surai, 2002Surai PF. Natural antioxidants in avian nutrition and University Press; 2002.; Selle at al., 2013Selle P, Cowieson of organic selenium supplementation on growth performance, nutrient utilisation and selenium tissue concentrations in broiler chickens. Proceedings of the 24th Australian Poultry Science Symposium (APSS). Veterinary Science Conference Centre; 2013 Fev 17-20; Sydney, AU. Sydney: University of Sydney; 2013.). Se supplementation to animal feeds enhances the immune status of the animal and the ability of the immune system to respond to disease challenges (Tayeb & Qader, 2012Tayeb IT, Qader GK. Effect of fed supplementation of selenium and vitamin E on production performance and some hematological parameters of broiler. Kahraman Maras S\u00fctc\u00fc Imam University Journal of Natural Sciences 2012;15:46-56.). Vitamin E plays an important role in various biochemical and physiological processes, including antioxidant activity (Litta et al., 2014Litta G, Chung TK, Weber GM. Vitamin E: vital for health and performance. Word Poultry 2014. Available from: http://www.worldpoultry.net/Broilers Nutrition-2014 1437326. [http://www.worldpoultry.net/Broilers Nut... ](http://www.worldpoultry.net/Broilers%20Nutrition-2014%201437326)). Reportedly, the supplementation of 150 and 300 IU/kg vitamin E to feeds was shown to improve the immune response and to reduce the mortality of chickens challenged with E.coli (Tengerdy & Nockels, 1975Tengerdy RP, Nockels CF. Vitamin E or vitamin A protects chickens against E. coli infection. Poultry Science 1975;54:1294-1296.). Similar effects have been obtained with doses ranging from 100-300 mg/kg in turkeys and chickens challenged with colibacillosis, coccidiosis, and listeriosis (Colnago et al., 1984Colnago GL, Jensen LS, Long PL. Effect of selenium and vitamin E on the development of immunity to coccidiosis in chickens. Poultry Science 1984;63:1136-1143.; Julseth, 1974Julseth, DR. Evaluation of vitamin E and disease stress in turkey performance [thesis]. Forth Collins (USA): Colorado State University; 1974.). In the past decade, considerable information has been published, indicating that vitamin E, Se, and carotenoids are major immune-stimulating agents (Surai, 2002Surai PF. Natural antioxidants in avian nutrition and reproduction. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press; 2002.). Despite the enormous amount of research focusing on vitamin E and Se, few of these studies have compared the effects of vitamin E, Se and different sources and levels of carotenoids in broiler diets. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the effects of dietary supplementation with high doses of Se and vitamin E, as well as with low and high doses of carotenoids, on broiler antioxidant systems, skin pigmentation and immune responses. Materials and Methods Animals and experimental design In total, 945 one-day-old commercial Ross 308 broiler chicks were purchased from a local supplier. All chicks were wing-banded for individual identification upon arrival at the university's poultry research farm. At 3 days of age, 105 chicks were randomly distributed among nine pens according to antioxidant and pigment treatments, with three replicates that had 35 chicks per pen, as follows: Treatment 1: control diet (corn- and soybean-based commercial diet) Treatment 2: control diet+0.5 mg/kg Seyeast (Sel-PlexTM 2000) Treatment 3: control purchased from a commercial supplier (Seher Tavuk\u00e7uluk, Malatya). The supplements were provided by the Red Corp., New Jersey, USA) respectively. Detailed information regarding the nutritional content of the basal commercial diet is provided in [Table 1]().The supplements were added to the commercial feed using an electric mixer with a capacity of 40 kg. The birds were provided with feed and water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. The commercial feed varied according to the following feeding schedule: starter feed, 0-11 days; grower feed, [Table 1]()). Broiler Feed Composition (g/kg) The birds live weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio were measured weekly from 1 to 6 weeks of age. A researcher with an animal care research ethics certificate (FK) collected blood and hepatic samples from two chickens from each replicate, for a total of six chickens per treatment. A blood sample was drawn from the jugular vein (Hoysak & Weatherhead 1991Hoysak DJ, Weatherhead PJ. Sampling blood from birds: a technique and an assessment of its effect. Condor 1991;746-752.) using a heparinized syringe and placed into an ice-cold tube. The plasma samples were stored at 20\u00b0C for analyses of total carotenoids each week. At the end of the experiment, the chickens were sacrificed by cervical dislocation immediately after the blood sample was obtained. Liver analysis Liver carotenoid, vitamin A (retinol and retinol esters), vitamin E and Q10 levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), described previously by 2001aSurai PF, Speake BK, Sparks NHC. Carotenoids in avian nutrition and embryonic development. 1. Absorption, availability and levels in plasma and egg yolk. Journal of Poultry Science 2001a;38(1):1-27.. Tissue aliquots were vortexed in 0.7 mL of 5% NaCl. Ethanol (1 mL) was added, and the samples were homogenized for 1 min. Hexane (2 mL) was added during homogenization. Following homogenization, the samples were centrifuged, and the carotenoid-containing hexane phase was collected. The hexane extraction was repeated, and the combined hexane phase was dried using N2 gas. It was then re-dissolved in dichloromethane/methanol (1:1 v/v). The concentration of vitamin E (a-, g-, and d-tocopherols, as well as a- and g-tocotrienols) was determined as previously described (Surai et al., 2001aSurai PF, Speake BK, Sparks NHC. Carotenoids in avian nutrition and embryonic development. 1. Absorption, availability and levels in plasma and egg yolk. Journal of Poultry Science 2001a;38(1):1-27., bSurai PF, Speake NAR, Blount JD, Sparks NHC. Carotenoid discrimination by the avian embryo: A lesson from wild birds. Comparative Biochemistry Physiology 2001b;4:743-750.) using a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system reverse-phase column (10 cm\u00d74.6 mm; using a mobile phase of methanol/water (97:3 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.05 mL/min. The fluorescence detection of tocopherols and tocotrienols involved excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 330 nm, respectively. Standard solutions of tocopherols and tocotrienols in methanol were used for instrument calibration. Coenzyme Q10 was analyzed in the same extract by injecting 50 \u00b5l into the same HPLC system but using a Vidac 201TP54 column (5m m,25 cm\u00d74.6 mm), a mobile phase of ethanol/methanol/2-propanol (70:15:15 by volume) and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with diode array detection at 275 nm (Mattila 2001Mattila P, Kumpulainen J. Coenzymes Q(9) and Q(10): contents in foods and dietary intake. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 2001;14(4):409-417.). A coenzyme Q10 (Sigma) standard was used for calibration. Total carotene levels were analyzed by injecting 10 \u00b5L sample extraction into the same HPLC system, using a Waters NH2 column (5mm, 25 cm x 4.6 mm), a mobile phase of methanol/water (97:3 by volume) and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with diode array detection at 444 nm (Surai & Sparks, 2001Surai PF, Sparks NHC. Comparative evaluation effect of two maternal diets on fatty acids, vitamin E and carotenoids in the chicken embryo. British Poultry Science 2001;42:252-259.). The levels of retinol and retinol esters were determined by injecting 10 \u00b5L sample extraction into the HPLC system using a Waters Supherisorb ODS 2, 5m C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (25 cm x 4.6 mm; Phase Separations Limited, UK), with diode array detection at 325 nm (Karadas et al., 2005aKaradas F, Surai PF, Sparks NH. Grammenidis E. Effects of maternal dietary supplementation with three sources of carotenoids on the retinyl esters of egg yolk and developing quail liver. British Poultry Science 2005a;47(2):200-208.). Immune response Half of the control chicks were selected as negative controls to verify effects of the control diet on the immune response to vaccination. Except for the negative controls, all birds were inoculated with a commercial B1strain LaSota (Lohmann Animal Health International (LAHI), Gainesville, GA) EID50 live vaccine tittered to a dose of at least 106.5. The vaccines were administered with tap water that was dechlorinated by adding skimmed milk to 20 L of water. Blood samples were collected from the brachial veins of two birds per replicate (total of six birds) and centrifuged (3000\u00d7g for 10 min) to obtain the serum for immune response analyses. The antibody response to vaccination was evaluated by NVD hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (log2/8 HA), which were performed as described by Van Eck & Goren (1991Van Eck JHH, Goren E. An Ulster 2C strain-derived Newcastle 283 disease vaccine: vaccinal reaction in comparison with other lentogenic Newcastle 284 disease vaccines. Avian Pathology 1991;20:497-507.) at 13 days and 20 days post-vaccination, when the chickens were 35 and 42 days of age. Skin color evaluation Broiler carcasses were refrigerated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. Breast and leg colors were evaluated using a Chromameter (CR-400, Minolta, Japan) and expressed using the redness (a*), yellowness (b*) and lightness (L*); for each bird, three readings were performed, and the averages were calculated and recorded. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 13.2 statistical software for Windows. Duncan's multiple range tests were used to assess differences between treatments, and a p<0.05 was considered statistically significant (unless otherwise stated). Results Diet analyses Analysis of the feed (n=4 samples) indicated that the concentrations of total carotenoids in the control diet were 7.40\u00b10.69, 9.54\u00b10.76, 13.95\u00b10.12, and 15.18\u00b10.18 \u00b5g/g for the starter, and finisher phases, respectively. Lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-carotene were the only carotenoids detected in the control diet, and they were found at the following concentrations (% of total carotenoids): 43.51% lutein, finisher phase. The total carotenoid concentrations of the experimental groups are listed in [Table 2]().The carotenoid percentage changed the b-carotene-supplemented Total carotenoid concentrations of the experimental diets (\u00b5g/g) Bird performance Body weights, feed intake, feed conversion ratios, and mortality rates are presented in [Table 3](). In general, the body weights of the birds did not vary significantly among the treatment groups (p>0.05). Performance data by supplement treatment group Overall, feed intakes throughout the course of the experiment (weeks 0-6) were significantly lower in the 200 mg vitamin E and 25 mg/kg apo-ester treatment groups compared with the 100 mg/kg b-carotene treatment group (p<0.05). The feed conversion values did not vary significantly among the treatment groups (p>0.05). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the b-carotene treatment group compared with the vitamin E, lutein beads, and canthaxanthin treatment groups (p<0.05). Immune response The antibody titers for the different treatment groups are presented in [Table 4](). Before vaccination on day 14, significant differences were found between the other treatment groups and the 25 mg/kg Xamacol(r) and 100 mg/kg b-carotene groups (p<0.05); these differences, however, disappeared on day 21 (p>0.05). At 13 days post-vaccination, the antibody titers in all treatment groups improved significantly compared with those in the negative (unvaccinated) control group ( [Table 4]()). Significant improvements were also found in the positive (vaccinated) control group (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the stimulated immune responses of the positive (vaccinated) control group and the groups supplemented with 25 mg/kg Xamacol(r) and 100 mg/kg b-carotene. Interestingly, at 20 days post-vaccination (42 days of age), the HI response of the negative control group was significantly improved compared with those of all of the experimental treatment groups, although it did not improve compared with that of the positive control group (p<0.05). Vaccine The total plasma carotenoid concentrations by week are presented in [Table 5](). All of the antioxidant treatment groups had significantly higher total plasma carotenoid concentrations compared with those of the control group during week 1 of the experiment. However, in week 2, the total plasma carotenoid concentration of the vitamin E treatment group was significantly higher than those of all of the other experimental groups, and although the total plasma carotenoid concentration of the Se treatment group was lower than that of the vitamin E treatment group, it was significantly higher than those of all of the other pigment-supplemented treatment groups (p<0.05). These differences between the vitamin E and Se treatment groups disappeared during weeks 4, 5 and 6. During week 3, all of the experimental groups except for the 100 mg/kg b-carotene-supplemented group had significantly higher total plasma carotenoid concentrations than the control group (p<0.05). In week 4 after vaccination, the concentrations in the 25 mg/kg canthaxanthin and the 100 mg/kg Lutein Bead groups were significantly improved compared with the concentrations in all of the other experimental treatment groups. These two groups had been flowed up with the vitamin E supplementation treatment. However, lower total carotenoid concentrations were recorded in the b-carotene-supplemented treatment group (p<0.05). Plasma total carotene concentrations (\u00b5g/g) by age Liver antioxidant concentrations The liver antioxidant (total carotenoids, a- and g-tocopherols, total vitamin E and coenzymeQ10) concentrations are presented in [Table 6](). The total carotenoid concentrations in the liver varied among the treatment groups as follows: canthaxanthin>apo-ester>Xamacol(r)>Lutein Beads Lyco Beads>b-carotenoid vitamin E Sel-plex of a- and g-tocopherols and coenzyme Q10 were not affected by the treatments; however, the liver vitamin E concentrations (total vitamin E and a-tocopherol) were significantly higher in Vitamin E supplemented than those in the other treatment groups ( [Table 6]()). Antioxidant composition of the liver at 42 days of age (\u00b5g/g) The liver retinol and retinol ester concentrations at 42 days of age are presented in [Table 7](). As the table shows, b-carotene supplementation significantly improved the total vitamin A concentrations in the liver (p<0.05) compared with all of the other experimental treatments. The treatments did not affect the retinol concentrations (p>0.05); however, b-carotenoid supplementation had a significant positive on the R-linoleate, R-oleate, R-palmitate and R-stearate concentrations (p<0.05). In addition, compared with b-carotene supplementation and the control diet, pigment, vitamin E and selenium supplementation had negative effects on retinol ester accumulation (p<0.05). Liver retinol and retinol ester concentrations at 42 days of age (\u00b5g/g) Skin and meat pigmentation The skin and meat pigmentation findings are presented in [Tables 8](), [9]() and [10](). [Table 8]() shows that significant improvements in breast and leg skin and meat redness (a*) were only found in the 25 mg/kg canthaxanthin treatment group (p<0.001). In addition, redness (a*) in the 100 mg/kg b-carotene treatment group was significantly lower compared with the 100 mg/kg Lutein Beads and 25 mg/kg canthaxanthin treatment groups 8]()). The effects of different sources of antioxidants on skin and meat pigmentation redness (a*), n=6 The effects of different sources of antioxidants on skin and meat pigmentation yellowness (b*) values, n=6 The effects of different sources of antioxidants on skin and meat lightness (L*) values, n=6 As shown in [Table 9](), breast and leg skin and meat yellowness the 100 and 25 mg/kg Xamacol(r) groups were significantly higher than those in the control, 100 mg/kg Lyco Beads and 100 mg/kg b-carotene groups (p>0.05). No differences were found between the breast and leg skin and meat yellowness (b*) of the control, 100 mg/kg mg/kg b-carotene groups (p>0.05). Although canthaxanthin is a pigment that is used to enhance redness, it also significantly increased meat and skin yellowness (b*) in the broilers that received it as a supplement compared with the control broilers. By contrast, meat and skin yellowness was negatively affected in the 200 mg/kg vitamin E supplemented group and was similar to that of the control group. Breast and leg skin and meat lightness (L*) were significantly improved in the canthaxanthin treatment group compared with the other treatment groups (see [Table 10]()). Discussion Performance Compared with the corn-and soybean-based control diet, the supplementation with selenium, vitamin E and carotenoids from various sources did not cause any significant differences in the live weight, feed intake or feed conversion ratio (FCR) over the course of the 6-week experimental period (p>0.05). Our findings for selenium are in line with those of Selle et al. (2013Selle PH, Celi P, Cowieson A. Effects of organic selenium supplementation on growth performance, nutrient utilisation and selenium tissue concentrations in broiler chickens. Proceedings of the 24th Australian Poultry Science Symposium (APSS).

Kahraman Maras S\u00fctc\u00fc Imam University Journal of Natural Sciences 2012;15:46-56.); et al. (2008Skrivan M, Dlouha G, Masata O, S. Effect of dietary selenium on lipid oxidation, selenium and vitamin e content in the meat of broiler chickens. Czech Journal of Animal Science 2008;53:306-311.), who reported that different doses of selenium and vitamin E had no significant effects on live body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, or FCR. Our findings for Se were not in agreement with those of Hoffman (2007)Hoffmann, PR. Mechanisms by which selenium influences immune responses. Ozdemir E, M. Dietary vitamin e (a-tocopherol acetate) and selenium supplementation from different sources: performance, ascites-related variables and antioxidant status in broilers reared at low and optimum temperatures.

Poultry Science 2005;84:543-546.), who noted that the FCR of broilers fed organic Se supplements was improved compared with that of broilers fed un-supplemented diets. Our findings for vitamin E supplementation are in agreement with those of Bottje et al. (1997Bottje WG, Erf GF, Bersi TK, Wang S, Barnes D, Beers KW.

British Poultry Science 2011;52:97-105.) who reported that differences in dietary a-tocopheryl acetate concentrations (0, 17, 46 and 87 mg/kg diet) had no effect on broiler performance. By contrast, Chae et al. (2006Chae BJ, Lohakare JD, Choi JY. Effects incremental level of a-tocopheryl acetate on performance, nutrient digestibility and meat quality of commercial broilers. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Science 2006;19:203-208.) and Rebole et al.

British Poultry Science 2006;47:581-591.) reported that supplementation of 200 mg/kg a-tocopheryl acetate increased body weight gain and the FCR without affecting feed intake. Pigment supplementation has previously been reported to have no significant effect on feed intake or body weight (Fletcher et al., 1986Fletcher DL, Papa CM, Tirado FX.

In contrast with the above performance parameters, our study found that the mortality rate was significantly affected by antioxidant supplementation. The mortality rate of the group that received supplementary b-carotene was significantly higher than those of the 200 mg/kg vitamin E, 100 mg/kg Lutein Beads, 25 mg/kg canthaxanthin and 25 mg/kg Xamacol(r) groups. These differences may have been caused by differences in the dosages. Our results are in line with those of Siegel et al. (2000Siegel PB, Larsen CT, Emmerson DA, Geraert PA, Picard M. Feeding regimen, dietary vitamin E, and genotype influences on immunological and production traits of broilers. Journal of Applied Poultry Research 2000;9:269-278.), who reported day 41 mortality rates of 8.6% 7.5% and 5.4% for chickens that received dietary vitamin E supplementation of 10, 100, and 300 IU/kg per day, respectively. Similarly, Blum et al. (1992Blum JC, Touraille C, Salichon, MR, Ricard FH, Frigg M. Effect of dietary vitamin E supplies in broilers. 2. Male and female growth rate, viability, immune response, fat content and meat flavour variations during storage. Archive fur Geflugelkunde 1992;56:37-42.) reported an increased mortality rate in cocks and hens that received a low level of vitamin E supplementation (20 mg/kg diet) (3.2% and 2.9%, respectively) compared with that of hens that received a higher (160 mg vitamin E/kg diet) level, for which the mortality rates decreased (1.7% and 1.5%, respectively). In other previous animal studies, the survival rates of parrot fish larvae were found to increase with b-carotene supplementation (Tachibana et al. 1997Tachibana K, Yagi M, Hara K, Mishima T, Tsuchimoto M. Effects of feeding of b-carotene-supplemented rotifers on survival and lymphocyte proliferation reaction of fish larvae (Japanese parrotfish (Oplegnathus fasciatus and preliminary trials. Hydrobiologia 1997;358:313-316.), and lycopene was shown to enhance mouse resistance to bacterial infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae (Lingen et al. 1959Lingen C, Ernster L, Lindberg O. The promoting effect of lycopene on the non-specific resistance of animals. Experimental Cell Research 1959;16:384-393.). However, in our study, b-carotene and lycopene supplementation did not improve survival rates. Immune response The immune responses of the birds were significantly stimulated by all experimental treatments compared with those in the unvaccinated controls. Interestingly, immunity was significantly higher in the vaccinated controls compared with the unvaccinated controls (p<0.05), and there were no differences in immune stimulation between the vaccinated control group and the birds fed the Xamacol(r)- and b-carotene-supplemented diets. It is possible that HI was stimulated by both treatments on day 14 prior to vaccination, which could account for these results. Newcastle disease challenges are often used to assess the immune-stimulating properties of antioxidants. Surai (2006Surai PF. Selenium in nutrition and health. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press; 2006.) reported that Se and vitamin E significantly improved the immune responses of chicks vaccinated with a live Newcastle vaccine. Shekaro et al. (2012Shekaro A, Oladele SB, Abdu PA, Ibrahim NDG. Effect of selenium on the susceptibility of vaccinated cockerels against infectious bursal disease. Journal of Veterinarian Advance 2012;2(12):573-579.) have reported that the addition of 0.5 ppm organic Se to broiler diets enhanced the immune response against infectious bursal disease, and a number of other studies (El- Sheik et al., 2010El-Sheikh AMH, Abdalla EA, Maysa MH.

Poultry Science 2001;80:320-326.) have found that humoral antibody titers increase when feed is supplemented with Se or vitamin E. Our findings that organic selenium supplements (0.5 ppm) significantly increased the 10-day post-vaccination HI antibody titers against NDV (compared with both the unvaccinated and vaccinated controls, as well as the birds given 25 ppm Xamacol(r) supplements (p<0.05), are in agreement with the findings of the studies mentioned above. In our study, dietary supplementation with 200 mg/kg a-tocopherol significantly increased the antibody response to the NDV vaccine compared with the response in both the unvaccinated and vaccinated controls, as well as that of the broilers given 25 ppm Xamacol(r) (p<0.05). These results are in line with those of a number of studies (Boa-Amponsem et al., 2006Boa-Amponsem K, Picard M, Blair ME, Meldrum B, Siegel PB.

By G. Effect of dietary a-tocopherol concentration on performance and some immune responses in broiler chickens fed on diets containing oils from different sources. British Poultry Science 2011;52:97-105.) reported that a-tocopherol (<100 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the humoral immune response to NDV, and Marsh et al. (1981Marsh JA, Dietert RR, Combs GF.

Poultry Science 1993;72:1280-1284.) reported a similar lack of an effect of dietary supplementation with higher levels of a-tocopherol (100-250 mg/kg). Links between immune function and carotenoids have been experimentally demonstrated (Penissi 2003Pennisi E. Colorful males flaunt their health.

Effects of carotenoids, immune activation and immune suppression on the intensity of chronic coccidiosis in greenfinches. Experimental Parasitology 2011;127:651-657.). Our results are in agreement with those of several studies (Tengerdy et al., 1990Tengerdy RP, Lacetera NG, Nockels CF. Effect of carotenoids ease protection and humoral immunity in chickens.

Behavioral Processes 2006;73:325-332.) that have demonstrated that b-carotene does not effectively protect chickens against E.coli or enhance antibody protection; however, our findings conflict with those of Bendich & Shapiro (1986Bendich A, Shapiro SS. Effect of beta-carotene and canthaxanthin on the immune responses of the rat. The Journal of Nutrition 1986;116:2254-2262.) and Jyonouchi et al. (1994Jyonouchi H, Zhang L, Gross M, Tomita Y. Immunomodulating actions of carotenoids: enhancement of in vivo and in vitro antibody production to T-dependent antigens. Nutrition and Cancer 1994;21:47-58.), who have reported that b-carotene enhances the immune response in rats. Our findings of the positive effects of other carotenes on the immune system are in line with previous findings indicating that carotenoids have immune-suppressive effects in bird species (Fenoglio et al., 2002Fenoglio S, Cucco M, Malacarne G.

Nutrition and immune system. British Poultry Science 2007;48:525-537.). Plasma carotene concentrations With the optimum level of carotenoid supplementation of broiler diets, the degree of carotene accumulation varied according to the provided as follows: Xamacol(r)>canthaxanthin>apo-ester>vitamin E>selenium>control (p<0.05) ( [Table 5]()). The significant increases in the plasma total carotenoid concentrations that were observed when the basal diet was supplemented with pigments, as well as with vitamin E and Se, demonstrated the synergistic effects of substances with antioxidant properties. However, unlike the optimum level of carotenoid supplementation (25 mg/kg) in the control diet, [Table 5]() shows that the total carotenoid accumulation in the plasma of the chickens was only increased by dietary supplementation with 100 \u00b5g/kg Lutein Beads and not by high-dose (100 \u00b5g/kg diet) carotenoid supplementation (except for the first week over the course of the experiment) compared with that in the control group. As shown in ( [Table 5]()). Lyco Beads and b-carotene had no significant effects on the total plasma carotene concentrations (p>0.05). Further research is necessary to explore the differences related to the chemical compositions of lycopene, lutein and b-carotene. [Table 5]() shows that the best results for total plasma carotenoid accumulation were obtained with supplementation of 25 mg/kg Xamacol(r), mg/kg b-carotene. These results, which suggest that quality is more important than quantity, are not in agreement with those of Sepp et al. (2011Sepp T, Karu U, Sild E, M\u00e4nniste M, H\u00f5rak P. Effects of carotenoids, immune activation and immune suppression on the intensity of chronic coccidiosis in greenfinches. Experimental Parasitology 2011;127:651-657.), who have shown that differences in carotenoid supplement dosages do not significantly affect plasma carotenoid levels. The low level of plasma carotenoid accumulation found with high doses of supplementary b-carotene in our study might indicate pro-oxidant activity, which would supports the findings of Ruiz et al. (1999Ruiz JA, Perez-Vendrell AM, Esteve-Garcia E. Effect of beta-carotene and Vitamin E on oxidative stability in leg meat of broilers fed different supplemental, fats. Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry 1999;47:448-454.), who observed antioxidant activity in both the fresh and cooked meat of broilers that were fed diets containing 15 ppm b-carotene and found pro-oxidant activity when the amount was increased to 50 ppm. In a study of rats, Alam & Alam (1983Alam SQ, Alam BS. Lipid peroxide, alpha-tocopherol and retinoid levels in plasma and liver of rats fed diets containing beta-carotene and 13-cis-retinoic acid. Journal of Nutrition 1983;113:2608-2614.) found that plasma and liver peroxide levels increased as the dose of b-carotene increased, but no beneficial effects were observed. Similar data were reported by Lomnitski et al. (1991Lomnitski L, Bergman M, Schon I, Grossman S. The effect of dietary vitamin E and beta-carotene on oxidation processes in the rat testis. Biochimica Acta 1991;1082(1):101-107.), who described increases in values as a result of b-carotene dietary supplementation. Lutein is a carotenoid that constitutes major parts of the avian diet, egg yolk and tissue. It has also been shown to perform better than b-carotene in quenching lipid peroxyl radicals and to be a more efficient antioxidant than a-tocopherol in vitro (Chopra et al., 1993Chopra M, RL, Thurnham DI. Free radical scavenging activity of lutein in vitro. York Academy of Sciences 1993;691(1):246-249.). Woodall et al. (1996Woodall AA, Britton G, Jackson MJ. Dietary supplementation with carotenoids: effects on alpha-tocopherol levels and susceptibility of tissues to oxidative stress. British Journal of Nutrition 1996;76:307-317.) reported that 37-day-old chickens provided with dietary supplementation of 100 mg/kg of either b-carotene, zeaxanthin, or canthaxanthin had total plasma carotene levels of 3.3, 15.5, and 7.1 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, compared with the level of only 2.6 \u00b5g/mL that was found in birds fed a commercial diet with no supplements. Their results for b-carotene are very similar to ours, but their findings for canthaxanthin are different than ours (8.18\u00b11.26 \u00b5g/mL with 25 mg/kg dietary supplementation). Our findings also showed that Lutein Beads were more efficient than Lyco Beads in transferring dietary carotenoids to the plasma. These results are consistent with previous observations that have indicated that lycopene is much less efficient than other carotenoids in terms of egg yolk deposition (Karadas et al., F, Grammenidis tomato on Poultry Science 2006;47(5):561-566.). Sikder et al. (1998Sikder AC, Chowdhury SD, Rashid MH, Sarker AK, Das SC. Use of dried carrot meal (DCM) in laying hen diet for egg yolk pigmentation. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Science 1998;11:239-244.) has attributed these differences to the different characteristics of the various types of carotenoids. A previously published lycopene dose-response study has demonstrated the saturation of lycopene absorption at increasing doses (Diwadkar-Navsariwala et al., 2004Diwadkar-Navsariwala V, Novotny JA, Gustin DM, M, Bowen PE. A physiological pharmacokinetic model describing the disposition of lycopene in healthy men. Journal of Lipid Research 2004;44:1927-1939.). Increasing serving sizes of a tomato beverage were administered to adult men; these servings delivered lycopene doses ranging from 10 to 120 mg. Compartmental modeling showed that the lycopene absorption rates for 10, 30, and 60 mg were 34, 14, and 7%, respectively (Novotny et al., 2010Novotny NA, Harrison DJ, Pawlosky R, \" Vincent P, Flanagan VP, Kurilic AC. b-Carotene conversion to vitamin A decreases as the dietary dose increases in humans. Journal of Nutrition 2010;140(5):915-918.). In our study, we found that over the dose range studied, absorption efficiencies decreased with increasing dose. Studies have revealed much higher carotenoid concentrations in the plasma of wild birds (Surai,2002Surai PF. Natural antioxidants in avian nutrition and reproduction. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press; 2002.). For example, Tella et al. (1998Tella JL, MC, Hiraldo F. A comparison of spectrophotometry and color charts for evaluating total plasma carotenoids in wild birds. Physiological Zoology 1998;71:708-711.) investigated plasma carotenoid concentrations in 356 birds from 26 wild species and found concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 74.2 mg/mL, with an average concentration of 9.4 mg/mL. The plasma carotenoid concentrations in white storks were shown to increase from 2.2 mg/mL to 11.1 mg/mL after they were fed a diet of crayfish (Negro et al., 2000Negro JJ, Tella JL, Blanco G, Forero MG, Garrido-Fernandez J. explains variation of plasma carotenoids and skin pigmentation in storks. Physiological and Zoology 2000;73:97-101.). Plasma carotenoid concentrations in wild American Kestrels raised in captivity were found to vary from approximately 4 to 87 mg/mL, depending on the season and bird sex and age (Negro et al., 1998). Plasma carotenoid concentrations in wild shrikes were found to vary from approximately 10 to 20 mg/mL (Bortolotti et al., 1996Bortolotti GR, Negro JJ, Tella JL, Marchant TA, Bird DM. Sexual dichromatism in birds independent of the diet, parasites and androgens. Proceedings of the Royal Society 1996;263:1171-1176.). Unlike those in the wild birds, the plasma total carotenoid accumulation for the broilers in our study did not exceed 16 mg/mL, regardless of the dose of supplementary carotenoid. Further research should be conducted to better elucidate the effects of dosage. Liver antioxidant (total carotenoid, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q 10 ) concentrations The liver is considered the main storage site for fat-soluble antioxidants (carotenoids, vitamins A, E and coenzyme Q10) (Tyczkowski & Hamilton, 1986Tyczkowski JK, Hamilton PB. Absorption, transport, and deposition in chickens of lutein diester, a carotenoid extracted 1986;65:1526-1531.; Schiedt, 1998Schiedt K. Absorption and Metabolism of carotenoids in birds, fish and crustaceans. In: Britton G, Liaaen-Jensen Pfander, I, Erritz\u00f8e Karadas F, M\u00f8ller AP. High levels of liver antioxidants are associated with life-history strategies characteristic of slow growth and high survival rates in birds. Journal of Comparative Physiology Part B 2012;182:947-959.). The analysis of bird livers performed in the present study showed that the total carotenoid levels in the livers of the birds that received carotenoid dietary supplements were significantly higher than those in the controls (p<0.05) ( [Table 6]()). The total liver carotenoid levels in the canthaxanthin treatment group were also significantly higher than those in the Lutein Bead and Lyco Bead treatment groups (p<0.05). The finding that canthaxanthin accumulates at higher rates than other synthetic red pigments is consistent with reports in the literature (Klasing, 1998Klasing KC. Comparative avian nutrition. London: Cab al., 2003Waldenstedt Effects on performance, caecal campylobacter and clostridial counts and tissue astaxanthin concentration of broiler chickens. Animal Feed Science and Technology 2003;108:119-132.). Vitamin E supplementation was found to significantly increase the liver vitamin E concentrations (p<0.05); however, the different antioxidant treatments did not significantly affect the liver coenzyme Q10 levels ( [Table 6]()). The dietary supplements did not significantly affect the liver retinol levels, but they did have significant effects on the liver retinol ester concentrations (p<0.05) ( [Table increased the liver R-linoleate and R-oleate concentrations, whereas all of the other treatments significantly decreased the R-oleate concentrations compared with that in the control group. With the exception of b-carotenoid, all of the other dietary supplements decreased liver R-palmitate concentrations compared with that in the control group. Compared with the concentrations in the controls, both apo-ester and b-carotenoid supplementation significantly increased the R-stearate concentrations, which, however, were not affected by the other experimental treatments. Moreover, the R-stearate concentrations in the b-carotenoid treatment group were higher than those in the apo-ester treatment group. The total vitamin A concentration was significantly higher in the b-carotenoid treatment group, whereas the concentrations were significantly lower in all of the other treatment groups compared with the control group, with the exception of the apo-ester treatment group. These results are in accordance with reports in the literature and indicate that rather than influencing skin pigmentation, b-carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin A, tends to be converted into retinoids (Barua & Olson 2000Barua AB, Olson JA. Beta-carotene is converted primarily to retinoids in rats in vivo. Journal of Nutrition 2000;30:1996-2001.; Poor et al., 1987Poor CL, Miller SD, Fahey GC, Easter RA, Erdman JW. Animal models for carotenoid utilization studies: evaluation of the chick and the pig. Nutrition Reports International 1987;36:229-234.), which mainly accumulate in tissues as oxy-carotenoids (Surai, 2002Surai PF. Natural antioxidants in avian nutrition and reproduction. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press; 2002.). A study conducted by Yeum & Russell (2002Yeum KJ, Russell RM. Carotenoids bioavailability and bio conversion. The Annual Review of Nutrition 2002;22:483-504.) has demonstrated that orally administered physiological doses of b-carotene are completely converted into vitamin A in the small intestine enterocytes of rats, producing retinoid forms that are incorporated into chylomicrons, secreted into lymph, injected into the blood stream and then delivered to the liver for storage. The direct measurement of liver vitamin A reserves has been described as the gold standard for assessing vitamin A status (Barua & Olson, 2000;Tanumihardjo, 2004Tanumihardjo SA. Assessing vitamin A status: past, present and future. Journal of Nutrition 2004;134:290S-293S.; Howe & Tanumihardjo, 2006Howe JA, Tanumihardjo SA. Evaluation of analytical methods for carotenoid extraction from biofortified maize (Zea mays sp.). Journal Agricultural Food Chemistry 2006;54:7992-7997.). However, it has been suggested that the dose may influence the conversion of b-carotene to vitamin A (Brubacher & Weiser 1985Brubacher GB, Weiser H. The vitamin A activity of B-carotene. International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research 1985;55:5-15.). Skin and meat pigmentation Whether consumers consider a product attractive will influence their purchasing decisions. The color of raw poultry meat is important in terms of consumer expectations regarding freshness; raw breast meat is expected to be pale pink in color, and raw thigh and leg meat is expected to be dark red (Northcutt, 2009Northcutt JK. Factors affecting poultry meat quality. Bulletin 2009; 1157: April, the University of Georgia and Ft. Valley State College, the U.S. Georgia: Fort Valley University of Georgia.). Redness (a* values) Our study found that supplementation of broiler diets with canthaxanthin significantly improved breast and leg skin and meat redness (a*) ( [Table 8]()). The leg skin pigmentation a* values in the canthaxanthin treatment group were higher than those in the other treatment groups. However, the a* values in the b-carotene group were lower than those in both the canthaxanthin and Lutein Bead groups. It is possible that rather than contributing to pigmentation, the majority of b-carotenoid accumulated in the liver as retinol and retinol esters, which would explain these findings. Canthaxanthin is commonly used to provide a yellowish-reddish color to broiler carcasses (P\u00e9rez-Vendrell et al., 2001P\u00e9rez-Vendrell AM, Hern\u00e1ndez JM,Llaurado L, Schierle J, Brufau J. Influence of source and ratio of xanthophyll pigments on broiler chicken pigmentation and performance. Poultry Science 2001;80:320-326.), which is an important factor for consumer acceptance in various countries (Castaneda et al., 2005Casta\u00f1eda MP, Hirschler EM, Sams AR. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed natural and synthetic pigments. Poultry Science 2005;84:143-147.; Liu al., Wang SJ, SJ, Zhang WP, Yang Y. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed different levels of natural okra and synthetic pigments. Journal of Applied Poultry Research 2008;17:498-504.). The commercial poultry industry considers an a* value of at least 4 to be desirable (Castaneda et al., 2005Casta\u00f1eda MP, Hirschler EM, Sams AR. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed natural and synthetic pigments. Poultry Science 2005;84:143-147.). Castaneda et al. (2005)Casta\u00f1eda MP, Hirschler EM, Sams AR. Skin pigmentation evaluation in broilers fed natural and synthetic pigments. Poultry Science 2005;84:143-147., who investigated the effects of different pigment types and amounts in broiler diets, reported that a synthetic pigment provided results closest to the commercially prescribed a* value. The canthaxanthin-supplemented group in our study not only met this goal but also had close to twice the minimum recommended commercial a* value. Tyczkowski & Hamilton (1986Tyczkowski JK, Hamilton PB. Absorption, transport, and deposition in chickens of lutein diester, a carotenoid extracted from marigold (Tagetes erecta) petals. Poultry Science 1986;65:1526-1531.) studied the absorption, transport and deposition of canthaxanthinin broilers that were provided with dietary supplements ranging from 5-80 mg/kg feed and found that the canthaxanthin concentrations in the jejunum, large intestine, serum, liver and toe web were directly proportional to those provided in the diet. Our study used the level of canthaxanthin recommended for broiler diets (25 mg/kg) and obtained significant improvements in skin and meat redness values (p<0.05). Canthaxanthin has been reported to accumulate in the tissue and eggs of wild birds such as mallards and gulls (McGraw & Toomey 2010McGraw KJ, Toomey predictors of integumentary pigmentation and implications and Zoology 2010;83(1):97-109.; Surai et al., 2001Surai PF, Sparks NHC. Comparative evaluation effect of two maternal diets on fatty acids, vitamin E and carotenoids in the chicken embryo.

Part 1. World's Poultry Science Journal 2012;68:465-476.), and commercial broiler producers should take this into consideration when contemplating the canthaxanthin supplementation of broiler diets. Yellowness (b* values) The present study found b* values ranging from 1 to 9 ( [Table 9]()). Bianchi et al. (2005Bianchi M, Fletcher DL, Smith DP. Physical and functional properties of intact and ground pale broiler breast meat. Poultry Science 2005;84:803-808.) reported yellowness (b*) values of 6.2 for normal breast meat and 7.6 for pale breast meat. Castroman et al. (2013Castrom\u00e1n G, Del Puerto M, Ramos A, Cabrera MC, Saadoun A. Organic and conventional chicken meat produced in Uruguay: colour, pH, fatty acids composition and oxidative status. American Journal of Food and Nutrition 2013;1(2):12-21.) reported breast meat and leg meat yellowness values of 16.9 and 16.7, respectively, for organic broilers and 19.7 and 19.1, respectively, for conventional broilers. Although our values are higher than those reported by Bianchi et al. (2005)Bianchi M, Fletcher DL, Smith DP. Physical and functional properties of intact and ground pale broiler breast meat. Poultry Science 2005;84:803-808., they are very close to those reported by Castroman et al. (2013)Castrom\u00e1n G, Del Puerto M, Ramos A, Cabrera MC, Saadoun A. Organic and conventional chicken meat produced in Uruguay: colour, pH, fatty acids composition and oxidative status. American Journal of Food and Nutrition 2013;1(2):12-21. and other studies in the literature (Waldenstedt et al., 2003Waldenstedt L, Inborr J, Hansson Effects on performance, caecal campylobacter and clostridial counts and tissue astaxanthin concentration of broiler chickens. Animal Feed Science and Technology 2003;108:119-132.; Inborr & Lignell, 1997Inborr J, algae meal (Haematococcus pluvialis) on performance and carotenoid concentration of different tissues of broiler chickens. Proceedings of the 13th WPSA Conference on Poultry Meat Quality in Poznan; 1997 Sep 22-25; Poznan, Poland. Session M1, p.39-43.). Yellowness in breast skin is a good indicator of the xanthophyll content in feed (P\u00e9rez-Vendrell et al., 2001P\u00e9rez-Vendrell AM, Hern\u00e1ndez JM,Llaurado L, Schierle J, Brufau J. Influence of source and ratio of xanthophyll pigments on broiler chicken pigmentation and performance. Poultry Science 2001;80:320-326.), with more intense yellow tones of broiler carcasses suggesting a higher intake of yellow pigments from through the diet (Mourao et al., 2008Mourao CMGA, Ponte PIP. Effect of dietary dehydrated pasture and citrus pulp on the performance and meat quality of broiler chickens. Poultry Science 2008;87:733-743.). Lightness (L* values) At 24 hours post-mortem, the L* values in the group that received supplementary canthaxanthin (L*=46-47) were significantly lower than those in all of the other experimental groups in our study ( [Table 10]()). The findings for these groups (L*=54-56) are in line with the values (L*=53-57) reported by Castrom\u00e1n et al. (2013Castrom\u00e1n G, Del Puerto M, Ramos A, Cabrera MC, Saadoun A. Organic and conventional chicken meat produced in Uruguay: colour, pH, fatty acids composition and oxidative status. American Journal of Food and Nutrition 2013;1(2):12-21.). Although Van Laack et al. (2000Van Laack RLJM, Liu CH, Smith MO, Loveday HD. Characteristics of pale, soft, exudative broiler breast meat. Poultry Science 2000;79:1057-1061.) used an L* value of 60 as the limit for pale poultry breast meat, other studies (Petracci et al., 2004Petracci M, Betti M, Bianchi M, Cavani C. Color variation and characterization of broiler breast meat during processing in Italy. Poultry Science 2004;83:2086-2092.; Bianchi et al., 2005Bianchi M, Fletcher DL, Smith DP. Physical and functional properties of intact and ground pale broiler breast meat. Poultry Science 2005;84:803-808.; Castrom\u00e1n et al., 2013Castrom\u00e1n G, Del Puerto M, Ramos A, Cabrera MC, Saadoun A. Organic and conventional chicken meat produced in Uruguay: colour, pH, fatty acids composition and oxidative status. American Journal of Food and Nutrition 2013;1(2):12-21.) used an L* value of 53 as a cut-off to distinguish between pale and normal poultry meat. Accordingly, the values found in the present study would be considered pale, with the exception of the canthaxanthin group, for which the values would be considered normal. Conclusions The present study showed that supplementation of commercial broiler diets with antioxidants significantly improved the immune response and liver antioxidant concentrations. Carotenoids were also found to improve skin and meat pigmentation. Total plasma carotenoid levels were also improved by Se and vitamin E supplementation, indicating the synergic effects of antioxidants. However, the fact that high doses of b-carotene also increased mortality rates must be considered.
