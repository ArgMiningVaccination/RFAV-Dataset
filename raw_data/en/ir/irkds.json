Acupuncture, a complementary therapy used in symptom management,[ Cancer patients are receptive to receiving acupuncture for symptom control. A 2018 cross-sectional study of breast cancer survivors showed that an equal percentage of patients preferred acupuncture versus medication for pain management.[ More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws regulating acupuncture practice. The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine offers national certification examinations for practitioners of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (www.nccaom.org); most, but not all, states require this certification. More than 50 schools and colleges of acupuncture and Oriental medicine operate in the United States, many of which offer master's-level programs and are accredited by or have been granted candidacy status by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). ACAOM standards for a master's-level degree require a 3-year program (approximately 2,000 hours of study) for acupuncture and a 4-year program for Oriental medicine, which includes acupuncture and herbal therapy (www.ACAOM.org). In recent years, some schools have begun to offer programs for Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine with an additional 1,200 hours of clinical-based doctoral training. Some Western medical training, including the study of anatomy, physiology, and clean-needle technique, is included in the curriculums of these schools. Postgraduate training programs in medical acupuncture for physicians also exist. In the United States, training to be a licensed acupuncturist is regulated according to individual state law. Because the educational and licensing requirements for acupuncture practice vary from state to state, one should inquire from each state board of acupuncture (or other relevant board) for particular information (www.nccaom.org). Third-party reimbursements also vary from state to state. Some insurance companies cover acupuncture or limited acupuncture treatment. Federal payers such as Medicare and Medicaid do not generally reimburse for acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for more than 4,000 years.[ Acupuncture is closely associated with Chinese meridian theory. According to this theory, there are 12 primary meridians, or channels, and eight additional meridians, each following a particular directional course along the body. A vital energy known as qi flows through these meridians and participates in the homeostatic regulation of various bodily functions. Along the meridians are approximately 360 points that serve as both pathognomonic signs of disorder and as loci for acupuncture treatments.[ Classical techniques of acupuncture include the following: Acupressure, using fingers or mechanical devices to apply pressure on acupuncture points is based on the same principles as acupuncture. Moxibustion is a method in which an herb (Artemisia vulgaris) is burned above the skin or on an acupuncture point for the purpose of warming it to alleviate symptoms. Cupping promotes blood circulation and stimulates acupuncture points by creating a vacuum or negative pressure on the surface of the skin.[ In addition to classical acupuncture techniques, other techniques have been developed and are sometimes used in cancer management. These include trigger point acupuncture, laser acupuncture, acupuncture point injection, and techniques focusing on particular regions of the body such as: Of these, auricular acupuncture is the most commonly used. In clinical practice, most acupuncturists in the United States use the traditional theories and principles of Chinese medicine. A 2017 survey of 472 licensed acupuncturists in the San Francisco Bay area reported that 77% were caring for patients with cancer, and 44% have training specific to the needs of patients with cancer.[ Although acupuncture has been practiced for millennia, it has come under rigorous scientific investigation only recently. In 1976, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified acupuncture needles as investigational devices (class III) (www.fda.gov), resulting in a number of research studies on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture.[ These actions by the FDA and NIH have resulted in the establishment of a number of active programs of research into the mechanisms and efficacy of acupuncture, much of which is, or is potentially, relevant to cancer management. The most extensively investigated aspect of these mechanisms has been the effect of acupuncture on pain management. The NIH Consensus Panel concluded that \"acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses,\" local and distal, \"mediated mainly by sensory neurons ...within the central nervous system.\" Acupuncture \"may also activate the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, resulting in a broad spectrum of systemic effects,\" including \"alterations in peptides, hormones and neurotransmitters and the regulation of blood flow.\"[ Although the mechanism of acupuncture is not fully understood, it has been proposed that beneficial results are mediated by changes in neurohormones and cytokines. Animal research suggests that acupuncture achieves its anesthetic effect by stimulating nerves in the muscle, which then relay the signal to the spinal cord, midbrain, and hypothalamus-pituitary system, ultimately triggering release of neurotransmitters and hormones, such as endorphins and enkephalins.[ Laboratory and animal cancer studies have also explored the mechanisms of acupuncture through the activation and modulation of the immune system. Previous animal and human studies have suggested that acupuncture worked through immunomodulation, with significant changes in cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-alpha).[ Acupuncture treatment points are located by using standard anatomic landmarks and comparative anatomy. EA is the most commonly used treatment intervention; a few studies have used moxibustion.[ Although several studies published in China examined the effect of acupuncture on the human immune system,[ A 2018 retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 375 cancer survivors who received acupuncture treatments at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Integrative Medicine Center outpatient clinic showed that patients experienced short- and long-term improvement in multiple symptoms including hot flashes, fatigue, numbness, tingling, and nausea.[ References: The generally accepted history of acupuncture /moxibustion (known as zhen jiu) is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), an indigenous, coherent system of medicine that has been practiced in China for thousands of years. The history of acupuncture/moxibustion in China can be traced back archaeologically at least 4,000 years, when bian (stone needles) were in use. During the long history of recorded practice, acupuncture has been applied to many disorders. The earliest written medical text, the ancient classic Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, second century BC), records nine types of needles and their therapeutic functions. The dissemination of acupuncture and TCM to other regions dates back centuries, first to Korea and Japan and then to other Asian countries.[ For centuries, Chinese acupuncturists treated cancer symptomatically. Ancient literature and acupuncture textbooks classify cancer as a Zhi syndrome or blood stasis condition and document acupuncture treatment principles and methods.[ References: At least seven animal studies investigating the effects of acupuncture in cancer or cancer-related conditions have been reported in the scientific literature.[ The four ex vivo studies suggested that acupuncture is useful in anticancer therapy either by actively stimulating immune activity or by preventing chemotherapy suppression of immune activity.[ In a study involving normal rats, electroacupuncture (EA) (1 Hz, 5-20 V, 1-millisecond pulse width, 2 hours) applied at the point Zu-Sanli (S36) for 2 hours daily on 3 consecutive days enhanced the cytotoxicity of splenic natural killer (NK) cells compared with a stimulation of a nonacupuncture control point in the abdominal muscle.[ Another study found that NK cell activity and T-lymphocyte transformation rate were increased in a mouse model of transplanted mammary cancer compared with a control (P < .05) after eight sessions of acupuncture and moxibustion.[ A study involving tumor -bearing mice (sarcoma S180) using moxibustion to warm the acupuncture point Guanyuan (CV4) once a day for 10 days found significantly increased production of erythrocytes, compared with a nontreatment control.[ The fourth ex vivo study used a rat model to investigate the effect of EA on nerve growth factor (NGF), which is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS have an increased risk of endometrial cancer and other diseases. Repeated EA treatments (12 treatments administered over 30 days) in PCO rats significantly lowered the concentrations of NGF in the ovaries, compared with untreated PCO rats.[ A study of cyclophosphamide -induced emesis in a ferret behavioral model used acupuncture as an adjunct therapy in treating the emetic side effects of chemotherapy. EA at 100 Hz, 1.5 V, for 10 minutes in combination with subeffective doses of antiemetics such as emetic episodes by 52%, 36%, and 73%, respectively (P < .01), in this ferret model.[ A rat model has been established by injecting AT-3.1 prostate cancer cells into the tibia of the adult male Copenhagen rat, which closely mimics prostate cancer-induced bone cancer pain.[ Another cutaneous cancer pain model has been established by injecting B16-BL6 melanoma cells into the plantar region of one hind paw of C57BL/6 mice. A single EA treatment showed significant analgesia on day 8 but not on day 20. EA treatments once every other day starting on day 8 showed analgesia at day 20, but EA starting on day 16 did not. The results indicate that EA exerts antihyperalgesic effects on early stage but not on late stage cutaneous cancer pain.[ The findings of these studies suggest that acupuncture may be effective in treating cancer-related symptoms and cancer treatment-related disorders and that acupuncture may be able to activate immune functions [ References: Effect of Acupuncture on Immune Function There has been limited research, mostly performed in China, evaluating the effect of acupuncture on immune system function in cancer patients, suggesting that acupuncture improves immune function.[ Effect of Acupuncture on Cancer Pain Clinical studies and reviews of acupuncture as a treatment for cancer-related pain have been reported in the English language (see Table 1).[ One randomized trial compared classical Chinese acupuncture, acupuncture point injection with freeze-dried human transfer factor, and conventional analgesic treatment in patients with gastric cancer pain.[ Also, a nonrandomized, single-arm, observational clinical study evaluated the effect of auricular acupuncture in 20 cancer patients who were still experiencing pain after treatment with analgesics.[ Although most of these studies were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture in cancer pain control, the findings have limited significance because of methodologic weaknesses such as small sample sizes, an absence of patient blinding to treatment in most cases, varying acupuncture treatment regimens, a lack of standard outcome measurements, and an absence of adequate randomization. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review of five RCTs reported benefits of acupuncture in reducing pancreatic cancer pain, pain from late-stage cancer, and chronic cancer-related neuropathic pain; the study found no difference between real and sham electroacupuncture (EA) for ovarian cancer pain.[ In addition, a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,639 participants with cancer-related pain in 20 RCTs with a high risk of bias showed that acupuncture alone was not superior to conventional drug therapy, although acupuncture plus drug therapy appeared to be superior to drug therapy alone.[ Most acupuncture cancer pain clinical trials use conventional body acupuncture. A 2020 clinical trial studied the effect of wrist-ankle acupuncture in combination with auricular acupuncture to treat cancer pain and showed that the combination therapy is effective in reducing pain and analgesic medication usage.[ |Reference||Trial Design||Type of Pain||Treatment controlled trial; VAS = visual analog scale.| |a For additional information and definition of terms, see theNCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms.| |b Number of patients treated plus number of patient controls may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled equals number of patients initially recruited/considered by the researchers who conducted a study; number of patients treated equals number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported.| |c Concurrent therapy for symptoms treated (not cancer).| |d Strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has activity or otherwise improves the well-being of cancer patients.

One RCT of 106 cancer patients who experienced postthoracotomy pain showed no statistical difference in the real acupuncture (RA) group compared with the sham acupuncture (SA) group in patients' pain scores measured by the Brief Pain Inventory at the 30-, 60-, and 90-day follow-up.[ Another smaller RCT (N = 27) showed a trend of lower VAS pain scores in patients who received EA when compared with patients who received SA on postoperative days 2 and 6; and a statistically significant lower cumulative dose of patient controlled analgesia on postoperative day 2 (P < .05).[ One RCT (N = 93) compared acupuncture with massage therapy and usual care in controlling postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and depressive moods.[ Another study showed that in cancer patients with chronic pain or dysfunction as a result of neck dissection, four weekly acupuncture treatments significantly reduced pain and improved function compared with standard care alone.[ Acupressure has been shown to be efficacious in reducing procedural pain.

Both EA and AA significantly reduced average pain severity on a 0 to 10-point pain scale (EA, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4; AA, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1) when compared with usual care. Because of ear pain, 10.5% of patients dropped out the AA group.[ Nausea and vomiting Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting Of all the investigated effects of acupuncture on cancer-related or chemotherapy-related symptoms and disorders, the positive effect of acupuncture on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (N/V) is the most convincing, as demonstrated by the consistency of the results of a variety of clinical study types, including RCTs, nonrandomized trials, prospective consecutive case series, and retrospective studies (see Table 4). Consistent with the findings from clinical studies of acupuncture on N/V due to other causes (i.e., postoperative N/V and morning sickness), these studies showed acupuncture to be effective in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced N/V (CINV). A 2013 systematic review of literature on acupuncture in cancer care screened 2,151 publications and identified 41 RCTs studying the effect of using acupuncture to treat eight cancer treatment-related symptoms (pain, nausea, hot flashes, fatigue, radiation-induced xerostomia, prolonged postoperative ileus, anxiety/mood disorders, and sleep disturbance). The review concluded that acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for CINV, but additional studies are needed because most RCTs had unclear bias or a high risk of bias.[ In 2005, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (N = 1,247) evaluating the effect of acupuncture-point stimulation in controlling CINV showed that acupuncture-point stimulation significantly reduced the proportion of acute vomiting (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99, P = .04),[ The trials in the meta-analysis were published between 1987 and 2003, and the sample sizes ranged from ten patients in the smallest trial [ A meta-analysis of acupuncture in N/V is the most comprehensive summary of clinical research on the role of acupuncture-point stimulation in controlling CINV. It found that acupuncture-point stimulation decreases the proportion of patients who experience acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting and concurred with the previous systemic review and meta-analysis.[ The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference held in 1997 reviewed studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of acupuncture in treating postoperative- and CINV.[ The acupuncture point specificity is worth mentioning because most of the earlier acupuncture CINV trials used the PC6 acupuncture point and showed positive results. A well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial published in 2014 showed that K1 acustimulation combined with antiemetics did not prevent cisplatin -induced or oxaliplatin -induced nausea in 103 liver cancer patients who underwent a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedure.[ A 2016 RCT showed that among 48 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, patients randomly assigned to the auricular acupressure group (ear seed placed on point zero, stomach, brainstem, shenmen, and cardia) had significantly less intense and less frequent N/V in acute and delayed phases compared with the control group that had no auricular acupressure.[ Researchers have attempted to augment the impact of acupressure on the antiemetic effects using certain methods, but they were not found to be effective.[ Fewer studies have been done on acupuncture effects on pediatric oncology patients. A 2018 RCT of 165 pediatric patients who received chemotherapy with high-emetogenic potential showed that acupressure bands at PC6 point were safe but did not improve CINV when compared with placebo wrist bands.[ A 2017 RCT that compared acupuncture with SA in 60 multiple myeloma patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) showed that even though acupuncture did not significantly improve overall symptoms during and 15 days after BMT compared with SA, it was significantly more efficacious in reducing nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness at 15 days after BMT.[ A 2020 RCT examined the effect of real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in reducing CINV among 134 patients with advanced cancer. Patients received treatment twice a day on the first day of chemotherapy and once a day for the next 4 days. No significant difference was found between the two groups.[ Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting Acupuncture has also been used to relieve radiation-induced N/V. In one randomized study, patients who were randomly assigned to receive either verum or SA experienced fewer episodes of N/V than did those who received standard care.[ |Reference||Condition or Cancer Type||Treatment Groups (Enrolled; Treated; Placebo or = real acupuncture; SA = sham acupuncture.| |a For additional information and definition of terms, see theNCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms.| |b Number of patients treated plus number of patient controls may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled equals number of patients initially considered by the researcher who conducted a study; number of patients treated equals number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported;historical control subjectsare not included in number of patients enrolled.| |c Concurrent therapy for symptoms treated (not cancer).| |d These results indicate statistically significant differences unless stated otherwise.| |e Strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has activity or improves the well-being of cancer patients.

In 2007, one study reported results from a randomized, sham-controlled trial on the effect of acupuncture in treating breast cancer survivors who experienced three or more hot flashes per day.[ In 2009, one study reported another randomized SA-controlled trial on the effect of acupuncture in treating women with breast cancer who suffered from hot flashes after receiving tamoxifen for at least 3 months.[ Another clinical trial compared the effects of EA with hormonal therapy in breast cancer survivors with vasomotor symptoms; in 19 of 27 women who completed 12 weeks of EA treatment, the number of hot flashes was significantly reduced from 9.6 per day to 4.3 per day. The improvement persisted at the 12-month follow up.[ In 2010, another RCT compared the effect of acupuncture with venlafaxine in treating vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer patients suffering from more than 13 hot flashes per week.[ In 2013, a study reported the results of a three-arm RCT (N = 94) comparing RA (N = 31) with SA (N = 29) and usual care alone (N = 34) in reducing hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. In the acupuncture group, 16 (52%) patients experienced a significant reduction in hot flashes compared with 7 (24%) in the SA group (P < .05). There was also a statistically positive effect on sleep when RA was compared with SA. Importantly, the researchers measured the plasma estradiol level and determined that there was not a correlation between symptoms improvement and an increase in estradiol level.[ In 2014, a study reported the results of a two-arm RCT (N = 47) on the effect of acupuncture in reducing AIMSS and hot flashes as one of the secondary end points. When compared with baseline, acupuncture significantly improved hot-flash severity, frequency, and function. SA significantly improved the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale only. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups.[ These trials once again confirmed that acupuncture is safe. They showed that acupuncture reduced hot flashes significantly when compared with baseline, although the benefit of RA versus SA was not clear. A 2015 systematic review of acupuncture to control hot flashes in cancer patients showed that in all eight studies included in the review, acupuncture resulted in significant improvement from the baseline, and three studies showed RA was significantly better than SA in different aspects of hot flashes. However, none of the studies were rated with a low risk of bias.[ A study published in 2015 that used EA in the treatment of hot flashes randomly assigned 120 breast cancer survivors who were suffering from hot flashes at least twice daily to one of four of the following arms: EA, SA, gabapentin (GP), and placebo pills (PP) for 8 weeks.[ A 2016 pragmatic RCT (N = 190) that compared individualized acupuncture plus enhanced self-care (as described in an information booklet provided to all patients) with enhanced self-care alone showed that the combination therapy is superior to self-care alone in reducing hot flash scores at the end of treatment, at the 3-month follow-up visit, and at the 6-month follow-up Used Evidence Scored| = gabapentin; interference scale; hr = hour(s); HT = hormone therapy; RA = terms, see theNCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms.| |b Number of patients treated plus number of patient controls may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled equals number of patients initially recruited/considered by the researchers who conducted a study; number of patients treated equals number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported.| |c Concurrent therapy for symptoms treated (not cancer).| |d For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.| |e P< .001, acupuncture versus hormone therapy.| versus placebo versus usual care.| (RA and enhanced self-care); 105 fewer 30 (SA)||4 wk||Yes, SSRIs||RA was associated with 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than SA at 6 wk.

No effective treatment exists. Several RCTs have been conducted to study the effect of acupuncture in reducing cancer-related fatigue (see Table 6). One pilot RCT enrolled 47 cancer patients experiencing moderate to severe cancer fatigue and randomly assigned them to one of three groups: acupuncture (N = 15), acupressure (N = 16), or SA (N = 16). Patients in the acupuncture group received six 20-minute acupuncture sessions during a 2-week period; patients in the two acupressure groups were taught to massage RA versus SA points daily for 2 weeks.[ A follow-up RCT (N = 302) by the same group of investigators was published in 2013; among the 246 evaluable patients, acupuncture significantly reduced cancer-related fatigue, anxiety, and depression, and improved QOL when compared with usual care.[ Conversely, two RCTs showed no significant difference between RA and SA in reducing cancer-related fatigue (see Table 6).[ The effect of acupuncture on cancer-related fatigue was also studied as one of the secondary end points in acupuncture for the AIMSS study published in 2014.[ These results showed that acupuncture significantly improved fatigue when compared with usual care alone, although whether it is significantly better than SA will warrant further study. A 2016 pilot RCT of 78 cancer survivors with cancer-related fatigue showed that infrared laser acupuncture point stimulation was safe in cancer patients.

Acupuncture was associated with a decrease in the onset of symptoms and an increased saliva flow in two randomized studies that compared acupuncture with standard care for preventing xerostomia in patients undergoing radiation therapy.[ Compared with standard care, acupuncture significantly improved xerostomia symptoms in patients who experienced the condition following radiation therapy.[ In 2012, one group published two studies on the effect of acupuncture for preventing xerostomia. The first was a pilot study (N = 23); when compared with SA, RA significantly reduced xerostomia questionnaire scores from week 3 through the 1-month follow-up after radiation therapy. However, they did not find significant difference in salivary flow rates between the groups.[ Another study examined long-term effects of acupuncture on xerostomia.[ One phase III clinical trial with sites in the United States and China randomly assigned 399 patients (339 patients were included in the final analysis) to receive true acupuncture (TA), SA, or standard care control (SCC), with a primary endpoint of xerostomia questionnaire score reduction at 1 year.[ The findings from these studies are summarized in Table 7 below. |Reference||Treatment Groups (Enrolled; Treated; Placebo or No Treatment Unknown)c||Results||Level of Evidence real acupuncture; sham acupuncture; SCC = standard care control.| |a For additional information and definition of terms, see theNCI Dictionary of Cancer Termsfor additional information and definition of terms.| |b Number of patients treated plus number of patient controls may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled equals number of patients initially considered by the researcher who conducted a study; number of patients treated equals number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported.| |c Concurrent therapy for symptoms treated (not cancer).| |d Strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has anticancer activity or otherwise improves the well-being of cancer patients.

CIPN can manifest as a variety of symptoms, including pain, paresthesia, sensory loss, and muscle weakness, which can lead to poor dexterity and gait disturbance. Because there is limited effective treatment available, the debilitating symptoms of CIPN can cause delay, dose-reduction, or discontinuation of life-saving treatment. Long-term CIPN often significantly impacts patients' functional abilities and QOL. Depending on the agent used and the length of treatment, CIPN can persist long after chemotherapy completion in up to 55% of patients.[ Acupuncture to treat persistent CIPN from taxane or platinum-based chemotherapy Several studies have investigated the use of acupuncture to alleviate CIPN. Preliminary evidence from two small non-placebo-controlled studies (N = 5 [ In more recent studies, several RCTs found further promising effects of acupuncture in treating CIPN. CIPN from bortezomib or thalidomide Studies evaluating the effects of acupuncture on bortezomib and/or thalidomide -induced peripheral neuropathy have also shown promising results. Two studies of patients with multiple myeloma (N = 27 [ Prevention of CIPN In a phase IIA trial of acupuncture to prevent progression of CIPN severity from weekly paclitaxel in breast cancer patients, acupuncture prevented progression of CIPN severity in 26 of 27 patients, yielding a significantly lower progression rate compared with historical controls.[ Acupuncture for CIPN review A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven databases through August 2019 examined 386 cancer patients from six randomized controlled trials of high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale.[ Conclusion on the use of acupuncture to treat CIPN Emerging clinical trials comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture or SA showed promising efficacy for the use of acupuncture to reduce CIPN symptoms. Additional research needs to be done on exploring the mechanism of acupuncture to reduce CIPN symptoms and identify the sensitive population that may benefit most from acupuncture. |Reference||Trial Design||Intervention||Treatment Groups (Enrolled; Treated; Placebo or No Treatment = chemotherapy-induced CTCAE Adverse Events; EA = electroacupuncture; EORTC QLQ-C30 = European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; FACT/GOG-NTX = Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity; FACT-NTX = Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity = manual acupuncture; NCS = sham acupuncture; TCM = traditional Chinese medicine; VAS = visual analog scale.| |a For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.| |[ ||RCT||EA/SA/usual care||75; 27 (RA), 24 (SA); 24 (usual care)||NRS||Significant improvement in NRS-rated pain compared with sham and usual care control||1iiC| |[ ||RCT||Ear needle at real points/ear needle at placebo points/seeds at placebo points||90; 29 (acupuncture), 30 (acupuncture at placebo points); 31 (assigned seeds at placebo points)||VAS pain||VAS Pain (acupuncture)/3 once per month||1sC| |[ ||RCT||MA + baths/daily high dose vitamin B1 and B6/placebo||60; 14 (EA), 14 (hydroelectric baths), 15 (vitamin B1 and B6); 17 (placebo)||NRS||No significant difference among 4 arms; Limitations: baseline; 20 21; 26||CIPN symptoms may be a lifelong concern for some breast cancer survivors. There have been a number of case reports, retrospective chart reviews, and pilot studies demonstrating that acupuncture was safe and potentially effective in reducing swelling and improving symptoms in patients with upper- and lower-extremity edema.[ A 2013 single-arm clinical trial (N = 37) evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of acupuncture in treating patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).[ A 2016 RCT of 30 patients showed that warm acupuncture (acupuncture and moxibustion) improved BCRL in 51% of patients compared with 26% of patients treated with oral diosmin in the control group.[ A RCT of acupuncture versus usual care WLC studying 82 BCRL patients did not show a significant difference in arm circumference or bioimpedance.[ Ileus Three RCTs have studied the effect of acupuncture in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and have generated conflicting results. In 2010, one study reported the results of an RCT studying the effect of EA compared with usual care and found that EA did not significantly prevent prolonged postoperative ileus.[ In 2012, another study reported the results of a phase II RCT that compared RA with SA (N = 90) for reducing postcolectomy ileus. No significant differences were reported between RA and SA in reducing postcolectomy ileus as measured by the time that the patient first tolerated solid food and the time that the patient first passed flatus or a bowel movement.[ In 2013, a third study reported the results of a three-arm RCT (N = 165) that compared EA with SA and no acupuncture in reducing duration of postoperative ileus after laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. EA significantly shortened the time to defecation and the hospital stay compared with SA and no acupuncture.[ A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs involving 776 cancer patients showed that acupuncture was associated with earlier recovery of bowel function (shorter time to first flatus and defecation) compared with the control (no acupuncture, or SA or other types of active treatments).[ Sleep A number of RCTs have studied the effect of acupuncture in improving depression and sleep quality in cancer patients. In 2011, one study (N = 80) reported that acupuncture significantly improved depression and sleep quality when compared with fluoxetine. Patients receiving acupuncture reported significantly greater reductions in scores on the Self-rating Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.[ The effect of acupuncture on sleep has been studied as one of the secondary endpoints in an AIMSS study published in 2014.[ A 2019 RCT of cancer survivors reported that even though both cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and acupuncture produced a clinically significant reduction in insomnia severity, CBT-I is superior to acupuncture. Subgroup analyses showed that acupuncture was more effective than CBT-I in pain reduction, and CBT-I was more effective for improving insomnia in highly educated White males with no pain at baseline.[ Other treatment-related side effects Many studies have reported on the effects of acupuncture on cancer or other cancer treatment-related symptoms, including weight loss, cough, hemoptysis, fever, anxiety, depression, proctitis, dysphonia, clock-drawing test; FACT-COG = functional assessment of cancer treatmentcognitiontest; RA = real acupuncture; RCT = randomized = wait-list control.| |a For additional information and definition of terms, see theNCI Dictionary of Cancer Termsfor additional information and definition of terms.| |b Number of patients treated plus number of patient controls may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled equals number of patients initially considered by the researcher who conducted a study; number of patients treated equals number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported.| |c Concurrent therapy for symptoms treated (not cancer).| |d Strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has anticancer activity or otherwise improves the well-being of cancer patients.

The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Serious adverse effects of acupuncture are rare. Reported accidents and infections appear to be related to violations of sterile procedure, negligence of the practitioner, or both.[ Minor adverse effects of acupuncture such as the following, have been reported: These minor adverse effects can be minimized by appropriate patient management, including local pressing and massage at the needling site after treatment.[ Acupuncture in children has not been studied extensively; however, adverse effects appear to be rare and limited to the same effects as observed in adults.[ References: To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must: Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis, see the Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies. It is noteworthy that almost all reported clinical studies on the effects of acupuncture on cancer or cancer therapy -related symptoms focus on symptom management rather than the disease itself. Investigations into the effects of acupuncture on chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting, many of which were randomized and well-controlled, produced the most convincing findings. A number of randomized controlled trials have reported on the effect of acupuncture in alleviating other cancer treatment-associated side effects, with many showing promising evidence supporting the use of acupuncture. Additional phase III clinical trials are ongoing. The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Human/Clinical Studies Added Acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain in cancer survivors as a new subsection. Added text about a 2020 randomized controlled trial that examined the effect of real acupuncture (RA) versus sham acupuncture (SA) in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among 134 patients with advanced cancer (cited Li et al. as reference 56). Revised Table 4 to include the Li et al. 2020 study. Added text to state that an analysis of quality of life (QOL) endpoints showed that both RA and SA significantly improved QOL compared with usual care, but no difference between RA and SA was found (cited Bao et al. as reference 104). Added text to state that a secondary analysis of a 2019 trial evaluated the effect of acupuncture versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on pain in 70 cancer survivors with both insomnia and pain. Acupuncture reduced pain more significantly than CBT-I at week 8, but at 20-week follow-up, both groups showed significant pain reduction without intergroup difference (cited Yang et al. as reference 130).
