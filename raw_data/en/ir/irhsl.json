Therefore, it is interesting to learn about the types of food that are considered brain food for babies. A baby's crucial brain development continues till they reach three years. At this age, they start reacting to their surroundings, thinking, learning, and solving problems. Exposure to activities such as sports, music, and exploring their surroundings may aid their gray matter functions. In addition, the brain cells require nutrition to mature optimally. Foods rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and healthy fats support neuronal growth and help maintain healthy brain cells ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/)). Continue reading to learn more about food substances that can boost brain development in children and provide them with nourishment to help them become smart and intelligent. 10 Best Foods To Boost Brain Development In Babies: Here are ten foods you can feed your child during their early childhood to help boost your child's brain power and IQ. 1. Greek Yogurt: This acts like a super baby brain development food. Greek yogurt keeps the brain cell membranes flexible, it aids in the functioning of the synapses in sending and receiving information.

Broccoli: Broccoli is another superfood for your baby's brain. It is a good source of B vitamins such as folate, riboflavin and vitamin B6 that aids neuronal development.

Omega-3 fatty acids aid the growth and function of the brain in babies ( [7](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-Consumer/)). 6. Eggs: Egg is a nutrient-rich food. It nutrients like [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/benefits-of-fish-oil-for-babies_00352009/), zinc, lutein and choline, which enhances focus and concentration in children.

It helps to improve memory in babies ( [8](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470839/)) ( [9](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/)). [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905294/)). 7. Whole grains: Whole grains improve concentration in babies by providing their brain a constant supply of energy.
