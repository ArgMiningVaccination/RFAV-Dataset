The least invasive and most holistic modalities are the first choice. The ultimate goal and focus of treatment is to successfully identify and address the cause of the disease rather than suppressing the body's symptoms, which are signs of bodily disharmony and not the disease itself. The Naturopathic approach often includes the doctor educating patients about their lifestyle choices, as well as their physiology. Naturopaths work to identify and address the underlying causes of illness using their unique, Therapeutic Order: - Remove Obstacles to Health - Stimulate the Self-Healing Mechanisms - Strengthen Weakened Systems - Correct Structural Integrity - Use Natural Substances to Restore and Regenerate Health WHAT DOES A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR DO? Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care profession that combines the wisdom of nature with the rigors of modern science. Licensed Naturopathic Doctors (NDs/NMDs) are trained to diagnose and treat all chronic and acute health conditions. Naturopathic Doctors are trained in conventional diagnostic techniques such as physical exams, laboratory testing, differential diagnosis, x-ray and ultrasound imaging, and psychological assessment. In addition, NDs use specialized laboratory tests that assess physiological function, as well as other observational and physical techniques. NDs endeavor to identify disease states in the context of the individual's overall health. Naturopathic Doctors collaborate with all other branches of the healthcare team, referring patients to other health care practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. They care for patients of all ages and genders, tailoring treatment protocols for each patient, and placing a strong emphasis on prevention, patient education and self-care. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES In addition to Naturopathic consults, Dr. Kargman offers the following in-person services: Acupuncture Dr. Kargman is a licensed acupuncturist and combines a variety of styles of acupuncture in her treatment. Hypnotherapy Dr. Kargman, trained in Ericksonian Hypnotherapy, utilizes this modality to enhance her naturopathic practice. The principles of hypnotherapy compliment the fundamentals of naturopathic medicine. At its core, this modality is a form of potent self-healing. Hypnotherapy is most effective on illnesses that have a strong psycho-emotional component, such as gastrointestinal issues, pain management, fertility challenges, anxiety, depression as well as habit modification. Craniosacral Therapy Dr. Kargman, trained by the Upledger Institute, incorporates CranioSacral Therapy (CST) with acupuncture, as a gentle, hands-on treatment that may provide relief from a variety of symptoms. CST uses a light touch to examine membranes, assist in releasing the body's connective tissue tension as well as increase movement of fluids in and around the Central Nervous System (CNS). Release of restrictions in the craniosacral system can improve the functioning of the CNS, as well as many other systems of the body. Areas may include but are not limited to, digestive, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and circulatory. CST has also been shown to help with physical components related to such somatic conditions as post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety.
