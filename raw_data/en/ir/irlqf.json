In a 2003 cover article by physician Kimball Atwood IV we described in detail \"the ongoing problem\" of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative and Medicine (NCCAM) and its funding and promo- tion of pseudoscience. We return to the subject in this issue with another cover article. Eugenie V. Mielczarek and Brian D. Engler's \"MeasuringMythology\" summarizes their detailed study examining the last twenty yearsof NCCAM grant awards. Our authors looked at all the research projects. They found lots of startling concepts\u2014\"distance by the tax- payer with few if any real results. (The paucity of published results is suspi-cious in itself.) The details provide strong support for their conclusion: \"Wefound no discoveries in alternative medicine that justify the existence of thecenter; Congress has mandated into the health care bill the tax burden of paying for myths and commercial interests.\" It is time to ask how much longer NCCAM should be allowed to give false credibility to sham medicine and spend taxpayers' money for still more research into claimed treatments that are unsupported by scientific knowl- edge\u2014and as a result bear virtually no hope of any medical or scientific pay- off. In these hard economic times, this waste should be of national concern. * * * I just got back from CSIcon New Orleans 2011, our new Halloween-weekend conference \"dedicated to scientific inquiry and critical thinking.\" It was a great event. The conference marks awel come resumption, after aneight-year hiatus, of Committeefor Skeptical Inquiry/S KEPTI- CALINQUIRERconferences (now with our Center for Inquiry as cosponsor) in the proud tradition of the CSICOP conferences we used to have fairly regularly. Executive Director Barry Karr reports that most comments fromparticipants have been \"amazingly positive and overwhelmingly enthusiastic.\"Attendees said they look forward to the next one and will recommend the con-ference to their friends. My fellow CSI Executive Council members alsothought it a big hit: \"[an] absolute (and informative) delight\"; \"this will be a skeptics meeting people will indeed remember\"; \"a great revival of somethingthat has been missing the last years\"; \"exceptionally well-organized... wonder- ful mix of enlightenment and education\"; with interesting speakers andunique events\"; and \"encouraging and inspiring.\" I wasn't involved in organizing it, so I feel I may here further express my own view: the program content was superb, the presentations well done, the social events great fun, and the overall experience for me memorable. The social events included a Saturday night parade led by a New Orleans jazz band to a French Quarter bar with a New Orleans funk band and three- quarters of our attendees in costume\u2014some elaborate, some clever (skeptically speaking). As I said in my introductory remarks to the conference, skepticism is not only important, it is fun. We'll have some reports in our next issue. \u2014K ENDRICKFRAZIER[ FROM THE EDITOR Skep ti cal In quir er THE MAG A ZINE FOR SCI ENCE AND RE A SON ED I TOR Kend rick Fra zi er ED I TO RI AL BOARD James E.

F RENCH Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 5Ironically, British psychics didn't see it coming. They have recently been on thereceiving end of a veritable storm ofnegative publicity following allegationsthat Sally Morgan, who describes her- self on her website as \"Britain's best-loved psychic,\" may have been caughtusing a fraudulent technique to con- vince her audiences of her mediumistic ability. The allegations began September 12, 2011, when a caller named Sue phoned into the Livelineshow on RT\u00c9 Radio 1, an Irish radio station. Sue reported that the previous evening she had been to see Morgan in action at the Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin. She had been seated at the back of the theater on the fourth floor and had initially been im- pressed by the psychic's performance. However, as the second half of the showstarted, Sue became aware of a man's voice coming from an open window just behind her, from a small room (\"like a projection room\"). She realized that whatever the male voice said, Morgan repeated on stage about ten secondslater. An usher at the theater realized what was happening and quietly closed the window. The voice was not heard again. Other callers supported Sue's ac-count (visit http://bit.ly/qDlcuJ to listen to the radio show). Sue believed that the mystery voice was feeding information to Morgan via a hidden earpiece attached to her mi- crophone headset. She further specu- lated that this information may well have been gathered from audience members by accomplices of Morgan en- gaging people in conversation as they queued up before the show began. Given that this is a standard technique used by fraudulent mediums, this is not an unreasonable speculation. The theater's general manager claimed that the voice heard by Sue and other audience members belonged to two theater employees and was not sup-plying Morgan with information. Sally Morgan Enterprises also denied that the medium was being fed information during the show. Most readers of this magazine will immediately spot the similarity be tweenthese allegations and the case of Peter Popoff, the fraudulent faith healer ex- posed by James Randi back in 1986.Popoff claimed that he was receiving in- formation about members of his audi- ence directly from God. In fact, his wifewas relaying the information to him via his \"hearing aid.\" At the time, Popoff was fleecing his poor, sick followers to the tune of around $4 million permonth. Following his exposure, Popoff went bankrupt in 1987\u2014but he is now back, earning even more than he was in the 1980s. The allegations relating to Sally Mor- gan initially received very little coverage. The Irish Independent ran the story on September 13 (see http://bit.ly/mPoi5x), but it looked like that would be the only coverage the story would get and most of Morgan's fans would probably never even hear about the allegations. I thought that the story merited wider exposure, so Icontacted Ian Sample of the Guardianto see if he would like me to write the storyfor the Guardian's online science pages.[ NEWS aNdCOMMENT Geo Swaine/LFI/Photoshot/NewscomSI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 56Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerIni tially, he wasn't keen on the grounds that he didn't want to give free publicity to psychics. I persuaded Ian by pointing out that I thought it was a good idea to give psychics as much bad publicity as we could. My article, posted on September20, 2011, generated more comments thanany other piece I've written for theGuardian(www.guardian.co.uk/science/ 2011/sep/20/psychic-sally-morgan-hears-voices). I do not have psychic powers, so I make no apology for not foreseeing what would happen next. I tweetedabout my article and a few dozen people retweeted it. Others also tweeted about it, including Simon Singh, Richard Wiseman, and James Randi. The media picked up on the story and within four days several British newspapers had already run articles strongly critical of psychics in general and Sally Morgan in particular, including the Telegraph (http://tgr.ph/opcWIg), Ex press(http:// bit.ly/rpVUyc), and the Daily Mail (http://bit.ly/reTW3s). There is a cer- tain irony here, as such newspapersoften run stories that are little morethan gushing endorsements for the lat- est psychic superstar. There has also been a great deal of dis- cussion regarding this case and fraudulentpsychics in general on local and national radio. I have personally done several in- terviews on the topic, as has science writer Simon Singh. I think my favoritemoment was listening to Singh challengenone other than Uri Geller to put his powers to the test in our laboratory inorder to win Randi's Million Dollar Prize(http://bbc.in/npV4MB). Uri's response?(Sit down, dear reader\u2014this may comeas a shock!) He refused. On Friday, October 7, 2011, it was announced that Sally Morgan had in- structed Atkins Thomson, a London law firm experienced in matters of media law, to \"commence libel action inrelation [to] various articles in the press.\" As of the time of this writing(October 23, 2011), it remains unclearagainst whom any such action would bedirected. Indeed, there is some specula-tion that the announcement was in- tended as a scare tactic to try to stem the outpouring of bad publicity that has been directed against British psychics ingeneral and Morgan herself in particu- lar. If that was the intention, the tactic appears to have failed. For example, it was subsequently reported that a video on Morgan's own website clearly shows her removing an earpiece as she comes off stage after one of her shows(http://bit.ly/qXAke6). Simon Singh has published a piece in the Guardianexplicitly inviting Mor- gan to resolve the controversy by prov- ing her claims of psychic ability underproperly controlled conditions (see http://bit.ly/nUENUg). He is collabo-rating with Merseyside Skeptics (www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk) and my own Anomalistic Psychology Re search Unit (www.gold.ac.uk/apru) to design a suit-able test of Morgan's claims. Alterna- tively, Morgan can work with us to de-vise a suitably well-controlled protocol that suits her. So far, she has not replied to our invitation. You don't need psychic powers to foresee that the negative pub- licity for \"possibly-not-so-psychic Sally\" will continue for quite a while! n Christopher C. French is the head of the Anom- alistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and editor of The Skeptic (United Kingdom). As reported by BBC News Online (Sep tember 23, 2011), an Irish coroner has officially declared a seventy-six-year-old man to have died of \"spontaneous combustion.\" The body of Michael Faherty of Ballybane, Galway, Ireland, was discovered severely destroyed on Decem ber 22, 2010. Faherty's remains were found lying \"with his head closest to an open fire- place\"\u2014yet, without ex plaining themselves, firefighters con- cluded that that obvious source of ignition was not involved. Galway coroner Ciaran McLough lin then concluded, apparently using the process of elimination, that the death must have been caused by spontaneous human combustion (SHC) \"for which,\" he says, \"there is no adequate explanation.\" In fact, the coroner's ar-First Case of Spontaneous Human Combustion?

Benjamin Radford Russian researchers participating in a conference looking for the Yeti\u2014theAsian version of the North AmericanBigfoot\u2014claimed to have found \"in -disputable proof\" of the long-sought mystery beast in October. The Yeti is said to be muscular and covered with dark grayish or reddish-brown hair and is be- lieved to weigh between 200 and 400pounds. The Yeti is supposedly relativelyshort compared to Bigfoot's ten to twelve feet, averaging only about six or seven feet in height. Despite dozens of expeditions into the remote mountain regions ofRussia, China, and Nepal, the Yeti's exis-tence remains unproven. Could the new find be true? This is of course not the first time searchershave claimed strong, or even indis-putable, proof of the Yeti. In 2007,American television show host JoshGates claimed he had found three mys- terious footprints in snow near a streamin Nepal's Himalayas. Locals were skep-tical, suggesting that he simply misin-terpreted a bear track. No follow-up in-formation ever emerged, and the Gatestrack, once touted internationally as strong evidence of the Yeti, is now largely forgotten. In 2010 a strange, nearly hairless an- imal was captured by hunters in the Sichuan province of China. Research ersand news reporters suggested that a Yeti had finally been captured alive, though the proclamation turned out to be pre- mature: embarrassed officials eventually admitted it was nothing more than a mangy civet\u2014a small, cat-like animal native to the region. So what is this new, indisputable proof? Apparently some gray hairs found in a clump of moss in a Russian cave. Ac-cording to a spokesman for the Ke- merovo region in western Siberia, \"Dur- ing the expedition to the Azas skaya cave, conference participants gathered indis- putable proof that the Shoria mountains are inhabited by the 'Snow Man.' Theyfound his footprints, his supposed bed, and various markers ... which the Yetiuses to denote his territory.\" It's not clear why, if the researchers were certain that the Yeti had recentlyused the cave, they didn't simply set up cameras to record the creature\u2014or wait for it to return to the cave, where it could be trapped and captured alive, offering conclusive proof of the Yeti's existence. Some Russians view the announce- ment with considerable suspicion and skepticism, suggesting that the sudden discovery is a publicity stunt to in creasetourism in the impoverished coal-miningregion. So far it seems to have worked, as hundreds of people have come to tour thecave. In fact, the event seemed more of a media circus than a scientific expedition when former Russian heavyweight boxer Niko lai Valuev recently toured the cave\"searching\" for the Yeti, to great media at- tention. All new evidence of Bigfoot andYeti should be carefully and scientificallyanalyzed; however, if history is any guide,this latest Yeti discovery will soon fadeaway, leaving the creature's existence in question. American television channel host and explorer Josh Gates displays an alleged footprint of the mythical snow man \"Yeti\" at his hotel in Kathmandu, Nepal. gument is a classic example of faulty logic called \"an argument from ignorance\": basically, \"we don't know, therefore we do know.\" Certainly, we cannot explain one unknown by invoking another. Questioned about the case by CBS News's online Health Watch (Septem ber 27), I noted that the Irish authorities seem unaware of the scientific research into alleged SHC\u2014not a single case of which has been confirmed by mainstream science. In typical cases victims are impaired by age, infirmity, or drugs and so are more likely to have an accident and are less able to respond ef- fectively to it. A spark dropping from smoking materials or pro- pelled from a fireplace may land on the clothes, smolder, and burst into flame. As the victim succumbs, his clothing mayfunction like a wick, absorbing melted body fat to fuel more burn- ing to destroy still more tissue\u2014a cyclic process known as the Wick Effect. In this manner the body is consumed over time at a relatively low temperature that may have little effect on sur- roundings. In researching the purported phenomenon, forensic analyst John F. Fischer and I investigated thirty historic cases and pub lished the results in an arson investigation journal, as well as in my Secrets of the Supernatural , 1988, pp. 149-57.

In the recently published Steve Jobs, biographer Walter Isaacson unveilsmany heretofore hidden details sur- rounding the life and death of the notoriously guarded genius, whose in- novative \"i\" (standing for \"Internet\")gad getry has revolutionized the way hu-manity interacts in work and play. Jobs's gaunt appearance in 2003 led to much public speculation about his health. It was not until the following year that he underwent surgery to re- move a cancerous tumor from his pan- creas, and his subsequent liver transplant in 2009 seemed a last-ditch effort to sal- vage a few additional months or years of life from one of the most uniformlydeadly of all diagnoses. But the type of cancer that Jobs had\u2014 an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor\u2014often offers a far more promising prog- nosis than does the typical pancreaticadenocarcinoma. Whereas the latter al-most uniformly leads to death within ayear of discovery, Jobs's cell type, whichcomprises only 5 percent of cases, cancarry a greater than 50 percent chance forcure if treated in time. \"He was lucky,\"writes Isaacson, \"that it was detected so early\u2014as the by-product of a routine kid- ney screening\u2014and thus could be surgi- cally removed before it had definitely spread.\" Jobs fancied himself a lifelong skep- tic\u2014for instance, he abandoned Chris - tianity at age thirteen when his pastor couldn't explain to his satisfaction why God allows famine to claim the lives of innocent children. But his skepticism seems to have been mostly directed to- ward the conventional rather than the paranormal. As Isaacson puts it, \"In the past he had been rewarded for what his wife called his 'magical thinking'\u2014hisassumption that he could will things to be as he wanted.\" One relatively benign example: Jobs's belief that he needn't bathe more than once per week when adhering to a strict fruit-and-vegetable diet, which he often did even as a teenager. A less benign one: that what Penn Jillette would term\"NewAge (rhymes with 'sewage')\" ther- apies might prove as effective as the dreaded knife in ridding his body of can- cer. From the book: \"Specifically, he kept to a strict vegan diet, with large quantitiesof fresh carrot and fruit juices. To thatregimen he added acu puncture, a varietyof herbal remedies, and a few other treat- ments he found on the Internet or byconsulting people around the country, in- cluding a psychic.\" After such \"alternative\" therapies failed to magically effect a cure, Jobs fi- nally capitulated to the pleadings of physicians and family that he undergo surgery. His wife described for Isaacson\"her husband's doctors tearing up withjoy\" nine months earlier when the nee- dle biopsy results had unexpectedly of- fered far more than a mere glimmer of hope that their patient might survive for the long haul. But the hiatus may have provided the window of opportunity for his malignancy to spread\u2014three liver metastases were found. Jobs's ensuing chemotherapy, which worked amazingly well for a time, was uniquely targeted to his tumor cells, thanks to his having \"become one of the first twenty people in the world to have all the genes of his cancer tumor as well as of his normalDNA sequenced.\" The price tag for that procedure ex- ceeded $100,000, a drop in the bucketfor a billionaire. Jobs's magical mystery (de)tour through the world of iPhony cures may have ultimately proven far more costly. n Gary Posner, MD, is founder of Tampa Bay Skep- tics and a CSI scientific consultant.

A report presented by four different sources to the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices (ACIP), an in-dependent panel of experts that advisesthe Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) on vaccine policies,found no signals to link Garda sil di-rectly to any of the serious adverse ef-fects that have been publicized in themedia. To clarify this and help consumers make the best-informed decision be fore vaccinating, it is helpful to understand the difference between a side effect (caused directly by the vaccine) and an adverse effect (which usually occurswithin six weeks after the administra- tion of a vaccine but may or may not be related to the vaccine). 1) The most common side effects re- ported are pain followed by swelling and redness at the site of injection. These temporary symptoms usually re-solve within a few days, as is the case with most other vaccines. 2) The number of adverse effects that link the HPV vaccines to the nervous system disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syn - drome is around one to two out of every 100,000 cases\u2014about the same as the number of cases that occur in the gen- eral population as a sheer coincidenceor chance\u2014and such disorders have thesame statistical occurrence as the pop- ulation at large that has not been vac- cinated. It is obvious that the greater the number of shots administered (as ofJune 22, 2011, 35 million doses of Gar-dasil had been distributed), the morelikely the chance for these rare and un- expected events to occur. It should be noted that there is no report from the CDC of Gardasil resulting in mentalretardation. The HPV vaccine has established a decent track record at five years post-li- censure. Based upon these current find- ings, the FDA strongly recommendsvaccinating the target population: nine-to twenty-six-year-old females andmales. The CDC will continue to be vigilant and monitor safety data on an ongoing basis. Nevertheless, it is helpful to remind ourselves that regardless ofhow well studies are conducted, gray zones of risk exist. The history of med-icine has shown us that such unfortu- nate events do occur for unknown rea-sons, and research is underway to studyif genetics and environmental factors have a role to play in such rare and se- rious events. One should always balance the great - er good with these potentially minimal risks when evaluating the ad vantages of-fered by new and emerging medicines. Scaremongering for personal political gain does not bode well for the educationand welfare of the public. In the case ofthe HPV vaccine, it would be a shame if negative attention created by a few rare effects hampers the efforts to reach mil- lions of women and men who risk losingtheir lives to HPV-related diseases, in- cluding cancers and particularly cervicalcancer, both in our country and around the world. n Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 9COMMENTARY] The HPV Vaccine Controversy SHOBHA S.

They are also called botanical medicines, remedies, or supplements. In-variably they contain a mixture of ingre-dients, some of which may be pharma- cologically active. Frequently they aremarketed as dietary supplements, which are not required to have proven efficacy, safety, or quality in the United States and most other countries (Marcus andGrollman 2002, 347). Thus the spec- trum is wide with both high- and low- quality products often placed side by side. Calls for tighter regulation are made regularly (e.g., U.S. GovernmentAccountability Office 2009) but are rou- tinely frustrated. Herbal medicines are mostly used by consumers for self-treatment of minorsymptoms. Doctors rarely employ them (except in some countries, such as Ger- many) and, crucially, traditional herbal- ists use an entirely different approach with each treatment. The majority of herbal medicines have not been scientifically tested. Butsome have been adequately analyzed, standardized, and submitted to clinical trials (Ernst et al. 2006). St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is perhaps the best-investigated example. herbal antidepressant has sev-eral pharmacologically active ingredi- ents that have been standardized inhigh-quality products and tested for ef-ficacy and safety in approximately fiftyclinical trials and many post-marketing surveillance studies. The results leavelittle doubt that St. John's Wort is ef- ficacious for mild to moderate de- pression. It is also relatively safe as long as it is not combined withother drugs (Ernst et al. 2006). When taken together with other med-ications, St. John's Wort can powerfully interact such that it lowers the plasma level of many drugs (Izzo and Ernst2001, 15) which, of course, can have se-rious consequences. Thus the exampleof St. John's Wort goes some way to-ward demonstrating that herbal medi- cines can do both good andharm to pa- tients. In other words, some herbal medicines are complicated pharmaco-logical treatments and are biologically plausible (Schulz and H\u00e4nsel 2003). Many other herbal medicines are not well-researched; therefore we can- not be certain about their risk-benefitprofile (Ernst et al. 2006). Even the well-researched examples like St. John'sWort should be approached with healthyMedicines Derived from Herbs EDZARD ERNST Herbal medicines are currently quite popular; con- sumers are spending billions on them each year. En- thusiasts praise them as natural and safe, while skep- tics often see them as little more than glorified placebos. The general public is frequently confused by such contro- versies, by a plethora of misinformation, and by the bewil- dering categories of medicines derived from herbs (U.S. Government Accountability Office 2010). Here I will try to clear up some of this confusion by explaining what the different categories are. SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 1112 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerskepticism: the few high-quality prod- ucts available are outnumbered by sup- plements of low quality and dubiouscontent. Thus the market of herbal medicines is littered with products that contain little or no herbal ingredients(Sievenpiper et al. 2004, 27), are adulter- ated with prescription drugs (Miller and Stripp 2007, 9), or are contaminated withheavy metals (Buettner et al. 2009, 24; Cohen 2009, 361). Synthetic Drugs Derived From Herbs Many of our modern drugs (e.g., aspirin, Morphium, Tamoxifen, Vin cris tin, etc.) were originally derived from botanical material. In fact, many skeptics wonder why we cannot also extract and synthe- size the active ingredients from well-re- searched herbal medicines such as St. John's Wort and generate single ingredi- ents derived from that plant. This wouldclearly solve several problems inherent in herbal medicine, such as standardization. While this approach of creating pure compounds does work occasionally, it fails in other instances. One reason canbe the fact that herbal medicines tend to have not one but a multitude of pharma- cologically active ingredients. Thus ex- tracting only one ingredient might re-duce the pharmacological activity of the whole plant extract. Single ingredients derived from herb - al extracts can no longer be considered herbal medicines as, by definition, herbal medicines are based on the whole plant.Nevertheless, such drugs are reminders of the fact that many plants contain mol-ecules that are pharmacologically active and can thus have both beneficial and detrimental health effects. Traditional Herbalism If a patient consults a Chinese, Indian, Japanese, or European herbalist, he willbe diagnosed and treated according to obsolete and untested principles of di- agnosis, pathophysiology, and so forth. Treatment will typically be individual- ized according to the characteristics ofeach patient and based on complex, tai-lor-made herbal mixtures of several (up to ten) herbal extracts. This means thatten patients suffering from depression may receive ten different, individualized concoctions, none of which might con- tain St. John's Wort, the only evidence- based herbal antidepressant. In other words, the biological plausibility of tra- ditional herbalism is questionable. Traditional herbalism is thus dra- matically different from the herbal medicine described above. To scientifi- cally test its value can be complex but itis doubtlessly possible. Few rigorousstudies of this approach are currently available, and those that have been pub- lished do not support the notion that traditional herbalism is effective (Guo et al. 2007, 83). Neither can we be certain about its safety. Because the tailor-made concoc- tions of traditional herbalists may contain a confusing number of active ingredients, the potential for toxicity, herb-drug in- teraction, contamination, and so on can be considerable. More vigorous regula- tion of herbalists, a subject currently being discussed in Europe (Hawkes 2010, 339), is therefore required. Ten patients suffering from depression may receive ten different, individualized concoctions, none of which might contain St. John's Wort, the only evidence-based herbal antidepressant. In other words, the biological plausibility of traditional herbalism is questionable.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 12Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 13Homeopathic Remedies The public frequently confuses home- opathy with herbal medicine. The error usually arises because many homeo-pathic remedies are produced from \"mother tinctures,\" which are based on herbal extracts. Thus they can carry the same (or similar) names as herbal prod- ucts. The difference is that homeo- pathic remedies are typically highly di-luted and therefore contain no active ingredients at all. Thus homeopathy lacks any biological plausibility. Arnica is a good example. It is used as an herbal cream as well as a homeo-pathic remedy. Because it is toxic, Ar- nica should not be taken as an oral herbal medicine. Being highly diluted,homeopathic Arnica is, of course, both nontoxic and entirely ineffective (Ernst and Pittler 1998, 133). Bach Flower Remedies These products are currently very pop- ular for self-medication, particularly inEurope. They are produced by placing freshly picked flowers in spring water. Thus they are also plant-derived andfrequently confused with herbal medi- cines. After the flowers have floated for a while, the water is mixed with brandyand sold at high prices as Bach FlowerRemedies. Bach Flower Remedies were devel- oped by the British physician Edward Bach, who had previously worked as a homeopath. His remedies have, how- ever, little in common with homeopa- thy except, of course, that they are nei- ther biologically plausible nor of proven effectiveness for any condition (Ernst 2010, 140). Anthroposophical Medicines Rudolf Steiner developed his anthropo- sophical medicines about one hundred years ago (Ernst 2008, 150). They areproduced according to protocols similar to those of homeopathic remedies. Un- like homeopathy, however, anthropo- sophical medicine does not follow the \"like cures like\" principle. As many anthroposophical medi- cines are based on plants, they are alsooften confused with herbal medicines. The best known example is Iscador\u00ae, a fermented mistletoe preparation that isa highly popular treatment for cancer inEurope. Numerous trials exist, but col- lectively their results do not show thatthis is an effective therapy (Horneber et al. 2008, 16). Conclusion Many articles on herbal medicine con- clude by stating that more research is needed. Between 1999 and 2007, theNational Institutes of Health has spent US$1.9 billion on research into dietary supplements (Regan, Wambogo, andHaggans 2011, 141). Not all of thismoney was well invested (Ernst et al. 2011). I therefore advocate not necessar- ily more research but better-designed studies into the few plausibly beneficial aspects of herbal medicine. n References Buettner, C., K.J. Mukamal, P.

On Octo-ber 21, 2010, the Independent Investi-gations Group (IIG) conducted a dou-ble-blind test to determine whetherPower Balance's claims that the holo- grams on their bracelets (then sellingonline for $29.95) work with the body's\"energy field\" to improve strength, flex-ibility, and balance by \"optimizing thebody's natural energy flow.\" The com-pany's website also included a tangle ofinformation that attempted to drawconnections between Eastern medicine,\"body frequencies,\" and \"positive en-ergy.\" The following excerpt, once avail-able on the Power Balance site, gives in-sight into the company's rationalebehind its product: \"Most everythinghas a frequency inherent to it. Somefrequencies react positively with yourbody and others negatively. When the hologram comes in contact with your body's energy field, it allows your bodyto interact with the natural, beneficialfrequency stored within the hologram. This re sults in improved energy flow throughout your body.\" (See HarrietHall's excellent article about these claims,\"Power Balance Technology: Pseudo - scientific Silliness Suckers Card-Carry- ing Surfers,\" in the May/June 2010S KEPTICALINQUIRER; also available on- lineat www.csicop.org/si/show/power_balance_technology.) The company relies heavily on testimo-nials from blue-chip pro athletes like Shaquille O'Neal of the Boston Celtics,Lamar Odom of the Los Angeles Lak-ers, and Derrick Rose of the ChicagoBulls. Odom and others are paid to en-dorse the product and do wear thebracelets during games.Power Balance once used highly sub- jective applied kinesiology tests to demonstrate that the bracelets work. Inthese types of \"tests,\" one person ana-lyzes another's resistance and balance by applying pressure in various ways. (Theapplied kinesiology videos are no longer on Power Balance's website, www.power balance.com.) The applied kinesiology method of testing the bracelet's effectiveness is problematic and full of flaws for a num- ber of reasons. There is no way to know from videos of these tests how muchpressure the tester is exerting, whether the technique used to apply the pressure is identical each time, or whether the re- sistance from the person being tested isthe same each time. Most people's flex- ibility seems to improve from their first stretch to their second stretch regardlessof whether they are wearing the bracelet. 14 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirer[SPECIAL REPORT Power Balance Bracelets a Bust in Tests Members of the Independent Investigations Group and sixteen volunteers, including former Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes, conducted a test of Power Balance bracelets. The results will not be surprising to skeptics. JAMES UNDERDOWN Former Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes and IIG founder James Underdown.A volunteer running the test course.

Also, the people being tested may un- consciously change their own resistance when they know the bracelet is on and think it should be helping. Indeed, the psychological effect of believing the bracelet will help may be the only real ef- fect Power Balance can claim. Every ath- lete knows that confidence is an asset. To remove this suggestive influence of the bracelets, we decided to test six- teen volunteers, including former Olym pic gymnast Dominique Dawes, on a brief obstacle course that included a 16'\u00d74\"\u00d74\" balance beam, a figure- eight-shaped course (which our volun- teers ran while holding two thirty- pound dumbbells), and a stretch test.Dawes was there with Yahoo News, which shot some video of our test for a story (http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ weekend-edition/power-balance-wrist- bands-053237028.html). Dawes, by the way, arrived with a healthy skepticism that seemed to get even stronger when she learned of the test results.In random order, each of the sixteen volunteers went through the course four times: once with the real bracelet on and three times with each of the bracelets that had no holograms. The test was double blind; we taped over the bracelets so that no one\u2014volunteers and testers alike\u2014knew whether eachvolunteer was wearing a real Power Bal-ance bracelet or one that had had the holograms removed. The power of sug- gestion was therefore eliminated. By the end of the test, each of the four bracelets (labeled A, B, C, D)\u2014 three sans hologram and one \"gen-uine\"\u2014had been carried through thecourse a total of sixteen times. We dis- tributed the bracelets equally among the volunteers through all four roundsof trials to ensure that no bracelet hada numerical or sequential advantage at any given time. (We considered that the experience of running the course inearly trials might help the subjects im- prove their times in their subsequentattempts. To correct for improvingscores due to familiarity with the course\u2014sometimes called the \"Order Effect\"\u2014four people wore bracelet Ain the first round, four different people wore bracelet Ain the second round, and so on, for each of the four rounds.)

If the one genuine Power Balance bracelet had an intrinsic value that re- ally did confer better balance, flexibility,and strength upon its user, we should have seen cumulatively better scoresfrom the people who wore thatbracelet (C) when compared to the people wear- ing the three \"dummy\" bracelets (A, B, and D). The overall scores between the four bracelets were in fact very close to- gether: half the participants who wore the real bracelet did slightly better, and half did slightly worse\u2014exactly aswould be expected by chance. Table 1shows the results of the obstacle course. Bear in mind that a lower time indi-cates a better performance. When itcame to flexibility, the results weremuch the same: the overall scores were very close. This time, the Power Bal-ance bracelet (also Cin Table 2) fared slightly better than the other bracelets but, again, not significantly so. Our initial conclusion was that Power Balance bracelets have no dis- cernable effect when the wearer doesn't know whether or not he or she is wear- ing one with a hologram. In other words, the bracelet itself doesn't seem to be doing anything. These results are consistent with work done by Richard Saunders for the Australian Skeptics (see \"Power Balance Down and Out,\" SI, News and Comment, September/Oct ober 2011) and by John Porcari at theUniversity of Wisconsin at La crosse,both of whom conducted blinded tests of Power Balance's efficacy and found no difference between Power Balance products and dummy stand-ins used to blind the user.The IIG at CFI-Los Angeles has now added its findings to the growing pool of Power Balance's negative test results. Although the bracelet might have some value as a sort of rabbit's footmeant to boost one's confidence, PowerBalance bracelets are a bust as a boon to one's athletic prowess. n James Underdown is the executive director of the Center for Inquiry-Los An-geles and the chair and founder of the Independ- ent Investigations Group.

But as Ananias attempted to paint a picture Jesus himself intervened, wash-ing his face in water and inexplicablyimprinting his visage on a towel\u2014hencethe name Mandylion, a unique word of Byzantine Greek coinage describing a holy facecloth (Wilson 1979, 272-290; Vatican 2008). Alas, this legend is unknown before the fourth century; moreover, there are conflicting versions. One attributes the Image to the bloody sweat exuded by Jesus during his agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:44). A later leg- end holds that a woman named Veron- ica, who pitied Jesus as he struggled with his cross on the way to his cruci- fixion, gave him her veil or kerchief with which to wipe his bloody, sweaty face. In fact, however, this made-up taleobviously derives from the fact that veronicais simply a corruption of vera iconica, medieval Latin for \"true image\" (Nickell 2007, one revealing fourth-century text of the Edessan leg- end, the image is not claimed as mirac-ulous but instead merely the work of Hannan (Ananias), who \"painted a por- trait of Jesus in choice paints\" and gave it to the King (qtd. in Wilson 1979, 130). Astonishingly, many Shroud of Turin devotees, following Ian Wilson(1979, 119-121), believe the \"shroud\" is the lost original of the Edessan Image!How do they equate the latter's face- only image with the full-length, front-and-back bodily images of the Turin cloth? They imagine the shroud was folded so that only the face showed\u2014never mind its lack of record for overthirteen centuries, a bishop's report of the forger's confession, pigments andpaint that make up the image and \"blood,\" and radiocarbon dating to the time of the forger's confession: about the middle of the fourteenth century(Nickell 1998; 2007). Competing Mandylions According to the authoritative source The Dictionary of Art (Turner 1996), the Edessan Image \"entered Christian iconography during the 11th and 12th centuries, first in manuscript picture cy- cles that were elaborated to accompany narratives of the Edessan legend and then as part of a fixed scheme of imagesin church decoration.\" Three of these \"original\" Mandylions have received the most attention, each supposedly havingbeen the very one brought to Constan-tinople in 1204 by crusaders. One, the Parisian Mandy lion, was acquired by King Louis IX in the thirteenth cen- tury and became lost in 1792, probably destroyed in the French Revolution. Of the two surviving examples, the Vatican Mandylion has no certain his- tory prior to the sixteenth century. In1517 the nuns of San Silvestro inCapito were reportedly forbidden to exhibit it so that it would not competewith their church's \"Veronica\" (Wilson1991). The Vatican now concedes (in the official Vatican Splendors exhibit text [Vatican 2008]) that \"... the Mandy lion is no longer enveloped today by any legend of its origin as an image made without the intervention Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 17[ INVESTIGATIVE FILES J O E N I C K E L L Joe Nickell, PhD, is CSI's senior research fellow and author of such books as Inquest on the Shroud of Turin, Relics of the Christ , and Looking for a Miracle .

This brings us to the other surviving image, the Genoese Mandylion. It, too,lacks meaningful provenance. It is al-legedly traceable to the tenth century,but its verifiable history dates only from 1362. At that time Byzantine Emperor John V donated it to Genoa's DogeLeonardo Montaldo after whose deathin 1384 it was bequeathed to the Ge-noese Church of St. Bartholomew of theArmenians. It arrived there in 1388; thatis where it remains and where I pho-tographed it (Figure 1), displayed in agilt-silver enameled frame of the four-teenth-century Palae ologan style. Interestingly, fragments of ancient Persian and Arabian fabrics were found stuck on the back of the Genoese iconpanel. The Arabian fragment is from the sixteenth century, whereas the fig- ural silk Persian one has been attributed to the tenth century on stylistic grounds. However, radiocarbon testing of the wood gave a more reliable date range of 1240-1280 (Wolf 2005). Similarities Both the Vatican and the Genoese Mandylions are painted (the Genoesein egg tempera, the Vatican apparently the same) on linen cloth that has been glued to a wood panel (Vatican 2008; Church of St. Bartholomeo degli Ar- meni 2009; Wilson 1991, 113-114, 137-138). However, both X-rays and tomography (an X-ray technique where by selected planes are pho-tographed) reveal that the Genoeseimage-bearing cloth covers an original image painted on wood (Bozzo 1994). Also, the Vatican's on-cloth image shows alterations (in X-rays and reflec-tographic and thermographic photo-graphs), especially in the nose, whichwas originally shorter, \"so that the imageoriginally must have had a different physiognomy\" (Vatican 2008, 58). In 1996, the Vatican Museum's ex - perts concluded (according to Vati can2008, 58): The version in the Vatican and the one in Genoa are almost wholly iden- tical in their representation, form, technique, and measurements. In- deed, they must at some point in their history have crossed paths, for the rivet holes that surround the Genoese image coincide with those that attach the Vatican Mandylion to the cut-out sheet of silver that frames the image.... So this silver frame, or one like to it must also have originally covered in the Genoa. See my summary comparison of thetwo Mandylions (Table 1\u2014based on Vatican 2008; Bozzo 1974; Wolf 2005). Indeed, the images themselves, as they now appear to the eye, are remark- ably alike. Measurement ratios\u2014in -volving the most critical areas: the eyes, lengthy nose, and mouth\u2014are strik- ingly similar. Therefore, when photo-graphs of the images are brought to the same scale (based on inter-pupillarydistance), those features effectively su- perimpose, as I determined by using computer-generated trans parencies. (These were prepared by CFI LibrariesDirector Tim Binga using photos takenby art experts [Wilson 1991, plates 13and 14]. However, the lack of a forensic scale in each prevents reaching a defi- nite conclusion as to whether tracing might have been involved.) Conclusions Since the prototypical image for the later Mandylions and \"Veronicas\" first appeared in Constantinople in the tenth century, many copies have been made. In one known seventeenth-century in- stance, no fewer than six \"exact\" facsim- iles were carefully made. Such replicascould later be mistaken for or misrepre- sented as the original, as happened, forexample, with one that was specially made and sent to plague-ridden Venice in the 1470s; it later be came known asthe Holy Face of Alicante in Spain (Wilson 1991, 101-108). Perhaps this is what occurred in the case of the two existing Mandylions. The Genoese image, with its older provenance and two-stage creation, ap- pears to be the earliest. Its original image was certainly an artist's copy, since it was painted not on cloth but di-rectly on the wood panel. (One sourcereports that it has the same dimensions as the missing central panel of a triptychin the St. Catharine's Monastery at Mount Sinai [Wolf 2005].) Vatican experts acknowledge the ev- idence suggesting that their Mandy lion is \"a later replica of the one now in Genoa; that it was produced in the fourteenth century, when the Genoese version ... was given its existing Palae-M A N D Y L I O N S CRITERIA Vatican Genoese Radiocarbon date [None] 1240-1280 Verifiable provenance From 1517 From 1362 Painting medium Tempera (unconfirmed) Egg tempera Support Linen affixed to wood Linen affixed to wood panel (cedar) panel (cedar or poplar) Process of execution Has image corrections Retouched image on cloth (e.g., nose once shorter) covers original painted on wood Inner frame About 111/2/c4508 inches.

Their main reservation is that the alterations in the Vatican image's features (espe- cially the nose) may be inconsistentwith a simple, direct copy. However, itwould seem that the alterations mightbe due only to the image having been alternately painted and corrected in the freehand process of copying it. Expertexamination, in fact, showed \"no signsof overpainting\" (Vatican 2008, 57). In brief, then, the totality of evidence is most consistent with the hypothesisthat the Genoan Mandy lion is a replica, made no earlier than the thirteenth cen- tury, and that the Vatican Mandylion is a fourteenth-century copy of that replica. There is no proof that either was directly copied from the now-lost twentieth-cen- tury \"original,\" and instead there is proof against it. Neither is there any credible evidence that there was an authentic first-century image of Jesus\u2014miraculousor otherwise. The Shroud of Turin is not such an original, having been proven to be the work of a confessed forger in the middle of the fourteenth century. Thus, the shroud image simply followed the traditional likeness and not the other way around. n Acknowledgments Many people helped with this research proj- ect.

His essays can be found at www.rationallyspeaking.org. Irecently interviewed Robert Zaret - sky for the Rationally Speaking pod- cast (www.rationallyspeakingpod- cast.org). Zaretsky is the coauthor Philosophers' Quar- rel: Rousseau, Hume, and the Limits ofHuman Understanding , which touches upon a fundamental concern to the skeptical movement: the role of and constraints on human reason. Zaretsky and Scott's book is fascinat- ing as a narration of the clash be tween two of the most influential philosophersof the Enlightenment, set in a time whenall of Europe\u2014including politicians andmonarchs\u2014was actually paying attention to what philosophers were saying or doing. Rous seau was publicly and harshlycriticized by the very father of the En light en ment, Voltaire, and he was per-secuted by the authorities in both France(his adoptive country) and Switzer land (his native land). It is in this context thatHume offered the fugitive philosopher shelter in Eng land, whose monarchy was going to play along just to spite theFrench. But Rousseau was paranoid and prone to irrational outbursts, and he soon became convinced (without cause,as it turns out) that Hume was secretly plotting against him. When Rousseau went public with his accusations, Hume was taken aback and felt compelled to respond. All of Europe's intelligentsiajoined the fray on behalf of one or theother philosopher, and the two re - mained on nonspeaking terms until the ends of their lives. However, my interests lay in the in- tellectual differences and similarities between Hume and Rousseau aboutthe very nature and import of human reason. Despite both philosophersbeing considered major players in the Enlightenment, Rousseau was actuallya radical critic of the movement (hence Voltaire's vitriol against him), which helped usher in the Romantic reaction to the Age of Reason. Hume was less radical in his rejection of rationality, and yet in some sense his criticisms of it were more powerful and lasting thanthose of his Swiss counterpart. To simplify a bit, Rousseau's prob- lem was with rationality as the harbin- ger of modernity, as well as the philosophes' attitude that reason ought to bridle emotions. In Zaretsky and Scott's book we find the Genevan re - peatedly writing to Hume and to hisfriends in what sounds like a postmod- ern vein, where \"truth\" is not something interpersonal and subject to empiricalinquiry but something one \"feels\";therefore it cannot be questioned byothers. He would have driven any mod- ern skeptic positively insane. (I hastento add that his broader critique of thesocial contract, as well as his writings about education, are well worth the ef- fort, but they are of course more tan-gential to the theme of this column.) Hume, too, was interested in a radi- cal (for the time) reevaluation of emo-tions and a corresponding cutting downto size of reason. One of his most fa- mous quotes is that \"reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the pas-sions,\" by which he meant that reasontells us how to achieve our goals, but wewant to achieve one goal or another be- cause we have \"passions.\" (Before you dismiss this, stop and think about why you are reading this magazine; the an- swer, at bottom, is that you care about critical thinking\u2014because you have a passion for reason and rationality. It isn't entirely clear that such passion can bedefended on logical grounds, and cer- tainly not on those alone.) Indeed, one of Hume's greatest con-tributions to philosophy of science was his famous problem of induction, which essentially leads to the conclusion that science itself does not have logical foun- dations. The argument goes something like this: scientific reasoning is inductive (that is, based on generalizations from empirical evidence, as well as on the as- sumption of the continuity of nature\u2014 meaning that the laws of nature do not change). But how can we justify induc- tion itself? The only defensible answer seems to be \"because it has (largely) worked in the past.\" That answer is itself inductive, so now we find ourselves in- side either an infinite regress or an in- stance of circular reasoning\u2014not good places to be, philosophically speaking. Nobody has so far discovered an ad- equate answer to Hume's problem ofinduction (and many have tried, in - cluding most famously Karl Popper), but Hume himself would have advised us not to panic. The realization should simply instill some humility when we talk about the power of reason and sci- ence; it is not a motive to abandon ei- ther. We use whatever tools we have inthe best way we can, even though we have no idea why they seem to work so well\u2014a very pragmatic, as well as hum- bling, attitude for the philosopher whowas so congenial as a human being that his French colleagues called him \"le bon David.\" So while Rousseau arguably opened the door to the sort of rejection of rea- son and embracing of emotion that still plagues our post-Romantic and post- modern world, Hume simply reminded us that emotions are just as defining of the human condition as reason is, and appreciating the limits of the latter is, well, the reasonable thing to do for sci-entists and philosophers alike. nHume vs. Rousseau: The Limits of Human ReasonSI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 20[NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD M A S S I M O P O L I D O R O Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, lecturer, and co-founder and head of CICAP , the Italian skeptics group. His website is at www.massimopolidoro.com. Last May, newspapers in Italy and abroad reported that the iconic image of a Madonna had wept tears in the Orthodox Church of SaintNicholas in Milano. It was the secondtime that this phenomenon had report-edly happened there. Tears and a Strange Potato \"It was around 4:30 PMand we were cleaning up the church right before the Vespers,\" said Archbishop Avondios. \"Suddenly, somebody noticed that the painting with the Madonna in our church was weeping. The same way asit did last year.\" In April 2010, the samething allegedly happened, and it is saidthat there had been another weeping in2008. \"A miracle? We don't use that word,\" said Avondios. \"But something has hap-pened. And it is not a trick.\" A few days after the event, an Italian television show devoted to the paranor-mal, Mistero, called me asking if CICAP, the Italian skeptics committee, was inter-ested in investigating the case. Of coursewe were. After obtaining permissionfrom the Archbishop, I went to the littlechurch in Via San Gregorio. The place isquite unique, since the Orthodox Churchhas been established inside the only re- maining building of what was once the Lazzeretto, the place where those suffer- ing from the plague were brought be- tween the fifteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. The building was once a huge square, but in the following centuries, when the city grew much larger, it was torn down in order to allow for the con- struction of roads and houses in what is now part of downtown\u2014one of the busiest quarters of Milano. Father Avondios was there waiting for me, and he was quite willing to help.However, before visiting the church and looking at the painting, we had to waitfor the television crew to arrive. So he told me that there was at least one prodi-gious event that had already taken placesince the latest weeping. He introducedme to a woman named Nechita from Eastern Europe who told me that untilsome weeks before she seemed unable tobecome pregnant. However, after visitingthe icon and praying to the Madonna, the happy event took place and she was now with child. As further proof that something miraculous was going on, she showed mea curious relic. In a plastic box filled with water were two slices of a potato. While cooking at home, Nechita saw a strangedried-up shape that resembled a little tree inside a potato she had cut open. Shetook it as a sign and decided to keep the slices. Furthermore, although the potato had been cut awhile ago, it had not be-come dark: it still was clean and white, asif it would keep fresh forever. \"We have asked around and nobody has ever seen anything like that,\" said Nechita. \"I amsure that is part of the miracle.\" I pho-tographed the slices just before the tele- vision crew arrived. Tiny Drops of Something We finally entered the cramped room that served as the main church hall,where dozens of sacred paintings, icons,The Case of a Weeping Orthodox Icon Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 21 Massimo Polidoro examines the icon that had wept while Father Avondios looks on.A close-up of the sliced potato in its water box.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 2122 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerreliquaries, and candles were kept and where women were allowed inside onlywith their head covered by a shawl. Itcontained a painting of the Madonna with baby Jesus and two little angels crowning her\u2014a classic orthodox icon,probably not more than fifty years old,with gold and red as the prevailing col-ors and writing in cyrillic inside it. The picture had now been put in a case with a glass cover over it in orderto preserve it, whereas when the weep-ing occurred it was left in the open and people could touch it (and they con- stantly did, as a few films available on the web clearly show). For this occa- sion, while the cameras were rolling, Father Avondios promptly opened the case and took the painting out for us to see up close. There were traces of some liquid, which had oozed and had now dried up, starting at the eyes of both the Madonna and Jesus and trailing down. \"You see?\" asked FatherAvon dios. \"There still are little drops of tears. It is still weeping.\" It was not actually \"weeping,\" but as I looked closely at the painting I could see that there were in fact tiny little drops of something that still hadn't dried. By run- ning some new cotton swabs on the painting, I was able to capture some of those traces. The idea was to take them to the lab in order to see if some kind ofanalysis was possible. Father Avondios, a quite young Archbishop with a nice east- ern accent and a good sense of humor,was quite helpful. He even took off some splinters from behind the painting witha knife in case we needed to examine those as well. For the moment that was all I could do. Later I gave the samples to my good friend and colleague Luigi Garla schelli, a chemist at the University of Pavia, and he checked with their labs to determine what sort of analysis was possible. A Partial Solution to the Mystery While that was going on in Pavia, I wasinterested in checking on the mysteri- ous potato slices. I reached the Agron- omy Department at the Regione Piemonte in Turin, where I knew some people who had been crucial in solving a previous \"vegetable mystery.\" I had been shown some apples on whose sur-faces odd drawings and dark wavy lineshad appeared\u2014bizarre but not uncom-mon. In fact, it turned out that the ap- ples were suffering from an infection due to poor preservation. I got a similar answer in the case of the strange \"tree\" in the potato slices. It was a well-known form of plant disease called \"empty heart,\" which is caused by imbalances in nutrients and water. As for the po- tato remaining preserved, the agrono- mists explained to me that it is a natural reaction to the fact that the slices were kept under water. Oxygen is what turns a potato or a fruit dark, and the lack of it can only slow down the decaying process. In a few weeks, Garlaschelli had the results from the Mass SpectrometryLabs in Pavia. It turned out that the substance found on the painting was some kind of vegetable oil. The suspi- cion that the painting itself had pro- duced the oil was immediately dis- carded because a) oil paint is made with mineral oil because vegetable oils are easily perishable and b) if it was a nat-ural transudation it would have takenplace all over the painting and certainlynot only around the eyes of the Ma - donna and her baby. What conclusions can be drawn? The most logical one is that the oil came from outside the painting and it was ei- ther made to appear by some supernat- ural (and unproven) means or somebody put it there\u2014it is now im possible to guess who and why. There were many people freely moving around the church area while I was there, and\u2014as shown by various news clips\u2014the painting had been left without a glass cover before our arrival, so anybody who wished could reach and touch it. Father Avondios wrote to me later: \"We have always been and will be very careful in our statements and in declar- ing true an event or an apparition, in- dependently from the results of the analysis. I have always been open and curious, and that's why I allowed for the tests to be performed. We will still wor- ship and respect the icon of theMadonna not because of a supposed miracle but as an instrument of devo-tion to the Mother of our Lord.\" During our investigation, the police department had concluded work on an- other weeping Madonna case. This one was a print of a Madonna owned by a couple in Messina, Sicily, that they swore had wept blood. The house hadsince then been visited by thousands of pilgrims. Finally, the police were able todetermine that the blood was humanand that the DNA belonged to one of the owners. Now the couple risks charges of \"abuse of popular credulity,\" something that Italian law still consid- ers a crime. n Father Avondios showing the sliced potato with tree shaped signs.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 22Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 23[ PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS R O B E R T S H E A F F E R \"Psychic Vibrations\" has appeared in the S KEPTICALINQUIRERfor over thirty years.

Sorry to disappoint those who were expecting mayhem and de struction from puny Comet Elenin this fall. The comet began de stroying itself before it got close enough to see with the naked eye.This is not exactly surprising, as the same thing has happened to many smallcomets before. As astronomy writer Kelly Beatty reports, Within the past week the comet's brightness has declined by 50%, dropping a half magnitude between August 19th and 20th ... images show Comet Elenin's bright core be -coming elongated and diffuse\u2014the telltale signs that its icy nucleus haseither broken in two or disintegrated altogether. One veteran comet-watcher who's not surprised is John Bortle. Four months ago, based on Elenin's per- formance to that point, he cautioned, \"The comet may be intrinsically a bit too faint to even survive perihelion passage.\" (\"Comet Elenin Self De - structs,\" Sky and Telescope , August 30, 2011; http://tinyurl.com/3stmgmr). As noted by David Morrison in \"Comet Elenin Will Not Destroy Earth This Year\" (SI, September/October 2011, p. 5), Comet Elenin was pro- claimed by many to be a destructive force headed toward Earth, where it would (somehow) cause something Truly Awful to happen. This was of course absurd, since not only was Comet Elenin quite insignificant as far as comets go, but it was never going to get within twenty million miles of Earth. Those who would not believe the fact-based descriptions of Comet Elenin as a feeble, puny visitor to the inner solar sys-tem now must contend with the fact that the comet's icy core simply melted as it got closer to the sun. But I can guarantee that the conspir- acy claims will not end there. Soon we'll be hearing how NASA blew up Comet Elenin. Or maybe friendly space aliensdid it to save Earth. Or maybe the comet has faded to near-invisibility to bettersneak up and surprise unsuspectingEarthlings. But I think the claim thatwill win out is one that emphasizes thecomet's alleged dangerous and destruc-tive nature: \"That comet was so radioac-tive that it blew itself up!\" or possibly \"Itsweapons of mass destruction acciden- tally triggered prematurely!\" * * * For more than twenty years, UFO pro- ponents have been citing the 1989- 1990 wave of UFO sightings in Bel gium as an unexplained mystery.

For one thing, it shows nothing in the back- ground to allow its size or distance fromthe camera to be determined. it could aseasily be a tiny model seen close-up as a giant hovering craft. in the 1990s theBelgian skeptic Wim van utrechtshowed that the photo could easily be re-produced using a small model. in a recentissue of tim printy's webzine Sunlite , an article by pacquay notes severalinconsistencies about the photo (see http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty /uFO/Sunlite3_2.pdf) now we have a confession. the Bel - gian news organization rtl reported that the hoaxer (now identified aspatrick Marechal) has given his mea culpa and now \"lifts the veil\" from the mystery. the reporter interviewed Marechal in his home, where he showedthem many slides and prints. Accord ingto the rtl report, \"the uFO of petit-rechain is not a spaceship from a distant galaxy but a panel of painted styrofoam with three spots affixed\" (http://tinyurl.com/3ehg6v6). Marechal ex plained that once he showed his hoaxed photo to his coworkers, the situation quicklygot out of control, and he could nolonger hold back the photo's march allacross the world; he had \"managed to fool the whole world with a silly modelmade of styrofoam.\" this confession is very bad news for leslie kean.

On the latter, Kean calls the Petit-Rechain photo \"one of the most convincing\" pieces of evidence for the existence of UFOs.\" Worse yet for Kean, the Belgian UFOlogist PatrickFerryn, who is featured prominently onthe program proclaiming the validity ofthe Petit-Rechain photo, now acknowl-edges that it is a hoax. Ferryn was quoted by Belgian TV on July 26 stat- ing that the bogus UFO photo from Petit-Rechain does not in any way inval- idate the Belgian UFO wave that began in November of 1989 (http://tinyurl.com /3rzknbv). (True enough, but it does re- move the sole supposed photographicevidence for thousands of reportedsightings.) Kean did not volunteer anycomments on Marechal's confession,but when she was interviewed by SIDeputy Editor Benjamin Radford forDiscovery News (see http://tinyurl.com /RadfKean), she acknowledged the dif- ficulty the confession poses. However, she says she is not yet sure whether ornot the hoaxer's confession is to be be-lieved (see http://tinyurl.com/KeanBe). Former Arizona governor Fife Sym - ington is one of Kean's favorite wit-nesses concerning the famous \"PhoenixLights\" (although exactly how he be -came a \"former governor\" is never spelled out). He now claims to have \"held back\" UFO information andclaims to have seen Arizona's most fa-mous UFO fly over, which he nevermentioned before. How credible is FifeSyming ton? As the New York Times re- ported in a September 4, 1997 headline, \"Arizona Governor Convicted of Fraud and Will Step Down\" (http://tinyurl.com /krz46o). Symington was convicted on seven felony counts\u2014a fact Kean con- ceals from her audience. The conviction was later overturned because of possible misconduct concerning a juror, and he was pardoned by Presi dent Clinton be- fore he could be retried. If I were look- ing for someone whose testimony was credible, Fife Symington would be among the worst possible choices.Little has been written about the \"In- cursion at O'Hare Airport\" on Novem- ber 7, 2006, which is a major case for Kean. Several employees of United Air- lines reported seeing a \"strange object hovering just under a cloud bank. ... The metallic-looking disc was about the sizeof a quarter or half dollar held at arm'slength.\" Unfor tunately, no photographs exist of this supposed \"metallic-lookingdisc\" hovering over one of the world'sbusiest airports in daytime, and nothingshowed up on radar. Even more surpris- ing, we learn in Kean's documentary thatthe UFO hovered over gate C-17 atO'Hare. Apparently it was not seen byanyone at gate C-15, gate C-16, or any- where else. After anywhere from five to fifteen minutes, \"the suspended disc suddenlyshot up at an incredible speed and wasgone in less than a second, leaving a crisp, cookie-cutter-like hole in thedense clouds. The opening was approx- imately the same size as the object [Iwould suggest that the opening was in factthe object], and those directly un- derneath it could see blue sky visible on the other side.\" Kean ridicules an expla-nation offered by an FAA spokes man that the observers saw a \"hole-punch cloud,\" an unusual weather phenome-non where a large, dramatic circular holeis formed in a cloud layer. She cites a re- port by NARCAP, a pro-UFO inves- tigative team, showing that tempera- tures were too high for a hole-punchcloud to form at the 1,900-foot eleva- tion of the ceiling, which is probablycorrect. (Kean has no difficulty referenc- ing investigations by other researchers, so long as their conclusion agrees with hers.) But then she bizarrely suggests that \"this just happens to fit the wit- nesses' explanation of what they saw: a high-energy, round object very likely to be emitting some form of intense radi- ation or heat while cutting through the cloud bank.\" Now, one cannot simulta-neously argue that a hole-punch cloud could not have formed because the tem- peratures were above freezing and that a UFO formed one anyway. In any case,the low ceiling might easily have briefly opened up to reveal a much higher cloud layer where a hole-punch cloudalready existed. It is interesting that the photo used on a National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration website to illustrate the phenomenon of the hole-punch cloud was taken in nearbyWisconsin exactly eight days after theO'Hare Field\"incursion,\"(www.crh.noaa. gov/grb/?n=holepunch). nKean did not volunteer any comments on Marechal's confession, but when she was interviewed by SI Deputy Editor Benjamin Radford for Discovery News , she acknowledged the difficulty the confession poses. nR O B E R T S H E A F F E R PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS]SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 2526 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirer[ THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE S T E V E N N O V E L L A Steven Novella, MD, is assistant professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, the host of the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, author of the NeuroLogica blog, executive editor of the Science-Based Medicine blog, and president of the New England Skeptical Society. New ideas are presented in science and medicine all the time. This is healthy and necessary\u2014we have to keep churning the pot so that new ideas can emerge and our thinkingdoes not become calcified. But scienceis both a creative and destructiveprocess, and most new ideas are weededout by the relentless filtering process ofresearch and peer review. However, to patients suffering from an incurable disease a new idea repre- sents one thing: hope. Science, by con-trast, cares only about what works andis dispassionate, which is easily por- trayed as heartlessness. Hopeful non-sense thus has a public relations advan-tage over pitiless science every time. We are seeing this effect now with a new idea in the science of multiple scle- rosis (MS). A lone Italian vascular sur-geon, Paolo Zamboni, proposed thatMS is not caused by an autoimmuneprocess (the immune system attackingthe nervous system) but rather by block- ages in the veins that drain blood from the brain. He published his initial studythat found a \"dramatic\" association be- tween MS and these venous blockages (Zamboni et al. 2009). He called thecondition chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). The paper set off a bitter controversy. Zamboni is suggesting that decades of MS research have been on the wrongtrack and that he has found the true cause\u2014and potential cure\u2014of MS with a simple diagnosticprocedure. The pressloved it\u2014a lone maverick challengingthe status quo with a bold new idea. Many patients with progressive and difficult-to-treat MS also loved it, for itprovided hope of an effective treatment. (As an aside, there are several effectivetreatments for MS but not all types of MS or all patients respond.) When the neurological community treated Zam- boni's claims with (perfectly reasonable) skepticism, some patients began to weave conspiracy theories to explain the resistance. They wanted the new treat- ment, and they didn't want stuffy neu- rologists getting in the way because their turf was being threatened by a sur- geon (at least that is the narrative they told each other.) But science is pitiless and doesn't care for narrative, turf, or good headlines. Despite the low plausibility and the fact that Zamboni's claims ran counter to the carefully accumulated MS re- search to date, many centers set about to replicate his findings. Replication is a key process in science. If a phenome- non is real, then it will be real in any lab. Zamboni's findings were dramatic, so they should be easy to replicate. Two years later we have several good replications. One study did produce sim- ilar findings to Zamboni, although the association was not as strong (Al-Omariand Rousan 2010). The next three, how- ever, were all dead negative (Sundstr\u00f6m et al. 2010; Doepp et al. 2010; Krogias et al. 2010). Skepticism mounted. Another study this year comparing MS patients to normal controls concluded, \"This triple-blinded extra- and transcranial du-plex sonographic assessment of cervical and cerebral veins does not provide sup- portive evidence for the presence of CCSVI in MS patients. The findings cast serious doubt on the concept of CCSVI in MS\" (Mayer et al. 2011).In Multiple Sclerosis Treatments, Hope Trumps Reason To patients suffering from an incurable disease a new idea represents one thing: hope. Science, by contrast, cares only about what works and is dispassionate, which is easily portrayed as heartlessness. Hopeful nonsense thus has a public relations advantage over pitiless science every time.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:12 PM Page 26Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 27The largest replication to date (Ziva - dinov et al. 2011) found a small associa- tion between venous blockage and MS and concluded, \"Our findings are consis- tent with an increased prevalence of CCSVI in MS but with modest sensitiv- ity/specificity. Our findings point against CCSVI having a primary causative rolein the development of MS.\" These findings are interesting. They do not entirely rule out a correlation be-tween CCSVI and MS. However, the results are very ambiguous. There is astatistical correlation between MS and CCSVI, but there is also a correlation with other neurological diseases\u2014withvery different histories and probable causes from those of MS. CCSVI was also found in a quarter of healthy con-trols. So CCSVI is not specific to MS, and almost half of MS patients do not meet criteria for CCSVI. To summarize all of the existing re- search on CCSVI and MS: The re sultsare mixed with variable methodologyused but are generally negative. No one has found the dramatic results first published by Zamboni. After a coupleyears of research, his implausible idea is not looking very good. At best we can say that there may be a small and in- consistent correlation between venous blockages and MS. If the correlation is true, it is also possible that these block- ages are a result of MS, perhaps caused by inflammation, and are not necessar- ily a cause of MS. Despite these largely negative find- ings, there are still many MS patients clamoring for treatment. The treatment of CCSVI is called the liberation pro- cedure (essentially opening up the blocked veins, a procedure not without risk). Clinics are opening up offering the treatment to desperate patients\u2014 putting treatment ahead of the evi- dence or even using a treatment in the face of negative evidence, which is al- ways a bad idea. There are also calls, especially in Canada, for clinical trials of the libera-tion procedure. Such trials are not jus- tified by the science that has been done so far, but because clinics are already of- fering the liberation procedure, this may force the hands of MS researchers. Before subjecting people to experimen-tal medical interventions, ethics de-mands that we do sufficient basic sci- ence research to demonstrate that thereis at least a reasonable chance of benefit.We have not crossed that line withCCSVI and the liberation procedure. Advocates of the procedure, however, are likely to succeed in making an endrun around the usual safeguards of eth- ical medical research. Those promoting CCSVI and the liberation procedure are likely to beportrayed by some in the media and by hopeful patients as brave mavericks. That is the hopeful, romantic, and sen- sational view. I suspect, however, that inthe end the science will tell a differentstory. n References Al-Omari, M.H., and L.A.

The impediments could be political,cultural, technological, or more oftensome formidable combination of allthree. But in extremely rare instancesone can't help but believe that a particu-larly powerful idea's time has finally ar-rived. Biologists, conservationists, andeconomists around the world are sayingprecisely that about the commercial pro-duction of cultured, or in vitro, meat. The facts surrounding \"slow-grown\" meat are compelling, to say the least. Conventional meat production is a $1.4 trillion industry globally. We consumed228 million tons of flesh in 2000, andthat number is expected to more thandouble by 2050 as world population swells to nine billion. Gorging them- selves on 40 percent of the planet's ce-real grain, livestock also use and despoilabout 30 percent of the earth's surface,70 percent of its arable land, and 8 per-cent of its water supply. The world's 1.5 billion livestock are responsible for between 15 and 24 per- cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gasses\u2014including 68 percent of ammo- nia, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, 37 per-cent of methane, and 9 percent of car- bon dioxide. Beef ranching accounts for 80 percent of Amazon deforestation,and cattle, which defecate 130 timesmore by volume than humans, dump 64million tons of sewage in the UnitedStates alone. Pigs, of course, are no less prolific. When we use antibiotics on inten- sively farmed animals, we contribute mightily to the emergence of multi- drug-resistant strains of bacteria. Ani-mal diseases\u2014the chicken flu, for ex-ample\u2014can lead to novel epidemics oreven pandemics capable of killing mil-lions of people. What are the most common causes of food-born diseases in the United States, the EuropeanUnion, and Canada? That's right: con-taminated meats and animal products.And don't forget that the nutritionalmaladies associated with animal fats\u2014 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in particular\u2014are now responsible for afull third of global mortality. In rather stark contrast, meat grown in culture doesn't poop, burp, fart, eat, overgraze, drink, bleed, or scream in agony\u2014and it's a great deal less likely to poison, infect, or kill us. In those bright practical and ethical lights, a growing number of scientists are hopping onto the cultured meat bandwagon. The conventional meat industry \"no longer makes sense,\" according to Zuhaib and Hina Bhat, Indian biotechnologists and authors of an enlightening new study on cultured meat (Bhat 2011). All things considered, they argue, the transition to \"an in vitromeat production system is becoming increasingly justifiable.\" And although the technology is still in its early stages, adds a seasoned trio of Dutch veterinary scientists, culturedIn Vitro Meat: An Imminent Revolution in Food Production?

To that noble end, Hanna Tuomisto and M. Joost Teixeira de Mattos fromthe Universities of Oxford and Am ster - dam, respectively, calculated the likelyenergy use, greenhouse gas emissions,and land requirements associated withlarge-scale in vitromeat production (Tuomisto 2010). When contrastedwith the conventional industry in Eu- rope, cultured meat would involve 35-60 percent less energy use for pork,sheep, and beef, they say, and 80-95percent lower greenhouse gas emissionsand 98 percent reduced land use overall.Although in vitrochicken could require 14 percent more energy, if land use sav- ings were partially converted to bioen- ergy production, the total energy effi- ciency of the cultured product wouldstill prevail. And because most greenhouse gas emissions caused by cultured meat pro-duction are associated with fuel and electricity use, such emissions could befurther reduced through the application of renewable energy sources. That po- tential doesn't exist for the conventional industry because most of its emissions are produced by methane from manureand enteric fermentation and nitrousoxide from the soil. Cultured meat would also promote wildlife conservation, Tuomisto and deMattos contend, because it shrinks eco-nomic pressure to convert natural habi- tats to agricultural lands, and it providesan alternative means of producing meatfrom rare, endangered, or currently over-hunted or over-fished species. And al-though neither transportation nor refrig- eration expenses were figured into their studies they add that such costs would likely be less with in vitromeat. Whole animals wouldn't need to be hauledabout, after all; production sites could be located closer to actual consumers; and the finished product would presentfewer issues relating to microbial con- tamination. Not that cultured meat is a new idea. Back in the 1920s, in fact, WinstonChurchill predicted its use within fiftyyears. Following the discovery of stem cells and the development of the in vitrotissue culture, Dutch scientist Willem van Eeelen first patented the idea in 1999. In 2002, NASA financeda study involving the culturing of agoldfish fillet to explore the possibility of growing meat for long-term space flight (Ben jaminson 2002). Since then, most of the research has taken place in the Netherlands. Be tween2005 and 2009, the Dutch government funded a study exploring the possibility of culturing skeletal muscle cells from farm animal stem cells. The group was largely successful, but unfortunately the US$2.6 million grant has since expired without renewal. The general process behind in vitro meat is relatively basic.

But scientists have yet to isolate and developsuch cell lines from farm animals. Thus most of the research so far has involved myosatellites, or the adult stem cells that grow and repair muscle. Myosatellites are extracted from a small biopsy\u2014reasonably painless to the animal\u2014using enzymes or pipetting. A bacterial-based growth serum is applied to multiply the stems. Re search ers then coax them to differentiate into muscle cells, which are grown on an edible orbiodegradable scaffold to form my- ofibers. Those, in turn, are exercised under tension\u2014as if in a miniature, high-tech gymnasium\u2014to build bigger muscle tissues. The appropriate level ofstress can be achieved in a variety of ways, including electrical impulses, an- chor points, or possibly microspheres. Once produced on a commercial scale using bioreactors, producers could then grind the muscle strips while adding spices, iron, and vitamins to taste. In a nutshell, that's the proposed method for creating processed meats like sau - sages and hamburger patties. The fabri- cation of structured meats like steaks will be more complicated because as muscle fibers grow larger\u2014more than 200 mi- crometers thick\u2014they tend to die off as their inner cell layers become isolatedfrom the flow of nutrients and oxygen. Regardless of the specific goal, sci- entists face difficult challenges at every phase of production. As African food security expert Phillip Thornton ex- plains, although in vitromeat currently represents a \"perfectly feasible\" \"wild- card\" driver of change in the livestock industry\u2014indeed, in world culture more sweepingly\u2014\"at least another decade of research is needed\" before we can even begin to effectively confrontthe critical issues of scale and cost (Thornton 2010).

Buteven if we develop that technology, em- bryonic stems must be specifically stim-ulated to produce myoblasts and at pres- ent we have no way of guaranteeing theywill do so accurately. Myosatellites, by contrast, have been successfully isolated from the muscle of cattle, chicken, turkeys, pigs, and fish. But in addition to their general rarity and severely limited regenerative abili-ties, myosatellites have different capac-ities to proliferate, differentiate, and re-spond to growth factors depending ontheir specific muscle of origin. Adipose-derived adult stems provide an attractivepotential alternative, the Indian team notes, because they can be obtained lessinvasively from subcutaneous fat andcan differentiate into multiple cell line-ages, including muscle. As anchorage-dependent cells, my- oblasts require some sort of substratumor scaffold upon which to proliferateand differentiate. The challenge here isto develop structures that mimic the in vivomilieu. They should have large surface areas for growth and be flexibleenough to facilitate contraction. Andtheir by-products must be edible, natu-ral, and derived from non-animal sources. Researchers have proposed a number of inventive solutions, includ- ing porous collagen beads or mesh- works, large sheets or thin filaments, and microspheres made of cellulose, al- ginate, chitosan, or collagen that fluc- tuate in size following slight changes in temperature or pH. To commercialize the process, we'll need new bioreactors as well\u2014ones that maintain low sheer and uniform perfu- sion of nutrients at large volumes. Bal-ancing centrifugal, drag, and gravita- tional forces, rotating bioreactors allow the structures inside to stay medium- submerged in a perpetual state of free fall. In theory, research-size rotating sys- tems can be scaled up to industrial ca-pacity without affecting their physics. Perhaps most crucial of all, however, is progress toward a cheap, clean, and consistently effective culture medium.At this point, myoblast culturing usu- ally occurs in animal (fetal calf or horse)serums, which are expensive, highly variable in composition, and potentially rife with infectious contamination. They also raise familiar ethical concernsfor some and rather defeat the impor- tant point of creating an animal-free protein product. Serum-free, chemically defined media have already been developed to support turkey, sheep, and pig myosatel-lites, and one particularly inventive re-searcher has employed a medium madefrom maitake mushroom extract. Thus far, however, the price of these media is not practical for mass production. In ad- dition, we need to formulate species- and cell-specific arrays of growth factors to effectively control proliferation anddifferentiation. Clearly we have much left to achieve. Then again, as a group of Dutch andAmerican researchers observed six yearsago in the very first peer-reviewed paper published on the subject, the technical challenges facing cultured meat produc- ers are far less daunting than those facing scientists pursuing the application of en-gineered muscle tissue in a clinical set- ting (Edelman 2005). And maybe the Dutch group put it best two years ago:\"It may seem somewhat premature to start a societal discussion,\" they ad vised.\"However, food is a subject that evokes many emotions: it is, if we recall the tur- moil associated with the introduction of genetically modified foods, a good idea to educate citizens about all aspects\" of in vitromeat and to do so now. Compared to its conventional coun- terpart, cultured meat will allow us to lead significantly safer and more sustain- able lives. We will be able to control not only its flavor but its nutritional compo- sition as well. It will free our valuable re- sources and our land, minimize animal suffering, and satisfy mounting con- sumer demand for protein across the globe. How can we transform this truly great idea into a reality? At this criticalpoint, experts contend, we require only the degree of public investment long lav- ished upon in vitromeat's dirty, danger- ous, inefficient, and plainly outdatedpredecessor. n References Benjaminson, M.A., J.A.

It is also widely said to be one of the mostcredible and best-documented polter-geist cases in history. Not only were theghostly goings-on seen by dozens ofcredible eyewitnesses (including a fu- ture president of the United States), butthe case was even \"validated by theState of Tennessee as the only case inU.S. history where a spirit has caused the death of a human being\" (Schager2006). According to James McCormick and Macy Wyatt in their book Ghosts of the Bluegrass, \"The famous Bell Witch ghost story seems to have originated in thetown of Adams, Tennessee, in the early 1800s. A prosperous farmer, John Bell,and his family came under the attack ofa poltergeist known as the Bell Witch. The cruel things the family experienced were known far and wide, and were even said to have been investigated by Andrew Jackson, who lived nearby\" (McCormick and Wyatt 2009, 94). The whole story is lengthy and com- plex (and, in classic folklore tradition, has many variants), but it basically in- volves a Tennessee farmer named John Bell Sr., who in 1817 found a mysteri- ous creature with the body of a dog and the head of a rabbit. The Bell family later heard menacing scratching andgrowling noises coming from outside their cabin at night. The ghostly assaults began when the youngest Bell daughter, Betsy, was attacked by an invisible entity. The frequency and violence of the at- tacks increased, and soon objects were flying through the air, hurled by unseen forces. Eventually the spirit, an oldwoman named Kate Batts, held conver-sations with the Bell family, revealingthat she was taking revenge on JohnBell for having cheated her in a trade of goods. (In one variation of the story thatcirculated in Mississippi, the witch was not a woman named Kate but instead the spirit of a male slave whom John Bell had killed for having been Betsy's illicit lover [Hudson and McCarter 1934]). The witch ends up killing John Bell and then finally leaves the family in peace. As with many ghost stories, the Bell Witch story has been retold countless times. The legend has appeared in several books, including The Bell Witch: An American Haunting (Monahan 2000), and has been adapted into several horrorfilms, including An American Haunting . The story, full of drama and details, is terrifying if it's true\u2014but it isn't. De- spite many books, magazine articles, and websites offering claims to the con- trary, there's no evidence that any of the events took place (though the Bell fam- ily was real). As Slate writer Grady Hendrix notes, \"Most of the books about the Bell Witch are sourced from an 1894 volume called An Authen ticated History of the Famous Bell Witch [subti- tledThe Wonder of the 19th Century, and Unexplained Phenomenon of the Chris- tian Era] by Martin Van Buren Ingram. This volume was written 60 years after the fact and is regarded by some histo- rians as a novel that used real people and places to give it the appearance of reality.\" Ingram's book, which claims to \"record events of historical fact, sus-Benjamin Radford is a research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author or coauthor of six books, including Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.

In fact I investigated another famous (and very similar) haunting in whichexactly the same thing reportedly hap- pened: the Rose Hall mansion in Mon-tego Bay, Jamaica, is said to be hauntedby a witch named Annie Palmer. Thelegend of the White Witch of RoseHall (which also includes stories of slavery, cruelty, passions, and ghostly re-venge) is believed by many to be a truestory, but it is in fact based on a 1929novel that\u2014like the Bell Witch story\u2014 used real people and locations for verisimilitude (see Radford 2010). The Bell Witch story was identified as legend as far back as the 1930s, and it was even discussed in scholarly folk-lore publications such as The Journal of American Folklore (see, for example, Hudson and McCarter 1934). So whyis this obviously fictional story widelyregarded as true, or at least based onreal events? Largely because the publichas often been explicitly told that thestory is true by the \"original\" source, byuninformed writers, and by people whoknow (or should know) that it's a leg-end but market their version as a truestory anyway. Veteran ghost researcher Brad Steiger, who is typically careful to keep his booksuncontaminated by skepticism or verified facts, devotes eight pages of his 2003 book Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, and Haunted Places to retelling one version of the Bell Witch legend, apparently never realizing that it's a completely fictional tale. William Birnes and Joel Martin, in their book The Haunting of America: From the Salem Witch Trials to Harry Houdini, make the same mistake and even lamely suggest that \"skeptics blame Betsy, accusing her of fabricating the Bell Witch phenomena. However, no one ever proved that...\" (145). First of all, the burden of proof is noton skeptics to disproveanything but rather for the proponents to prove Betsy's claims. More to the point, skep- tics recognize that the entire storyis a legend\u2014including Andrew Jackson's involvement (there is no reference tothe Bell Witch in any of Jackson's writ-ings and no evidence that he'd heard ofthe story [Hendrix 2006]). The prob- lem is not that Betsy Bell may have liedabout being attacked by a ghost; it's that the original source for the Bell Witch story made the whole thing up. It's like arguing about whether Huckle- berry Finn lied when he said his drunken father beat him; it's all in the context of fiction. The fact that Steiger, Birnes, andcountless other \"experts\" have mistaken legend for fact (or not bothered to sepa-rate the two) does not speak well for their scholarship or credibility. Passing fiction off as fact is of course nothing new. Horror books and filmshave a long tradition of claiming mys-terious, ghostly, and supernatural events as having basis in fact when they were either largely or completely fictional. Classic examples include William Peter Blatty's novel The Exorcist(and the film version); Jay Anson's novel The Ami- tyville Horror: A True Story (and the film version); and Ray Garton's book The Haunting in Con necticut (and the film version), among many others (seeRadford 2009 and MonsterTalk 2011). The Bell Witch story is important for would-be ghost hunters and skepticsto understand because it shows how easily legend and myth can be mistakenfor fact and real events and how easilythe lines are blurred between ghost sto- ries that are acknowledged as fictional and \"true\" stories about ghosts. n References Birnes, William J., and Joel Martin. 2009.

ENGLERMEASURING MYTHOLOGY: Startling Concepts in NCCAM GrantsSI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:18 PM Page 3536 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerIn 1999, the Office of Alternative Medicine evolved into an NIH center, the National Center for Comple - mentary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM), whose annual budget nowaverages $134 million (Atwood 2003)(Figure 1). Placing the office at the NIH im- plied a strategy of scientifically studying the medical legitimacy of a growing un-regulated in dustry. But after twentyyears, two billion dollars, thousands offunding awards, and hundreds of clini-cal trials, it's sadly obvious the mandateis flawed. Few realize that fundingawards for complementary and alterna-tive medicine (CAM) are not limited to grants from NCCAM. Figure 2 showsthe percentage of awards for CAM that has come from other NIH centers and offices. Using data from the NIH website, we studied all NCCAM funding awardsfrom 2000 to the present. 1,2We found no discoveries in alternative medicine thatjustify the existence of the center; Con -gress has mandated into the health carebill the tax burden of paying for myths and commercial interests.

Americans reportedly spend thirty-four billion dollars annually on alternative medicine protocols and prod- ucts. In 1992 when Congress mandated the funding of an Office to study alternative medicine at the National In- stitutes of Health (NIH) with a budget of two million dollars, it couldn't have predicted that in 2011 NIH would be funding marketing of \"distance healing\" and that Amer icans would be paying for delivery of alternative medicine in their health care bill (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010).

What is most troublesome about this use of taxpayer dollars is the ab - sence of posted results of completedNCCAM clinical trials on the NIHwebsite. Queries to the director ofNIH, Francis Collins, on this missing data went unanswered. A taxpayer whosearches the NIH project reporter andclinical trials for needed medical infor- mation relating to alternative medicine will find startling concepts but few an- swers about their success. A person who might be facing the scary prospect of legitimate medical chemotherapy, del- uged by warm-hearted marketing from alternative medicine via the web and print journalism, is left clueless. Unsurprisingly, we found some neg- ative results for CAM studies. Did Amer icans really need to spend millions of dollars to learn that \"distance healing\" cannot cure brain cancer or HIV/AIDS; shark cartilage does not affect the sur-vival rates of cancer patients; vitamin E and selenium do not mitigate prostatecancer; magnets are not useful for fi- bromyalgia or carpal tunnel syndrome; and clinical trials using coffee enemas combined with heavy vitamin supple- mentation for patients with pancreatic or prostate cancer are unsafe? Termi- nated by an independent oversightmonitoring committee was twelve-year joint National CancerInstitute and NCCAM study compar-ing the effects of vitamin E and sele- nium on prostate cancer. The commit- tee had found a slight (4 percent)increase in prostate cancer for all 32,000 participants. However, this trialis still listed as ongoing. Worse, some funding awards\u2014such as two million dollars to test magnettherapy and twenty-two million dollarsto test distance healing\u2014reveal an ig- norance of basic science. From 1995 through 1998, the University of Vir - ginia was funded to study the effect of magnetic mattress pads for sufferers offibromyalgia. Results of the study con- cluded \"improvements (in pain inten-sity) did not differ significantly from changes in the Sham group or in the Usual Care group\"(Alfano et al. 2001). This conclusion should discourage con- sumers from purchasing magnets for medical purposes and NCCAM from continuing awarding funds for this inter-vention. In 1999, Operation Cure All, a law enforcement and consumer educa-tion campaign launched by the Federal Trade Com mis sion (FTC), targeted the claims of purveyors of magnet therapydevices and forced them to cease adver-tising. But despite the FTC's legal ac- tions in 1999 and a successful lawsuit brought by the National CouncilAgainst Health Fraud, NCCAM con-tinued to fund magnet therapy. The University of Virginia was awarded $446,000 from 2000-2005 to test the usefulness of pulsed magnetic mattresspads for alleviating arthritis.

These latterawardees concluded that despite learn-ing there was no difference in pain in- tensity for participants assigned to the sham or active magnet groups, theyneeded further studies to optimize thedosage. In 2007 the University ofNorth Carolina was awarded $283,000for the clinical trial \"Craniosacral Ther - apy in Migraine,\" which involved mag-nets. Ex was sixty-six. Beth ative Medicine,\" which included magnet therapy. There are nostudies conducted by Beth Israel on magnet therapy in the published liter- ature, and Beth Israel's website carriesan ambivalent article refusing to ac-knowledge the impossibility of mag- netic healing (Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center 2010). The magnets used in mattress pads in carpal tunnel and migraine studies, available commercially from sourcessuch as Nikken, have a field strength of several hundred gauss\u2014about the same strength as refrigerator magnets. Nik - ken's website makes no claims for med- ical use of their magnets. As scientific studies and calculations have shown, and the FTC recognized in 1999, blood is not magnetic; therefore, magnets of this strength cannot influence the flowof ions across cell membranes. Thus whether they are located in mattress pads, at the wrists, or surrounding thehead, no biochemistry can be initiated or inhibited by these magnets. From 1999 to the present, NIH's NCCAM has awarded millions of dollars for stud- ies for a protocol that has no basis in sci- ence. Its website makes no mention of scientific studies and publications by physicists about this fact. 1 The 1990s misconception about the energy of magnetic fields has a more re- cent counterpart: the commercial mar-keting of bracelets that purport to con-tain holograms that engage a \"field\" to improve athletic ability.

Not only have magnetic fields en- tered the NCCAM funding curricu-lum, but millions of dollars have been awarded for studies about the mythic\"biofields\" generated by Reiki, Thera - peutic Touch, and Qigong. These pro-tocols prescribe moving hands above apatient's body in a specialized set of motions that are supposed to initiate acure of the medical condition. Use ofthese motions in a hospital trauma cen- ter can be seen on the Internet (Don - nell 2010). The positioning differsslightly among these protocols but es-sentially involves an evocation of an undefined, unmeasured \"energy field\"that is purportedly emitted from thehand of the practitioner and interferes with an equally undefined field of thepatient. Interestingly, accidental reverse motions that might leave the patientsicker are never mentioned. One recip- ient of an NCCAM grant to study theefficacy of Therapeutic Touch, Gloria Gronowicz, was asked in July 2008 by a Hartford Courant reporter (Waldman 2008), \"Should somebody with osteo- porosis or a broken leg their Reiki practitioner?'\" Gronowicz re plied, \"Wedon't know.\" The majority of the clinical trials associated with these \"biofield\"awards, which include pro state cancer, fi- bromyalgia, cervical cancer, and coronaryartery disease, have been completed but few posted their results on NIH's official website (Figure 3). Some grants to study the efficacy of this \"hands off\" healing did not require clinical trials; they involved animals. A licensed Reiki practitioner at theCleve land Clinic received over a quar- ter of a million dollars (from 2002- 2003) to study the \"Effects of Energy Healers\" on \"... cholesterol-fed rab-bits.\" The project description reads \". ..

Seventy-two grants have been award - ed for interventions using Reiki, Thera- peutic Touch, and Qigong. Courses li-censing these practitioners are offered byintegrative medicine clinics, and in some institutions they are an elective part ofmedical school education. Respectedmedical clinics and academic institu- tions offer courses in CAM protocols. 3 The website of the Qigong Institute inCalifornia features a list of NIH awardsfor Qigong and Energy Healing Re-search (Qigong Institute, n.d.). Readerscan check with their local hospital or medical school to receive these treat- ments, which can be covered by the cur- rent health care bill. Some scientists are alarmed at the growth of national misconceptions asso -ciated with these distance healing pro- tocols. The Division of Biological Physics of the American Physical Soci - ety has endorsed a statement of its con- cerns on the use of distance healing: \"[The division] deplores the misuse ofthe term energyto mislead and defraud the public by improperly validating sci-entifically unsubstantiated healing pro- tocols.\" NCCAM has awarded grants totaling $11 million for these protocols. Awards for medical intervention by distance healing came with other op- tions. From 2000-2002, $417,000 was granted to the California Pacific MedicalInstitute for \"distant healing\" of AIDS by nurses and \"healers\" who prayed for pa- tients. The awardees published one of the few definitive results associated with NCCAM grants. It concluded: \"Distant healing or prayer from a distance does not appear to improve selected clinical outcomes in HIV patients who are on a combination antiretroviral therapy\" (Astin et al. 2006). Additional awards for healing by prayer: $823,000 to study effect of prayer on glioblastoma and $337,000 in 2003 for a clinical trial to study the ef- ficacy of distance healing on wounds re-sulting from breast reconstruction sur- gery. No results are available for eitherof these awards. One of the awardees, Elizabeth Targ, was a psychiatry professor at the Cali- fornia Pacific Medical Center in SanFrancisco. She died in 2002 at age forty- one of glioblastoma, a brain tumor, while conducting this NCCAM study into the efficacy of prayer on patients with the same cancer. In addition to being a founder-director of the Complementary Medicine Research Insti tute at the Cal- ifornia Pacific Cen ter, Targ was a re- search fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, a group that promotes para- normal concepts.

The study re- ports that the extract is tolerated and itsrecruitment of sixty participants is con-tinuing. There are no interim re ports onits effectiveness. Between 2000 and 2011 NCCAM has provided $105 million for Comple -mentary and Alternative Medicine(CAM) research for diabetes. These dol-lars were allocated across 362 projects. One of the trials, listed as completed in 2009, studied whether expressive writing would reduce stress and diabetic symp- toms. As far as we can determine from public records, the total funding was $106 million, about half of which came from NCCAM. Another trial, costing $390,000, tested whether MaharishiVedic Medicine could be an effectivesupplement in controlling type 2 diabetes.No results are available from either ofthese trials. Other diabetes trials featuredvitamin C, Reiki, and Glu cosamine.Glucosa mine received a \"thumbs down\"; the results for the vitamin C and theReiki trial are unknown. One trial, cen-tered at Griffin Hospital at Yale Univer- sity, reported, \"Chromium supplementa- tion was unlikely to attenuate diabetes risk\" (Ali et al. 2011). Healthy promises for soy consump- tion are a constant on the consumer horizon. NCCAM funded 111 soy awards (from 2000-2010) totaling $54 million. One result from Purdue Uni - versity reported that soy did not signif- icantly affect calcium metabolism and did not promote bone loss or calcium absorption in postmenopausal women(Spence 2005). A set of clinical trials (between 2000 and 2005) on the use of soy for treating several types of cancer was also completed, but their results have not been reported. Acupuncture is a popular alternative protocol. NCCAM funding grants for acupuncture over eleven years, 2000- 2011, have totaled $78 million (240 grants for fifty-eight clinical trials), with one posted result that published no con-clusion on the efficacy of this interven- tion for depression. In a recent publica- tion in the peer-reviewed medical journal Pain, Ernst et al. (2011) studied the literature since 2000, across all lan- guages, and concluded that \"numerous systematic reviews have generated little truly convincing evidence that acupunc- ture is effective in reducing pain.\" The paper also reported on ad verse effects of the protocol. Funding for botanicals totals about seventy-two million dollars. Many re- sults are far from earth-shattering;Gingko Biloba does not work for pre- venting Alzheimer's or dementia; lemon and lavender oils don't affect immuno- logical responses.\"Mind-body medicine,\" a heart- warming catch phrase implying per- sonal control over medical problems, ap pears throughout NCCAM project descriptions. We found it in six hundred funding awards (totaling $157 million). The mind-body mantra coupled with yoga embraced a subset of fifty grants totaling $11 million. Among the more startling concepts in the investigation of \"mind-body medi- cine\" were grants (of $351,000) for \"Transfer of Between Humans\" to Bastyr, a college of naturo- pathic medicine, to test whether \"a con- scious state could exert biological effects at a distance\" (Standish et al. 2004). \"Thirty seven (37) females and 23 males (n=60; 30 pairs) participated in the study.

Thus in another room 14.5 meters away this sig-nal would be reduced by a factor of sev- eral hundred.

Not deterred by lack of evidence, NCCAM engages in both subliminaland direct marketing for CAM. Sub lim - inally, through awards totaling twentymillion dollars for development of CAMcurriculum in medical schools. A study of these awards published in 2009 in Ac- ademic Medicine (Marcus and McCul - lough 2009) concluded that these curric-ula fail to meet the generally acceptedstandards of evidence-based medicine. Examples of direct marketing are grants to institutions, such as the ClevelandClinic, and individuals. Al though thereis scientific acknowledgment that dis tance healing is not a valid medicalintervention, nevertheless in 2010 NC -CAM awarded a Fort Worth consult- ant for \"large corporations and small businesses\" $188,000. His aim was \"to build, test, and disseminate an Internet- based wellness program that gives in- struction, guidance, and social support for the self-care practice of Qigong.\" Congressional misconceptions con- tinue to drive the industry and place a veneer of respectability on CAM. InJune 2011, Senator Bernie Saunders (I-VT) sponsored a conference on Com - ple men tary and Alternative medicine\u2014\"Taking Control of Your Health\"\u2014featuring speakers and workshops offer- ing complimentary hands-on sessions. The director of NCCAM, Josephine P.Briggs, MD, was a featured speaker. Ratcheted up by mandated coverage of alternative medicine in the health care bill, America's thirty-four billion dollar alternative medicine industry is poised to take advantage of the con- gressional mandate. State licensed health care practitioners such as chiro- practors are adding acupuncture and distance healing to their practices. NIH has fueled the process by using federalfunds for grants for market plans forthe industry. On June 13, 2011, Lawrence Lind - ner reported in the Washington Post that Congress has proposed ending a pro-gram providing federal funding to train40 percent of pediatricians and pedi- atric specialists. The pediatric resident training program, which costs $300 million, has been in place since 1999, almost as long as congressional fundingfor alternative medicine, a program thatis not being scrutinized by Congress or the administration. After nearly twenty years of funding, a paucity of reported results for clinicaltrials, and no discoveries that wouldlead to new areas of scientific medicalresearch or treatment, it is surprising that Congress has not recognized that taxpayers are funding a fruitless en- deavor. n Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge help from the Independent Investigations Group Wash - ing ton DC4and the librarians, IT services, students, and faculty at George Mason Uni- versity.

The practical joke succeeded,in spite of warnings and specific caveatswritten by Randi himself to the pro-gram director, James McDonnell. Whenrevealed, the hoax (Randi 1983a, 1983b)rocked the paranormal research commu-nity, re ceived extensive publicity in thepopular press 1, and to this day serves as a valuable instructive tool in courses on re -search methodology. In deed, I am willing to speculate that Project Alpha may wellrepresent the most effective applicationof instructive humor in the history ofparanormal re search. (Let me suggestthat, in honor of James Randi, when equally ambitious attempts at instructive humor are at tempted, they be designated \"Alpha-Level\" interventions.) Project Alpha is only one of many examples of instructive humor de ployed by paranormal skeptics. For others, one only need view a handful of episodes of Penn and Teller's television series Bull - shit!These magicians have fooled up- scale restaurant patrons into savoringexotic bottled water (actually pumped from an outdoor garden hose), teased blindfolded mediums with upside- down Ouija boards, and provided alter- native medical relief to pain patientsusing absurdly enormous fake horse- shoe magnets. Each stunt is presentedwith respect and with a full explanation of the critical thinking principles it il- lustrates. To these I add numerous jour-nalistic accounts, ex pos\u00e9s, satires and parodies, hoaxes, and tests with humor-ous effect. Learned professors are not above the application of instructive humor. In 1948psychologist Bertram R. Forer (1949) gave his students an apparent personality test and later distributed the resulting personality profiles. Students were quite impressed with the results, giving the test an average accuracy rating of 4.26 (0=\"very poor,\" 5=\"excellent\"). Of course, all profiles were exactly the same: a generic reading pasted together from random horoscopes. The \"Forer\" test is now a classic, used in hundreds of class- rooms each year to demonstrate the \"Forer\" effect (seeing a statement as per- sonally valid even though it could apply to anyone). Each of these demonstrations and tests is also an example of instructive humor (students invariably respond to Forer's test with laughter). Each po- litely makes a point about critically in- terpreting paranormal claims. In struc tive humor can be a very powerful tool in the hands of a skilled practitioner. Instructive Humor in Context Those who dare engage in critical dis- course over paranormal claims may quickly discover at least three ap - proaches. I am not referring to the tra- ditional Biblical (Matthew 25:31-46) groupings of sheep (blessed believers) and goats (condemned skeptics) or to ostriches (my own unbiblical addition). We are considering something new\u2014 neutral criticism , subjective relativism , and instructive humor. Neutral criticism . This, of course, is the preferred stance for scholarly publica-tion. One presents arguments in a dry and straightforward way without the in- jection of humor. Ironically, in my expe- rience, when manuscripts are submitted for consideration for publication, re-viewers use aggressive humor and even sarcasm without mercy. But articles thatLaughing Goats and Scowling Sheep Humor in Paranormal Discourse Humor, properly used, can be a very powerful way for skeptics to get their points across. JONATHAN C. SMITH Project Alpha is perhaps one of the most famous and elaborate instructive practical jokes played on paranor- mal researchers. From 1979 to 1983, two magicians, Steve Shaw and Mike Edwards, persuaded a team of scien- tists at the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research that they possessed remarkable psychic powers, including bending spoons with their minds, identifying pictures insealed envelopes, and magically creating pictures inside cam-eras. These \"powers\" were then demonstrated in 160 hours of experiments. However, unknown to the researchers, the project was the invention of James Randi, who trained hisSI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:13 PM Page 44Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 45survive this brutal gauntlet are often painfully humorless. Subjective relativism. Although variously defined, subjective relativism is often viewed as a philosophical perspective that reality is personal, created by our beliefs, and your beliefs and realities are just as valid as mine. As a critical per- spective, subjective relativism not only views paranormal and skeptical claimsneutrally but presents them as havingequal merit. This may seem quite fair and balanced; however, it opens the door to considerable mischief. Specifi- cally, it permits one to insist that we\"consider the controversy\" and elevate a questionable claim to the same status as the fact-based claim it contradicts. The most blatant example is the strategy of creationists to inject creation theory from the book of Genesis into high school biology classes by framing it as \"another theory.\" We see a similar ploy in one classic textbook on parapsy- chology. In discussing the spoon-bend- ing claims of Uri Geller, Irvin and Watt (2007) conclude, \"The authenticity of Geller's performance is a matter of much debate\" (emphasis added, p. 119). One viewing of a famous instructive and hu- morous test performed by the late Johnny Carson on Geller suggests oth-erwise (Google \"Geller Johnny Car- son\"). Remarkably, \"fair and balanced\" reviews occasionally grace the pages of top psychological journals and books, even with respect to classic and highly regarded works on complementary andalternative medicine (Field 2008; Krippner 2002; Krippner and Achter- berg 2000) or the psychology of religion (Azar 2011). Subjective relativism can be a science killer. If all perspectives are valid and subjective, then any paranormal finding can be embraced as \"just one way of looking at things.\" Worse, the relativist can conjure up new, \"equally valid\" ra- tionalizing scenarios, such as the sug- gestion that the negative energy, or neg- ative realities, evoked by skeptical researchers inhibit the emergence of paranormal phenomena. Given their rich store of alternative ad hoc explana- tions, subjective relativists can readily dismiss a strong negative finding with the caveat \"the jury's still out.\" I suspect subjective relativism is also a humor killer. If every perspective is as valid as the one you cherish, joking criticism be- comes impolite, even intolerant. Instructive humor . Humor can achieve a lot with a simple laugh. It grabs attention,disarms reflexive rigidity, and makes apoint. Perhaps you have carefully consid- ered a paranormal claim and have de- cided there is enough evidence to make a reasoned conclusion, concerning both methodology and results. Critics fail to listen to your observations. With exasper- ation, you resort to humor to break the ice and make your point. To illustrate, in class I find students persist in pat- terns of distorted thinking until shocked into wakefulness by humor and satire\u2014perhaps a lecture from James Randi or an episode of Penn and Teller's Bullshit! series. But humor has its risks. Even a gentle, mirthful tickle can provoke an in dignant cacophony of bleating and whining. Else-where (Smith 2010), I have cataloged the pained complaints of bruised flocks of paranormal re searchers, including accu- sations that skeptical \"fundamentalistic.\" Many no longer stoopto consider the criticisms of skeptics, con- tributing to a \"dialogue of the deaf\" (Al- cock 2003). It is incumbent on the skep- tical humorist to pick wisely from the quiver and aim carefully. For some para- normal researchers, quiet reason may no longer open the door. Major Alpha-Level intervention may be required. SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:13 PM Page 4546 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerThe Humorist's Handbook Here are five types of humor I have found most useful: 1. Humorous story . By far the most fre- quent application of instructive humor is the simple journalistic account of a paranormal advocate or incident. It is truly remarkable that the universe of theparanormal is replete with the weird,wild, and wonderful. Simply examinethe life stories of current popular advo-cates of specific claims, the reportedmanifestations of paranormal phenom- ena, and historical origins of specific paranormal claims. I propose thatghost-hunter researchers and their ven-tures are far more colorful than studiesof the genetic markers of evolution. Thehistory of research on the afterlife pro-vides a richer store of humor than thehistory of research on mathematical models of disease contagion. Skeptical journalists sometimes take delight in describing the foibles andpratfalls of paranormal researchers. For an excellent example, see Mary Roach's Spook (2005), a hilarious bestselling book outlining the history of research on the afterlife. Quality journals of skeptical inquiry and critical thinking, such as the S KEPTICALINQUIRER, offer a ready outlet for instructive and amus- ing stories and anecdotes. And of course, the extensive life work of James Randi presents a burgeoning library of humorous stories of things paranormal. These stories are not mean-spirited attacks used by desperate skeptics with weak arguments. Instead, the universe of the paranormal is its own best source of amusement, which when documented can provide vivid demonstration of the clumsy avoidance or misapplication ofthe tools of critical thinking. Unfortu-nately, when journalists entertain us with tales from beyond, they may fail to artic- ulate the lessons to be learned. 2. Amusing Expos\u00e9 of Foolery and Fraud. A good expos\u00e9 not only grabs our at- tention, it teaches a lesson. The world of the paranormal has had more than its share of amusing frauds; indeed, more than one area of study has been launched by a fraud. Consider the Fox sisters, whose secret foot thumps capti- vated early research on medium com-munication; the five teenage girls who tricked degreed professionals of the So- ciety for Psychical Research (in its firstscientific study) into believing their youthful psi abilities to guess cards andpeople's names; or Lady Wonder, a sen- sational psychic horse that amazed J.B.Rhine, one of the founders of ESP re- search. And then there is Houdini, whomade a career of exposing fraudulent psychics. These expos\u00e9s are worthy, even heroic, instructions. However, I cannotresist sharing the shocking double ex- pos\u00e9 of Swiss psychiatrist Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross. In the waning decades of the twentieth century, K\u00fcbler-Ross was famous for helping popularize near- death experiences, out-of-body experi- ences, and the five stages of dying (De- nial, Anger, Bargaining, Depres sion, and Acceptance). Many of her ideas still illuminate New Age and counter- culture websites and lesser university pro-grams in psychology and education. However, her career as a mainstream psy- chologist started to flounder after an odddouble expos\u00e9 at a K\u00fcbler-Ross retreat on death and dying for grieving widows. A turban-wearing male medium enabled widows to communicate directly withthe dear departed\u2014in a dark room,through sex. During one conjugal visit, the lights were accidentally turned on, exposing the naked medium (still wear-ing his turban). A subsequent expos\u00e9 re- vealed that several widows came down with identical vaginal infections (Smith 2010), an unfortunate fact that doused with cold water any post hoc rationaliza- tions that the naked escort was actuallyan accommodating clone of afterlife hus-bands. 3. Satire/Parody. The point of satire, and also often of parody, is to amuse through imitation while making a point. My fa-vorite paranormal parodies and satires are the faux religions, such as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (original and Reformed Pastafarian; Smith 2011) and the church of the Invisible Pink Uni- corn. To these I would add the Pigasus Awards, presented by James Randi to the year's most dubious paranormal claim, scientist, funding grant, media presenta- tion, or performer or the most egregious example of refusal to accept reality. 4. Hoax/Practical Joke . Project Alpha wins the prize. It amused and taught. 5. Reductio ad Absurdum . As typically and somewhat casually applied, this clumsy Latin logistical concept refersto the merciless elaboration of all theabsurd implications of a paranormal claim. A frequently cited example: ifpsychokinetic thoughts can influence the movement of physical objects, then gambling psychics should put casinos out of business. How to Make a Joke What is the best way to use instructive humor? First, those who use instructive humor should be willing to accept a clear and unambiguous piece of evi- dence for the paranormal. We should be willing to laugh at ourselves, espe- cially when Mother Nature tosses a cosmic pie in our faces. However, I wish to focus on an issue that is considerably more important: Explain your point. Two major articles, both unusual jokes that remarkably have made it into staid and respectedprofessional journals, highlight this es- sential lesson. In 2007 Leonard Leibovici, a highlyA good expos\u00e9 not only grabs our attention, it teaches a lesson. The world of the paranormal has had more than its share of amusing frauds; indeed, more than one area of study has been launched by a fraud.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:13 PM Page 46re spected and hard-nosed medical re- searcher, astonished the medical com-munity by publishing a study on the im- pact of retroactive intercessory prayer onserious blood infections (2001). Specif-ically, he obtained the medical files of3,393 patients hospitalized four to ten years previously. The files were ran-domly divided into two groups, one ofwhich received a short prayer re questingfull recovery and well-being. The pa- tients, being in the past, were unaware that they were the recipients of prayer. When Leibovici analyzed the files forboth groups, he found that the prayergroup had spent significantly less timein the hospital and had infections ofshorter duration. The study, which waspublished in the prestigious British Medical Journal , was not a fabrication and was indeed completed. Only carefulreading of Leibo vici's other writings re-veals that he was trying to make a hu-morous point concerning the misuse ofstatistics in paranormal research: that use of large numbers can produce spu-rious results and that we should be sus-picious of results that challenge the ex-isting body of data supportive of theprevailing world view. But this was not explained in the actual article. The Leibovici study is an excellent example of instructive humor in sci- ence. However, it illustrates another im- portant point: if you use humor to makea point concerning paranormal re- search, explain what that point is\u2014es- pecially if you dare to publish it in a se- rious scholarly journal. Leibovici failed to do so; indeed, one has to do a fair amount of detective work to figure out what he was up to. Because the point was not effectively made, his study fre- quently appears in the paranormal lit- erature\u2014not as a cautionary example of the misuse of statistics but as supportive evidence for retroactive causality (per- haps mediated by a spooky brew of tachyon particles and dark matterquantumly entangled in a wormhole). It is even presented as evidence for the existence of God. Skeptics have ignored the study, missing an opportunity to il- lustrate the need for research rigor. Contrast Leibovici's tongue-in- cheek article with a similar but more successful attempt to inject humor into a serious scholarly publication. In 1996Alan Sokal fooled the prestigious pro- fessional journal Social Text into pub- lishing as a serious article his techno the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.\" This parody is so good that it provides a more convincing quantum-based ra-tionale for parapsychology than cur- rently popular notions of quantum con- sciousness. But it is deliberate nonsense. Unlike Leibovicki, Sokal (2010) has made every attempt to explain the les- son of his instructive humor (even learned professionals can be fooled bypapers that contain jargon and \"flatterthe editors' ideological preconceptions\" about the subjective and relative nature of \"physical reality\" ). Beyond the Joke Leibovici and Sokal reveal two impor- tant caveats about using instructive humor: 1. Carefully explain your point and why you are using humor. 2. Invite your audience to engage in a dialogue about what constitutes goodevidence, the rules of the game of sci- ence, and the criteria for clear criticalthinking. Leibovici failed to do this and so his work has been misinterpreted, misused, and ignored. Sokal succeeded, and his effort has received the attention it de- serves. Indeed, I would vote to desig- nate it an Alpha-Level intervention. In conclusion, there are far more books and articles by paranormal believ- ers than skeptics. Yet skeptics are farmore likely to deploy humor. Do goats laugh while sheep scowl? Or perhaps when believers dig past the humor of skeptics, they discover a criticism that may have merit. Get past the laboratory practical psychic jokes of James Randi (or the fancy bottles of fake bottled tap water, upside-down Ouija boards, and gigantic qi-magnets of Penn and Teller), and you find a message that is worth our most serious attention. n References Alcock, J.E. 2003.

Here, in Part 3, we will address the interpretation proffered by some ofthose interviewed in the documentarythat DNA studies prove a direct bio- logical and historical connection be- tween the mound builders of the American Mid west and the ancient in- habitants of the Middle East. Lost Civilizations: Genetic Evidence DNA studies have helped to address im- portant questions about the biological makeup of Hopewell mound builder populations and where their ancestors came from, but the genetic data do not provide any evidence for a direct link be- tween the Hopewell and Israelite popu- lations of the Middle East, as some in- terviewees in Lost Civilizations claim.To date, DNA has been extracted from the remains of seventy-three individu- als buried at two sites exhibiting Hopewell archaeological features (thePete Klunk mound group in Illinoisand the Hopewell mound group in Ohio). Maternally inherited mitochon- drial DNA (mtDNA) was analyzed,and it shows that the genetic makeupof these populations was broadly simi-lar to other ancient and contemporary Native American populations from eastern North America (Mills 2003;Bolnick and Smith 2007) (Figure 1). When the Hopewell population (as well as other Native Americans) is compared with Old World populations,they are most genetically similar to populations in Asia. The scientific con- sensus, based on more than 150 studiesof Native American genetic variation, suggests that all Native Americans arede scended from a single source popula-tion that originated in Asia and mi- grated to the Americas via Beringia (Figure 2) approximately fourteen thou- sand to twenty thousand years ago (Kemp and Schurr 2010). This consensus reflects not only the observed patterns ofmtDNA variation but also studies of pa-ternally inherited Y-chromo some mark- ers and biparentally inherited autosomalmarkers. While the Lost Civilizations video does mention this \"mainstream\" per-spective, it emphasizes a different inter- pretation of the Hopewell genetic data. Specifically, the video suggests that the presence of a mtDNA lineage known as \"haplogroup X\" in the Hopewell population is evidence of a pre- Columbian migration of Israelites to the Americas because haplogroup X originated in the \"hills of Galilee\" in Is-rael and began to disperse out of theMiddle East approximately two thou- sand years ago. This argument is seri- ously flawed for four reasons. First, while several genetic studies indicate that haplogroup Xmay have first evolved in the Near East (Brown et al. 1998; Reidla et al. 2003; Shlush et al. 2008), these studies do not suggest that it originated specifically in Israelite or other Hebrew-speaking populations. Haplogroup Xis found throughout the Near East, western Eurasia, and north- 48 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerCivilizations Lost and Found: Fabricating History Part Three: Real Messages in DNA TheLost Civilizations of North America documentary suggests that there is genetic evidence for a pre-Columbian migration of Israelites to the Americas.

(2008) did find a higher frequency of haplogroup X in the Galilee Druze, a (non-Jew-ish) population isolate that prac- tices a distinctive monotheistic re- ligion, but the authors themselves point out that their nonrandom sampling strategy does not provide an accurate estimate of population haplogroup frequencies. Further- more, Shlush et al. (2008) arguethat the Galilee Druze represent a contemporary \"refugium\" for hap-logroup X, not that haplogroup X must have originated in the hills of Galilee (as diffusionist Donald Yates claims in the video). Second, and more important, the forms of haplogroup Xfound in the Galilee Druze (and else- where in the Near East) are not closely related to the particular form of haplogroup Xfound in Native Americans. All members ofhaplogroup Xshare some muta- tions, reflecting descent from acommon maternal ancestor, but other mutations divide haplogroup XmtDNAs into various subdivi- sions (subhaplogroups) that di- verged after the time of the shared maternal ancestor (Reidla et al. 2003). The Hopewell and other Native American populations ex- hibit sub-haplogroup X2a, which is different from the Druze (sub- haplogroups al. 2003; Shlush et al. 2008; Kemp and Schurr 2010). Be- cause subhaplogroup X2ais not found in the Middle East and is not particularly closely related tothe forms of haplogroup Xthat are found in that region, the hap- logroup Xdata do not provide any evidence for a close biological rela- Skeptical Inquirer | January / February 2012 49100% 90%80%70% 60% 50%40%30%20%10%0% Pete Klunk Mound Group (N=39)Other (N=218)Contemporary Eastern frequencies for Native American populations from eastern North Amer- ica and the Galilee Druze. Note the level of consistency in the distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups among Native Americans. The distribution of haplogroups in a Galilee Druze population is quite different. Figure 2. This map shows the configuration of the modern coastlines of northeast Asia and northwest North America, along with the maximum Late Pleistocene extent of the Bering Land Bridge. Its existence, between thirty-five thousand and eleven thousand years ago, provided a broad avenue across which human beings first entered the New World from the Old.

Third, it is misleading and inappro- priate to focus exclusively on hap- logroup Xand to ignore all other mtDNA lineages when considering the genetic origins of the Hopewell mound builders\u2014especially since haplogroup Xwas found in only one of the seventy- three Hopewell individuals studied. Asnoted earlier, when all mtDNA hap- logroups present in the Hopewell pop- ulation (as well as other Native Amer -icans) are considered, the genetic evidence clearly indicates an Asian ori- gin. Furthermore, if there had been a pre-Columbian migration of Israelitesto eastern North America, we would al-most certainly see other common Mid- dle Eastern lineages in the Hope well and other Native American popula-tions. We don't. None of the thirteenother mtDNA haplogroups found in the Galilee Druze is present in the Hopewell or other pre-Colum bian Na- tive Americans (see Figure 1). Nor dowe see any of the common Druze or Middle Eastern Y-chromosome hap- logroups in indigenous Americans. The genetic data therefore provide no evi- dence whatsoever for a migration of Is- raelites to eastern North America. Finally, DNA studies do not suggest that haplogroup Xbegan to disperse out of the Middle East only about 2,000 years ago, as diffusionist Rod Meldrum claims in the Lost Civiliza - tions video. Meldrum argues that there is a scientific controversy over the rate of mtDNA mutation, and he suggests that (a) the most accurate mutation rate estimates come from human pedigree studies and (b) those mutation rates demonstrate that haplogroup Xbegan to diversify and spread approximatelytwo thousand years ago. However, the particular controversy that Meldrumcites is a decade old, concerns the mu- tation rate in only one small segment of mtDNA (the control region), and has generally been resolved.

We don't.SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:13 PM Page 50served in parent-offspring comparisons, but many mutations are eliminated within a few generations of their occur-rence because of natural selection, ge-netic drift, and recurrent mutation atsome sites in the DNA. The measurablerate of mtDNA evolution therefore de-creases over time (Soares et al. 2009),making it inappropriate to use mutationrate estimates from pedigree studies fordating the origin and diversification ofmost lineages (for example, any thatoriginated more than a few generationsago). Instead, the mtDNA mutation rateis calculated by measuring the number of genetic differences between two ormore individuals (or species) and thendividing that number by the length oftime since they diverged from a com-mon ancestor. The timing of their diver-gence is based on fossil, archaeological,and/or geological evidence, and it is notsimply \"theoretical\" (as Mel drum sug-gests). Furthermore, Mel drum does notrely on newer findings to argue thathaplogroup Xbegan to diversify and spread only two thousand years ago, ashe claims, but rather on an old and un- usually fast estimate of the mtDNAmutation rate (Parsons et al. 1997). Vir-tually all pedigree studies have foundsignificantly lower mutation rates(Howell et al. 2003) than the one Mel-drum uses, which suggests that hap- logroup Xbegan diversifying much of thecomplete mitochondrial genome (ratherthan just the control region), using lesscontroversial mutation rates for the mtDNA coding region, also suggest thathaplogroup Xbegan to diversify much earlier (~31,800 years ago; Soares et al. 2009). Conclusion In the past, many scholars have pointed to a sometimes explicitly racist agenda behind the claims of diffusionists who argue that the glories of Native Ameri-can civilizations were achieved onlythrough borrowing from various Old World groups. The producers of the Lost Civilizations of North America and the diffusionists they feature in their docu- mentary turn this argument on its headby suggesting that it is instead those\"mainstream\" scholars who are the real racists because they deny Native Amer- icans their role in an already globalized world of the early centuries of the Com- mon Era. However, the only support forthis picture of Native American-Old World interactions two thousand yearsago comes from resurrected frauds and distorted history. There is no credible archaeological or genetic evidence to suggest that any Old World peoples migrated to the Americas after the ini- tial incursion from Siberia prior to the tentative forays of the Norse beginning at around 1000 CEother than limited contacts between Siberia and the Amer -ican arctic. n References Behar, Doron M., Michael F.

Disclaimer We are well aware that a claim underlying the Lost Civilizations documentary\u2014that the mound-building people of the Amer ican Mid- west were migrants from the Middle East 2,000 years ago\u2014may be in formed by religious doctrine. It is our position in this paper, how- ever, that whatever inspires this claim is not nearly as important as the fact that it is plainly wrong. As such, we will leave it to others to as- sess the role played, if any, by religion in shap- ing Lost Civilizations and focus instead on sci- entific evidence relevant to that claim.CIVILIZATIONS LOST AND FOUND: PARTTHREESI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:13 PM Page 5152 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerOf course, I agreed. The reporter ex- plained to me that the meteoric impact occurred close to Texas State Highway67 at a location thirty miles south ofFort Worth, very close to the county line between the Erath and Somer vell counties in the proximity of ChalkMountain. In fact, this place is locatedat the northern outskirts of the TexasHill Country, a geographical region ofCentral Texas four times the size ofConnecticut. The Texas Hill Countryis known for its vast diversity in botany and wildlife. Geological features in- clude limestone and granite. It is note- worthy that the greater area of the al-leged meteoric impact site is known for mysteries such as UFO sightings near Stephenville (January 8, 2008) and theThe Mysterious Meteorite of Chalk Mountain, Texas In May 2009 a meteorite impact was reported just thirty miles south of Fort Worth, Texas, but the mysterious object was of a very unusual composition for a meteorite. Had an impact occurred, it would have caused widespread devastation\u2014yet nothing of the sort happened. MANFRED CUNTZ From my perspective, the event started to unfold at 8:20 AMCDT on May 18, 2009, when I received a phone call from Sue Stevens, the senior media rela- tions officer at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). I'm an associate professor of physics and currently director of the astronomy program at the same institution. Arling- ton, well known as a sports and university city, is located in the center of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Stevens told me that she received an urgent phone call from Richard Ray, a reporter from a Fox TV affiliate, about a truly extraordinary event: a meteorite impact that occurred overnight, just south of Fort Worth. Richard Ray wanted to give me a call within the next few minutes, and he wanted to meet me at the impact site later that day.

Some of the UFO sightings havemeanwhile been attributed to nightflights and flares dropped by US Air Force F-16s stationed Fort January/February 2009). Visiting the Impact Site Due to my work schedule, I decided to meet the television reporter at noonatthe site of the alleged meteorite impact.I was accompanied byAurelian Balan,the astronomy laboratory supervisor atUTA.At the site of impact, we metCorky Underwood, who owned theproperty. We also met Arthur J. Ehl - mann, emeritus professorof geology atTexas Christian University (TCU), aleading expert in meteoric research, aswell as the current curator of TCU's Oscar E. Monning Meteorite Gallery.There were a few other spectators as well. The site of impact was quite amaz- ing. The supposed meteorite was nearly round in shape and as big as a standardrefrigerator. It was of a grayish-white color and did not show any signs of heat-related coating or disintegration. It was sitting near the end of a trench, and as a secondary feature it was sitting on a crater about three times the diam- eter of the meteorite. The trench itselfseemed to indicate that the meteorite was partially sliding on the ground be- fore coming to a complete stop. CorkyUnder wood also pointed to some treesin the background that had apparently been damaged by the in coming \"mete- orite.\" \"These trees were perfectly allright before the meteorite hit,\" he said. The tracks on the ground as well as the smashed trees pointed to an extremelyinclined meteoric trajectory. My colleague Arthur Ehlmann chipped off a piece of the meteorite with his pocket knife. \"This is lime- stone,\" he Limestone a sedi- mentary rock, one of the three majorrock groups that form Earth's crust. Itis composed mostly of calcium andmagnesium carbonates and is formedvia deposition in water. Limestone isn't found in meteorites. Meteorite Origins Meteorites are natural objects originat- ing in outer space that survive impact with Earth's surface. Most meteorites derive from small astronomical objects called meteoroids, but they are also sometimes produced by impacts of as-teroids, the large counterparts of mete- oroids. When they enter the atmos- phere, impact pressure causes the bodyto heat up and emit light. Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and stony-iron meteorites contain largeamounts of both metallic and rocky material. Stony meteorites are by far the most abundant. Modern classificationschemes divide meteorites into groupsaccording to their structure, chemicalOverall setting of the meteoric site.

Most meteoroids disintegrate signif- icantly when entering Earth's at mos - phere. If they hit the ground, the ob- jects are known to arrive at their terminal velocity and typically create craters about ten times their size. Ex- plosions, detonations, and rumblingsare often heard during meteorite falls,which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, up to many thousands of square miles. As meteoroids are heated during atmos- pheric entry, their surfaces melt and ex-perience ablation. They can be sculptedinto various shapes during this process. Obviously, all these features are in stark contrast to those of the meteorite en- countered at Chalk Mountain. The Meteorite in the News The Chalk Mountain meteorite re - ceived significant news coverage, in - cluding from Fox TV. Although the Fox TV clip, which aired on the evening of May 18, 2009, was clearly skewed to- ward sensationalism, it was still techni- cally correct because it stated that the so-called meteorite finding poses an un- solved mystery because its origin is still unknown. I also gave an interview to Whitney White-Ashley from a small local newspaper located at Glen Rose, the seat of Somer vell County. Angelia Joiner later published an online articleabout the meteorite that tried to create the impression that there is chemical evidence that the rock is not from the immediate area. Joiner also quoted Steve Hudgeons, lead investigator of the Texas Mutual UFO network, who of- fered a calculation about the trajectory of the rock. At that time, the true origin of the meteorite was a mystery. Conclusion I received an unexpected and intriguing clue via email on May 20, 2009, from John Maroul of Benbrook, Texas, who had previously forwarded me a list of sci-ence questions about meteorites. His email read in part: \"Look what CorkyUnderwood does for a living: Rents andsells heavy equipment that can carve limestone and dig trenches. Not saying he hoaxed this but it is more than suspect.\" The solution to the meteorite mystery at Chalk Mountain turned out to be both trivial and embarrassing. JohnMaroul's email also pointed me to the website www.recsinc.com, which con- tains detailed information on renting out earth-moving equipment. Accord ing to the website, the company's equipment isable to handle dirt and all sizes of rock. Together with the overwhelming scien- tific evidence that the \"meteorite\" could not be from outer space due to its lime- stone composition and, additionally,would not have survived its path through Earth's atmosphere, this was the final piece of the puzzle. Problem solved\u2014it was almost certainly a hoax.For those of you who would like to find and visit the alleged site of the \"meteorite impact,\" please be aware: thesite is located on private property (in- dicated by a clearly visible sign), and most Texans, especially those in the Hill Country, own guns. There may be an admission fee. n Note I later called the Fox News reporter to tell him my conclusion and the evidence on which it was based. Shortly after our phone conversation, the Fox News clip (which was about two minutes long) became unavailable. References Bennett, Jeffrey, and Seth Shostak. 2007. Life in the Universe, 2nd ed.

However, conspir- acy theories about missing records are built on the assumption that the com- plete and unambiguous truth exists in some source. These records are not mere evidence or witnesses to truth; they are the truth. Yet the nature of knowledge is fragmentary, decentral- ized, and is never revealed wholesale in any sacred tome. Records are biased, and facts get muddled by conflicting witness statements or by bureaucratic quibbling. Truth is found more in sta- tistics than in simple absolutes. This iswhy we need scientists, detectives, his- torians, librarians, investigative journal- ists, activists, and archivists\u2014not only to discover facts but to connectthese disparate pieces of information so thatthe facts can be properly understood. Without connections, the world of knowledge would resemble the library of Jorge Luis Borges's famous short story: filled with books that cannot be located without a classification system.When one works with records, it be -comes apparent how easily they can be- come disorganized or even lost without any evil intent. Even\u2014or especially\u2014in this age of Google, nothing replaces sound re - search techniques for connecting the facts. The tiresome clich\u00e9 of the \"dustyarchives\" points to an even more insid- ious image: the supposedly untouched oeuvre or the hidden manuscript that, once found, reveals everything. Pre sum -ably all one must do is find it, blow off the dust, and read it to achieve wisdom.Information Literacy and Conspiracy Theories Archives, 'Lost' Records, and Found Rubbish The public often believes that missing records indicate that important information has been suppressed by prevailing authorities. An archivist explains the nature of conspiracy theories, including record loss, and cautions against accepting \"objective\" claims even by original sources. KRISTIN E. HARLEY Conspiracy theories abound regarding \"lost\" or secret records. Examples include the disappearance of physi- cal evidence in the \"Black Dahlia\" murder case at the Los Angeles Police Department (Leung 2004), the missing slow-scan television analog videotapes of Neil Armstrong's moon walk (Kaufman 2007), and the alleged diary of a priest involved in incidents depicted in the film The Exorcist(Op- sasnick 1973). What would otherwise be a mishap or mere rumor gets blown up in people's minds as another example of the \"powers that be\" suppressing explosive revelations. If only we had these \"censored\" records, the truth would come out! It would destroy the Darwinist/atheist/materialist hege- mony! We have heard these canards far too often. SI Jan Feb 2012 NEW_SI new design masters 11/14/11 12:14 PM Page 5556 Volume 36 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerIf only gaining knowledge were that simple; if only teasing out the truth could be a matter solely of possession. For all our technical sophistication, most people are still woefully informa-tion illiterate and, misguided by cable news, the Internet, or Hollywood, have unreasonable expectations that makethem resist the tedious work of open- ended inquiry. This fuels popular con- spiracy theories and a hankering for revelation. College and university li- brarians, charged with teaching infor- mation literacy to students, are on the front lines of a battle that must be joined by faculty, archivists, scientists,writers, curators, activists, and journal- ists if the public at large is to break freeof the stranglehold that pseudoscience has on it. In my work as an archivist, I have had to sort through files labeled \"miscella-neous\" or \"filing\" or even \"?\" and recon-struct an arrangement that the docu-ments may have never actually had\u2014or that may have existed only conceptually while these papers were being actively used. This is no small task; a guiding principle of archival science is original order:the retention of associated docu- ments in their logical organization dur-ing their active \"life.\" In this, anarchivist's job is not unlike that per- formed by the brain as it remembers\u2014 both are reconstructive, involving the reordering and the discarding of dis- parate data. The aim is not to recon- struct this association \"objectively\" but to retain or restore the particular style of a creator\u2014the person or organization that originated the records. If a creator of a collection is organized, the archivist can focus on cataloging and preserving the work and does not have to piece together projects, chase down correspondence, de- cipher drafts, or evaluate handwritten notes. However, few creators are this ac- commodating, and it is not unheard of for an archivist to receive boxes of papers haphazardly dumped into them without any order at all. For this and other mundane reasons, records are \"lost\" all the time, while other records languish, properly cataloged but unread, their significance missed. Think of Gregor Mendel's work on heredity and what it could have meant to Darwin. Yet it was no conspiracy. Such historical The tiresome clich\u00e9 of the \"dusty archives\" points to an even more insidious image: the supposedly untouched oeuvreor the hidden manuscript that, once found, reveals everything.

I have never worked anywhere in which crucial documentshave not on occasion been misplaced,taken home, ignored, or mistakenly de- stroyed. More important, many collections were never complete in the first place. For example, if a scholar dies, Harvardmight get his dissertation, his home state's archives might get his letters, andhis family might have his unfinishedmanuscripts. At no time were this per- son's papers all under one roof. Afterthe death of the French writer Antonin Artaud, his relatives, friends, and doctor publicly accused each other of stealing his effects. Even the most meticulous cataloging system can allow a film toslip through the cracks, as apparently happened to the moon walk video dur- ing shipment (a particularly vulnerable time for any records system). Yet de- spite the fact that many other videos ofthe real-time broadcast were made on July 21, 1969, the \"lost Apollo 11 tapes\"still fuels speculation that the moon landing never happened. Yes, Virginia, police department ev- idence boxes routinely get lost, too\u2014 particularly when a cold case is over fifty years old. It does not matter how famous that case\u2014such as the \"Black Dahlia\" murder\u2014still is. In the early hours of January 15, 1947, the naked, bloodless, and expertly bi- sected body of twenty-two-year-oldElizabeth Short, referred to as the Black Dahlia, was dumped in a Los Angelesvacant lot. The criminal investigation be- came a national sensation, spawning myths that circulate to this day. A flurry of books has been published about the murder, including the engrossing but silly Black Dahlia Avenger by Steve Hodel, the son of the late George Hodel, who be- lieves his father was the Black Dahlia murderer despite the fact that the elder Hodel had been exonerated of the crime. Here the case takes one of its many twists, for Steve Hodel claims that the box containing the LAPD's evidence against his father has gone missing. Steve Hodel's unsupported specula- tions about his father's involvement with Elizabeth Short's murder are just that: unsupported speculations that are bolstered only by the younger Hodel'sobsession with photographs from his father's album that do not even resembleShort. Certainly, the loss of the evidence box does nothing to dissuade Hodel from his cause, but this loss actually presents an obstacle to any resolution ofthe case\u2014not evidence of any cover-up. Since the Hodel-as-the-Black-Dahlia- murderer hypothesis is at best uncon- vincing, it would seem that for some reason the younger Hodel merely wishes his father was guilty. People wish all sorts of things. No fewer than fifty men claimed to be theBlack Dahlia murderer (Gilmore 1998),and the elder Hodel hinted at it him-self. Despite evidence that points away from George Hodel's guilt, in cludingtranscripts from the bugs planted in the doctor's house, his son Steve persists in finding \"evidence\" for his assumed con-clusion. \"I don't have to be convinced. Idon't need an expert to tell me. I know [George Hodel's guilt] as a fact,\" hesays. Hodel? \"Because it's the truth\" (Leung2004). This lack of critical thinking is astonishing. Locating Hodel's evidence box could make no difference when self-styled investigators brandish ar -chives like swords over Dahlia turf in lieu of examining their facts in context. The point is, human records follow a trajectory all their own. In certain cir- cumstances, written records can be as problematic as oral testimony, and thuswe should be suspicious of any polishedsource offering \"revealed truth\" and claiming a historic origin. It just is not very likely that this is anything other than a modern fake. Which brings us to that alleged diary of the priest who inspired The Exorcist. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the novel and the screenplay, claims that the exorcizing priest kept a diary about the proceedings. This purported diary is held up by religious believers in exorcism, par- ticularly Catholics, as \"proof\" that The Exorcistwas based on a real account of demonic possession. The victim, a Cot-tage City, Mary land, teenager (not living in Mount Rainier as is popularly re- ported) was indeed troubled. Various car- bon copies of the diary with differing numbers of pages have been circulating for years; however, the journalist Mark Opsasnick uncovered this unfortunate boy's real story by following up on theboy's birth date as reported in the diary. (This is a simple piece of evidence thatshould not have been neglected by anyserious researcher, but before Opsasnick there had been no real research done.) The diary itself is unreliable as a source; the \"possession\" account is largely a rumor spread by word of mouth and re - peated by credulous newspaper reporters, and the true story reveals a disruptive, buthardly supernaturally endowed, boy (Op-sasnick 1973).

(As Jon Stewart once joked, \"Filing alpha-numerically? Slow down\u2014I don't have a doctorate!\"[Comedy Central 2009].) Possession is a novel, but it perfectly il- lustrates two aspects of the problemhere. First is the misconception that anysource can possess \"the answer\" in the same manner that a crossword puzzle contains its solution. Second is the pop- ular belief that prevailing authorities are driven to possess this subversive truthbefore the public learns of it. Research and scientific inquiry are thus reduced inthe popular mind to a mere MacGuffin plot device. Will the heroes (priests,scruffy English nerds, intelligent designad vocates, Tea Partiers, Birthers, 9/11 Truthers) rescue this holy grail before the evildoers (atheists, moneyed curators, Darwinists, liberals, the Obama Youth, scientists) get their paws on it? The sim-ilarities here to the persecuted Christians in their catacombs, or to Jews and Mus- lims under pagan rule, are obvious. It also has a parallel in the popular concep- tion of science as a collection of \"proofs\" or absolutes, rather than an often bewil- dering array of conditional probabilities, hypotheses, theories, and uncertainties. Therefore, it is not surprising that the naive and the credulous can become,well, possessed by conspiracy theories. The niggling and less sensational task of ferreting out obstinate facts is tooboring, time consuming, and suspi- ciously bureaucratic to those who want an unqualified truth that exists \"out there somewhere,\" complete and uncor- rupted and waiting to liberate the masses. It is so much more comforting for some people to believe that poets write perfectly honest letters to each other and keep them safe for posterity; priests record events faithfully without a personal agenda; the police must hidethe Black Dahlia evidence because of acover-up; or the imperialist United States never landed on the moon. Yet the fact remains that in an in- creasingly interactive online world, it makes no sense for the average person to remain passive and uncritical, merelyaccepting everything that any book,cable news show, or website tells them. The mere fact of there being a \"data deluge\" requires people to filter infor- mation; why not learn to filter it intel- ligently? If one is cynical enough to in- dulge in conspiracy theories, one shouldalso be sufficiently distrusting of sources to evaluate them instead of treating them as holy writ. The ability to locate and evaluate authoritative information, ascertain thecredibility of sources, recognize \"too good to be true\" offers, ask for and fol- low up on citations, demand explana-tion of internal inconsistencies, and begin to recognize one's own possible biases isinformation literacy. The more that the public recognizes that it must take an active role in vetting the bom- bardment from our increasingly inter- active, multimedia world, the less the public will remain passive consumers of a dose of fact washed down with a gal- lon of fraud. In so doing, it will no longer flatter \"the powers that be\" by giving them the power to withhold a\"truth\" that no person or organization can ever possess. We must all work toempower the public to be more infor- mation literate, for then the \"truth\" be- comes a matter not of possession but oflifelong seeking. nAcknowledgment The author gratefully acknowledges the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, for its contribution to this article.

The author of the first journalistic book about the organiza- tion, Paulette Cooper, nearly went tojail on a framed drugs charge after her book was published in 1971. Richard Behar's 1991 article, \"The Cult of Greed,\" cost Timemagazine seven years and $10 million to defend. While re- searching that story, Behar noted in a sidebar, at least ten attorneys and six private detectives were assigned to\"threaten, harass, and discredit\" him. Nothing so dramatic happened when I covered for Wiredthe Church of Scientology's 1993-1995 efforts to contain criticism on the Internet; thecreepiest moment was getting an email message demanding details of what I wanted from a top Scientology PRagent less than twenty-four hours afterrequesting an interview with someone I'd found online who appeared to be entirely independent. As long as Iavoided peeking up the financial skirts of the CoS, I was advised at the time by an experienced former Scientologist, I should be all right. I did, and I was. All of that is likely why, as Reitman says, there have been no independent journalistic books about Scientology in the past twenty-five years. Between1987, when British journalist Russell Miller tackled the biography of founder L. Ron Hubbard, and 2005, when Reit - man began researching the 2006 Roll - ing Stonearticle that formed the basis of this book, the field was left to Scientol- ogists past and present. Mem bers tend to write propaganda; those who've left tend to write out of pain, anger, and be-trayal. Reit man aims to be neutral, but it's fair to say that her account of theCoS and its works has more in common with those of Scien tology's critics. It is unsurprising to learn, therefore, that the CoS has issued a seven-page complaintabout the book, calling it poorly re-searched, inaccurate, and devoid ofinput from insiders. In an interview with Slate (www. slate.com/id/2298771/), Reitman has re sponded that she spent three dayswith the CoS's current spokesman, Tommy David, and visited its interna-tional base and one of its schools. The book is full of quotes from what were clearly lengthy interviews with manyScientologists\u2014most were disaffected,but some were still members when the interviews took place. I would not call it underresearched. Approximately the first third of the book reviews material that will be largely familiar to any who have readearlier Hubbard biographies such as Bent Corydon's Messiah or Madman? (Lyle Stuart, 1987) or Russell Miller'sBare-Faced Messiah (Michael Joseph, 1987). Reitman reviews Hubbard'searly life, the contradictory accounts ofhis military career, his work as a pulp fiction writer, and his marriages, as wellas the origins of Dianetics, Scientology, and Hubbard's personal vendettaagainst psychiatry. Famous beginningin the 1950s, Scientology found trac- tion among the exploring 1960s gener- ation. For some people, it worked or seemed to; for others, it brought psy- chotic breakdown. Less familiar material starts with the coup that saw David Miscavige, a Sci-entologist from the age of eleven, take control of an increasingly paranoid or- ganization. From there, Reit man moveson to the building of Sci en tology's basein Clearwater, Florida, and in great de- tail describes the notorious case of LisaMcPherson, who died in a CoS-owned hotel after undergoing a mental break- down and a cleansing procedure that was supposed to cure it.

Finally, she reviews the CoS's long-running battle with the IRS and takes a brief look at its fi- nances, which she argues now rely on re- turns on its extensive real estate more than the auditing fees for which it is famous. Membership, she concludes, is shrinking de- spite its claims to the contrary. People in Los Angeles will readily tell you that Scientology offers young actorstraining and career help in return for pro- motion later on. Hubbard originated this idea, but it was Miscavige who put it into practice by building the Celebrity Centre.There, stars like Tom Cruise and John Tra - volta see a much more indulgent version ofScientology. Staff and insiders live strictly controlled lives, working up to eighteen- hour days for little or no pay, and they maybe punished for infractions by the withhold- ing of food or sleep. The celebrity strategy has its drawbacks, as Miscavige learned in 2005 when Tom Cruise freaked out publicly on Oprah's sofa. Reitman's most interesting sections are those in which she follows the adolescent struggles of teens raised inside Scientology.Some rebel and are punished; others fall in love and grapple with the conflict betweentheir personal desires and the demands oftheir Scientology careers; a few regroup andthrive. Reitman is particularly im pressed bytheir poise, and she notes that in the orga- nization's schools Hub bard implemented teaching techniques that are now common-place. For these kids, the Internet has been a game-changer: it is no longer possible tokeep them away from all outside views. With all this material to draw on, it's not surprising that Reitman devotes only a para- graph or so to Scientology's battle to keep itsupper-level documents off the Internet. For- mer insiders say that Hubbard was very quickto catch on to the usefulness and importance of computers and that the CoS was a pioneer in its use of computer systems. As compre- hensive as Reit man's book is, somewhere therein lies another tale for the next brave writer. n Wendy M.

Turing predicted that by the year2000 computers would be able to trick human judges into thinking they were talking to a fellow human instead of a machine at least 30 percent of the time for conversations lasting about five min- utes. This has always seemed to me to set the bar so low as to make the entire en-terprise spectacularly uninteresting. Sure enough, reading Brian Chris - tian's The Most Human Human con- firmed my impression that the so-calledTuring test is one of the most hyped ideas in both artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind. Christian's book is well worth the read, particularly because he has a background and writing expe- rience that allow him to write for the public about both science and philoso-phy or, as in this case, about the inter- section between the two. The title of thebook comes from something that hap- pens during the yearly competition for what is known as the Loebner Prize. Hugh Loebner is an American inventor who in 1990 established a cash prize of $100,000 for the computer program that can do what Turing predicted com- puter programs ought to be able to doby now. No program has won the Loebner Prize so far but Christian participated in a side competition in 2009 for the \"most human human,\" an actual person who wins by convincing the judges that he is, in fact, a fellow Homo sapiens and not a computer. Christian used thepreparation for his trip to the competi- tion, as well as his experience there, to dig into the background of the Turing test, the controversies surrounding ar- tificial intelligence, and the scientific and philosophical aspects of language and thought. The result is an amusingand informative tour de force of the field, yet it may leave you scratchingyour head wondering why all the fuss. To begin with, as I said, the bar is set pretty low. We have actually had very simple computer programs (like the fa-mous ELIZA, which simulates a talk therapist) that are capable of doing a pretty good job of fooling us into think-ing that we are talking to anotherhuman (bad news for talk therapists, Isuppose). And they do that, unques-tionably, without any hint of \"under-standing,\" let alone of consciousness. Indeed, the whole Turing test idea strikes me as naively behavioristic in nature. Behaviorism was an approach toexperimental psychology championedby the likes of J.B. Watson and B.F. Skinner as a reaction to the excesses ofpsychoanalysis. Behaviorists decided that talk of internal mental states wasunscientific and that all that psycholo- gists can do is study external behavior (which has led to a small cottage indus-try of jokes about behaviorists asking others what they\u2014the behaviorists\u2014 felt in response to this or that). As much as it was probably a necessary corrective to so much un founded talk ofid, ego, and superego, behaviorism has since left the building as a viable theory of psychology (though it remains as aTuring Test for Human Beings MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI The Most Human Human: What Talking with Computers Teaches Us about What It Means to Be Alive.

The issue, as Christian makes abun- dantly clear throughout the book, is notwhether programmers can devise a cleverenough trick that can fool some peoplesome of the time (and for a short periodat that) but whether it is possible\u2014oreven makes sense to try\u2014to equip com- puters with something akin to human in-telligence and thought. (Please noticethat I do not subscribe to non-physicalistviews of human consciousness.) This, ofcourse, cannot be achieved by parlortricks like ELIZA, nor does one come much closer by designing programs like Deep Blue\u2014the one that famously beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Deep Blue was a testimony tohuman ingenuity, but it wasn't thinkingin anything like the way a human being does, despite its impressive speed of in- formation processing and clever algo-rithms devoted to single-minded excel-lence at a task. Christian seems convinced that the key to artificial intelligence is to be found in the implications of Shannon's Information Theory, which deals among other things with the compres- sion of semantic content. As Christianputs it at the end of the book, \"If a com- puter could ... compress English opti-mally, it'd know enough about the lan- guage that it would know the language. We'd have to consider it intelligent\u2014in the human sense of the word\" (emphasis in the original). Well, in some sense of knowing and intelligence this may betrue. But would we have succeeded in creating an artificial intelligence sub- stantially analogous to the human vari- ety? Would that computer be conscious of knowing the English language? There are serious reasons to doubt it. More likely, we would have created something different, and we might need to broaden our very understanding of what \"thinking\" means. n Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and author of Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk .

Kennedy is the author of Hidden Cities: The Dis- covery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization , published in 1994 to excellent reviews in, among other places, The New Yorker , theAtlantic Monthly , the Boston Globe, the Christian Sci- ence Monitor, and Kirkus Re- views. He presented the then- startling thesis that failure to investigate, study, and preserve ancient American earthworks reflected a deep-rooted and es- sentially, if not consciously, racist attitude toward the first Ameri- cans and the nature of their civ- ilizations. He discusses and de- bunks attempts to \"explain away\" the evidence by appeals to mys- terious Old World civilizing in- fluences (Chapter 10). I cannot understand why Feder et al. fail to cite this important book,which sets the entire train of modern developments in mo- tion, including the Smoot- Stout-McLerran documentary. Another more recent best seller, The Lost City of Z by David Grann (2005), tells the story of the last intrepid Eng- lish swashbuckler and explorer, Percy Fawcett, and his idiosyn- cratic and doomed search for a\"lost city\" in the Amazon. At the end, Grann reveals that Fawcett was basically rightabout the \"lost city.\" He was wrong about the material with which it was built.

People in Red fern's book re- port all manner of frightening and ap- parently pointless MIB harassment, and poor Colin Bennett, a prolific British UFOlogist, laments that a visit to his girlfriend's apartment by a mysterious MIB after they had a UFO sighting ledher to break up with him. Theories about the identity of the Men in Black run the gamut from hal- lucinations and hoaxes to vampires andtulpas (supernatural beings allegedlymeditated existence by high-levelTibetan lamas but which, like Franken -stein's creation, sometimes acquire an agenda of their own). The MIB are also theorized to possibly be time travelers, demonic manifestations, rogue civilian or possibly government investigators, orsome sort of trickster or fairy spiritplaying a kind of cosmic joke. By the way, there are a few reports of Womenin Black, although they are far outnum- bered in the traditionally male occupa- tion of UFO witness intimidation. The book is not entirely drivel, but much of it is. Some interviews with (andquotes from) well-known UFO logists about the MIB are informative and help set the historical framework for thisbizarre aberration of belief. Author Redfern, interviewed about the book by UFO writer James Moseley, said, \"I didn't make this stuff up. I let other peo- ple make it up for me.\" After the remarkwas published Red fern insisted he meant it only in jest, but the comment would not have been funny were it not so obvi- ously true.

The body of relevant evidence has expanded far beyond what wascited by Grann. The stories are strikingly parallel. While Fawcett may have been a Theo sophical crackpot and the mound builders inspi- ration for all sorts of fantasies and frauds, the fact remains that on both continents both scien- tists and the general public for far too long failed to see the ev- idence. That is a valid matter for sociologists and social psychol-ogists to ponder. Arthur M. ShapiroDistinguished Professor of Evolution and Ecology University of California, Davis amshapiro@ucdavis.edu Regarding the article \"Civiliza- tions Lost and Found: Fabricat- ing History,\" I strongly agree with the fact that \"Most Ameri- cans don't know much of any- thing about Native American cultures.\" Most indigenous Am -er icans, unfortunately, don't know enough about their ownancestors' migrations into North America either. Chester Twarog Hudson, Massachusetts Kenneth L. Feder, Bradley T. Lepper, Terry A. Barnhart, and Deborah A. Bolnick respond: Roger Kennedy's book is a well- regarded contribution to the liter- ature concerning the mound builders, but we think Shapirogives the author too much credit in stating that \"He presented the then-startling thesis that failure to investigate, study, and preserve ancient American earthworks re-flected a deep-rooted and essen-tially, if not consciously, racist at-titude toward the first Americans and the nature of their civiliza- tion.\" Startling to whom? The thesis is certainly correct, but it was hardly new or \"startling\" tothe archaeological community or to historians who had studied the pervasiveness of racism in Amer- ican society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Nor was Kennedy the first writer to de- bunk efforts to \"explain away\" ev- idence by appealing to diffusion of cultural influences or colonization. Kennedy builds his arguments in Hidden Cities upon a literature going back several decades. For ex- ample, the first edition of Robert Silverberg's book Moundbuilders of Ancient America: The Ar- chaeology of a Myth was pub- lished in 1968, and Kennedy's perspective in his Hidden Cities was already a central theme in this book published twenty-six years earlier. Silverberg's thesis is featured in Willey and Sabloff'sHistory of American Archaeol- ogy(first published in 1974) and in Ken Feder's Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology (first published in 1990). Our Debt to Hume Massimo Pigliucci rightly re- minds skeptics of our debt tothe Enlightenment thinker and skeptic David Hume (\"OnMiracles\u2014Again,\" SI, Septem- ber/October 2011). When Hume stated that \"a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature,\" he was not giving a definition of the word miracle but merely stating one necessary condition for the application of this concept. Hume's definition is given in a footnote: \"A miracle may be accurately defined, as a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent.\" (Enquiry, Sect. 10, part I). So, according to Hume, there are two necessary condi- tions for applying the termmiracleto an event: 1. The event violated a law of nature, and 2. God (or some other spirit) brought about theevent.This makes it even more difficult to establish that a mir- acle has occurred. One must show that an event violated a law of nature, and one must alsoshow that God (or some other powerful spirit) exists, and then one must show that the eventwas caused by God (or by someother powerful spirit) as op- posed to being caused by a human being (or a space alien)with extraordinary powers. Because God (as typically conceived) does not have a body, we cannot directly observe the existence or activities of God using our senses, so it is difficult to establish that Godexists and even more difficult to establish that some alleged su- pernatural event was caused by God (or by some other specifi-cally identifiable spirit). Each of the above two con- ditions presents a serious diffi- culty to any effort to show that a miracle has happened, but the requirement that both condi- tions be satisfied makes it nearly impossible to do so.

Many people use a simplified version of the scien- tific method in their daily lives yet don't think of it as such. I'll bet that when Sylvia Browne loses her car keys, she says to herself: \"Maybe I dropped them in the garage\" (formulation of a hypothesis); \"Let me go look on the floor of the garage\" (testing the hypoth- esis); \"Nope, they are not there\" (initial hypothesis has been dis- proved); \"The first place I went to after entering the house was the bathroom; maybe they arethere\" (second hypothesis); \"Let me check the bathroom\" (test- ing the hypothesis); and finally, \"Here they are on the counter near the sink!\" (validation of hy- pothesis). Furthermore, every time we use any of the countless tech- nologies developed as a result of the discoveries of science andare not surprised when they function as they are supposed to, we are declaring our trust in the truth-finding power of sci- ence. In many cases we are en- trusting our health and our very lives to that power. I sometimes wonder just how tenaciously a believer inpseudoscience would continueto cling to those beliefs if he were in a situation where he had a high personal stake in discov- ering the truth. Gina PataccaColumbus, Ohio In the Trenches While attempting to debate a new acquaintance about his penchant for chiropractic, I wasstopped in my tracks by his dec- laration that my \"opinions weren't valid because [I] readthem in books.\" He further in- sisted that I lacked his real world experience, which sup- ported his various beliefs in the supernatural and alternative medicine. I'm not usually stumped for a rejoinder, but this convinced me that he wasn't going to listen anyway. I'm still wondering what I should have said to him. \"Gee, the Bible is a book, isn't it?\" might have had some effect, but I doubt it. Just an example of the sort of mind- numbing thankless skirmishes I experience down here in the nonacademic trenches. Debra ThrallSandy Hook, Connecticut Deliberate Ignorance Isn't it odd that in the twenty- first century with so many ad- vances in science, technology, and education, ignorance is soprevalent in the United States (\"Deliberate Ignorance\" byKeith Taylor, SI, July/August2011)? I commend Taylor for having the journalistic back- bone to write so honestly about how ignorance and stupidity is so widespread. Most peoplewouldn't broach the subject. I feel that there are several reasons that ignorance is so widespread. Two are pure lazi- ness and the fact that people don't have the time in today's overworked society to really look into issues. It's much easier to let someone else do the thinking for you. Fundamentalist religion, which is cultism in my opinion,is another factor in American stupidity. It brainwashes people into believing only what they are told and teaches them not to think. A person who is educated or thinks for himself is a danger to religion. The Republican Party is an- other factor in the dumbingdown of America. It constantly does everything in its power to discourage and inhibit educa-tion. Education lets the sun shine in on its snake oil agenda. Yes, Taylor, you are so right. We are in the process of putting down our education system. We have politicians who denigrate evolution and global warming as if they are better experts than the scientists who study these things. I expect any day now to hear that the Earth is actually flat; if it's said by the right people, thousands will really believe it. Robert G. Reed Boyne City, Michigan Science and Religion Jim Clark describes the book The Language of Science and Faith as \"A Flawed Attempt to Reconcile Religion and Sci- ence\" (SI, September/October 2011). Science and religion come from entirely different premises. It is erroneous to prove or dis-prove the one or the other; each case is based on different prem- ises and rationales. Such attempts may be intellectually inviting but are doomed to failure. Leo Shatin Retired professor of clinical psychology Mount Sinai School of Medicine New York, New York Dowsing So, evidence does not support the validity of dowsing (\"Dows- ing: Dubious and Dis credited,\" SI, September/October 2011). Be that as it may, dowsingserves an important purpose in locating sources of well water. It relieves the landowner from the responsibility of choosing an exact spot to drill. If it turns out to be a \"dry hole,\" he can blame the dowser, not himself. Joe CallizoLower Lake, CaliforniaNICE Excellence The Commentary by James D. Herbert and Richard Redding (\"When the Shrinks Ignore Sci- ence, Sue Them,\" SI, Septem- ber/October 2011) is excellent, but there has never been a British body called the National Insti-tute for Clinical Effective - ness. They presumably mean the body originally set up in 1999 as the National Insti tute for Clinical Excellence, which since 2005 has been called the Na-tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, while still re- taining the engaging acronymNICE.
