Here are FAQs and links to deeper answers and source materials. Chilly's also put together a library website on COVID, now updated with vaccine news. Yes, research indicates that they are safe and effective. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines are undergoing the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Your vaccine will be fully activated before the end of the semester, which means at home you'll be able to: Note: The campus has not changed social distancing or mask rules for the classroom or elsewhere, so you'll still need to follow those guidelines until the rules change. You may have seen reports on social media or elsewhere about deaths after the vaccine. No deaths have been linked to the vaccine. Between 12/14/20 and 3/22/21, .0018% of people who received a vaccine died (That's 18 in 1 million; For comparison, you are over 3 times more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime). When someone dies shortly after receiving the vaccine, their death is thoroughly investigated. CDC and FDA physicians reviewed death certificates, autopsy, and medical records related to each death; o pattern has been indicating a link to any vaccine has been found. Yes. If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, the vaccine should not be a factor. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine brought together medical specialists in areas related to fertility and infectious disease to study COVID-19 and make recommendations. They continue to recommend that all people be vaccinated, including women who are pregnant or who contemplate becoming pregnant in the future. More about pregnancy and the COVID-19 vaccines. No. None of the current vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. All of the vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms such as fever or body aches. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus. Personal experience: Marie had the J&J vaccine two weeks ago today and so did librarians August and Melodie. Within 24 hours after the vaccine, August had a mild fever; I felt achy and tired; Melodie had a headache. Each of us had a sore arm from the shot. It was a little inconvenient, but we're all glad we got the vaccine. We can't wait to be in a room together maskless again! mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein (or part of a protein) that triggers an immune response. That immune response produces antibodies that protect us from getting infected from the real virus. More about mRNA vaccines. The Janssen Johnson & Johnson vaccine that will be available on campus next week is a viral vector vaccine. In this type of vaccine, genetic information is delivered to your cells by a vector (a harmless piece of another virus). The vector gives your cells instructions to make spike proteins on the cell surface, triggering an immune response. With both vaccines, our bodies learn how to protect us against future infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that we get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.The vaccine doesn't become fully effective until at least two weeks after you get your final dose. The J&J vaccine takes 4 weeks. Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That's because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. However, experts don't know for sure how long this protection lasts, and the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness. American Medical Association.
