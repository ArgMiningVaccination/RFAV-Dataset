Massage is tremendously beneficial for a wide variety of conditions and can be a powerful ally in caring for your overall health and well-being. Some of the commonly accepted benefits of massage include: - Alleviation of pain - Reduction of stress - Lessening depression and anxiety - Improving circulation - Relaxing muscles and decreasing stiffness - Increasing flexibility - Reducing spasms and cramping - Preparing for and recovering from workouts We offer many types of massage therapy, including: Swedish Massage One the most common and familiar types of massage is Swedish massage. It involves soft, long, kneading strokes, as well as light, rhythmic, tapping strokes, on your topmost layers of muscles, sometimes combined with movement of your joints. Swedish therapy relieves muscle tension, is often used after an injury and can be both relaxing and energizing. Prenatal Massage During pregnancy, your body experiences major changes. Prenatal massage can help with the effects of these changes by reducing stress, decreasing arm and leg swelling, and relieving muscle and joint pain. Particularly while pregnant, massage can be a helpful form of pain relief to assist you in being comfortable and feeling well, especially when taking medication and other medical options may be limited due to pregnancy. Using specially designed massage pillows, your massage therapist will help get you into a comfortable position for this type of massage. Connective Tissue Massage / Myofascial Release Connective tissue surrounds, protects and supports all of the other structures in your body. Fascia, a specific type of connective tissue, provides a continuous sheath of structural support for the skeleton and soft tissues such as muscles and tendons. Connective tissue massage restores length and flexibility to your fascia, and can reduce stress, relieve chronic tension, and improve flexibility and posture. Many athletes and dancers rely on this type of massage to enhance their performance. Connective tissue massage can also be helpful in preventing and rehabilitating from many types of injuries. Aromatherapy Massage Aromatherapy uses essential oils from plants for healing. Although the word \"aroma\" makes it sound as if the oils are inhaled, they can also be massaged into the skin. Essential oils are also used as an effective alternative treatment for infections, stress, and other health problems. Aromatherapy works on the \"smell\" receptors in your nose that communicate with parts of your brain (the amygdala and hippocampus) that serve as storehouses for emotions and memories. For example, scientists believe lavender stimulates the activity of brain cells in the amygdala similar to the way some sedative medications work. Aromatherapy massage is a popular way of using essential oils because it works in several ways at the same time. Your skin absorbs essential oils, and you also breathe them in. Plus, you experience the physical therapy of the massage itself. Energy Healing Hands on energy healing, where a positive energy exchange will take place. These energetic changes in the body will release blocked energy (due to trauma, stress, etc.) and allow positive energy to come in. The energy exchange will balance the energy of that area and promote the body's natural healing process. Crystals will be used to magnify the energy exchange. Specific vibrational sound will be administered during each session corresponding to the specific targeted area.
