Currently used conventional medication (ranging from pain-killers to biological agents) is potent, but frequently associated with serious, even life-threatening side effects. Used for millennia in traditional herbalism, medicinal plants are a promising alternative, with lower rate of adverse events and efficiency frequently comparable with that of conventional drugs. Nevertheless, their mechanism of action is in many cases elusive and/or uncertain. Even though many of them have been proven effective in studies done in vitro or on animal models, there is a scarcity of human clinical evidence. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available scientific information on the following joint-friendly medicinal plants, which have been tested in human studies: Arnica montana, Boswellia spp., Curcuma spp., Equisetum arvense, Harpagophytum procumbens, Salix spp., Sesamum indicum, Symphytum officinalis, Zingiber officinalis, Panax notoginseng, and Whitania somnifera.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2017-01-16", "cleaned_text": "by irreversible destruction of articular cartilage and bone erosion, induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-). These mediators increased the collagenase or matrix metaloproteinase (MMP) synthesis and the degradation of collagen type II, and decreased the synthesis of collagenase inhibitors, collagen and proteoglycans [ [2](#B2-nutrients-09-00070)]. Degradation of collagen type II by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (also called MMP-13) represents one of hallmarks osteoarthritis [ [3](#B3-nutrients-09-00070)]. [4](#B4-nutrients-09-00070), [5](#B5-nutrients-09-00070), [6](#B6-nutrients-09-00070)]. Monitoring the OA evolution and therapy involves pain and physical function assessment for shorter studies, as well as joint imaging for longer studies (1 year or more). Pain is evaluated with visual analog scales (VAS), while the functional impairment with Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC) [ [7](#B7-nutrients-09-00070)]. Other useful assessment tools of functional impairment are Lequesne Functional Severity Index [ [8](#B8-nutrients-09-00070)] and Karnofski Performance Scale Index [ [9](#B9-nutrients-09-00070)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-09-00070)], typically associated with high levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. RA is currently treated with a wide variety of medicines ranging from steroidal/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID and pain killers), to potent biological agents targeting specific immune and inflammatory pathways, such as TNF-alpha (TNF-) inhibitors and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists [ [11](#B11-nutrients-09-00070)]. Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen is most frequently used in very high doses (4000 mg/day). Concerning the pain killers, tramadol is highly recommended, but also other opioids (e.g., morphine) [ [12](#B12-nutrients-09-00070)]. Etanercept, infliximab and rituximab represent few examples of TNF- inhibitors used for the treatment of severe RA [ [13](#B13-nutrients-09-00070), [14](#B14-nutrients-09-00070)]. Anakinra (an IL-1 receptor antagonist) [ [15](#B15-nutrients-09-00070)] and for [ [16](#B16-nutrients-09-00070)]. [17](#B17-nutrients-09-00070)]: gastrointestinal ulcerations, hemorrhagic infusion hypersensitivity reactions, and auto-immune responses (e.g., lupus-like syndrome) triggered by TNF inhibitors [ [19](#B19-nutrients-09-00070)]; increased risk of severe infection, affecting mainly the respiratory tract, caused by biological drugs (anakinra, rituximab, or abatacept) [ [20](#B20-nutrients-09-00070)]; fatal cytopenia induced by methotrexate [ [21](#B21-nutrients-09-00070)]; etc. [22](#B22-nutrients-09-00070)]. These remedies may be have a beneficial effect not only on the symptoms but also on the course of the disease [ [23](#B23-nutrients-09-00070)]. [Table 1](#nutrients-09-00070-t001)) showed benefits in terms of pain and physical mobility, with low risk of side effects in arthritic subjects. These results warranting further investigation. 2. Anti-Arthritic Medicinal Plants 2.1. Arnica montana, family (fam.) Asteraceae [24](#B24-nutrients-09-00070)], and is one of the natural remedies most often used for rheumatologic conditions [ [25](#B25-nutrients-09-00070)]. [24](#B24-nutrients-09-00070)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-09-00070)]. A double-blind study on 204 patients comparing Arnica montana with ibuprofen in topical applications for hand OA found no difference in terms of efficiency and side effects (less frequent for Arnica) [ [27](#B27-nutrients-09-00070)], a result corroborated by another study [ [28](#B28-nutrients-09-00070)]. The equipotency of Arnica with NSAID in the local treatment of hand OA was acknowledged also by a Cochrane 2.2. many anti-arthritic combinations contain BS. [31](#B31-nutrients-09-00070)]. In another study, a B. frereana preparation decreased the synthesis/ activation of several inflammation-related mediators enzymes (MMP-9 and MMP-13, cycloxygenase-2, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2), thus and cartilage dissolution [ [32](#B32-nutrients-09-00070)]. [33](#B33-nutrients-09-00070)]. [22](#B22-nutrients-09-00070)]. and Curcuma longa was tested on a rat model of adjuvant induced arthritis and proven to relieve inflammation and arthritis, and also to diminish the production of TNF- and NO [ [34](#B34-nutrients-09-00070)]. [35](#B35-nutrients-09-00070)]. Indeed, a couple of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies done on patients with knee OA demonstrated that phytopreparations from BS gum resin are able to reduce pain and increase functionality after only a few days (a week or so at most) with no serious adverse effects [ [31](#B31-nutrients-09-00070), [36](#B36-nutrients-09-00070)]. A phytosomal Boswellia preparation has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of knee OA when added to the standard management of this condition (ameliorating the functional status (higher Karnofski Scale Index) and the symptoms (lower WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities questionnaire) Score) [ [37](#B37-nutrients-09-00070)]). It also hasten functional recovery and diminished pain and objective physical and humoral signs of inflammations in persons with arthritis of the hand induced by work-related overstraining [ [38](#B38-nutrients-09-00070)]. A combination of Curcuma longa and BS was proven to be safe and efficient in patients with osteoarthritis, alleviating symptoms and objective signs, even better than celecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) and being practically devoid of side effects [ [39](#B39-nutrients-09-00070)]. However other studies failed to confirm the efficiency of BS in the treatment of active RA [ [40](#B40-nutrients-09-00070)]. [41](#B41-nutrients-09-00070), [42](#B42-nutrients-09-00070)], a family of pentacyclic triterpenes, among which the main contenders were, initially, 11-keto--boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid. Oral or local administration of boswellic acids in a bovine serum albumin-induced arthritis model ameliorated the electrophoretic pattern of the synovial fluid proteins and decreased the infiltration of leucocytes into the knee joint [ [43](#B43-nutrients-09-00070)]. These compounds were considered until recently to inhibit leukotriene synthesis by suppressing lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5) in vitro and in animal models [ [30](#B30-nutrients-09-00070), [44](#B44-nutrients-09-00070)]. Other mechanisms were also invoked such as suppression of NF-B activation, reduction of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines C3 into the active components C3a and C3b, hampering the activation of the classic path of the complement [ [45](#B45-nutrients-09-00070)]. These were showed in various in vivo experiments, with various arthritic or non-arthritic inflammation models (e.g., hypersensitivity reaction in mice) [ [46](#B46-nutrients-09-00070)]. More recently, concerns were raised regarding both the action intensity of 11-keto--boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid, and their bioavailability, the latter being too poor to provide concentrations high enough for bioactivity [ [47](#B47-nutrients-09-00070)]. Nonetheless, another member of the family was proposed as active principle, namely -boswellic acid, able to reach much higher levels in plasma, enough to efficiently exert its inhibitory action on microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 and on the serine protease cathepsin G, which might be the substrate of the inflammation-suppressing aptitude of BS preparations [ [17](#B17-nutrients-09-00070)]. 2.3. Curcuma spp., fam. Zingiberaceae [48](#B48-nutrients-09-00070)]. [49](#B49-nutrients-09-00070)]. The ability to prevent the destructive changes in joints and periarticular bone seems to be comparable to that of betamethasone [ [50](#B50-nutrients-09-00070), [51](#B51-nutrients-09-00070)]. Liposomal encapsulation may help overcome the poor bioavailability problem generated by the low water-solubility [ [52](#B52-nutrients-09-00070)]. The osteoclast-osteoblast balance is tipped in favor of bone building, while halting the OA progression [ [52](#B52-nutrients-09-00070)]. In a rat-model of experimentally induced arthritis, a combination of ginger and turmeric rhizomes was superior to indomethacin (a potent NSAID) regarding the ability to alleviate both joint histopathological changes, and the extra-articular manifestations, including systemic inflammation (leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and hyperglobulinemia), malnutrition (decreased body weight gain, and hypoalbuminemia), and iron deficiency anemia, with no prejudice to kidney function and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (favorable lipid and oxidative profile) [ [53](#B53-nutrients-09-00070)]. [39](#B39-nutrients-09-00070)]. Curcuma domestica extracts have been shown to be useful in knee osteoarthritis, reducing the pain and preserving functionality with an efficiency equivalent to ibuprofen, but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects [ [54](#B54-nutrients-09-00070)]. A recent meta-analysis found relevant scientific evidence for the efficacy of turmeric as a therapeutic option in arthritis, but concluded that more studies are necessary in order to definitively pin it down [ [55](#B55-nutrients-09-00070)]. [56](#B56-nutrients-09-00070)]. In a rat model of arthritis, it has been shown to ameliorate the joint inflammation (evaluated by the neutrophil infiltrate density), in the first six hours after the arthritis-inducing event (zymosan infiltration) being even more effective than a low dose of prednisone [ [57](#B57-nutrients-09-00070)]. [58](#B58-nutrients-09-00070)]. The blockage of glial activation resulting in decreased synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord, corroborated by similar results in studies on cultures of astrocytes and microglia can be responsible for arthritic pain acid was showed until now only in non-arthritic animal models (e.g., acute experimental colitis in rat) [ [65](#B65-nutrients-09-00070)]. Kynurenic acid is also an endogenous oxidative metabolite of tryptophan, with glutamate-receptor antagonist activity, which may explain partially its analgesic properties. One in vitro study showed that kynurenic acid is able to inhibit the proliferation of synoviocytes [ [66](#B66-nutrients-09-00070)]. Its level was significantly lower in human subjects with RA than that in those with OA [ [67](#B67-nutrients-09-00070)], fact which suggests the beneficial potential of kynurenic acid supplementation in [70](#B70-nutrients-09-00070), [71](#B71-nutrients-09-00070)]. This suggests other HP constituents may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect. [72](#B72-nutrients-09-00070), [73](#B73-nutrients-09-00070), [74](#B74-nutrients-09-00070)]. The severity of pain and other symptoms was assessed by the WOMAC questionnaire, VAS, Lequesne Index, physician exam and/or pain-relieving medication dose. [75](#B75-nutrients-09-00070)]. Harpagoside inhibited in vitro the synthesis of various pro-inflammatory mediators via suppression of iNOS and COX-2 expression through inhibition of NF-B activation [ [76](#B76-nutrients-09-00070)], but showed no anti-inflammatory activity in one animal model of inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw edema) [ [70](#B70-nutrients-09-00070)]. The scientists suggested that other phytochemicals than harpagoside may be contributors to the anti-inflammatory effect routine therapy (diclofenac sodium, Leflunomide and prednisone) in terms of joint swelling, tenderness, and pain index, as well as time of morning stiffness, VAS and immunological parameters, in patients with RA [ [82](#B82-nutrients-09-00070)]. 2.7. Salix spp., fam. papyrus (about 1550 BC) [ [85](#B85-nutrients-09-00070)], and afterwards by all the great masters of medicine in antiquity, middle ages, and modern times [ [86](#B86-nutrients-09-00070)]. [87](#B87-nutrients-09-00070)]. [88](#B88-nutrients-09-00070)]. The ability to mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress was corroborated by still another study on the collagen induced arthritis animal model [ [89](#B89-nutrients-09-00070)]. [86](#B86-nutrients-09-00070)]. A two-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated the ability of willow bark extract (in a dose equivalent to 240 mg salicin/day) to control the symptoms of patients with OA, especially to reduce pain, although with rather subdued efficiency [ [90](#B90-nutrients-09-00070)]. The same dose of willow bark extract was used in two other six-week, randomized, controlled, double-blind trials in patients with OA and RA, respectively, the herbal preparation being compared with a potent NSAID (diclofenac) and with placebo. The two trials yielded sobering results, as in neither was willow bark extract significantly better than placebo in pain relief [ [91](#B91-nutrients-09-00070)]. In a six-week, open, multicentric observational study with reference treatment, WBE was evaluated as better as conventional therapy by physicians and patients alike, in terms of both therapeutic efficiency and side effects, when used for hip and knee degenerative disease [ rat model of acute gout-like arthritis, SO strongly hindered the inflammatory reaction, thinning the inflammatory infiltrate, lowering the levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6), impeding the activity of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) (at least in the mast cells) and complement system activation [ [97](#B97-nutrients-09-00070)]. In another rat model of OA, SO alleviated joint pain by inhibiting oxidative aggression (decline in the peroxidation of lipids and in the production of superoxide anion and peroxynitrite, and a surge in glutathione and glutathione peroxidase levels) in the muscles associated with nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor [ [1](#B1-nutrients-09-00070)]. SO is active in experimentally induced arthritis through its minor constituents (devoid of these minor constituents it is inactive), decreasing not only the clinically visible joint inflammation, but also its serum markers (oxidative stress related molecules, RA markers, inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines) and the activity of hydrolytic enzymes; additionally, bone loss was also diminished [ [99](#B99-nutrients-09-00070)]. [100](#B100-nutrients-09-00070)]. In a placebo controlled trial on patients with knee OA, sesame seed administration was associated with a statistically significant drop in serum levels of malondialdehyde and of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) after two months of treatment. and significantly lowered levels of IL-6 after treatment [ [101](#B101-nutrients-09-00070)]. [102](#B102-nutrients-09-00070)]. Sesamol has been proven to mitigate joint inflammation, cartilage degradation, and periarticular bone resorbtion in adjuvant-induced arthritis animal model. This action was paralleled by a drop in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in the activity of tissue-destructive enzymes [ [103](#B103-nutrients-09-00070)]. In addition, a restoration of the oxidant homeostasis reflected in decreased oxidative stress markers and a boost in the activity of protective enzymes were noticed [ [103](#B103-nutrients-09-00070)]. The hydroperoxides-scavenging capacity of sesamol makes it able to arrest the oxidation state of iron and consequently the conversion of inactive LOX (Fe2+) to active LOX (Fe3+), which synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) in RAW 264 cell culture [ [117](#B117-nutrients-09-00070)]. [117](#B117-nutrients-09-00070)]. In addition, it augmented the serum corticosterone level, and this may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect of ZO. [118](#B118-nutrients-09-00070)]. Several other studies showed clinical improvement in OA patients with ZO extract, as evaluated by the pain score with VAS, reduction in intake of rescue medication, having mostly mild gastrointestinal adverse events, and similar or even better efficacy and satisfaction score than the standard treatment prescribed by the orthopedic specialist [ [119](#B119-nutrients-09-00070), [120](#B120-nutrients-09-00070), [121](#B121-nutrients-09-00070)]. [122](#B122-nutrients-09-00070)]. However, one cross-over study (a wash-out period of one week followed by three treatment periods of three weeks duration each) found no significant difference between placebo and ginger extract in OA patients [ [123](#B123-nutrients-09-00070)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-09-00070)]-gingerdione inhibited B kinase activity required for NF-B activation and suppressed NF-B-regulated expression of inflammatory macrophages. [ [114](#B114-nutrients-09-00070)]. Other compounds from ZO (10-gingerol, 8-shogaol and 10-shogaol) showed the capacity to inhibitory effects on collagenase activity against the degradation of the bovine Achilles tendon type I collagen, that may be useful in joint disease treatment [ [127](#B127-nutrients-09-00070)]. [128](#B128-nutrients-09-00070)]. [129](#B129-nutrients-09-00070)]. [126](#B126-nutrients-09-00070)]. Whitaferin A reverted to near normal levels the increase in paw volume, lysosomal enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and TNF in an monosodium [ [130](#B130-nutrients-09-00070)]. Withaferin A supressess NF-B activation by targeting a 179 in IB kinase , NF-B Essential Modulator/ IB kinase association complex formation, according to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies [ [131](#B131-nutrients-09-00070), [132](#B132-nutrients-09-00070)]. 3. Concluding Remarks [133](#B133-nutrients-09-00070)]. The available studies did not evaluate the effect of plant extracts on disease progression, or whether it halts the aggravation of arthropathies. For this purpose, studies of longer duration should be performed. [134](#B134-nutrients-09-00070), [135](#B135-nutrients-09-00070), [136](#B136-nutrients-09-00070), [137](#B137-nutrients-09-00070)].
