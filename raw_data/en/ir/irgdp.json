On the occasion of the Federal Delegate Conference of the German Green Party [B\u00fcndnis90/DieGr\u00fcnen] on 15-17 November 2019 in Bielefeld, the motion V-01 on \"Real patient protection: end the prejudice of homeopathy\" was presented. The motion V-01 contained three central claims: effects of homoeopathically potentized substances were said to be \"not detectable\"; \"lack of efficacy of homeopathic treatment beyond the placebo effect\" was claimed to be \"repeatedly demonstrated in very large and high-quality trials\"; and there were alleged \"health risks of delayed treatment\" if homeopathic products are used instead of conventional drugs \"to treat dangerous or chronic diseases\". We published a [scientific assessment](http://www.ifaemm.de/Abstract/PDFs/Hamre_Kiene_Assessment_Motion_V01_2019.pdf) of this motion. The three claims did not stand up to scrutiny: in many experiments, homoeopathically potentised substances have shown reproducible effects on biological processes; in meta-analyses of clinical trials including most subsets of high-quality studies, homeopathic treatment has beneficial effects beyond placebo; and the available evidence from comparative studies and case reports does not support the notion of health risks from homeopathy. Despite the declared commitment of the motion V-01 \"to a health policy based on scientific knowledge\"; the central claims of the motion were shown to be false and misleading, reflecting unverified popular opinions and ignoring the actual evidence base.
