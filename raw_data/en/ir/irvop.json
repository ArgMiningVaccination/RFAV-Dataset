A B S T R A C T Background Maintenance treatments are effective in retaining patients i n treatment and suppressing heroin use. Questions remain re garding the efcacy of additional psychosocial services. Objectives T o evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any agon ist maintenance treatment versus standard agonist treatmen t for opiate dependence Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials registe r (June 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6, 2011), PUBMED (1996 to 2011); EMBASE (January 1980 to 2011); CINAHL (January 2003 to 2011); PsycINFO (1985 to 2003) and reference list of articles.

Comparing the different psychosocial approach es, results are never statistically signicant for all the compari sons and outcomes. Authors' conclusions For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosoci al support to standard maintenance treatments do not add addi tional benets. Data do not show differences also for contingency appr oaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies w as too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be no ted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offer s counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the rev iew, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychos ocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is pr ovided, but the narrower question of whether a specic more structured intervention provides any additional benet to a standard p sychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and ev aluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatm ent outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interperso nal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Combined psychosocial and agonist maintenance interventi ons for treatment of opioid dependence The abuse of opioid drugs and drug dependency are major health and social issues. Maintenance treatments with pharmacologica l agents can help to reduce the risks associated with the use of street dru gs for drug addicts who are unable to abstain from drug use. Met hadone is effective in retaining patients in treatment and reducing h eroin use but re-addiction remains as a substantial challenge. Opiate addicts often have psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depressio n and may not be able to cope with stress. Psychosocial intervent ions including psychiatric care, psychotherapy, counselling, and so cial work services are commonly offered as part of the maintenan ce programs. Psychological support varies from structured psycho therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and supporti ve-expressive therapy to behavioural interventions and contingency manage ment. This review addressed whether a specic psychosocial interven tion provides any additional benet to pharmacological enance treatment. The control intervention was a maintenance progra m, which routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to pharma- cological treatment. Present evidence suggests that adding ps ychosocial support does not change the effectiveness of retenti on in treat- ment and opiate use during treatment. Findings on retention in treatment were for 12 different psychosocial intervention s including contingency management. These conclusions are based on 34 rando mised trials involving 3777 opiate addicts, some 73% of whom were male. All but three studies were conducted in the USA. The previous version of this review showed a reduction in opia te use during treatment that was no longer the case with the add ition of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abst inent at the end of follow up. The psychosocial interventions a re likely to require rigorous assessment of any changes in emotional, i nterpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life fu nctioning that may indirectly reduce drug use over longer periods of time. 2 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Substance dependence continues to be a major clinical and social problem affecting millions of people worldwide and causing su b- stantial costs to society. Drug dependence has been described by the World Health Orga- nization as \"a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cogni tive phenomena of variable intensity, in which the use of a psychoac- tive drug (or drugs) takes on a high priority. The necessary de- scriptive characteristics are preoccupation with a desire to obta in and take the drug and persistent drug-seeking behaviour. Det er- minants and the problematic consequences of drug dependence may be biological, physiological or social, and usually intera ct.\" (WHO 2009 ). Abuse and dependence on opioid drugs are major health and socia l issues in most societies.The UNODC estimates the total numbe r of opiates users at the global level between 15.2-21.1 millio n peo- ple (UNODC 2007 ). More than half of the world's opiates using population are thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the population aged 15-64 years) ar e found along the main drug trafcking routes out of Afghanista n. T rends in use appear to indicate a stabilisation of the overal l num- ber of heroin users in Europe, but recent data on drug induced deaths are mostly associated with opioid use ( EMCDDA 2009 ). The largest heroin using population in the Americas is found i n the USA where approximately 1.2 million heroin users (0.6% of the population aged 15-64) have been estimated ( UNODC 2010 ). Description of the intervention Data from literature and clinical experience, suggest that met ha- done treatment aimed at maintenance is effective. Maintenance treatments, for those who are not yet able to achieve a drug fre e state, may help to reduce the risks associated with the use of st reet drugs. Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse in heroin use, a nd re- lapse from the drug-free state to re-addiction is a substantial prob- lem in the rehabilitation of dependent heroin users. The difculty for drug addicts in maintaining a drug-free state makes the psychological process underlying addiction particula rly important in developing treatments and their importance is b e- coming increasingly apparent ( Farrell 1994 ;Philips 1986 ). The continued use of illicit substance reflects the drug addict's continuing inability to cope with stress. In this category of pa tients, the process of affective states elaboration is often delegate d to an external factor such as a substance mood modier. The substance abuse is reinforced by the positive expectancies towards the dr ug's effectiveness in reducing the stress due to the deciencies in cop ing with situational demands ( Castellani 1997 ).Why it is important to do this review The Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol has conducted six reviews on maintenance treatment of opioid dependence ( Clark 2002 ;Faggiano 2003 ;Ferri 2010 ;Minozzi 2011 ;Mattick 2008 ; ). These reviews highlight that methadone mainte- nance at proper doses is the most effective treatment in retain ing patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use but shows w eak evidence of effectiveness towards other relevant outcomes such as mortality, criminal activity and quality of life. However, pe rhaps the only component of methadone maintenance treatment that has been conclusively evaluated is the dose level of the medicat ion itself ( Faggiano 2003 ). While the dose of methadone is clearly an \"active ingredient\" in methadone maintenance treatment, que s- tions remain regarding the efcacy and value of the support ser - vices such as psychiatric care, psychotherapies, drug abuse coun- selling, urine monitoring, and social work services that are co m- monly offered by most maintenance programs and by all other forms of substance abuse treatment. Psychosocial treatments for opioid dependence are a critical com- ponent of the overall treatment package and require evaluati on as stand-alone interventions but also in combination with pha r- macotherapies. This current review focuses on psychosocial trea t- ments delivered in association with pharmacological maintena nce treatment, to determine if the psychosocial treatments are ef fec- tive in influencing adherence to treatment and in reducing relap se rates. In parallel with this review, there are two other part ner re- views. The rst looks at the effectiveness of psychosocial inte The second looks at the effectiveness of psychoso- cial interventions alone for opiate dependence and abuse ( Mayet 2004 ). Heterogeneity of the population with substance use disorder s, and the wide range of different psychosocial interventions, make s it very difcult to identify a particular therapeutic intervent ion as the gold-standard in this area. Hence this review will be comprehen sive in the list of interventions which will be considered with the a im of including every type of psychosocial intervention provided to patients in conjunction with agonist maintenance treatment. N o a priori choice will be made, since the scope of the review is to expl ore if psychosocial treatments contribute to the achievements of th e expected outcomes, rather than ranking the different treatme nts. Should one of the treatments considered appear to prevail, it will be separately reviewed.

M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials T ypes of participants Opiate addicts undergoing any psychosocial associated with any agonist maintenance intervention. People less than 18 years of age and pregnant women were exclud ed because the pharmacological treatments for these people are of ten different from those offered to the general population. No restrictions for people with physical or psychological illne ss. T ypes of interventions Experimental Interventions: Psychosocial plus agonist mainte- nance interventions of any kind (any psychosocial and any drug) compared to: Control intervention: Any agonist treatments alone for opiate maintenance therapy. It was intended to consider outcomes for participants using mul ti- ple drugs separately because these people may respond differ ently to psychosocial interventions than those with less severe pro blems. However, insufcient information of this nature was availab le to make this comparison. Psychosocial treatments in combination with antagonist maint e- nance (e.g. naltrexone) treatment is not included in this revie w. The aims and context of antagonist maintenance are in quite dif - ferent to agonist maintenance therapy and it would be complex dealing with this diversity as well as the diversity in psycho social interventions.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data collection and analysis Selection of studies One author (Amato) inspected the search hits by reading the titl es and the abstracts. We obtained the full text of each potentiall y relevant study located in the search and two authors (Amato, Mi- nozzi) independently assessed the articles for inclusion. Do ubts were resolved through discussion Multiple publications were col- lated and assessed as one study. Data extraction and management T wo authors (LA, SM) independently extracted data.Any disagr ee- ment was discussed and resolved by consensus. Key ndings have been summarized descriptively in the rst instance and assess ed for possible meta-analysis. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies The risk of bias assessment for RCTs were performed using the cri- teria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2011 ). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Review is a two-part tool, addressing seve n specic domains, namely sequence generation and allocation con - cealment selection bias), blinding of participants and provide rs (performance bias) blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias ) , incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) selective outcome re- porting (reporting bias) and other source of bias. The rst par t of the tool involves describing what was reported to have hap- pened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assign ing a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in ter ms of low, high or unclear risk. T o make these judgments we will use t he criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to the addiction el d. SeeAppendix 6 for details. The domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) were addressed in the tool by a sin gle entry for each study. Blinding of participants and, personnel (avoidance of perform ance bias) were not assessed because it was not feasible for the kin d of intervention. Blinding of outcome assessor (avoidance of dete c- tion bias) were considered separately for objective outcomes (e .g. retention, abstinence measured by urine-analysis, subjects s till in treatment or abstinent at the end of follow up) and subjective out- comes (e.g. side effects, social functioning as integration at sch ool or at work, family relationship). Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were con- sidered for all outcomes except for the drop out from the treat- ment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. See Appendix 6 for criteria used to assess risk of bias. Grading of evidence The quality of evidence was assessed according to GRADE method (Guyatt 2008 ;Guyatt 2011 ), a method systematic and explicit.In order to indicate the extent to which one can be condent that an estimate of effect is correct, judgments about the quality of evidence are made for each comparison and outcome. These judg- ments consider study design (RCT , quasi RCT or observational study), study quality (detailed study design and execution), con - sistency of results (similarity of estimates of effect across st udies), precision of estimates, and directness (the extent to which peop le, interventions and outcome measures are similar to those of in ter- est). The following denitions in grading the quality of evid ence for each outcome are used: High: further research is very unlike ly to change our condence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: fur- ther research is likely to have an important impact on our con- dence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on o ur condence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Measures of treatment effect Dichotomous outcomes (retention, abstinence by primary sub- stance, results at follow-up) have been analysed calculating th e Relative risk (RR) for each trial with the uncertainty in each res ult being expressed by their condence intervals. Continuous outcomes (compliance, psychiatric symptoms, de- pression) have been analysed calculating the Mean Difference (MD) with 95%CI. Weighted mean differences and 95% con- dence intervals (CI) were calculated comparing and pooled the mean score differences from the end of treatment to baseline fo r each group. In case of missing data about the standard deviatio n of the change we imputed this measure using the standard deviati on at the end of treatment for each group. Unit of analysis issues We have not used data presented as number of positive urine te sts over total number of tests in the experimental and control gro up as measure of substance abuse. This is because using tests inst ead of the participants as the unit of analysis violates the hypot hesis of independence among observations. In fact, the results of te sts done in each participant are not independent. If all arms in a multi-arm trial are to be included in the meta- analysis and one treatment arm is to be included in more than one of the treatment comparisons, then we divided the number o f events and the number of participants in that arm by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method avoid the multipl e use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial. It compromis es the precision of the pooled estimate slightly. Assessment of heterogeneity Statistically signicant heterogeneity among primary outcom e studies was assessed with Chi-squared (Q) test and I-squared 7 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(Higgins 2011 ). A signicant Q ( P<.05) and I-squared of at least 50% was considered as statistical heterogeneity. Assessment of reporting biases We used funnel plots (plots of the effect estimate from each stud y against the sample size or effect standard error) to assess th e po- tential for bias related to the size of the trials, which could i ndicate possible publication bias Data synthesis The outcome measures from the individual trials were combined through meta-analysis where possible (clinical comparability o f in- tervention and outcomes between trials) using a xed-effect mo del unless there is signicant statistical heterogeneity, in whi ch case a random-effects model was used. Sensitivity analysis T o incorporate assessment in the review process we rst plotte d intervention effects estimates stratied for risk of bias fo r each rel- evant domain. If differences in results were presents among s tud- ies at different risk of bias, we then performed sensitivity analysisexcluding from the analysis studies with high risk of bias.We also performed subgroup analysis for studies with low and unclear risk of bias R E S U L T S Description of studies See:Characteristics of included studies ;Characteristics of excluded studies .

Effects of interventions See: Summary of ndings for the main comparison Any Psychosocial intervention plus pharm versus pharm standard f or treatment of opioid dependence The results were summarized, with comparisons of quantitati ve data where possible, rst comparing the presence of any kind of psychosocial versus pharmacological and then separately for th e type of psychosocial treatment. Eight studies had more than two arms of comparison, in this case we matched the groups with the same psychosocial intervention and the control groups if there was no psychosocial treatment. This was possible for seven out of eight studies. In one study (Woody 1983 ) in the rst arm, participants were treated with a behavioural treatment, in the second arm with a psychoanalyti c oriented treatment and in the third with a standard methadon e maintenance treatment. This study was included for the rst ar m in the group of behavioural treatments and for the second arm in the group of psychoanalytic oriented treatment, participa nts of the third arm are considered twice; in any case these comparisons are kept separate preventing these participants from being co unted twice. For details on the studies seeCharacteristics of included studies tables For some outcomes reported in the included studies, it was impo s- sible to make comparisons and pool results due the criteria ado pted for reporting the results. Different rating instruments we re used and for many of them the authors did not indicate the range of scores that were considered to represent mild, moderate and se - vere. This prevented comparison of results between studies. In ad- dition, the results on urinalysis could not be summarised beca use these data were incongruous and the number of positive cases wa s unclear and possibly biased since the results are mainly based on number of positive tests rather than number of participants w ith positive tests. 13 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Furthermore, one study ( Chopra 2009 ) reported the results in terms of median weeks of continuous abstinence (interquartile range): medication contingency: 6 (2,10); voucher contingency: 6 (3-12), control: 4 (2-12) ; Planned pair wise comparison revealed that both the medication and voucher contingency groups were each signicantly better than standard treatment (P: 0.023 and P:0.040 respectively). Another study ( Epstein 2009 ) reported raw data about mean week of continuous abstinence only in a gure; i n the text is reported that for patients receiving 70 mg of metha done, contingency had no effect on the frequency of opiate negative urine; For patients receiving 100 mg of methadone contingency on both opiate and cocaine negatives urine appeared to increase the frequency of opiate negative urine during the second week o f intervention, but this effect quickly dissipated. 1.3 Number of participants still in treatment at the end of the follow-up Three studies, 250 participants ( Iguchi 1997 ;Khatami 1982 ; 14 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The remaining outcomes were analysed only in single studies considering a limited number of participants. Comparing the different psychosocial approaches, results are never statistically signicant for all the comparisons and outcomes a nd this is true also for contingency approaches, contrary to all exp ec- tations. In fact results on retention in treatment for the 14 s tud- ies, 1616 participants, that considered contingency managemen t approaches do not show any additional benet in adding this in - tervention: RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.96 to1.08). Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant out comes such as mortality. The previous versions of this review showed a reduction in opi ate use during treatment that was no longer the case with the addit ion of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abstinent at the end of follow up. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence It should be noted that the control intervention used in the st udies included in this review is a program that routinely offers coun - selling sessions in addition to pharmacological therapy; thu s the present review did not evaluate the question of whether any a n- cillary psychosocial intervention is needed when pharmacologi cal maintenance treatment is provided but the narrower question of whether a specic more structured intervention provides any a d- ditional benet to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outco mes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interperso nal, vo- cational and physical health areas of life functioning. It is also worth mentioning that, like other patients who hav e been treated with some kind of psychotherapy, opiate addicts have s ig- nicant psychiatric problems especially in the areas of depres sion and anxiety. T o the extent that drug use is an attempt to self-m ed- icate for these problems and to the degree that psychosocial int er- vention, especially psychotherapy, can reduce them, psychother - apy can, perhaps, reduce drug use indirectly in these people. Ne v- ertheless to evaluate these effects it is necessary to observe these patients for long periods and to develop methods for standar d as- sessments of specic outcomes. Regarding the applicability it is probably good but it is impo rtant to note that 26/28 studies were conducted in the USA and this is a limit to the generalisability of the results because health effectsof various substances of abuse seem to be strongly dependent o n social context, and the location of the conduct of the studies could act as an effect modier in the estimation of efcacy of treatment . Quality of the evidence Limitation in the study design: Methodological quality of included studies was quite good: ha lf of the studies had an adequate sequence generation and only tw o (5.8%) had it inadequate; 29/34 studies had an unclear allocati on concealment and three had inadequate allocation concealment. None of the studies were double blind due to the kind of inter- vention assessed (psychosocial) which cannot be blinded. 20.5% of studies declared that the outcome assessor was blind. 76% of studies were judged at unclear risk of detection bias. For risk of bias related to incomplete outcome data, 73.5% of studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Considering risk of bias at an outcome level, we judged that ob - jective outcomes (retention in treatment, use of substances) we re at low risk of bias because they were not likely to be influenced b y lack of blinding and because considering sequence generation an d allocation concealment, we didn't found signicant difference i n results between studies with low and unclear risk of bias. Mor eover, performing a sensitivity analysis including and excluding st udies at high risk of bias, the results didn't change. For subjective out- comes nevertheless 76% of studies were judged at unclear risk o f detection bias. Indirectness of the evidence: None of the included studies included indirect population, int er- ventions, controls or outcomes, so we judged that the level of t he body of evidence wasn't downgraded by this limitation. Inconsistency in the results: We didn't nd unexplained heterogeneity or relevant inconsi stency in the results. Imprecision of the results: Results for primary outcomes were not imprecise, whereas resu lts of secondary outcomes had wide condence intervals due to the low number of included studies and the small number of partici- pants The quality of evidence of any psychosocial plus any pharmaco- logical Intervention versus any pharmacological standard, as sessed according to GRADE method, be judged as high for dichoto- mous outcomes (retention, abstinence, results at follow up, com - pliance and moderate for dichotomous outcomes (compliance) see Summary of ndings for the main comparison Potential biases in the review process A particularly important component of a review is the identica - tion of relevant studies. Publication bias has long been recog nised as a problem in this regard since it means that the likelihood o f 16 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.nding studies is related to the results of those studies. On e way to investigate whether a review is subject to publication bias is to prepare a funnel plot and examine this for signs of asymmetry . Funnel plot (plot of the effect estimate from each study against the sample size or effect standard error) was used to assess th e po- tential for bias related to the size of the trials, demonstra ting low probability of publication bias seeFigure 4 Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Results of the parallel review on detoxication treatment ( Amato 2011 ) shows more benets of adding psychosocial interventions to the pharmacological one. This may be due to the most robust effects of methadone maintenance treatment itself, as compare d to detoxication treatment and possibly to the fact that addit ional counselling is usually offered as well along with methadone m ain- tenance and not with detoxication. Another possible explana tion is that participants in detoxication are less stable - it is us ually a personal crisis that brings them into detoxication - and they have more psychological issues that need to be dealt with. If psychos o- cial interventions delivered in association with detoxicati on helps them to deal with these issues, then it seems reasonable to ex pect that the provision of associated psychosocial interventions m ight improve the outcomes of detoxication. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychoso- cial support to maintenance treatments do not add additional b en- ets. Data do not show differences between different psychoso cial interventions also for contingency approaches, contrary to all ex- pectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse r ele- vant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the st udies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to me thadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of wh ether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methad onemaintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whethe r a specic more structured intervention provides any addition al benet to a standard psychosocial support. These interventio ns probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorou sly assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and p hysical health areas of life functioning. It was not possible to nd a specic psychosocial intervention with strong efcacy, in fact data do not show differences between different interventions also for contingency approaches, cont rary to all expectations. It is also worth mentioning that, like other patients who hav e been treated with some kind of psychotherapy, opiate addicts have s ig- nicant psychiatric problems especially in the areas of depres sion and anxiety. T o the extent that drug use is an attempt to self-m ed- icate for these problems and to the degree that psychosocial int er- vention, especially psychotherapy, can reduce them, psychother - apy can, perhaps, reduce drug use indirectly in these people. Ne v- ertheless to evaluate these effects it is necessary to observe these patients for long periods and to develop methods for standar d as- sessments of specic outcomes. Eventually, the results of the review on maintenance treatme nts clearly show that provision of methadone maintenance treatme nt should not be abandoned in the absence of resources for additio nal psychosocial treatment. Implications for research Eventually the review shows that psychosocial interventions can be evaluated in the context of randomised controlled trials, e ven though in order to study possible added value of any psychosoci al treatment over an already effective treatment such as mainten ance pharmacological interventions, only big multi site studies co uld be considered which dene experimental interventions and outcom es in the most standardized way possible.

Description of psychosocial interventions utilized i n the included studies Behavioural Interventions (20 studies) 1Acceptance andCommitment Therapy(Hayes 2004 arm a) A behavioural therapy with emphasis on acceptance, spirituali ty, mindfulness and behaviour changes. The attempt is to regu late thoughs, feelings or other private experiences. 2.Biofeedback (Khatami 1982 ) A behavioural treatment based on the assumption that enviro nmental stimuli can act as cues for drug-taking behaviour. These stimuli appear to cause anxiety in addicts who are trying to abstain fro m drugs and such anxiety may in turn motivate further drug use. The biofeedback procedure aims to relieve anxiety. Electromyogra phy (EMG) biofeedback consists of teaching participants to contro their EMG activity. 3.Cognitive-Behaviour alTherapy(Abrahms 1979 ;Scherbaum 2005 ;Woody 1983 arm b) Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy is an active, directive, time-l imited system of psychotherapy that focuses on uncovering and u nder- standing the relationship and influence of automatic thought s and underlying assumptions on problematic feelings and be haviours. The behavioural component consists of deep muscular relaxatio n training with imaginal and actual approach of conflict situatio ns; identication and practice of verbal and non verbal components o f assertiveness; identication of and engagement in pleasan t events; isolation and graduated rehearsal of small units of behavio ur leading to goal attainment. The Cognitive component of drug use; lowering of exp ectations and restructuring of goal setting strategies; development and co ntingent application of positive self-statements and evalua tions. 4.Contingency Management (Abbott ;Epstein 2006 2005 2007 ;Preston 2000 ; Silverman 2004 ;Stitzer 1992 ) Contingency Management is a behavioural treatment based on p ositive/negative reinforcers used to promote abstinence in i n participants in treatment. Many are the contingencies utilized in the includ ed studies both, single or combined. Participants can obtain pa yment, or win prizes or a (c) take-home pharmacological treatment (methadon e or bupreborphine) dose, for or for completi ng a treatment plan task; furthermore participants can receive ha lf of their pharmacological treatment for clinical attendance an d the other half for remaining abstinent. A variant of this approa ch is the Community Reinforcement Approach, a behavioural trea tment intervention based on a social learning theory model intende d to rearrange personal and community reinforces. Specic abst inence 90 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.reinforces in all major aspects of the patient's life are exami ned; positive reinforces are identied and as to drug use. 5.Information-M otivation-Behaviour alSkillsModel(Avants 2004 ) A model of behaviour change that focused on reducing both drug an d sex risks. All these interventions are behavioural approaches, which ar e in line with reinforcement principles. Psychoanalytic Interventions (4 studies) 1.Subliminal Stimulation (Thornton 1987 ) Is based on a psychoanalytic theory that states that unconsciou s wishes and fantasies have a direct impact on overt behaviour p articularly pathological behaviour. The experimental stimuli are desig ned to activate unconscious wishes and fantasies that have affe cted behaviour in ways that neutral stimuli have not. The stimuli MOMMY AND I ARE ONE was chosen to activate \"symbiotic-like fantasies\" of oneness with the \"good mother of infancy\". This fantasy allay s anxiety and mobilizes positive affect, very likely because t he unconscious fantasy, the idea of oneness with the mother leaves the perso n feeling comforted and protected. Furthermore this fantasy e nables participants to feel more 'connected' to the therapist and more able to respond to treatment. 2.Suppor tive-Expr essive Therapy(Woody 1983 arm a; Woody 1995 ) The supportive techniques aim to help the participant feel comf ortable in discussing his or her personal experiences. The exp ressive techniques aim to help the participant identify and work throu gh problematic relationship themes. Special attention is pa id to themes that are involved in drug dependence, the role of drugs in rela tion to problem feelings and behaviours and how problems may be solved without recourse to drugs. 3.Short-termInterpersonal Psychother apy(Rounsaville 1983 ) A treatment based on the concept that psychiatric disorders, in cluding opiate addiction, are intimately associated with dist urbances in interpersonal functioning, which may be associated with the ge nesis and perpetuation of the disorder. Counselling Interventions (4 studies) 1.Customized Employment Suppor ts(Magura 2007 ) An intervention in which counsellors work intensively with a s mall caseload of patients to overcome the vocational as well a no n- vocational barriers that hinder employment, with the goal of attaining rapid job placement. 2.Enhanced Methadone Services (Chawarski 2008 ;Chawarski 2011 McLellan 1993 ) This intervention consists of counselling plus on site medical , psychiatric, employment and family therapy services. The int ervention is composed also by educational, directive, and prescriptive com ponent (BDRC) and uses short-term behavioral contracts aimed at improving treatment adherence and getting patients to make i nitial lifestyle changes, including cessation/reduction of drug use and cessatio n/reduction of drug- risk behaviours 3.Enhanced Medical Management (Fiellin 2006 ) Extended sessions of manual guided, medical focused counselli ng 4.Free Mapping and Free plus guide Mapping: ( Czuchry 2009 ) Counsellors and clients cooperatively construct a node-link dis play over the course of counselling session in order to facilita te engagement of patients in treatment, positive feeling about self and tr eatment, therapeutic alliance . A marker board or large sheet of paper is used to provide a shared visualization.. The results display is r eviewed and modied in subsequent session. In free plus guide mapping the utilisation of a preformed \"l l in the node\" mapping could help patients and counsellors in ex amining treatment related issues Other Interventions (2 studies) 1. Relational Psychotherapy Mothers' Group (Luthar 2000 ) Is a developmental informed, supportive psychotherapy desi gned to serve heroin-addicted mothers with children less than 1 6 years of age, aims at addressing psychosocial vulnerabilities and faci litating optimal parenting, among at risk mothers. 2. Twelve-step facilitation (Hayes 2004 arm b) Is a structured, manualized psychosocial intervention design ed to both parallel and facilitate a 12-step prospective. The tr eatment emphasizes acceptance of the addiction problem, surrender of con trol and active participation in 12-step meetings and a program of recovery. In 25 out of 28 of the included studies, the standard control tre atment consisted of the provision of agonist maintenance trea tment associated with the availability of standard counselling ses sions. The counselling sessions consisted of: clear statement s of the program's rules, comprehensive treatment plans, information on HIV an d, when needed, other relevant specic issues. This counselli ng is standard 91 Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatment s versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatmen t of opioid dependence (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Cochrane Collaboration.
