Thai massage blends gentle rocking, rhythmic acupressure and deep assisted stretches to open, exe rcise and tone all systems of the body. The work is deeply therapeutic, fluid and meditative. Thai Massage relaxes, refreshes, and revitalizes both giver and receiver. Its ancient origins are linked to Yoga, Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine, as well as the l ocal indigenous healing practices of ancient Siam. Thai massage is a combination of gentle rocking, range of motion, acupressure, reflexology, energy work, specialized yoga and stretching. Joints are loosened and opened through manipulation and peripheral stimulation, muscles are stretched, internal organs are toned, vitality is increased and a deep state of relaxation can be achieved. The work is very rhythmical and meditative, enabling both the client and practitioner to voyage together into deeper realm s of consciousness. The massage work is done on a floor mat with receiver wearing loose, comfortable clothing. This gives the practitioner leverage and the ability to use their body very effectively, which is not possible on a massage table. Thai is base d on a system of energy lines called \"Sen\", which follows energy as it flows through the form of the body. There are said to be 72,000 \"Sen\" which cover the entire body. The \"Sen\" are closely associated with the Nadis of Ayurvedic medicine and the Meridian s of Chinese Acupuncture, all of which can produce internal effects from stimulation of external points on the body. Because of the deep sense of fluidity, vitality, and healing imparted to both the practitioner and client, Thai Massage is becoming increa singly popular. It is often incorporated with other forms of bodywork at premier health resorts, exclusive spas, health professionals' offices, and by successful massage therapists. Certificate of Completion: Thai Massage. Upon completion of the 100 hour Thai Massage training , you will be awarded a certificate of completion in Thai Massage.

It has been passed down from master to student, from one generation to the next. Native Hawaiians believed that all nature is replete with the same energy or spirit which they called aloha 'aina . This system of massage was kept secret from the West until the 1970's. The massage can be physical therapy or a vehicle for the release of emotions, traumas, tension, stress and blocked energy. It is used to revive the body, to move blood and lymph, release muscle spasms, and facilitate waste produ ct removal from muscle and connective tissue. The concepts of unconditional love, grace, beauty and spirituality are inherent in Lomi. Strokes of an elongating nature are used to expand the body. The most distinctive movement of Lomi is a kneading motion done toward the heart, using either thumb, palms or forearms. However, a full range of massage strokes \u2014 effleurage, petrissage, friction, vibration, percussion and kneading \u2014 are also used. Special attention is paid to the na 'au, the lower abdomen, which a ncient Hawaiian philosophy considers the center of all emotion and power. The practitioner will predominantly use the soft part of the forearm coupled with a dancing motion to create the long, gliding strokes intrinsic to Lomi. Finger tips, hands, knuckle s and elbow may also be used. Certificate of Completion: Lomi -Lomi Practitioner. Upon completio n of the 68 hour Lomi -Lomi massage training , you will be awarded a certificate of completion acknowledging you as a Lomi -Lomi Practitioner .

These classes qualify you to become a Naturopathic Practitioner (N.P.). Naturopathy can be practiced alone or in conjunction with the Holistic Health Practitioner license or other therapeu tic practices. Those in the fields of medicine, nursing, chiropractic, physical therapy, dentistry, massage, acupuncture, counseling and other healing arts use clinical Naturopathy in their existing practices. Naturopaths use natural therapies ( naturo ) to treat pathology or diseases and dysfunctions ( pathy = pathology abreviated). Naturopathy helps the body, emotions and spirit to heal itself by re -establishing balance where there is imbalance. Naturopathic origins are usually attributed to Hippocrate s who, 2000 years ago, taught that the key to good health was to live as naturally and as moderately as possible. He approached healing with \"let -the-body -heal -itself\" principles. Others believe that its origin is as old as the human race: that it came i nto being with the first human who covered an injured leg with a leaf that soothed it; or chewed a root to dull pain; or eased an aching foot in water; or observed and then practi ced the innate wisdom of injured animals; or spontaneously prayed, meditated, or practiced positive visualization. Whether it is nutrition, herbs, massage, hydrotherapy, counseling, aromatherapy, energetic healing, prayer or meditation, or any other natural healing modality, naturopathy's essential work is to establish the cause o f a breakdown and then alleviate rather than suppress the symptoms while at the same time empowering the client to be in charge of his or her health. This becomes true self -determination, holistically. This program teaches you how to integrate different n atural healing (naturopathic) therapies into appropriate health programs. The emphasis will be learning dynamic health counseling skills and how to individualize naturopathic and holistic health therapy techniques appropriate for the client's unique nee ds. Training includes your self -directed selections from clinical master nutrition, clinical master herbology, relaxation and rejuvenation, clinical master aromatherapy, water sound color & light therapies, health analysis and assessments, health sciences , and other traditional and cutting edge natural therapies. Also, includes a wide and comprehensive list of optional and elective classes to choose from (see below under Electives - including massage therapies and therapeutic bodywork,) plus classes in focused activity with intention \u2014such as emotional, psychological, soul and spirit or spiritual counseling, prayer, meditation, and visualization to empower body -mind healing. Emphasis is both for therapy and prevention as well as generating optimal health, v itality, and wellness. This course trains you in complementary medicine, alternative medicine, traditional naturopathy, modern progressive naturopathic medicine, and other natural healing approaches both for self -help or self -healing with personal growth a nd to develop a successful, professional career and practice. Deep, long term therapy and healing occurs when concerns are integrated and holistically addressed \u2014physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually.

Catalog updated annually for the period Jan 1 - Dec 31 (5,CCR\u00a771810(b)(1)) Page 48 FAQ'S What is the difference between \"accredited\" and legitimate, \"state -licensed\" and \"state -approved\" ? The most important consideration is for a college to receive a state -licensed and state -approve d designation. All programs are then reviewed and approved by the state. As a state licensed and state approved vocational college, NHI must adhere to the state's quality control. The states support only state -approved colleges. For license and certificati on, states have recognized training only from state -approved, state -licensed vocational college. It is easy for schools or colleges to buy or receive \"accreditation\" from a private accrediting group, but that accreditation bears absolutely no legal or sign ificant meaning. When students graduate from a legitimate, state -approved, state - licensed school, a student will be grand mothered or grandfathered in when programs later become licensed! States and cities only grant licensing and give reciprocity only if you attended a state -approved, state -licensed school anywhere in the country, or if your school has been accredited by a Federal, not private, accrediting agency empowered by the U.S. Government. Important Note !!! Senate Bill SB577, which was signed into law January 2003, does liberalize the scope of \"complementary and alternative medicine\" in California \u2014 such as Nutritionist, Herbalist, and Holistic Health Practitioner. A copy of the law is available upon request. Similar laws are currently being enacted in other states officially and/or in common practice. What is the difference between a Nutritionist and Dietitian? Trained dietitians primarily focus on meal planning and are hired by hospitals and occasionally other institutions. Nutrition is a \"whole body\" approach, in which, meal planning is only a small part. Nutritionists are trained to individualize a nutritional and supplement program for therapies according to the individual's unique constitution and health concerns. Individuals preferring progre ssive help usually seek the advice of Nutritionists rather than dietitians. The majority of Nutritionists work for themselves doing nutritional consulting. Some start out by working with M.D.'s, chiropractors, H.H.P.'s, acupuncturists, naturopaths, osteopa ths and other health therapists. What are the licensing requirements for H.H.P.'s? You should check with your state/city for required total hours and specific course requirements. Even if you are not licensed, you can use C.N.C., C.C.M.H. and H.H.P. af ter your name to market and demonstrate your abilities and education. H.H.P.'s are licensed in fewer than 18 states. However, there are H.H.P.'s, as well as C.N.C.'s and C.C.M.H.'s, practicing openly and successfully in every state. Even if one practices where not currently licensed, our programs teach you how to practice and speak in an entirely legal manner. No matter where you practice, you can advertise yourself as having graduated from a state -licensed and state approved school and licensed to practi ce in southern California. How do I obtain malpractice insurance? Malpractice insurance can be obtained through several national organizations. Contact us for their catalogs and applications. There are also other national organizations offering malpracti ce insurance. What kind of job can I get after graduation? You can start out working with an M.D., chiropractor, acupuncturist, wellness center or other health therapists doing health consultations. Also, you can work in a health food store and develop y our own clientele doing consultations on the side. Or, you can work for a supplement or herb company as a sales representative, thereby meeting health food store employees who will then refer to you when their customers need trained or in -depth advice. The majority of graduates initially or eventually work for themselves. When can I start a program? You can start any of our residential programs at any time.

Natural Healing Institute of Naturopathy, Inc., \u00a9 2016 Catalog revised annually late December Catalog period Jan 1 -Dec 31 each year page 24 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ'S) What is the difference between \"accredited\" and legitimate, \"state -licensed\" ? The most important consideration is for a college to receive state approval and state license. All programs are then reviewed and approved by the state. As a state -approved vocational college, NHI must adhere to the state's quality control. The states su pport only state - approved colleges. For license and certification, states have recognized training only from state -approved, state - licensed vocational college . It is easy for schools or colleges to buy or receive \"accreditation\" from a private accrediting group with an impressive name , but that accreditation bears absolutely no legal or significant meaning. When students graduate from a legitimate, state -approved, state -licensed school, a student will be grandmothered or grandfathered in when programs later become licensed! States and cities only grant licensing and give reciprocity only if you attended a state -approved, state -licensed school anywhere in the country. What is the difference between a Nutritionist and Dietitian? Trained dietitians primarily focus on meal planning and are hired by hospitals and occasionally other institutions. Nutrition is a \"whole body\" approach, in which, meal planning is only a small part. Nutritionists are trained to individualize a nutritional and supplement program for therapies according to the individual's unique constitution and health concerns. Individuals preferring progressive help usually seek the advice of Nutritionists rather than dietitians. The majority of Nutritionists work for themselves doing nutritional con sulting. Some start out by working with M.D.'s, chiropractors, H.H.P.'s, acupuncturists, naturopaths, osteopaths and other health therapists. What are the licensing requirements for H.H.P.'s? You should check with your state/city for required total hours and specific course requirements. Even if you a re not licensed, you can use N.C ., C.N., C.N.C.,C.M.H., C.C.M.H. and H.H.P. after your name to market and demonstrate your abilities and education. H.H.P.'s are licensed in fewer than 18 states. However, there are H.H.P.'s, as well as C .N.C.'s and C. C.M.H. 's, practicing openly and successfully in every state. Even if one practices where not currently licensed, our programs teach you how to practice and speak in an entirely legal manner. No matter where you practice, you can advertise yourself as having graduated from a state -licensed school and licensed to practice in southern California.

Are there any additional special functions at NHI? Yes, several. Every August, NHI sponsors a special weekend retreat focusing on fasting and detoxification. (Steve Schechter is the author of a best -selling book for 12 \u00bd years on natural therapies well docum ented by scientific research to boost immunity and detoxify.) This is at our auxiliary retreat center we purchased in Encinitas. See below. Tell me more about the NHI retreat center? This property has been officially declared by the city as a \"Specific Protected Bio -Zone.\" Steve has already lushly and verdantly landscaped it. He is planting an additional more than 200 different medicinal plants, about 20 different kinds of medicinal trees, plus fruit and nut trees, olives, grapes, and vegetables. By the end of 2006, he hopes to have this land nationally certified as a true \"Botanical Sanctuary\" and convert it into a land trust/land stewardship. \"One of my primary intentions when I fo unded NHI is to empower people to simultaneously heal and optimize themselves, each other, and our living planet. \"Faced with challenging, yet en -lightening, times, I feel we need to help one another understand, re -experience, and act from a recognition t hat we are, body and spirit, one and interdependent - with the living earth and with all of creation. There is greater freedom and Self -fulfillment or Self -realization in interdependence. \"Perhaps the future does not lie in more and more complex methods o f information transmission and alienating, isolating corporate control and exploitation of our planet; but, in the simple understanding that this living planet is our home and that we live here thanks to a miraculous and complex web of interconnected life. Perhaps a lofty goal is to heal our planet and to heal ourselves simultaneously; and in so doing, to achieve our full potential self, to go beyond ourselves, to connect with others and our inner and outer nature, and to joyfully and meaningfully realize o ur full potential Self.
