Where did Reconnective Healing\u00ae Originate? Dr. Eric Pearl is the founder of Reconnective Healing and The Reconnection. Dr. Eric Pearl ran a highly successful chiropractic practice for 12 years in Los Angeles before discovering Reconnective Healing. One day, his patients began to report healings when he simply held his hands near them, without touching them. He went in search of the universal wisdom behind what was happening. Through Dr. Pearl's journey of research and discovery, it became clear that the appropriate name for this work is \"Reconnective Healing.\" As he continued working with these energies patients soon reported all kinds of healing and his patient's healings have been documented in his numerous books including Dr. Eric Pearl's international bestseller: The Reconnection, Heal Others, Heal Yourself. Dr. Eric Pearl has been featured in top media including The Dr. Oz Show, The New York Times and CNN. His internationally bestselling book, The Reconnection: Heal Others, Heal Yourself, now in over 39 languages, and has been endorsed by such notables as Deepak Chopra. Now recognized and supported by science, Reconnective Healing facilitates healings for people that are often instantaneous and can last a lifetime. Feeling compelled to teach others, Eric's work has taken him to over 100 countries and has affected millions of people.
