CDPH Division of Communicable Disease Control 100Expanded Eligibility for JYNNEOS MPX Vaccine If someone was exposed to MPX <14 days ago, vaccinate them with 2 -doses of JYNNEOS with 28 days between 1st and 2nd dose (PEP and PEP++) If someone is in a high -risk group (next slide), vaccinate them with 2 -doses of JYNNEOS with 28 days between 1st and 2nd dose ( PrEP ). 101 CDPH Considerations for Expanded ProphylaxisHigh-Risk Groups Eligible for JYNNEOS MPX PrEP Vaccination Any man or trans person who has sex with men or trans persons Any man or trans person who is taking or is eligible for HIV PrEP Anyone living with HIV , particularly those with a CD4 count <350/mm3, an unsuppressed HIV viral load, or an opportunistic infection People and their partners with high -risk sexual activity (recent history of sexually transmitted infections, sex at commercial sex venues, sex at events in geographic areas with high MPX transmission) HCWs who are likely to collect laboratory specimens from persons with MPX (e.g., persons working in sexual health clinics or clinical settings that serve at risk populations). 102 CDPH Considerations for Expanded MPX Post -and Pre -Exposure ProphylaxisSummary Eligibility has expanded to include new groups and individuals Providers are well -positioned to identify their patients who would be eligible for vaccination Please encourage these patients to get vaccinated and ensure those who already received one dose return for their second 103MMWR Incidence of Monkeypox Among Unvaccinated Persons Compared with Persons Receiving 1 JYNNEOS Vaccine Dose 104 Incidence of Monkeypox Among Unvaccinated Persons Compared with Persons Receiving 1 JYNNEOS Vaccine Dose \u2014 32 U.S. Jurisdictions, July 31 -September 3, 2022 | MMWR (cdc.gov)Data from 32 U.S. jurisdictions (including California) among males 18 - 49 years of age eligible for JYNNEOS vaccination Vaccinated: One -dose of JYNNEOS vaccine at least 14 days prior to infection Unvaccinated: No documented JYNNEOS vaccination before or after illness onset including unknown vaccination status MPX incidence 14 x as high among unvaccinated males compared to those who received at least one JYNNEOS dose Intradermal Administration of JYNNEOS Vaccine Recommended route of vaccination is intradermal for adults aged 18 years -old or greater without a history of keloid Preferred location is volar surface of forearm If alternative sites desired can administer over deltoid or upper back below scapula in cases of patient preference (reduce stigma, marking, etc...) 105 CDPH Considerations for Expanded MPX Post -and Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis 106In general, JYNNEOS may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. oAdminister each injection in a different injection site. Flu vaccine and JYNNEOS vaccine may be given at the same time. Special considerations for COVID -19 vaccines: oSomeone with recent COVID -19 vaccination: do JYNNEOS if eligible oSomeone with recent JYNNEOS vaccination: some people, particularly adolescent oryoung adult males, might consider delaying COVID -19 vaccination for 4 weeks after JYNNEOS vaccination.JYNNEOS Coadministration Considerations CDC Interim Guidance for Jynneos Vaccine107Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications to immunization with JYNNEOS for persons exposed to MPX. Available human data on JYNNEOS administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine associated risks in pregnancy. However, animal models, including rats and rabbits, have shown no evidence of harm to a developing fetus. MPX infection during pregnancy is associated with complications, including severe congenital infection, pregnancy loss, and maternal morbidity and mortality. Healthcare providers should discuss the risk and benefits with the patient using shared decision making.JYNNEOS Pregnancy and Lactation CDPH Vaccine Page: Vaccine Resources Vaccine Q&A for Providers Vaccine Q&A for Public Vaccines Page : oResource Links oAllocation Process Local Health Departments MPX with Resources109 EZIZ MPX Vaccine Resources Includes : Intradermal Clinical guidance Vaccine information Storage and handling Standing orders Coding information Screening checklist EZIZ MPX Resources110111Resources and Support Type of Support Description Access health care provider MPX clinical guidanceClinical Guidance MPX EZIZ (https://eziz.org/resources/monkeypox/ ) Includes : Intradermal instructions, Clinical guidance, Vaccine information, Storage and handling.
