Read on for everything you need to know about mangoes.", "sitename": "EverydayHealth.com", "date": "2023-02-22", "cleaned_text": "Mangoes are a tropical tree fruit that have been enjoyed for their sweet, bright flavor for centuries. More recently, research has uncovered the fruit's added benefits in the form of key nutrients that help people fight disease, maintain a healthy weight, and even ward off some signs of aging. While at one time considered exotic, mango fruit is now available in most supermarkets and is a common ingredient in many dishes, owing to its popular flavor and versatility \u2014 it's delicious sliced, chopped, pureed, juiced, and even roasted. Here is everything you need to know about mangoes, including their nutrition content and health benefits, plus more ways to enjoy eating them. How To Cut It: Mango What Are the Potential Health Benefits of Mangoes? Research on mangoes has revealed that they may offer a number of nutritional perks, including: - Bolstered Immunity \"Mangoes are high in immune-boosting vitamin C,\" says [Nicole Stefanow, RDN](https://www.instagram.com/nicole.stefanow.nutrition/?hl=en), a culinary registered dietitian in the New York City area. A 1 cup serving provides two-thirds of the vitamin C you need in a day. Vitamin C plays an important role in the body's healing process, and helps your body form blood vessels, cartilage, muscle, and collagen in bones. - Protection From Free Radical Damage Free radicals are compounds that are associated with many chronic diseases and aging in general. High levels of antioxidants, including beta-carotene and vitamin C, in mangoes help safeguard cells from free radical damage. They're also a source of phytochemicals, which are plant-based compounds known for their health-promoting properties. Specific phytochemicals in mangoes, including phenolic acids, mangiferin, and gallotannins, have been linked to anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer effects. - Improved Digestive Health One cup of mango contains about 3 g of fiber, which is roughly 10 percent of what you need in a day. Dietary fiber has long been recognized as crucial to [digestive health](/digestive-health-pictures/superfoods-that-help-digestion.aspx). Additionally, mangoes specifically were found to significantly improve [constipation](/constipation/guide/), including stool frequency and consistency, according to a study, which found that mango was more effective than a supplement that provided the same amount of fiber (300 grams). One possible reason, according to the study authors: Consuming mangoes may increase the healthy fatty acids and gastric secretions that aid digestion. - Cancer Prevention Research has found that carotenoid-containing fruits and vegetables, which include mangoes, may help reduce the risk of colon cancer, according to a 2013 study. And research from 2015 involving mice indicated that micronutrients in mangoes may help shrink breast cancer cells. The study found that dietary mango decreased tumor size and suppressed cancer growth factors. (Of course, more research is needed in humans.) - Better Sleep Mango contains [vitamin B6](/drugs/vitamin-b6), \"which is responsible for producing [serotonin](/serotonin/guide/), a chemical that helps with sleep and regulates our mood,\" says [Laura M. Ali, RDN](https://www.lauramali.com/), a culinary registered dietitian based in Pittsburgh. Three-quarters of a cup of mango typically provides 8 percent of your daily B6 needs. - Sharper Vision Mangoes contain the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin as well as vitamin A, all of which help protect our eyes and reduce the risk of macular degeneration, Ali says. While additional research is needed to determine the exact link between zeaxanthin and [age-related macular degeneration](/macular-degeneration/guide/), this specific antioxidant \"may increase the concentration of macular pigment, thus building healthier eyes,\" according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation. - Help With Inflammatory Diseases Many nutrients in mangoes, including antioxidants and vitamin C, have anti-inflammatory effects, says Ali. She notes that people with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions may benefit from mango consumption. - Smoother Skin [Post-menopausal women](/menopause/post-menopause.aspx)who ate a half cup of Ataulfo mangoes (sometimes called \"champagne mangoes\") four times a week saw a 23 percent decline in deep wrinkles after two months, according to a study published in 2020. (The study was supported by the Mango Board and conducted by researchers at the University of California in Davis.) Study participants saw a 20 percent decrease after four months. More research is needed in this area. - Improved Cardiovascular and Gut Health Eating two cups of mangoes a day benefited systolic blood pressure among healthy post-menopausal women, according to research from 2018. This is likely because of the polyphenols (such as mangiferin, quercetin, gallotannins, and gallic acid) that the fruit contains, the study authors theorized. Clearly, mangoes can be part of a balanced diet and help you maintain good health. But they're not a cure-all and won't magically fix or prevent disease, and they can't make up for an otherwise unhealthy diet. Can Mangoes Help You Lose Weight? Possibly. Fruit, including mangoes, contains a lot of water and [soluble fiber](/ibs/soluble-vs-insoluble-fiber-for-ibs.aspx), Ali says. \"Both help fill you up so you aren't hungry, which is great for helping with weight control,\" she says. If you're full because you've eaten low-calorie, nutritious fruit, you're less likely to binge on, say, high-calorie processed snacks. It's also important to consider portion size. A serving is roughly half of a mango, so if you stick to that amount, you will be able to better keep sugar and calories in check. Common Questions & Answers How to Select and Store Mangoes Mangoes can be found at the grocery store year-round. Choose mangoes that have a nice balance between firmness and softness, Allen says. Ripe mangoes look more yellow and reddish; if you buy ripe ones, put them in the refrigerator. If you choose unripe ones, leave them at room temperature. To extend the shelf life of ripe mangoes, consider freezing them, she suggests. Dice some up and put them in a ziplock bag, and you'll have a supply at the ready when you're making smoothies. Slicing the fruit can be difficult, Stefanow says. That's because of the wide, flat pit in the middle. \"You'll want to use the pit as a guide to slide your knife across the fruit,\" she suggests. There are online tutorials that show how to slice mangoes properly. How to Eat Mangoes You can enjoy mango by itself as a sweet snack, but its tropical flavor pairs well with a lot of other foods, too. Slice it and add it to smoothies, salsas, yogurt, or desserts. Mango can also be good for savory dishes, and you can grill it to caramelize its natural sugars. Stefanow suggests a tropical fruit salad: Mix diced mangoes, [pineapples](/diet-nutrition/8-reasons-eat-pineapple/), and kiwis with lemon and lime juice, and top with grated ginger. You can also toss the fruit into your favorite salad or pair it with peppers in a traditional mango chicken dish. Saut\u00e9 diced chicken with bell peppers, soy sauce, ginger, and [garlic](/drugs/garlic), and stir in diced mango, Stefanow recommends. Like many other fruits, mango also makes a tasty (and nutritious) dessert. Try preparing mango sorbet or pudding, for example.

Side Effects and Health Risks of Mangoes Some people worry about mangoes' sugar content: 1 mango contains 46 grams. But \"natural sugar from fruits like a mango isn't a big concern,\" Allen says, especially given that its fiber reduces the impact on blood sugar. \"While vegetables are lower in calories and sugar, fruits offer a tasty, sweet option, while still being healthy.\" [B6](/diet-nutrition/benefits-of-vitamin-b6.aspx), C, and E, making it quite nutritious for both humans and dogs. The snack is also sweet, so your dog will probably love it.\" The group recommends cutting mangoes into small pieces before serving to your dog, which will help eliminate any choking risk. Growing Your Own Mango Trees You'll have the best luck growing your own mango tree if you live in an area where the temperature doesn't drop below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Those who live in tropical to subtropical climates should plant their new mango trees in late winter to early spring, in a spot that's protected from the cold. It should begin fruit production in three years. A Summary on Mangoes Mangoes are a nutritious tropical fruit that are low in calories, a good source of vitamin A and fiber, and an excellent source of vitamin C. Blend your mango into a smoothie, or enjoy it raw, grilled, or as a sauce or dressing. The fruit is versatile and can be used in many recipes. Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking - Mango Facts.
