ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: Allele -specific efficacy of two malaria subunit vaccines following immunization with the polymorphic antigen apical membrane antigen -1 (AMA1) . Amed Ouattara , Doctor of Philosophy, 2012 Dissertation Directed by : Christopher V. Plowe MD MPH Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Professor and Leader, Malaria Group Center for Vaccine Dev elopment University of Maryland School of Medicine 685 West Baltimore Street, HSF1 -480 Baltimore MD 21201 USA Background: Antigenic diversity of malaria parasites poses a major obstacle to the development of an effective malaria vaccine. Population genetic s analyses suggest that polymorphic regions of the vaccine antigen apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) are targets for protective immune responses. Objectives: The study exploited a unique opportunity to assess strain -specific efficacy in clinical trials of t wo AMA1 -based vaccines, with the ultimate goal of developing an AMA1 malaria vaccine that protects against genetically diverse parasites. Methods: We used data and samples collected during two randomized, double -blind, controlled phase 2 trials (Bancouman a AMA1 -C1 and Bandiagara FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine trials) of malaria vaccine safety and efficacy to assess allele -specific in AMA1 vaccinees compared to control groups. In each study, we sequenced the Plasmodium falciparum ama1 gene from samples collected at b aseline, during clinical episodes, at scheduled intervals during post -vaccination follow -up period, and whenever blood smears were collec ted for malaria diagnosis. Using a homology definition based on clusters c1, c1L, c2, c3 and domains 1, 2 and 3, we ass essed the time to first malaria episode with an AMA1 sequence identical to that of the vaccine strains 3D7 or FVO type. In addition, we measured the hazard of having a clinical episode with the vaccine strain in the two treatment groups. Finally, genetic d iversity parameters were assessed and compared between treatment arms. Results : The bivalent malaria vaccine showed no overall effi cacy. AMA1 vaccine group and controls groups were found to have genetic parameters comparable at baseline and during the foll ow-up period. No difference was found between the 2 treatment arms regarding the time to first clinical episode with a 3D7 or FVO AMA1 c1L haplotype. In Bandiagara, the monovalent vaccine has a 20% overall efficacy against malaria first clinical episodes. The time to first clinical episode with a 3D7 c1L allele was longer in the AMA1 vaccine group compared to the rabies vaccine, Likelihood Ratio p -value respectively equal to 0.025 (ITT) and 0.018 (PP). The vaccine efficacy against c1L allele was 64% (ITT) a nd 72% (PP). Conclusion : It may be possible to design a polyvalent or chimeric AMA1 vaccine that provides broader cross -protection.

CHAPTER 1 A. Introduction and objectives 1. Introduction Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1 ) is an erythrocyte surface protein expressed during Plasmodium falciparum's asexual sta ge. The 83 kDa polypeptide is thought to play a role in invasion of host red blood cells. Animal studies [1] have demonstrated the ability of vaccines based on this antigen to stimulate antibody responses that have been correlated with protection, thus preventing malaria disease. In addition, in Phase 1 studie s conducted in Malian adults and children, post -vaccination titers of AMA1 antibodies were found to be higher in vaccinees compared to controls [2,3] However, the high degree of polymorphism observed in this pro tein may limit its success as a vaccine antigen. Diversity -covering approaches that incorporate polymorphisms from various parasite strains into chimeric antigens have been proposed to address the issue of antigen diversity [4] However, the design of such artificial antigens is complex and may even lead to an ineffective vaccine due to a misfolding of vaccine proteins [5]. This study e xploits a unique opportunity to assess strain -specific efficacy in clinical trials of two AMA1 -based vaccines. Even if vaccine -induced selection cannot be demonstrated directly by comparing frequencies of vaccine -type and non -vaccine type AMA1 in vaccinees and controls, evaluating population genetic parameters may provide indirect evidence for allele - specific immunity elicited by the vaccine. The overall objective of this dissertation was to assess whether vaccination with an AMA1 -based malaria vaccine, eit her monovalent or bivalent, select s for alleles different from the vaccine allele/s among vaccinees . 2 Results of this study may aid efforts to develop next generation AMA1 -based vaccines that are more broadly efficacious by identifying important polymorphi c amino acid residues or clusters of residues that are most relevant to cross -protection. B. Research Questions, Hypotheses, and Specific Aims Overall research question Does vaccination with an AMA1 -based malaria vaccine, either monovalent or bivalent, select for alleles different from the vaccine allele/s among vaccinees? Overall hypothesis Based on studies showing allele -specific protection from rodent malaria parasites and field surveys, we expect that children vaccinated with AMA1 vaccines will experie nce fewer infections with parasite strains carrying AMA1 alleles similar to those in the vaccine formulations compared to children who receive d a control vaccine, demonstrating allele -specific efficacy and selection of alleles genetically different from st rains used in the vaccine. Specific aim # 1: To measure selection induced by a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine (3D7 and FVO -based) in Bancoumana, Mali (Figure 1 .1) by assessing a) changes in genetic diversity of malaria parasite AMA1 sequences among vaccinee s and controls before vaccination (baseline) and at predefined periods after vaccination with a bivalent AMA1 vaccine and b) the incidence of bivalent vaccine -type AMA1 alleles in vaccinated individuals compared to controls. Hypothesis : Genetic diversity p arameters of malaria parasites will decrease after vaccination with a bivalent AMA1 vaccine compared to controls due to a total reduction in the number of circulating malaria strains among those vaccinated (if there is cross -allelic protection). In additio n, we hypothesized that AMA1 v accinees will have a decreased incidence of malaria 3 infections with parasites having AMA1 alleles similar to the bivalent vaccine alleles compared to the control group . Specific aim #2: To evaluate selection induced by a mono valent AMA1 malaria vaccine (3D7 - based) in Bandiagara, Mali by assessing a) changes in genetic diversity of malaria parasites AMA1 sequences among vaccinees and controls before vaccination (baseline) and at predefined periods after vaccination with a bival ent AMA1 vaccine and b) the incidence of bivalent vaccine - type AMA1 alleles in vaccinated individuals compared to controls. Hypothesis : Genetic diversity parameters of malaria parasites will decrease after vaccination with a mono valent AMA1 vaccine compare d to controls due to a total reduction in the number of circulating malaria strains among those vaccinated (if there is cross -allelic protection). In addition, we hypothesized that AMA1 v accinees will have a decreased incidence of malaria infections with p arasites having AMA1 alleles similar to the mono valent vaccine alleles compared to the control group . 4 Specific Aims 1A and 1B Specifi c aim 2 A Specific aim 2 B Long term goal Figure 1 .1.

Overview Malaria is one of the most important tropical infectious diseases in the world. Approximately 225 million clinical cases are observed each year , leading to 781,000 deaths [6] Most of these deaths are due to one parasite species: Plasmodium falciparum. In Mali, malaria is the leading cause of mortality (13%) and morbidity (15.6%) in the general popul ation [7]. Malaria transmission in Mali is highly seasonal, peaking during the rainy season (June to November). Many strategies have been proposed to reduce the burden of this disease [8]. Vaccination in combination with other control measures such as vector control, chemoprophylaxis , and early detection and treatment will provide the population the greatest benefit [8]. Thus, different antigens and strategies are currently being tested to develop a protective malaria vaccine. Previous data on malaria vaccine -induced selection are limited. The combination B malaria vaccine, which contained merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP1, MSP2) and ring erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) was shown in a Phase 2b trial in Papua New Gui nea to reduce parasite density and the prevalence of infection by parasites similar to the vaccine strain in vaccinees compared to controls [9]. RTS,S /AS01 , a circumsporozoite protein (CSP) -based vaccine directe d against the pre -erythrocytic stage of the parasite , is the vaccine candidate that, to date, has progressed the furthest in clinical testing [10]. A vaccine trial conducted in Mozambique revealed that the vaccine conferred an efficacy of 30% in first clinical episodes while the efficacy against s evere malaria was 58% [11] but no selection for parasites with non - vaccine strain CSP was detected [12]. Failures of some vaccines against other pathogens that are 6 based on polymorphic antigens have been attributed to the inclusion of diverse forms of the same antigen in the vaccine formulation [13]. Therefore, an understanding of isolate -specific efficacy is an important step in the development of a multivalent vaccine that covers most of the strains found in endemic countries. 2. Malaria life cycle and vacci ne target Malaria is transmitted to humans by female anopheles mosquitoes. After inoculation, sporozoites infect the liver and mature into schizonts. The schizonts rupture , releasing merozoites into the bloodstream, where they invade erythrocytes. Merozoites undergo asexual replication within erythroc ytes to form additional merozoites, some of which invade new erythrocytes and others differentiate into sexual forms (gametocytes) that will be taken up by mosquitoes during a blood meal. Fertilization takes place in mosquitoes where gametes develop into ookinete s and oocysts , including a genetic recombination step that occurs during a brief diploid stage, eventually releasing thousands of sporozoites that are injected during blood feeding (Figure 2.1). Vaccines are being developed that target each stage of the parasite's life cycle ( Figure 2.1). 7 Figure 2 .1: Malaria parasite life cycle ( GlaxoSmithKline . 2006) 3. Malaria pathology and pathogenesis Malaria is caused by a single cell eukaryotic parasite of the genus Plasmodium . Symptoms are mostly associated with parasite development and replication in red blood cells. 8 Factors that affect the severity of malaria infection include host immune status, the general health and nutritional condition of the infected individual as well as Plasmo dium species [14]. Mild malaria is generally observed in adolescen ts and adults in high transmission areas , whereas severe malaria is seen in children less than 5 years old and malaria -na\u00efve patients travelling in malaria transmission zones. The pre -erythrocyte stage which starts after the inoculation of sporozoites int o hepatocytes is clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms occur when thousands of merozoites released from the liver invade erythrocytes. Following the invasion of red blood cells, the parasite will mature into a schizont which rupture s, initiating a new blood cy cle. The burst ing of infected red blood cells will release hemozoin and stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF -, IFN- and IL -1 that in turn lead to the fever observed during malaria [15]. In the early stage of clinical manifestation, the fever attacks are periodic ( 48 hours for P. vivax, P. ovale , and P. falciparum , and a 72 -hour cycle for P. malariae ), corresponding to the release of a new generation of merozoites in the blo odstream. Additional symptoms observed during this stage include headache, muscle pain, anorexia , nausea and lassitude. The severity of these symptoms has been correlated with parasite load [16]. The mechanical rupture of red blood cells and the consumption and degradation of hemoglobin are the main cause of hemolytic anemia. Cytoadherence plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria . Parasite sequestration follows the adhesion of P. falciparum erythrocyte me mbrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) [16] to host cell surface receptors such as intercellular 1 selectin, and C D36 [17]. The sequestration of infected red blood cells in the brain may result in 9 cerebral malaria with convulsion followed by prostration, coma and death. When the sequestration occurred in the placenta during pregnancy, it may result into low birth weight and even abortion of the fetus . In endemic regions, patients may show signs o f splenomegaly and hepatomegaly after experiencing multiple infections. The hyperactivity of the monocytes /macrophage system to eliminate degenerate d red blood cells and malaria pigment is responsib le for the enlarged spleen and liver observed in children. Severe and lethal malaria are primarily seen in infection s due to P. falciparum . Other species are rarely fatal. The ability of P. falciparum to produce high parasitemia , to cytoadhere, and to invade all stage of red blood cells, help to explain this mor bidity and mortality. 4. Malaria control measures Different approaches are being developed and used to prevent and control malaria. These strategies include the reduction of human -mosquito contact through the use of insecticide - impregnated supports and repel lents, chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women and malaria -na\u00efve individuals including infants, children and travelers , and an early detection and treatment of clinical cases with effective malaria drugs. At the community level, approaches to reduce vector contact include the treatment of mosquito breeding sites with insecticides to prevent larva l development. At the family level , insecticide spraying in houses, use of insecticide -impregnated bed nets , and other interventions significantly reduce the exposure t o mosquitoes [18]. The development and use of rapid diag nostic test s in malaria diagnosis is reducing the delay to treatment, thus preventing disease progression toward severe symptoms . This may also reduce the human reservoir for parasites and lower the transmission rate. This early diagnos is, in 10 combination w ith the use of artemisinin -based combination therapies , has led to an almost complete elimination of malaria in Zanzibar [19]. 5. Vaccines against malaria Early malaria immunization trials using experimental chal lenge by infected mosquitoes were conducted first in the mid-1970s [20,21]. Field trials measuring efficacy against clinical malaria were conducted with the SPf66 vaccine in the 1990s [22]. Advances such as parasite cultivation methods and the sequencing of the P. falciparum genome have increased hope for the development of a malaria vaccine [23]. However, after more than 35 years in laboratory research and field trials, the only vaccine that has gone into a Phase 3 trial is the RTS,S vaccine, which showed a moderate efficacy of 50% in a Phase 2 trial conducted in the Gambia [24] with similar results in subsequent Phase 2 trials and in interim analyses from the ongoing Phase 3 trial . This limited success has raised doubt about the likelihood of having a highly efficacious malaria vaccine in the next fe w years. However, with the involvement of funding agencies, the private sector, and international organizations united by the goal of containing or even eradicating malaria, strategies are being scaled up to control the disease burden. In addition to the e ffective treatment of malaria cases and the use of insecticide impregnated barrier s, malaria vaccines could play an important role in this initiative. Research strategies targeting all stages of malaria parasite development are currently underway. Accordin g to parasite development stages, malaria vaccines can be divided into 3 groups: pre -erythrocytic vaccines, blood stage vaccines, and \"other\" vaccines, including transmission blocking vaccines and vaccines against pregnancy - associated malaria ( Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3). 11 a) Pre-erythrocytic vaccines Immune response s to the P. falciparum sporozoites are very limited due to the ir brief passage in the blood stream before invading hepatocytes. A vaccine targeting sporozoites needs to act promptly in order to prevent invasion. Both humoral and T -cell responses are required to block hepatocyte invasion. The goal of pre-erythrocytic vaccines is to prevent the occurrence of the blood stage, thus averting malaria symptoms. The circumsporozoite (CS) protein expressed on th e surface of sporozoites is the key antigen of interest during this stage. The protein has 412 amino acids [25], consisting of a central domain that is conserved within species [26]. Anti - CS antibodies we re shown to inhibit sporozoite invasion in vitro, while anti-CS monoclonal antibodies were able to block experimental infection of animals [27]. RTS,S is the leading malaria vaccine candidate. It is a recombinant protein comprised of 2 polypeptides. The CS protein of the 3D7 strain is fused to the N terminus of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to form the RTS (repeat region , T cell epitopes, and hepatitis B surface antigen) molecule. In addition, a 19 tetra peptide repeat motif (NANP) fused in the C -terminal is then added. The S molecule consists of the entire 226 amino acid sequence of infused HBsAg [28]. Clinical studies conducted in the Gambia showed that the vaccine prevented 34% of infections over 15 weeks of follow -up. In Mozambique [29], RTS,S induced 35% efficacy against first clinical episodes and 49% protection against severe malaria. New strategies such as vaccine with combinations of different antigens from different stages or different alleles of the same antigen are also under exploration in exploration. RTS,S is being associated with MSP -1 in an evaluation study at WRAIR. 12 The second vaccine directed toward the liver stage consists of epitopes from multiples antigens. B-cell, CD4 and CD8 T -cell epitopes of the liver stage surface antigen (LSA) and CS were strung together and fused to the thrombospodin related adhesion protein (TRAP) . No protection was seen in Phase 2b trials conducted in Kenya [30] using this vaccine, but other variants are now under development. LSA1 and LSA3 are also under development as malaria vaccine candidate s by, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Pasteur Institute in Paris respectively . Finally, a whole cell radiated -attenuated sporozoite vaccine was recently tested in a Phase 1 /2 trial at the University of Maryland and the U.S. Navy Medical Research Institute [31]. Results of this Phase 1/2 tria l showed that the immunogenicity and efficacy of such vaccine were possibly suboptimal due to an inefficient route of administration [31]. b) Erythrocytic vaccines The gradual acquisition of natural protection aga inst disease in malaria transmission areas following repeat infections indicates the feasibility of a blood stage malaria vaccine. Immune protection during this stage is essentially mediated through antibodies. Antigens expressed on the surface of the mero zoite have been the target of vaccine developers. Malaria pathology is associated with the blood stage. Therefore blood stage vaccine s are intended to prevent disease and death without necessarily preventing infection. The protective mechanism likely oper ates through neutralizing antibodies against surface antigens of plasmodium -infected erythrocytes. Antigens of interest as vaccine candidates include the merozoite surface protein s 1, 2 and 3 (MSP1, 2 and 3), the serine -repeat antigen (SERA), the erythrocy te binding antigen (EBA) and the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). 13 MSP1, a 230 -kDa protein, is the antigen on which FMP1/AS 02 and MSP 1-42 vaccines are based. A Phase 2b vaccine trial conducted with FMP 1/AS 02 in Kenya did not show any clinical efficacy [32]. A Pha se 1 trial using MSP1 -42 is currently underway in the United States. MSP 3 is a 48 kDa protein expressed by late schizonts. The protein is targeted mainly by IgG 1 and IgG 3 in high transmission area patients. A Phase 2b trial based on this antigen adjuvante d with LSP was completed 6 months ago in Mali. A SERA5 -based vaccine is in a Phase 1 trial in Japan , whereas EBA -175 vaccine is being tested in a Phase 1 trial in the United States. MSP3 is located on the surface of the merozoite. In a recent Phase 2 tr ial, a vaccine construct based on this antigen was associated with the reduction of clinical malaria incidence rate in young children [33]. Apical membrane antigen 1 is synthesized during the liver and the blood stage. It is a functional protein that may play a role in erythrocyte and hepatocyte invasion. Inhibitory antibodies against this antigen were shown to prevent merozoite entry into red blood cells. Three Phase 2b vaccine trial conducted in Mali were based on this candidate, including the FMP2.1/AS 02 trial, the AMA1 -C1 trial, and the AMA1 -FVO trial. c) Transmission -blocking vaccines Transmission -blocking vaccines are also sometimes called \"altr uistic vaccine s\". If successful , such a vaccine would induce neutralizing antibodies responses against gametocyte or ookinete surface proteins, thereby blocking fertilization [10]. The targeted antigens during this 14 stage are Pfs25 and Pfs28. Pfs25 has been expressed as a recombinant protein and te sted in a phase 1 trial [34]. d) Vaccines against pregnancy -associated malaria The occurrence of malaria during pregnancy, primarily among primigravidea, is associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery d ue to sequestration of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells of the placenta. This binding is mediated by the interaction between Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein -1 (PfEMP -1), a ligand expressed on the surface on the infected erythro cyte, and receptors on the placenta surface - mainly chondroitin sulphate antigen (CSA). High titer s of anti - PfEMP -1 have been shown to correlate with pregnancy -associated malaria [35]. Preclinical studies are underway in Sweden and at the Pasteur institute in Paris to develop a candidate vaccine. 15 Figure 2.2: Malaria vaccine type s according to parasite life cycle ( Reproduced from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative web site at www.malariavaccine.org , 2012 ) Erythrocyte stage vaccine Antigen : AMA1, MSP1, MSP2, MSP3 Liver stage vaccine Prevent infection Antigen : CSP Sexual Stage (Transmission blocking vaccine: TBV) Stop parasite development Antigen : Pf28/25 Anti sporozoite vaccine Inhibit mobility and prevent hepatocytes invasion Antigen : CSP, TRAP 16 Figure 2.3: Malaria vaccine s under development [10] 17 B. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) 1. Description of AMA1 antigen AMA1 is a type I integral surface protein expressed in sporozoites during hepa tocyte invasion and in merozoites during red blood cell invasion. The 83 kDa protein is processed into a 66 kDa product prior to erythrocyte invasion [36]. Structurally, the protein has an N -terminal extracellular domain with 525 residues, a transme mbrane domain (21 amino acids) and a C - terminal domain with 55 residues [37]. The extracellular domain is divided in to 3 sub-domains (Figure 2.4 A) based on the pattern of disulphide bonds. Most of the polymorphisms in AMA1 are located in domain I (32 single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNP). However, domain III (9 SNPs) is also quite diverse . Domain II (11 SNPs) is less polymorphic [37]. The boundary of domain s I and II is situated between residues 302 and 320 while the boundary of domain s II and III is localized between residues 418 and 443 ( Figure 2.4 A). The polymorphic residues in domains I and III have been described as being the target of the protective immune response [36,38]. AMA1 is involved in the reorientation, binding and invasion of the merozoites into the red blood cells [39] Thus, antibodies to AMA1 may block erythrocyte invasion by malaria parasites. 2. Structure and polymorphism of AM A1 The ectodomain of AMA1 starts at residue 97 and end s with its carboxy -terminal at residue 547 . The AMA1 ectodomain polymorphic . It has at least 62 polymorphic amino acid residues distributed across its three domains ( Figure 2.4 B). Most of these polymorphisms are dimorphic. The remaining polymorphic sites are trimorphic, tetramorphic at amino acids 18 position 200 and 201, and finally heptamorphic at position 197 [39]. Five highly polymorphic residues (187, 197, 200, 230 and 243 ; Figure 2.5) are located at the top left side of the three dimensional structure of the molecule. These highly polymorphic residues and some dimorphic residues are located on one face of the molecule, called the \"polymorphic face\". Additionally, four dimorphic residues are situated on domain I surface at the positions 121, 325, 393 and 395 [40] (Figure 2.5) in the non-polymorphic face of the protein. AMA1 is a PAN domain protein [39]. The crystal structure of the AMA1 ectodomain reveals loops in domain 1 and 2. The ordering of the domain 2 loop identifies a hydrophobic pocket in the center which may be the target of anti -AMA1 antibod ies. The majority of highly polymorphic residues a re located around this pocket, wh ich is likely the AMA1 binding pocket (Figure 2.6 ) [39]. Domain s 1 and 2 are conserved in evolutionar ily distinct AMA1, confirming its critical function. In a 3 year incidence study of the variation in the AMA1 gene in infections , conducted in Bandiagara, Mali, Takala et al observ ed an extensive diversity in the parasite population. Th is study identifies 214 unique haplotype from 506 human infections. Moreover, half of the haplotype s were observed only once during the study. This great diversity was shown to differ also according t o countries and continents. Creating a vaccine to account for a ll of these polymorphisms pose s a significant challenge for malaria vaccine developers. 19 A 20 B Figure 2.4: Sequence of PfAMA1 ectodomain showing domains I, II and III [41].

Front view on the left and side view on the right [43]. 3. Rationale for an AMA1 -based malaria vaccine AMA1 is an 83 kDa protein initially expressed and stored in micronemes , small organelles in the apical complex that are involved with red blood cell invasion . The protein is later cleaved and distributed on the surface of the merozoite as a 66 kDa antigen [44]. A vaccine based on the AMA1 protein may not be stage -specific due to the protein's expression on the sporozoite surface. AMA1 is thought to play an important role in erythrocyte [45,46] and hepat ocyte invasion [47]. Anti -AMA1 antibodies have been found to inhibit erythrocyte invasion in in vitro studies [48]. In addition, vaccination of primates with an AMA1 against disease [49]. Moreover, AMA1 antibodies purified from the blood of individuals living in endemic areas showed a protective effect [50] against disease. All of these factors led to the use of AMA1 as a vaccine candidate antigen. This choice has been confirmed by observations from field studies showing that a protective immune response to AMA1 is acquired following repeat ed infectio n [10]. This protection is medi ated by neutralizing antibodies directed against proteins like AMA1 that are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. This protection may result in a reduction of parasitemia rather than complete parasite clearance, explaining the anti -disease ef fect of this group of vaccine [51]. 4. Antigen diversity and vaccine efficacy Antigenic diversity is an immune evasion mechanism employed by the malaria parasite to avoid clearance in th e bloodstream. The greatest challenge in developing a malaria vaccine is to overcome the diversity of candidate antigens. In vitro and field studies have been conducted to assess the impact of polymorphi sm on epitope recognition by their targeted antibodie s. An early in vitro study [52] has shown that the i nvasion -inhibitory ant ibodies against 3D7 AMA1 were not able to block erythrocyte invasion of W2mef parasites due to their genetic dissimilarity. In a field study in Gambia, the p rotective effect of ant ibodies to MSP -3 polymorphic regions was found to be stronger than the effect of antibodies targeting the conserved regions [53]. Furthermore, a vaccine trial conducted in Papua New Guinea using combination B va ccine, a mixture of MSP1 and MSP2 protein, showed an i ncreased incidence of clinical infections with non -vaccine type parasites in vaccinated individuals compared to participant s who received the control vaccine [9]. 23 Conversely, v accines based on MSP1 [54] as well as CSP antigens [55] did n ot affect allele frequencies in field trials. Only some evidence of decrease d multipl icity of infection was seen in participant s receiving the vaccine of interest. In addition to these two observations, it is not clear whether combination B allele specificity was due to the specificity of the immune response or a divergence in strain virul ence [56]. The polymorphism of AMA1 antigen is the major challenge for its use as an effective vaccine candidate. The extent to which these polymorphisms may compromise an AMA1 -based vaccine is unknown. A radical subst itution of asparagine by t yrosine can completely disrupt the recognition of putative epitopes [36], while n ine substitutions may lead to a change in the charge of the molecule , which becomes unrecognizable to neutralizing antibodies. With a g rowth and invasion inhibition assay and ELISA using antibodies to recombinant P. falciparum 3D7 AMA1 adjuvant ed with Montanide ISA720, purified human anti -AMA1 antibodies were found to strongly inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites , with the majo rity of these antibodies reacting in a strain -specific manner [5].The extent of escape was found in another study to correlate with sequence distance between vaccine and target strain [57]. Based on antigenic escape modeling, growth inhi bition -invasion assays [42], impact of AMA1 -c1L polymorphic sites on risk of clinical malaria, anti-c1L antibodies may be strain specific. Further investigation of the allele -specific efficacy of candidate malaria vaccines is needed for a rational development of an AMA1 -based vaccine. 24 5. Within -host selection and evolutionary consequences of vaccination Antigenic drift, which is the accumulation of amino acids changes from one form that is recognizable by the immune system to another less recognizab le form, is seen during influenza virus seasonal monitoring. This surveillance has identif ied novel strains that can successfully infect vaccinated and unvaccinated hosts and that will be incorporated in the following year's vaccine. On the other hand, a 1 0-year follow -up of the Hib vaccine [58] and a 4 -year genetic surveillance following the introduction of the meningococcal C vaccine in the United Kingdom [59] both showed an increase in genetic diversity without a major switch of the encoding gene. However, in an animal model, a serial passage of rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi through mice previously immunized with live parasites increased parasite virulence [60]. This observation underlines a change in parasite behavior in a human -modified environment. In vitro [56] and in vivo [61] studies using an AMA1 -based vaccine have shown that immunization with a single antigen generates a clone -specific response leading to a change in clone frequencies. There is a need for molecular epidemiology studies to a ssess whether malaria vaccines are strain specific and the extent of change in the distribution of alleles following immunization. If antigenic drift is taking place following immunization, it may reduce overall vaccine efficacy in the long term. C. Summary of scientific rationale Despite enormous efforts by international agencies and governments of malaria endemic areas to eradicate malaria in the late 1950s and early 1960s, two billion people are still at risk of being infected annually with the disease [62], leading to almost 655.0000 deaths each year [63]. Most of these deaths occur in sub -Saharan Africa , where the disease is endemic1. Parasite 25 resistance to antimalarial drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides are major contributors to this persistent malaria burde n [64]. Vaccination is one promising str ategy that may help to overcome this disease; however, most vaccine formulations have shown limited success owing in part to the great genetic diversity of the parasite population s in endemic areas [65]. The P. falciparum genome consists of 23 megabases with approximately 5400 genes distributed over 14 chromosomes [66]. The P. falciparum genome is extremely A -T rich (approximately 80%). Almost 4% of the genes are involved in immune evasion and host parasite interact ions [67]. At least 31% of the predicted proteins have one or more transme mbrane domains, including several of the surface antigens being targeted by malaria vaccines (e.g. AMA1 , MSP1 and RESA) [67]. These antigens are targets of humoral immunity during malaria infection [9]. Most vaccines that are being investigated have targeted these proteins. In endemic areas, an individ ual acquires protective immune responses following repeated infection s from multiple strains of the parasite , suggesting that the immune response may be strain -specific. Studies of an MSP2 -based vaccine conducted in Papua New Guinea have shown an increased incidence of clinical infections with non -vaccine type parasites in vaccinated individuals [9]. Hence, the variability of antigens included in vaccines may be an obstacle in the development of an effective mala ria vaccine. However, other vaccines based on MSP1 (SPf66) [54] as well as CSP (RTS,S/AS02 A) [55] did not affect the allele frequencies of antigens in vaccinees compa red to controls. In both studies, no evidence of selection was observed, although both showed some evidence of decreased multiplicity of infection (MOI) in vaccinated participant s. Therefore, further investigation of the allele -specific efficacy of candida te malaria vaccines is needed. 26 AMA1 is a leading malaria vaccine candidate based on its immunogenicity (capacity to produce antibodies that inhibit erythrocyte invasion), the increase prevalence of antibody positivity with age , and its sequence characteri stics [40]. Indeed, the AMA1 sequence is relatively conserved among Plasmodium species (most species have AMA1 protein) and lacks the sequenc e repeats and size polymorphism described in other malaria vaccine candidate antigens. In addition, the protein is expressed during both the liver and the blood stage s of the parasite, allowing the possibility of designing a vaccine that would target multi ple stages of the life cycle. However, as suggested by Cortes et al. [36] and others [68] genetic diversity in AMA1 could be a great obstacle for its use as a malaria vaccine. With at least 62 polymorphic codons in the AMA1 gene, it is important to assess whether the immune response to the vaccine is allel e- specific and to identify polymorphic residues that are under selective pressure. The degree to which a 3D7 -based vaccine will protect against non -3D7 type parasites in vivo is not known. Thus, we measure d the allele -specific efficacy of a monovalent AMA1 vaccine based on 3D7, as well as a bivalent vaccine based on a mixture of 3D7 and FVO strain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether immunization with these two antigens corresponding to one or two isolates of the malaria parasite would lead t o the selection of heterologous alleles, thus affecting allele frequencies. A shift in the distribution of malaria parasite alleles w as assessed in the context of two efficacy trials of an AMA1 -based vaccine. Limited cross -protection by the vaccine against diverse strains and a resulting selection for non-vaccine strains manifested as a shift in the genetic composition of the parasite populations harbored by vaccinees was expected. . 27 Figure 2.6.

Overall study design This study was conducted in the context of two randomized, double -blind, controlled Phase 2 trials of malaria vaccine safety and efficacy, one completed in summer 2007 and the second one completed in October 2009. The first study ( AMA1 -C1 study) tested a bivalent and FVO) using a Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine (Hiberix) as a comparator in Bancoumana, Mali. The second study (FMP2.1/AS02A trial) assessed the efficacy of a monovalent AMA1 vaccine (strain 3D7) compared to a rabies vaccine control in Bandiagara, Mali (Table 3.1). The AMA1 -C1 trial was a randomized , controlled Phase 2 trial conducted in 300 children aged 2 to 3 years inclusive in Bancoumana. The AMA1 -C1 vaccine being tested in this study contains an equal mixture of the correctly folded ectodomain portion of recombinant AMA1 from the genetically diverse FVO and 3D7 strains of P. falciparum proteins FVO and were expressed separately as secreted recombinant p roteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris , purified, and then combined in equal amounts by mass spectrometry. Blood samples used in this study were collected during screening (baseline data) and participant follow -up. The FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine trial was a rand omized, controlled , Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the AMA1 malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02 A versus rabies vaccine in 400 children aged 1 -6 years in Bandiagara, Mali. FMP2.1 is a lyophilized preparation o f the of 3D7 clone of P. falciparum AMA1 . 29 FMP2.1 is comprised of 478 amino acids, 449 of which are derived from the merozoite surface protein AMA1 . The first dose of this vaccine was administered in May 2007. Sample collection and biologica l analysis dates are reported in Tables 4 and 5 of the annex section. For both trials, we assess ed allele -specific vaccine efficacy based on 2 outcomes: The time to malaria first clinical episode with strains homologous to that in the vaccine. We define d homology based on the entire ectodomain sequence as well as on putatively important clusters of amino acids such as c1 or c1L , c2, c3 as well as domain 1, domain 2 and domain 3 as described by Dutta et al [42] and Takala et al [69]. Reduction in the frequency of strains homologous to vaccine isolates in the malar ia vaccine arm. We define d similarity as having identical amino acid sequences within portions of AMA1 that we will analyze (entire ectodomai n, domains I, II, and III, and c 1 and c1L, c2, c3 clusters ). 30 Table 3.1.

To measure the selection induced by a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine (3D7 and FVO -based) in Bancoumana, Mali. (Specific Aim 1) This stud y measure d the selection on AMA1 induced by a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine (3D7 and FVO -based) in Bancoumana, M ali. Following immunization , participant s were followed up for 6 months with blood collected on filter paper at specified times and during unsc heduled visits at the clinic. These blood samples were used to extract parasite DNA and amplify the AMA1 encoding gene. 31 a) Study sites Bancoumana is a rural village situated 60 km southwest of Bamako , the capital city of Mali. The health district of Banco umana has a population of approximately 22,000 inhabitants. Malaria t ransmission is hyper -endemic and seasonal (June -November) at this study site, with a peak transmission in October (Figure 3.1). b) Study populations In Bancoumana, the study population cons ists of children aged 2 to 3 years inclusive. These children were divided into 2 cohorts. One group of 60 children was randomized 1:1 to receive either AMA1 -C1/Alhydrogel\u00ae or type B (Hib) vaccine in the beginning of the study in Bancoumana. This cohort ( Phase 2a) allowed a more extensive evaluation of vaccine safety prior to Phase 2b. The second group of 240 children were randomized 1:1 to receive either AMA1 - C1/Alhydrogel\u00ae or type B vaccine in Bancoumana ( Phase 2b). 32 Figure 3.1.

In Bancoumana sample collection started at day 42 and was scheduled each consecutive month. Additional samples were collected during unscheduled visit s for malaria related symptom s (Figure 3.2). d) Sample size and power calculations In Bancoumana , where 3D7 and FVO were both in the vaccine formulation, based on c1L alleles frequencies of respectively 9.66% and 0% and assuming a 50% efficacy, the power to detect a 50% reduction of va ccine allele is 80% with the assumption that 10% of samples w ould not be sequenced or w ould have multiple variants ( Table 3.2). 34 Table 3.2.

The sample sizes here refer to the total number of samples that were required to be positive by PCR. e) Sample selection In Bancoumana, samples were collected from the 150 children who received the AMA - C1 vaccine and 150 controls recruited for the vaccine trial during the screening an d the 6 month follow -up period. Our working sample set include d screening samples, those positive for malaria during the follow -up period , and 20% of randomly selected microscopy -negative samples. Based on av ailable microscopy data, we had a sample set of 1247 distributed as follow s: 581 thick smear -positive samples (have malaria parasite s) 366 thick smear -negative samples (without malaria parasite s) 35 300 screening samples (collected during participant screening prior to enrollment in the study) . f) Measured Covariates Participant characteristics in cluded demographic information. Parasite data included parasitemia, parasite species, and parasite ama1 amino acid composition. Multiple infections from the same participant s were also recorded. g) Laboratory technique s DNA extraction We extracted parasite DNA according to a protocol described by the supplier using the QIAmp 96 DNA kit (Qiagen\u00ae). Briefly, pieces of filter paper strips stained with dried blood were placed into the wells of the round -well block (provided in kit) and 180uL of Buffer ATL were added. The blocks were incubated at 85oC for 10 minutes followed by a brief centrifugation to remove liquid from inside the lid. Protease K (20uL) was added into the wells. The block was mixed by vortexing and incubate d at 56oC for 1h. Buffer AL (200uL) was added to the sample, mixed thoroughly and centrifuge d briefly at 3000rpm to collect any solution from the caps and then incubate d at 70oC for 10 min. DNA was precipitate d by adding 200uL of ethanol (96 - 100%) to eac h well , follow ed by mix ing. The wells were then s ealed with new caps & shak en vigorously for 15s. They were then c entrifuge d briefly at 3000rpm to collect any solution from the caps. The mixture from the round well was transferred in a QIAamp 96 plate on t op of an S - Block. The plate was sealed with an AirPore tape sheet and centrifuge d 4000rpm for 6 minutes. The plate was then washed with 500uL of buffer AW1 at 4000rpm for 6 minutes and with buffer 36 AW2 at 4000 rpm for 23 min. DNA (Table 3.3) was then eluted with 150uL Buffer AE after an incubation of 5 m in at room temperature , followed by a centrifugation of 4000 rpm for 6 min. PCR technique and gel electrophoresis A nested PCR was used to amplify the entire ectodomain coding sequence of AMA1 gene (1861 bp) [41]. PCR and sequencing conditions are described in Duan et al [68]. Briefly, a nested PCR was performed using primers F2 (tcaaattaatgtacttgtta ) and R8 (ttttagcataaaagagaagc) (Table 3.4). Conditions for this amplification were an initial DNA denaturation at 94oC for 2 min, followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94oC for 20 sec; primer annealing at 52oC for 10 sec, and extension at 60oC for 3 min. A final extension was conducted at 60oC for 5 min. PCR products of the first amplification were subsequently used as a template for a second round of amplification with primers n1 (atgagaaaattatactgcgt) and n2 (tgattatatcagacgttgaa) (Table 3.4) (Figure 3.3). Amplification conditions were exactly the same as in the primary amplification with only 30 cycles instead of 38. Each primary PCR reaction contained a total volume of 27 l with 22.5 l of Platinum super mix in 96 wells plate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1 l of each primer and 2.5 l of malaria parasite DNA. Secondary PCR ha d 45 l of Platinum Mix, 1 l of each primer and 5 l of primary PCR product. Secondary PCR products were electrophoresed on a high pre-cast gel system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) , then visualized and photographed under ultraviolet light (Figure 3.4 and 3.5). 37 Table 3.3.

The h ypothesis for this investigation was that genet ic diversity parameters of malaria parasites will decrease after vaccination with a bivalent AMA1 vaccine compared to controls due to a total reduction in the number of circulating malaria alleles among those vaccinated. Our r ationale was that if the vacci ne is strain -specific, vaccine -induced antibodies will reduce the frequency of parasites that have an AMA1 sequence similar to the vaccine strain (Specificity of the response). In summary, in this specific aim, the distribution of parasite haplotypes at baseline was compared to their post-vaccination distribution . We conducted the following statistical analysis using AMA1 gene sequences obtained from AMA1 vaccinees and controls group. All the following analyses were performed using DNASP , BioEdit and MEGA 4 software. 41 Sequences were assembled and compared using sequence alignment software to assess their similarity. We compare d haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity () parameters of sequences obtained from the control group to those of vaccine group at baseline before immunization (baseline comparability) . We estimate d Hd, , and the average number of nucleotide differences between pairs of sequences (k) in the control compared to estimates in the vaccine group after immunization. Hd, and k w ere assessed to compare sequences obtained from the control group before and after vaccination and sequences obtained from the vaccine group before after vaccination (schematic description in Figure 8). 42 A Vaccinees, D 0 Vaccinees D follow -up Divergence Divergence Controls, D 0 Controls Dfollow -up B.

Specific aim #1B: Our goal in specific aim #1B was to assess the incidence of bivalent vaccine -type AMA1 alleles in vaccinated individuals compared to controls. We h ypothesized that AMA1 vaccinees will have a decreased incidence of malar ia infections with parasites similar to the bivalent vaccine alleles compared to the controls. The r ationale for this aim was that if the nucleotide composition of the gene encoding the vaccine antigen is similar to those of alleles infecting vaccines (3D7 and FVO reference sequences in Figure s 3.7 and 3.8), allele -specific vaccine - induced immunity may result in a reduction of the incidence of vaccine -type alleles in this group. This aim was assessed in the context of a r andomized vaccine trial with longitu dinal follow -up. 46 The study design helped to ensure similarity among study groups and increase d confidence that differences were due to the intervention, and longitudinal observation allow ed a measure of incident cases . We evaluated the number of samples n eeded to detect a significant difference given a certain power. The assumptions we made for our analysis of time to infection with a similar strain were the following. G iven D equal s the number of events in the 2 groups and = 1.5 (relative hazard), the n umber of disease cases due to the particular haplotype assuming a 5% rate of unsequenced isolates and 80% powe r is given in table 3 . Statistical analysis aim #1B : To accomplish this aim, we compare d AMA1 vaccinees to the control i ndividuals based on clinical malaria episode s with the same AMA1 haplotype as the one contained in the vaccine and measure d the time to the next clinical malaria episode with haplotypes similar to that of the vaccine antigen. We define d similarity based on the entire ectodomain se quence as well as putatively important clusters of amino acids such as c1, c1L, c2 and c3 as well as domains 1, 2 and 3 . Participant carriage of haplotypes w as estimated at each follow -up time point. We used Cox proportional hazards to model the time to first clinical malaria episode with similar strains while taking into account repeated measurements from the same individua l. The outcome of interest was the time to first clinical malaria episode. Our first predictor was the p -distance between infecting par asite AMA1 of 3D7 or FVO AMA1 sequence. . Finally, we assess ed vaccine -induced selection applying sieve analysis (Figure 3.9). This method was originally developed for application to viral genotype data arising from HIV vaccine trials. It assesses how vacci ne protection varies jointly with sequence variation in multiple genes. The 47 model offers the advantage of incorporating information on risk factors , allowing an estimation of odds ratios adjusted for the covariates. The principle of the sieve analysis is the following : Assuming K distinct strains circulating in the geographical region, the strain specific odds ratio (OR (s,i)) can be estimated. With (OR (s,i) ) equal to the odds of infection by strain \" s\" in infected vaccinated compared to infected un vacci nated subjects divided by the odds of infection by strain \" I\" in infected vaccinated compared to infected unvaccinated subjects. We conducted the sieve analysis by using logistic regression to assess whether groups of p-distances are predictors of vaccina tion status and clinical disease . Covariates include age, vaccine status and clusters as defined by Dutta et al [42]. Strain s in this case were defined as AMA1 haplotypes based on the full AMA1 ectodomain, AMA1 c1 or AMA1 c1L. As our clusters were not ordered, we used the likelihood ratio statistic for testing heterogeneit y of K proportions. 48 Figure 3.9. Sieve analysis of pathogen strains in a preventive vaccine trial [70]. 3. Evaluate selection induced by a monovalent (3D7 -based) AMA1 malaria vaccine in Bandiagara, Mali (specific aim #2) This study measure d the selection induced by a mono valent AMA1 malaria vaccine (based on the ama1 sequence of the 3D7 strain ) in Bandiagara, M ali. 49 a) Study site Bandiagara ( Figure 3.1) is a rural town of almost 13,700 inhabitants locat ed 700 km northeast of Bamako. Malaria transmission is seasonal and hyper -endemic, with seasonal peaks following the rains in July -October. b) Study population The study population in Bandiagara comprised 2 groups of children aged 1 to 6 years. One group (2 00 children) received the vaccine study (50 g of FMP2.1 adjuvanted with 0.5 mL of AS02 A), and the control group (200) received the rabies vaccine. c) Sample collection Blood samples were collected on filter papers. These samples were used for DNA extraction , PCR and sequencing. Participant follow -up and sample collection at both sites are described in Figure 3.2. Active surveillance started on the 90th day followed by days 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 . Passive surveillance was conducted any time a participant attended the clinic for a clinical examination. The per protocol (PP) analysis included samples collected from screening day to day 240 while the intention to treat analysis consist of samples collected from day 74 (2 weeks after the last immunization) to day 240. d) Sample size and power calculations In Bandiagara, the vaccine was based on the AMA1 3D7 antigenic form (prevalence equal s 9.66% based on c1 cluster). If we assume the vaccine w ould reduce the number of circulating 3D7 by 50%, this study w ould have a 80% power to detect a reduction of vaccine allele frequency by 50% assuming 10% of non -amplified and multiple sequences ( Table 3.2). 50 e) Sample selection In Bandiagara, samples were collected from the 200 vaccinated children and 200 controls recruited f or the vaccine trial during the screening and the 6 month follow -up period. Our working samples include d screening samples, those from participants positive for malaria during the follow -up period , and 20% of randomly selected microscopy -negative samples. Based on microscopy data, we ha d a sample set of 1 091 distributed as follow s: 504 thick smear -positive samples ( with malaria parasite s) 291 thick smear -negative samples (without malaria parasite s) 296 screening samples (collected during participant scree ning prior to e nrollment in the study) f) Measured Covariates Participant characteristics included demographic information. Parasites data included parasitemia, parasite species and parasite ama1 gene amino acid composition. Multiple infections from the same participant were also recorded. g) Laboratory techniques Protocols used to assess this aim were identical to those used while assessing specific aim #1. h) Statistical analysis for specific aim #2 This study assessed the allele specific efficacy of a monovale nt AMA1 3D7 -based malaria vaccine in Bandiagara, Mali. Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes Corporation, MI) was used to align and edit DNA sequences. Sequences were defined as collected from single/predominant infections or multiple 51 infections based on th e peak height of the chromatogram. Multiple -allele infections were defined as those with a secondary peak height of 50% or more of the primary peak height at any polymorphic site. Haplotypes were defined using only single/predominant of haplotype definition We used MEGA 4.50.3 [71] and DNASP 4.50.3 [72] software to estimate amino acids differences between 3D7 reference sequence and any single/predominant sequences. To explore FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine efficacy , we used SAS 9.2 statistical software (Cary, NC) to assess the time to malaria first clinical episode with a 3D7 (DERHFDKY) and non -3D7 c1L haplotype. To evaluate the cross protective effect of FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine, we model the time to first clinical episode with strains matching Fab 9 during the 6 months of follow up. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between treatment arms and risk of a clinical episode with parasites havi ng an AMA1 c1L haplotype identical to 3D7 or any of the previous strains while a Chi square tests was used to compare the frequency of c1L haplotypes in the two treatment arms. Potential immunodominant amino acid positions were identified by comparing the frequency of vaccine strain codons across the 52 polymorphic sites in FMP2.1/AS02 A and rabies vaccine groups correcting for multiple measurement. To investigate the dynamics of amino acids in treatment arms, we compared the frequency of epitopes which cha nge from 3D7 -type to 3D7 - type, from 3D7 -type, from other -type to 3D7 -type and from other -type to other - type in consecutive malaria infection in sequences identified by day 74 to those collected after 52 this time point. Furthermore, important ep itopes were a ssessed by identifying individual amino acids that were positively associated with antigenic distance thus representing the whole ectodomain. We used a stepwise linear regression with no intercept to select for candidate amino acids at a selec tion threshold of p=0.15. Candidate amino acids were used in a linear regression model with the dependant variable being the natural log transformation of amino acid distance when sequences were compared to 3D7 strain while the predictor was individual ami no acids. Amino acids were considered significantly associated to p -distance at p=0.001 after controlling for multiple comparisons. To assess whether c1L is the main target of immune response , we define haplotypes based on polymorphic codons which discrim inate 3D7 and FVO in domain 2 (positions 308, 330 332, 404) and domain 3 (positions 439, 451 ). Haplotypes identified through this clustering were used to measure the time to a first clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 -type haplotype. Moreover, the number o f codons difference in c1L susceptible to introduce a change in vaccine efficacy was measured by defining groups of alleles that were used in a time to event and Cox proportional analysis. Finally, we used a neighborhood joining network to assess the re latedness of sequences collected from FMP2.1/AS02 A and rabies vaccine groups to 3D7 allele. Splits tree [73] was used to construct phylogenetic tree and visualization was done through Den troscope [74]. B. Human Subject Protections Protocols for both studies have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB ) of the University of Bamako, Mali. The Bandiagara study was also approved by 53 the University of Maryland at Baltimore IRB, and the Bancoumana study protocol was approved by the IRB of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Ins titutes of Health. 54 IV. CHAPTER 4 A. Lack of allele -specific efficacy of a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine1 1 Ouattara A. et al. Malari a Journal. 2010 June 21, 9(1):175 55 1. Abstract Background Extensive genetic diversity in vaccine antigens may contribute to the lack of efficacy of blood stage malaria vaccines. Apical membrane antigen -1 (AMA1) is a leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidate with extreme diversity, potentially limiting its efficacy against infection and disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites with diverse forms of AMA1. Methods Three hundred Malian children participated in a Phase 2 clinical trial of a bivalent malaria vaccine that was found to have no protective efficacy. The vaccine consists of recombinant AMA1 based on the 3D7 and FVO stra falciparum The gene encoding AMA1 was sequenced from P. falciparum infections experienced before and after immunization with the study vaccine or a control vaccine. Sequences of ama1 from infections i n the malaria vaccine and control groups were compared with regard to similarity to the vaccine antigens using several measures of genetic diversity. Time to infection with parasites carrying AMA1 haplotypes similar to the vaccine strains with respect to i mmunologically important polymorphisms and the risk of infection with vaccine strain haplotypes were compared. Results Based on 62 polymorphic AMA1 residues, 186 unique ama1 haplotypes were identified among 315 ama1 sequences that were included in the ana lysis. Eight infections had ama1 sequences identical to 3D7 while none were identical to FVO. Several measures of genetic diversity showed that ama1 sequences in the malaria vaccine and control groups were comparable both at 56 baseline and during follow -up period. Pre - and post -immunization ama1 sequences in both groups all had a similar degree of genetic distance from FVO and 3D7 ama1 . No differences were found in the time to first clinical episode or risk of infection with an AMA1 haplotype similar to 3D7 o r FVO with respect to a limited set of immunologically important polymorphisms found in the cluster 1 loop of domain I of AMA1. Conclusion This Phase 2 trial of a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine found no evidence of vaccine selection or strain -specific effi cacy, suggesting that the extreme genetic diversity of AMA1 did not account for failure of the vaccine to provide protection. 57 2. Background Combined with other measures, vaccination is considered a promising approach to control and eventually eliminate mala ria [8,75]. Extensive polymorphism in many Plasmodium falciparum proteins may limit the efficacy of vaccines based on just one or two allelic variants that are not broadly cross -protective against diverse antige ns found in natural infections. For example, a multi -antigen blood stage malaria vaccine evaluated in Papua New Guinea reduced parasite density and prevalence of infection in a strain -specific manner, suggesting selection of non - vaccine variants [9]. In contrast, immunization with RTS,S, a vaccine directed against the pre - erythrocytic circumsporozoite protein [10], does not appear to result in selection or allele -specific efficacy [55,76]. Apical membrane an tigen -1 (AMA1) is a leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidate that is thought to play a critical role in erythrocyte invasion. Antibodies against AMA1 have been shown to block parasite invasion [77-82], and sero-epidemiological studies have shown an association of anti -AMA1 antibodies with naturally acquired protection against malaria [83,84]. Animal studies [85] have shown the ability of va ccines based on this antigen to stimulate antibody responses that were correlated with a reduction of parasite density. AMA1 is expressed mainly during the P. falciparum asexual or blood stage, and examination of ama1 sequences from natural P. falciparum infections has shown extreme diversity in this gene. There are up to 62 polymorphic amino acid sites in AMA1, representing more than 15% of the amino acid sites distributed over three domains of the protein [37,69]. The greatest 58 polymorphism is seen in domain I, especially in a cluster of amino acids near a hydrophobic pocket [39] that is thought to play a role in erythrocyte invasion, the cluster 1 loop of domain I (c1L), which includes amino acid residues 196, 197, 199, 200, 201, 204, 206 and 207 [86]. Based on antigenic escape modeling, growth and invasion inhibition assays [42] and molecular epidemiological studies of the impact of AMA1 polymorphism on risk of clinical malaria [37], c1L has been identified as a key target of both strain -specific antibodies and allele -specific naturally acquired protective immune responses. The malaria vaccine AMA1 -C1 is a bivalent vaccine comprised of recombinant AMA1 based on the 3D7 and FVO reference strains of P. falciparum expressed in Pichia pasto ris and adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, developed by the Malaria Vaccine Development Branch of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and tested at the Malaria Research and Training Center a t the University of Bamako in Mali. Phase 1 studies of AMA1 -C1 in Malian adults and child ren showed that it was acceptably safe and tolerable and modestly immunogenic [2,87]. However, as with other vaccine antigens, the high degree of polymorphism observed in this protein [4,36,37,62] and possible strain specificity of the immune response [1] may limit its success as a vaccine candidate. Since failures of AMA1 vaccine s in animal models have been attributed to the diversity of the antigen used in vaccine formulation [5,56], careful measurement of allele -specific efficacy and vaccine selection are important components in assessing the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates in field trials conducted in endemic countries [88]. 59 A Phase 2 clinical trial of AMA1 -C1 vaccine in Malian children showed no impact of vaccination on parasite density or clinical malaria [89]. Even in the absence of measurable overall parasitological or clinical efficacy, it was hypothesized that children who received the AMA1 vaccine might have a decrease d incidence of clinical malaria caused by parasites having AMA1 alleles similar to the vaccine alleles as a consequence of the strain specificity of the immune response. In this scenario, t he low vaccine efficacy might be explained by the vaccine only prov iding protection against parasites with AMA1 haplotypes (based on the immunologically relevant polymorphic amino acid residues in c1L) similar to those of the strains represented in the vaccine formulation. Data and samples collected during this trial we re used to assess whether this bivalent malaria vaccine produced a response that was specific to the vaccine antigens, resulting in selection of alleles differing from the vaccine strain. It was further reasoned that even if selection could not be demonstr ated directly by comparing frequencies of vaccine -type and non -vaccine type AMA1 in vaccinees and controls, these data might provide indirect evidence for allele -specific immunity elicited by the vaccine. 3. Methods Overall study design Samples used in thi s study were collected during a double -blind, controlled, Phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of the AMA1 -C1 malaria vaccine conducted in Bancoumana, Mali from 2006 to 2007. The main objective of the study was to compare the protection induced by a bi valent 60 AMA1 vaccine composed of 3D7 and FVO strains control (Hiberix \u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK). Details on the methods and overall results of the trial are described elsewhere [2,89]. Briefly, 300 children aged from 2 to 3 years inclusive, were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to the vaccine or control group. Two doses of vaccine were given to participant s at 28 day intervals. Immunized children were followed for up t o 52 weeks. Follow -up for vaccine efficacy started 14 days after the last immunization (day 42) and extended to Day 156. Procedures included monthly clinical examination and malaria smears, and blood collection on filter paper for malaria parasite typing. Those presenting with clinical symptoms outside scheduled visits also had malaria smears and blood collected on filter paper for malaria parasite typing. Site and sample collection Samples were collected at the Malaria Research and Training Center resear ch clinic in Bancoumana, a rural village 60 km southwest of Bamako in Mali, West Africa. The health district of Bancoumana has a population of approximately 22,000 inhabitants. Malaria transmission is hyper -endemic and seasonal (June -November) , with peak t ransmission in October. The blood collection procedure onto filter paper was performed as described by Duan et al [68]. The study was approved by institutional review boards of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Dentistry of the University of Bamako and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of study participants prior to inclusion in the study. Three hundred blood sample filter papers were collected the first day of vaccination and served as a baseline time point in this study. In 61 addition, 504 infections, as determined by thick smear microscopy, were collected after vaccination was complete (day 42 to day 156). Finally, 2 91 thick smear -negative samples from the same period of observation were randomly selected from the study database (Figure 1) in the hope of capturing episodes of sub -patent parasitemia . DNA extraction Malaria parasite DNA was extracted using the QiaAmp 9 6 DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ama1 gene amplification and sequencing A nested PCR was used to amplify the entire ectodomain coding sequence of ama1 (1861 bp), using primers designed by Duan et al [68]. Briefly, a nested PCR was performed using primers F2 (tcaaattaatgtacttgtta) and R8 (ttttagcataaaagagaagc) with the following cycling conditions: initial DNA denaturation at 94 oC for 2 min, followed by 38 cycle s of denaturation at 94 oC for 20 sec; primer annealing at 52 oC for 10 sec, and extension at 60 oC for 3 min. A final extension was conducted at 60oC for 5 min. PCR products from the first amplification were used as the template for a second round of ampl ification with primers n1 (atgagaaaattatactgcgt) and n2 (tgattatatcagacgttgaa). Amplification exactly the same as in the primary amplification , only with 30 cycles instead of 38. Each primary PCR reaction contained a total volume of 27 l with 22.5 l of Platinum super mix in 96 -well plates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1 l of each primer and 2.5 l of malaria parasite DNA. The secondary PCR used 45 l of Platinum Mix, 1 l of each primer and 5 l of primary PCR product. PCR products were 62 electrophoresed on a high -throughput pre -cast gel system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) then visualized and photographed under ultraviolet light . Amplified products were purified using Exo - SAP-it (US Biomedical, Cleveland, Ohio). Purified products were sequenced using primers described by Duan et al. [30] on an ABI 3730XL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster CA). Sequences were deposited in GenBank [GenBank HM562354 -HM562668 ]. Sequence alignment, statistical and genetic analysis DNA sequences wer e anal ysed using Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes Corporation, MI). A sequence was considered to be from a multiple -allele infection when the secondary peak height was 50% or more of the primary peak height at any polymorphic site. Analyses were initial ly performed on the 1206 bp region covering domain 1 to domain 3 [30] and then limited to cluster one and one loop (c1L) , as described by Dutta et al based on antigenic escape residues [42]. Reference sequences were strains [GenBank AF277003 ]. Because haplotypes could not be determined fo r multiple -allele infections, only sequences classified as corresponding to single or predominant infections with secondary peak height less than 50% of the primary peak at polymorphic codons were used for this analysis. Parasite population genetic param eters were estimated using MEGA 4.50.3 [90] and software. The parameters of interest included: nucleotide diversity (), which is a measure of the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences chosen randomly from the sampled population; haplotype diversity (Hd), measuring the probability of randomly choosing two individuals bearing different haplotypes; the average 63 number of nucleotide differences (k); the number of net nucleotide (D a); the average number of nucleotide substitutions per si te (D xy); the average number of nucleotide differences (k); and Tajima's test, which estimates departures from neutrality by comparing an estimate of the number of segregating sites to the average number of mutations between pairs in the sample. Groups of sequences were also compared by assessing changes in allele frequencies and DNA divergence between populations. In addition, vaccine and control groups were compared before and after vaccination (Figure 2) with the reference sequences 3D7 and FVO to assess any change in the sequence distribution after vaccination. AMA1 haplotypes were assigned to haplotype groups (or subpopulations) using Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE software [91] . The model conditions have been described previously [92], and consisted of running te n runs of 50,000 burn -ins and 100,000 iterations were performed for K=1 to 10 using admixture models. A clinical malaria episode was defined as having an axillary temperature > 37.5 oC and a parasitemia greater than or equal to 2,500 asexual P. falciparu m parasites per mm3 [93]. SAS 9.1.3 statistical software (Cary, NC) was used to assess the time to first clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 or FVO c1L haplotype as defined by Dutta [42] and Takala [69]. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the associati on between study group and risk of a clinical episode with parasites having an AMA1 -c1L haplotype identical to 3D7 or FVO. Chi-square tests were used to compare the frequency of c1L haplotypes in the two treatment arms. 64 4. Results Measures of selection and allele -specific efficacy Of 1,091 samples subjected ama1 , 510 were PCR of these yielded full ama1 sequences ( Figure 4.1). Of these, 315 were classified as single/predominant allele infections and were included in th e haplotype analysis while 138 classified as multiple -allele infections were excluded from haplotype analyses. Table 4.1 shows the number of ama1 haplotypes in each treatment group at baseline and during the efficacy observation period. Among 315 ama1 sequences, 186 unique amino acid haplotypes were identified with haplotype prevalences ranging from 0.3% to 2.54% , confirming the extreme diversity in AMA1 found at another site in Mali [69]. Based on the entire set of polymorphic sites within the AM A1 ectodomain (domains I, II and III), there were eight infections with an AMA1 haplotype identical to 3D7 among the 315 analysed, all of which were detected in samples from the post -immunization efficacy observation period; there were no 3D7 -identical seq uences in infections detected among the 44 samples collected at baseline, before immunization. No AMA1 sequences exactly matched the haplotype of the vaccine strain FVO. Of the eight 3D7 -type sequences detected during the post -vaccination efficacy observat ion period, 5/142 (frequency of 3.5%) were in the AMA1 malaria vaccine group and 3/129 (frequency of 2.3%) were in the control group with a Fisher's exact p -value of 0.72 . Thus , there was no suggestion that allele -specific vaccine selection resulted in a d ecreased frequency of infections harboring parasites with 3D7 -type alleles with respect to the whole AMA1 ectodomain. Based only on the c1L haplotype, 14.3% of sequences matched the 3D7 vaccine strain while 4.8% matched FVO, similar to the higher prevale nce of 3D7 -type AMA1 -c1L at another vaccine testing site in Mali [69]. While there was a slightly higher proportion of both 3D7 and FVO -type AMA1 -c1L haplotypes in the control group at baseline before vaccines were administered, this difference was not significant, and there were no significant differences in the proportions of 3D7 and FVO c1L haplotypes when comparing pre -immunization to post -immunization P. falciparum clinical episodes ( Table 4.2) and infections ( Figure 4.2) in either the malaria vaccine or control groups. Haplotype diversity before and after immunization. To assess whether immunization with AMA1 -C1 resulted in decreased ama1 diversity, ama1 sequences from infections present before immunization were compared to those occurring af ter immunization. The hypothesis was that if vaccination reduced the risk of infection caused by parasites with AMA1 similar to the vaccine strains, the AMA1 haplotype frequency of infecting strains would be reduced, as measured by reduced diversity parame ters in the malaria vaccine group compared to controls following immunization. Immunization with the AMA1 -C1 vaccine had no effect on various measures of genetic diversity. At baseline the two groups were comparable, with 21 haplotypes among 21 infection s in the vaccine group and 22 haplotypes among 23 infections in the control group, and with similar values of Hd and in both groups ( Table 4.1). The average number of nucleotide 66 differences between the two groups at baseline was 20.805, while the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site between the two groups (D xy) was 0.0172 , and the net nucleotide substitutions between groups (D a) was 0.0003 ( Table 4.3). When comparing all post - immunization infections in the vaccine and control groups, haplot ype and nucleotide diversity were again very similar ( Table 4.1). Malaria vaccine group and control group sequences were also virtually identical with respect to the number of net nucleotide substitutions per site after vaccination with a Da value of -0.00002. Moreover, comparing baseline sequences to post - vaccination sequences within the malaria vaccine and control groups, genetic diversity parameters (Hd, , D a and k) were also similar ( Table 4.3). These analyses do not provide evidence of a reduction in ama1 diversity due to the malaria vaccine during the follow -up period. Divergence from vaccine strains . Ama1 sequences from the vaccine and control groups were compared to the vaccine strains 3D7 and FVO to assess whether infections experienced by indiv iduals receiving the malaria vaccine had sequences that were more divergent from the vaccine strain sequences than those in the control group. All measures of genetic differentiation indicated that immunization with AMA1 -C1 had no impact on genetic diverge nce from the vaccine strains. Both at baseline and following immunization, the vaccine and control group sequences were similarly divergent from FVO and 3D7 based on K, D xy and D a, suggesting that the vaccine did not increase divergence from the vaccine st rains ( Table 4.3). Additional analyses were performed based only on the polymorphic amino acids in cluster 1 of domain I of AMA1 [79] which includes the cluster one loop, to determine whether evidence of 67 selec tion or reduced diversity would emerge when focusing only on those polymorphisms thought to be most relevant to allele -specific antibody responses [42] and to acquired clinical immunity [69]. Both at baseline and following immunization , ama1 cluster 1 sequences , which includes conserved regions as well as the polym orphic positions ranging from amino acids positions 187 to 230 , were similar in the AMA1 vaccine and control groups: at baseline, nucleotide divergence of ama1 cluster 1 sequences compared to 3D7 cluster 1 sequence were 0.05374 and 0.0467 for the malaria v accine and control groups respectively. In infections occurring after immunization, cluster 1 divergence from 3D7 was 0.066 in the AMA1 vaccine group and 0.0530 in control group, respectively , with p > 0.1, thus supporting a lack of vaccine selection or al lele-specific efficacy. A similar lack of increased divergence from FVO in cluster 1 was observed : nucleotide divergence was 0.0018 in the AMA1 vaccine group and 0.0035 in the control group before immunization , compared to 0.0013 and 0.0022 in the AMA1 and control group , respectively, following immunization. The similarity of c1L haplotype distribution in the two treatment arms was further supported when the incidence of infection by haplotype was compared ( Table 4.2). Although there was a lower incidence of clinical malaria caused by 3D7 -type AMA1 -c1L in the malaria vaccine group (18.6%) compared to the control group (30.8%) following immunization, this reduced frequency did not achieve statistical significance, and there was no suggestion of decreased ri sk of clinical malaria caused by FVO -type AMA -1 c1L in the malaria vaccine group. 68 Structure analysis . Based on results from the incidence study conducted in this site before this vaccine trial [92], we used k= 6 (Figure 4.3) as the number of groups in the structure analysis. The distribution of sequences in each group is shown in Figure 4.4 and was used to compute a Chi- square test. The test was not significant when the six groups of sequences defined using clustering analysis are compared as follows: malaria vaccine vs. control group sequences at baseline (p= 0.81); control group sequences at baseline vs. after immunization (p=0.19); malaria vaccine group sequences at baseline vs. after immunization (p=0.67); an d malaria vaccine group sequences after immunization vs. control group sequences after immunization (p=0.10). Time to first clinical malaria episode with vaccine -type parasites The time to disease with 3D7 and FVO c1L haplotype was also measured . Indivi duals experienced their first clinical episodes between 6 to 154 days post -immunization (mean 79.2 days). Survival curves ( Figure 4.5A, 4.5B) showed no difference between the two groups in time to clinical infection with a 3D7 or FVO c1L haplotype. The occ urrence of AMA1 3D7 -type clinical episodes in the two treatment arms was identical both at the beginning (log rank test p - value= 0.88) and at the end of the follow -up period (Wilcoxon test p -value= 0.73). A similar observation was made when the strain unde r consideration was FVO (Log rank p -value= 0.56 and Wilcoxon p -value= 0.19). A Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to model the time to first clinical malaria episode with a c1L haplotype exactly matching the 3D7 or FVO strain as a function o f study group. Hazard ratios obtained from the model and vaccine allele -specific efficacy are shown in 69 Table 4.4. The hazard ratio for clinical illness caused by parasites with 3D7 -type AMA1 -c1L was 1.06 with a 95% (CI) of 0.48 -2.32. Fo r FVO , the hazard ratio was 1.34 with a 95% CI of 0.50 -3.62. These results support the conclusion that the AMA1 vaccine and control groups had similar risks of having clinical malaria episodes with parasites similar to the vaccine strains with respect to i mmunologically important polymorphic amino acid residues. 5. Discussion The extensive genetic diversity that is maintained in malaria vaccine candidate antigens through balancing selection applied by host immunity may hamper the development of effective ma laria vaccines, especially those targeting highly polymorphic blood stage antigens such as AMA1 [88,94]. Molecular epidemiological studies can suggest which antigen variants might best be included in vaccines ba sed on their prevalence in natural populations [69], and molecular epidemiological, population genetics [92] and in vitro invasion inhibition studies [42,57,95] all provide clues about which variants might offer the most cross -protection in multivalent vaccine formulations. However, only field trials of vaccine efficacy against diverse parasites can provide definitive evidence of cross -protection or the lack th ereof. Here , results are reported of analyses of allele -specific efficacy of AMA1 -C1, a bivalent AMA1 vaccine that was designed to overcome allelic diversity in this extremely polymorphic antigen by including two allelic variants of the target antigen. AMA 1-C1 is the first AMA1 vaccine to be evaluated in a field trial measuring efficacy against malaria in a natural setting. 70 The AMA1 sequences included in AMA 1-C1 are derived from the P. falciparum strains 3D7 and FVO. These sequences were chosen based on t he availability of these two well -characterized culture -adapted strains with divergent sequences, without knowledge of the baseline distribution of the corresponding AMA haplotypes in the natural parasite populations where the vaccine would be tested and e ventually deployed. The results of this study show that, based on polymorphisms in the entire AMA1 ectodomain, fewer than 3% of AMA1 sequences examined from samples collected at the vaccine trial site had haplotypes matching 3D7 while none had the FVO hapl otypes; very similar results were found at another vaccine testing site in Mali [37]. Thus a possible explanation for the failure of AMA1 -C1 to demonstrate protection in a Phase 2 trial in 300 Malian children was that allele -specific immune responses induced by the vaccine, even if hi ghly effective against parasites carrying homologous forms of AMA1 (either with respect to the whole AMA1 ectodomain or some subset of immunologically important epitopes such as c1L on domain I), were not broadly cross -protective enough to result in measur able efficacy against parasitemia [96]. If an insufficiently broad immune response explained the lack of overall efficacy, allele -specific vaccine -induced immune responses should still have been directed against the fraction of parasites with partial or full homology to 3D7 and FVO AMA1, leading to a reduction in the frequency of these alleles following immunization. The results of this study provide evidence that insufficient coverage of AMA1 diversity does no t explain the lack of vaccine efficacy. Several measures of genetic diversity showed no impact of the vaccine on the diversity of AMA1 alleles in infections experienced by vaccine recipients compared to baseline or to infections in the control group. Moreo ver, no significant association 71 was seen between vaccination and the risk of clinical malaria episodes caused by parasites with AMA1 similar to the vaccine strain with respect to immunologically dominant regions of the AMA1 protein. There was a non -signifi cant ~1.6 -fold lower incidence of clinical malaria caused by parasites with AMA1 -c1L haplotypes corresponding to 3D7 following immunization with AMA1 -C1 than with a control vaccine ( Table 4.4). However, this hint of possible selection is at odds with the o bservation of increases in the frequency of 3D7 -type c1L in both treatment groups during the post -immunization observation period, and the lack of any suggestion of reduced risk of clinical episodes caused by parasites with FVO -type AMA1 -c1L in the vaccine group. It is more likely that AMA -c1 vaccine failed to protect due to insufficient immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. For this reason, a new formulation of AMA1 -c1 that includes the toll -like receptor agonist CPG 7909 has been developed and test ed in Phase 1 trials, which show an approximately 12 -14-fold increase in post -immunization antibody levels compared to the formulation without this additional adjuvant in malaria na\u00efve populations, and a 2.5 -3-fold increase in antibody levels in malaria ex posed adults [96-98]. A monovalent AMA1 vaccine based on the 3D7 strain and formulated with the AS02 A adjuvant system has also shown strong and sustained antibody responses in Malian adults [3] and children [99]. Results of a Phase 2 safety and efficacy study of this vaccine will be available soon and may allow ascertainment of an allele -specific effect of an AMA1 -based mala ria vaccine. 72 Limitations of this study include the possibility that there was insufficient statistical power to detect a subtle degree of allele -specific efficacy. P. falciparum infections with AMA1 corresponding to the 3D7 strain with respect to the ent ire ectodomain represented only 3% of all the haplotypes present at the vaccine trial site at the start of the study. Furthermore, only single or predominant AMA1 sequences could be used to define haplotypes and for population genetic analyses, also contri buting to reduced statistical power to detect differences between the malaria vaccine and control groups. To detect a 50% reduction in the frequency of full AMA1 haplotypes by the vaccine, 1,534 unique or predominant AMA1 sequences would have been required to have 80% power with significance at 5%. Statistical power is increased by examining only haplotypes based on the eight polymorphic amino acid positions within the putatively immunologically important region of AMA1, c1L of domain I to detect a similar effect, 586 unique or predominant c1L haplotypes would be required, demonstrating the challenges of measuring allele -specific efficacy for vaccines based on uncommon antigenic variants . However, the conclusion that the vaccine had no effect on the distribu tion of AMA1 haplotypes is supported by the near -uniformity of several measures of genetic diversity and divergence from the vaccine strains. 6. Conclusion In this Phase 2 trial of the bivalent blood stage malaria vaccine AMA1 -C1 in Malian children, no evidence was found of allele -specific efficacy. AMA1 sequences in infections occurring in the vaccine and control groups were remarkably similar before and after immunization when examined using several complementary statistical and population genetics methods . These 73 results strongly suggest that the AMA1 -C1 vaccine failed not due to inability to overcome extensive genetic diversity in AMA1, but for another reason, most likely an insufficiently immunogenic vaccine formulation. Two second generation AMA1 vaccine s with more immunogenic adjuvant systems are being evaluated in field trials in Mali. Results of these trials should provide evidence on which to base decisions about whether or not further development of AMA1 -based vaccines is warranted, and to guide opti mal choices of AMA1 haplotypes to include in a multivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine. 74 7.

Molecular Basis of Strain -Specific Efficacy of a Blood -Stage Malaria Vaccine: Vaccine Development Implications .2 2 Ouattara A. et al. Submitted for publication to PLOS Genetics March 2012 84 1. Abstract The disappointing efficac y of blood -stage malaria vaccines to date may be explained in part by allele -specific immune responses that are directed against variant epitopes on highly polymorphic blood -stage antigens. FMP2.1/AS02 A, a monovalent blood -stage candidate vaccine based on apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) from the 3D7 allele of Plasmodium falciparum , had marginal overall efficacy but high allele -specific efficacy against clinical malaria in a recent Phase 2 trial in Malian children. We used molecular epidemiology methods to assess the cross - protective efficacy of the malaria vaccine and to infer which polymorphic amino acid positions in AMA1 were the targets of protective allele -specific immune responses. These analyses suggest that FMP2.1/AS02 A had the highest efficacy again st AMA1 alleles identical to the 3D7 vaccine -type allele at eight highly polymorphic codons in the cluster 1 loop (c1L) of Domain 1, but which differed from 3D7 elsewhere in the molecule. Comparison of the incidence of vaccine - type alleles before and after vaccination in the malaria vaccine and control groups and examination of the patterns of allele change at these polymorphic codons in consecutive malaria episodes suggest that the highly polymorphic codon 197 in c1L was the most critical determinant of allele-specific vaccine efficacy. These results indicate that a multivalent AMA1 vaccine with broad efficacy could include only a limited set of key alleles of this extremely polymorphic antigen. Author summary Scaled -up diagnosis and treatment and the use of insecticide -impregnated nets have reduced the malaria disease burden in many areas, but malaria elimination will require more effective tools 85 for interrupting transmission. Vaccination is the control measure that has had the greatest impact on past dise ase control, elimination and eradication efforts. However, malaria parasites are highly diverse and vaccines may only protect against parasites that are similar to those on which the vaccine is based. We assessed the ability of the partially -effective cand idate blood -stage malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02 A to prevent malaria caused by different parasite strains and found that the protection induced by the vaccine was mainly directed against those similar to the strain variant at key amino acid positions in the v accine antigen. This information may aid the design of a more broadly cross -protective multivalent blood -stage malaria vaccine. 2. Introduction Antigenic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum blood -stage surface antigens may pose a major obstacle to the develop ment of an effective malaria vaccine [56,88]. P. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is considered a promising vaccine candidate [95], but in vitro [42,100] and molecular epidemiological studies [56,101] suggest that extreme polymorphism in AMA1 may limit its efficacy as a vaccine antigen. The extracellular domain of AMA1 is divided into three sub -domains based on the pattern of disulfide bonds [102]. The preponderance of the polymorphism in AMA1 is located in Domain 1, where 32 polymorphic codons reside. Domain 2 has 11 polymorphic codons and Domain 3 con tains nine [37]. The remainin g polymorphic codons are in the pro -sequence region (nine) and the cytosolic region (three). Domain 1 is divided into three clusters (clusters 1, 2 and 3) based on amino acid spatial proximity [39], and the most polymorphic region of AMA1 is a loop within cluster 1 (the cluster 1 l oop, c1L) 86 containing eight highly polymorphic codons that encode as many as six different amino acids at position 197, and four amino acids each at positions 200 and 201 ( Figure 4.6). Allelic exchange experiments [42,52], in vitro analysis of amino acid relevance [46,103,104] and molecular epidemiology studies [43] identified polymorphic amino acids in c1L (residues 196, 197, 199, 200, 201, 204, 206 and 207) as being the main targets of naturally -acquired protective antibodies. It was therefore hypothesized that these amino acids could be important in determining allele -specific efficacy in clinical trials of AMA1 -based malar ia vaccines. Using 473 P. falciparum AMA1 sequences collected from a single vaccine trial site we recently demonstrated allele -specific efficacy of an AMA1 vaccine in a Phase 2 trial conducted in Malian children [105] . FMP2.1/AS02 A, developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), is a monovalent blood -stage vaccine based on AMA1 sequence corresponding to that of the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum , formulated with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' Adjuv ant System AS02 A. In this trial the vaccine did not provide significant protection against clinical malaria episodes during the first post -vaccination malaria season based on the primary endpoint, and it had approximately 20% efficacy against first and mul tiple episodes of clinical malaria in secondary analyses using a range of definitions of clinical malaria, with varying statistical significance. However, protective efficacy against clinical malaria episodes with AMA1 c1L alleles identical to allele -specific efficacy trial provided the first evidence of allele -specific vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria. 87 A Phase 2 trial of a different, b ivalent vaccine containing two versions of AMA1 based on sequences derived from the 3D7 and FVO strains of P. falciparum , adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, showed neither overall nor allele -specific efficacy, nor evidence of vaccine selection of non -vaccine alleles [106]. An underpowered earlier trial of a vaccine comprised of three blood -stage antigens showed neither overall nor allele -specific efficacy, failing to protect against clinical malaria, but some ev idence of selection favoring non -vaccine alleles of one of the antigens was detected [107]. The leading pre -erythrocytic vaccine RTS,S/AS01, which is based on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP ) of P. falciparum , has shown about 50% overall efficacy against clinical malaria, but thus far no allele -specific efficacy has been reported based on epitopes RTS,S/AS01 based on sequencing the repeat region of CSP thought to be the target of protective antibodies has not been yet assessed, although methods employing next -generation sequencing technologies are being developed with this goal in mind [109]. The analyses reported here were designed to understand which AMA1 alleles contributed to the observed allele -specific efficacy of the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine. We previously found that sera from Malian adults vaccinated with FMP2.1/AS02 A inhibited parasite growth in a non -allele - specific fashion [3], and in the Phase 2 trial the vaccine reduced cumulative parasite density [105]. These results leave open the possibility that this AMA1 vaccine could offer some degree of cross -protection against parasites with genetically diverse forms of AMA1. Here we present the results of exploratory analyses designed to a ssess systematically the degree of cross - protective efficacy provided by FMP2.1/AS02 A against clinical malaria with diverse AMA1 88 alleles, with the ultimate goal of informing development of an AMA1 malaria vaccine that offers broad cross -protective efficacy . 3. Results Sequences used in this analysis have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers JQ812138 to JQ812610 . Overall, 600 ama1 gene sequences were obtained from both clinical malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections during the first six mon ths of follow -up. Single and/or predominant infections defined as sequences with a secondary electropherogram peak height less than 50% of the primary peak height at polymorphic codons represented almost 79% of these sequences (473/600 sequences). Among th e single and/or predominant sequences (473), 221 were observed in the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine group and 252 in the rabies group. The proportion of multiple allele infections, defined based on chromatogram peaks was similarly distributed in the two vaccine gro ups. The frequency of c1L haplotypes among clinical malaria episodes ranged from 0.21% for alleles observed only once to 13.5% allele Allele -specific efficacy. The cross-protective efficacy of the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine against clinical malaria due to heterologous alleles was measured by comparing the hazard of the first clinical malaria episode with various AMA1 c1L alleles in the two vaccine groups. Alleles were defined based on polymorphic codons in c1L. For this analysis we measured vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria with AMA1 alleles corresponding to the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum (the allele in the malaria vaccine), and with alleles corresponding to the Fab9, DD2, M5 and FVO strains, which represent the most common alleles found in clinical malaria episodes during the 89 study. Table 4.5 shows estimates of vaccine efficacy along with the incidence of clinical malaria episodes observed for each allele group. The incidence of clinical malaria with the Fab9 allele, which differed from 3D7 by only one amino acid, at position 197, was comparable to the incidence of 3D7 -type clinical episodes. However, the vaccine did not have significant efficacy against the Fab9 AMA1 c1L allele (vaccine efficacy, 1%; 95% CI, 0.45 - 2.17). Analyses targeting the three remaining alleles had similar results. These analyses indicate that the vaccine showed no cross -protective efficacy against alleles with c1L sequences that were not fully identical to the vaccine 3D7 allele. To determine whether the malaria vac cine had activity against clinical malaria episodes based on the number of amino acid differences when c1L sequences were compared with those of the malaria vaccine allele, we grouped non -3D7 alleles into those with low (five to eight amino acid difference s), medium (three to four differences), and high (one to two differences) degrees of similarity to 3D7 based on c1L amino acid composition. Alleles identified using these groupings were used to assess the time to a first clinical malaria episode in the two vaccine groups. The time to the first clinical malaria episode with any of these allele groups was comparable in the two vaccine groups, and neither vaccine was associated with a reduction of the risk of clinical malaria episodes with any of the allele gr oups ( Table 4.5). Finally, to confirm a lack of cross -protective efficacy, we estimated vaccine efficacy against any non-3D7 c1L alleles. The time to a clinical malaria episode with any non -3D7 c1L allele was comparable in the two vaccine groups (p=0.62) and no vaccine efficacy was observed (hazard 90 ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.69 -1.25) (Table 4.5). Thus, the malaria vaccine did not prevent clinical episodes with non -3D7 c1L alleles. Based on the incidence of the 3D7 AMA1 c1L allele, we estimated that children w ho received the rabies vaccine were at increased risk of having a clinical malaria episode with the 3D7 AMA1 c1L allele compared to those who received (relative risk=2.61; 95% CI: 1.07 -6.37) . Vaccine -induced selection. Using the amino acids in c1L to define alleles, we identified incident cases of clinical malaria caused by infections with 3D7 -type c1L alleles in the malaria and rabies vaccine groups. The incidence of clinical malaria episodes associated with the 3D7 c1L allele wa s reduced in the malaria vaccine compared to the rabies vaccine group: 16 episodes with 3D7 -type c1L alleles were seen in the rabies vaccine group while only six were seen in the AMA1 vaccine group (Chi2=4.9, p = 0.027, intention -to-treat analysis) ( Figure 4.7). In a similar analysis using only sequences from clinical malaria episodes occurring after the last vaccination in individuals who received all three doses of vaccine (per -protocol analysis), the reduction of the incidence of 3D7 -type c1L alleles in the malaria vaccine group was even greater (Chi2=5.97, p = 0.015) ( Figure 4.7). In contrast, sequences with the 3D7 c1L allele detected in asymptomatic infections during active surveillance (cross -sectional surveys) were similarly distributed (p=0.3) betwe en the two vaccine groups ( Figure 4.7). These observations suggest that selective pressure induced by the malaria vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of homologous alleles during clinical malaria episodes but not in asymptomatic infections identifi ed by active surveillance. 91 As another approach to assess vaccine selection of non -vaccine -type variants, we grouped alleles based on polymorphic codons in the whole ectodomain and compared the prevalence of vaccine - type alleles in clinical malaria episod es in the malaria vaccine and rabies vaccine groups. Alleles were grouped using a clustering algorithm implemented in Structure software version 2.3.3 [91] and the distribution of each group of alleles was then compared in the two vaccine groups. Such population structure clustering algorithms are designed for application to data from unli nked, neutral loci, so application to linked polymorphisms within a gene under balancing selection likely violates the assumptions of the underlying models, potentially resulting in spurious population inferences [91]. With these limitations in mind, we used the algorithm to categorize haplotypes into groups with similar AMA1 amino acid se quences. Figure 4.S1 shows the clustering of study sequences. The frequency of alleles within the 3D7 haplotype group was significantly lower in malaria vaccine group compared to the rabies vaccine group (7.5% vs. 16.5%) ( p = 0.014), consistent with select ion by the AMA1 vaccine. In contrast, allele from the Fab9, Dd2, M5 and FVO haplotype groups had similar distribution in the two vaccine groups. Identifying important amino acids. To identify specific amino acid positions targeted by vaccine -induced immu ne responses, we explored the amino acid composition across the whole ectodomain of sequences identified through study day 240. This analysis showed that only five sequences exactly matched the 3D7 allele at all polymorphic codons. Six of the 22 sequences with c1L amino acids matching 3D7 corresponded to P. falciparum strain PC26 based on the whole ectodomain sequence, three matched the sequence of the S35 strain, and eight were of other types ( Figure 4.S2). This variation outside of c1L suggests that polym orphic residues 92 located outside c1L may not play an important role in recognition by inhibitory antibodies. Moreover, to investigate whether polymorphic codons in domains 2 and 3 were targets of protective vaccine immune responses in the initial follow -up period (day 0 to 240), we used residues that differentiate 3D7 and FVO in domain 2 (positions 308, 330, 332, 404 [3D7: QPIT and FVO: ESNR]) and identif ied by these two methods were then used to model the time to a clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 allele. Participants who received the malaria vaccine had survival times comparable to those who received the rabies vaccine. The Kaplan - Meier survival curve of the cumulative probability of having a clinical malaria episode with the 3D7 allele in children who received the malaria vaccine was identical to those who received the rabies vaccine (domain 2: long rank test Chi2=2.67, p = 0.10; domain 3: log rank te st Chi2=1.16, p = 0.28). Moreover, we observed no difference in vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria between the two vaccine groups ( Table 4.5). To identify specific codons driving allele -specific immunity, we assessed whether the incidence of polym orphic codons in ama1 was equally distributed in the two vaccine groups before and after vaccination. The hypothesis was that the incidence of clinical episodes with vaccine -type alleles would decrease following vaccination in the malaria vaccine group com pared to the rabies group. This was done by analyzing the distribution of vaccine -type alleles at each individual amino acid position in sequences collected from clinical malaria episodes occurring in the malaria vaccine and rabies vaccine groups during an d up to two weeks after the vaccination period (days 0 to 74, with vaccinations occurring on days 0, 30 and 60), and during the period 93 starting two weeks after vaccination was completed (days 75 to 240) ( Figure 4.8), accounting for multiple comparisons. Th e relative risk ratio (RRR) of the incidence of vaccine -type amino acids at a given position showed that vaccine -type amino acids at position 175, 187, 172, 197 and 332, were less frequent in the malaria vaccine group compared to the rabies vaccine group (Figure 4.9A) following vaccination . In contrast, the incidences of vaccine -type amino acids at the rest of the codons were similarly distributed in the two vaccine groups before and after vaccination (Figure 4.S3). In further support of the relevance of key specific amino acids, an analysis of the shift from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type alleles in consecutive malaria episodes revealed that the incidence of alleles that changed from a 3D7 -type to non -3D7-type was higher in the malaria vaccine group com pared to the rabies control group in sequences identified from days 75 -240 for three codons, 197, 435 and 485 ( Figure 4.9B). Finally, we used a linear regression model to assess which amino acids taken individually were associated with antigenic distance from the vaccine allele (obtained by comparing each AMA1 whole ectodomain sequence to the vaccine strain 3D7 sequence). After correcting for multiple comparisons, amino acids at positions 167, 187, 197, 225, 330, and 503 were identified as being positivel y associated with antigenic distance in this analysis (p=0.001 adjusting for multiple comparisons). 94 Interestingly, codon 197 was identified as the most important codon for characterizing AMA1 allelic identity by all three methods of analysis used to asse ss the role of specific amino acids. We used the amino acid at this position as a surrogate for allele definition to assess the time to the first clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 allele. The allele -specific efficacy data using only codon 197 as a proxy for allele definition revealed identical vaccine efficacy to that for the whole c1L against five known alleles ( Table 4.5) suggesting that codon 197 may be the driving force of allele -specific efficacy in c1L. This was confirmed by an analysis of the amino acid composition at position 197 in the whole sequence dataset. Among the 406 single or predominant sequences used in this analysis, we identified 49 sequences with c1L amino acids exactly matching the eight amino acids of 3D7 (DERHFDKY). In all of these sequences, when the amino acid at position 197 is a glutamate (E) the remaining codons were, by definition, 3D7 -type. However, the same observation did not hold when any of the remaining codons were used to define 3D7 allele. Therefore, the 3D7 allele can be defined solely on the amino acid at position 197 in this dataset. This observation indicates that, within this dataset, amino acid 197 can be used as a surrogate marker for codon identity of c1L. Therefore, instead of defining AMA1 alleles based on c1L, it may be possible to use the amino acid at position 197 to reduce the number of alleles that would need to be considered in vaccine design. 4. Discussion Measuring vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous alleles and identifying the relevant a mino acids driving allele -specific immunity are important steps in the design of malaria vaccines that target polymorphic antigens. The solving of the AMA1 protein crystal structure 95 [39] has allowed identification of immunologically important amino acid residues in this malaria vaccine antigen using both in vitro [42] and in vivo approaches [69]. In particular, new molecular epidemiological tools and approaches have the potential to inform the choice of antigenic variants to include in multivalent, broadly efficacious vaccines [88], and these tools can be used to assess the impact of malaria vaccines on the frequency of alleles observed in fie ld trials and to identify amino acids that are the targets of immune responses [105]. The findings that a monovalent AMA1 vaccine was efficacious only against homologous alleles in a human vaccine trial confirm ed earlier observations from in vitro [100] and animal studies [1,56] suggesting that AMA1 generates allele -specific immune responses. The observed patterns of natural acquisition of allele -specific immunity to AMA1 are consistent with a gradual accumulation of protective responses to a repertoire of AMA1 variants by people repeatedly exposed to malaria over years [110]. However, protective immunity to malaria is compl ex and poorly understood, and it is likely necessary to be exposed to many diverse variants of numerous polymorphic P. falciparum antigens to build up the truly \"protective\" repertoire of immune responses that allows older children and adults to escape cli nical disease after years of continuous exposure. In contrast to a bivalent AMA1 vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide that showed no overall efficacy nor any suggestion of efficacy against clinical malaria with homologous AMA1 alleles or any select ion of non -vaccine alleles [106] , the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was highly efficacious against clinical malaria with vaccine -type AMA1 c1L. The mean antibody responses 96 to FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine were much higher and mo re sustained compared to antibody responses to the bivalent AMA1 vaccine, suggesting that the latter vaccine failed simply because it was not immunogenic enough. In secondary analyses, the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was shown to have about 20% efficacy against a ll clinical malaria episodes [105] , with varying statistical significance. This marginal overall efficacy may represent the vaccine having an effect exclusively directed against vaccine -type and closely related alleles with respect to the cluster of highly polymorphic amino acids located near the putative invasion binding site in Domain 1 of AMA1, particularly those with a glutamate at amino acid position 197. The consistency of our findings using several differ ent methods of analysis is strongly supportive of allele -specific efficacy of the malaria vaccine, defining the \"allele\" on potentially as few as this one extremely polymorphic amino acid. The allele -specific efficacy of the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was conf irmed by an analysis of the incidence of the c1L allele in clinical episodes before and after vaccination, which revealed a decreased incidence of 3D7 AMA1 c1L alleles in the malaria vaccine group compared to the rabies group following vaccination. With 3D 7 representing 13.5% of c1L alleles, an overall efficacy of approximately 20% against clinical malaria episodes suggests that there may be other AMA1 codons outside of c1L that are targeted by protective antibodies. As suggested by Dutta et al. [100] our a nalysis supports the notion that codons in Domain 2 and Domain 3 may also play some role in anti -AMA1 immunity. Due to the small number of clinical malaria episodes in our study with alleles defined based on these codons it was not possible to assess allel e-specific efficacy against individual alleles of Domain 2. 97 The finding that this malaria vaccine was efficacious only against clinical malaria with AMA1 alleles homologous to the vaccine allele in c1L points to the need for a multi -allele vaccine. Altho ugh a multivalent vaccine including all unique AMA1 alleles would be practically impossible, using molecular epidemiology approaches it may be possible to group sequences that are closely related and/or to identify amino acids that play a fundamental role in allele -specific efficacy. Representative alleles that cover a large proportion of the population may be selected and used as vaccine antigens, as has been done for a successful multivalent pneumococcal vaccine [111]. Focusing on representative alleles may reduce the number of alleles to a number that can feasibly be managed by vaccine developers. A multivalent vaccine that comprises ten of the most prevalent alleles may cover more than 70% of alleles identifi ed in the study area (Figure 4.S4). In corroboration of this finding, immunological analyses have been used to assess the allele specificity of the immune response by characterizing antibody responses against variants of AMA1 [104]. These analyses revealed that epitopes within AMA1 of the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum are representative of both D10 and S35 epitopes (which are identical in Domain I but differ in Domains II and III), suggesting that 3D7 may be used t o achieve cross -protection against both D10 and S35 strains in a multivalent malaria vaccine. Even though a barrier blocking clinical episodes with vaccine -type alleles (a sieve effect) [70] was observed at se veral amino acid positions in Domains 1 and 3, the strongest barrier induced by the malaria vaccine was seen at amino acid position 197, which is located in c1L of Domain 1. Alleles defined based on this codon showed vaccine efficacy identical to that for the whole of 98 c1L, suggesting that this position may be the most critical amino acid in antibody binding. Residue 197 forms a hydrogen bond with the light chain of CDR2, a component of the monoclonal growth [112]. by disrupting the antigen/antibody interaction at po sition 197. This observation may explain why this amino acid is encoded by the most polymorphic codon of the whole ama1 gene, with six possible different amino acid residues at this position. Therefore, instead of considering all polymorphic codons of the ama1 gene to define haplotypes, position 197 might be chosen as a surrogate for AMA1 c1L polymorphic codons in this and possibly other study sites. This would limit the number of alleles required to design a multivalent AMA1 -based vaccine to only six, whic h would represent 100% coverage of all alleles with respect to \"alleles\" defined on the basis of AMA1 codon 197. The latest findings that a mixed antigen formulation may produce the same immunological response as sequential infections with the same antig ens [113] further support the feasibility of developing a multivalent AMA1 vaccine, either as a stand -alone blood -stage malaria vaccine, or as a component of a multi -stage, multi -antigen vaccine [114] with higher efficacy than that achieved by the most advanced malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, which is currently being assessed in a large Phase 3 trial in Africa [115] . 5. Materials and Metho ds Overall study design The FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, controlled , Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the AMA1 malaria vaccine 99 FMP2.1/AS02 A versus rabies vaccine in Bandiagara, Mal i [105]. FMP2.1 is a lyophilized preparation of ectodomain of the 3D7 clone of P. falciparum AMA1 designed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, adjuvanted with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' propriet ary adjuvant AS02 A. The antigen is comprised of 478 amino acids, 449 of which are derived from AMA1. Vaccinations were administered in May and June 2007, prior to the onset of the annual July to December rainy season. The study population in Bandiagara com prised two groups of children aged one to six years old. One group (200 children) received the malaria vaccine ( 50 g of FMP2.1 adjuvanted with 0.5 mL of AS02 A) and the control group (200 children) the rabies vaccine. At each cross sectional survey (days 0 , 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240) and each clinic visit with malaria symptoms, children were clinically examined and blood was collected on filter paper for vaccine gene sequencing. A clinical malaria episode was defined as an axillary temperature > 37.5oC and a parasitemia greater than or equal to 2,500 asexual P. falciparum parasites per mm3 of blood [93]. Allele -specific analysis was done by intention -to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP; starting at day 7 4, two weeks after the last vaccination at day 60). Ethical approval for the vaccine trial was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bamako, Mali, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the Walter Reed Army I nstitute of Research, and the U.S. Army Surgeon General. Study site and sample collection Blood samples were collected at the Bandiagara Malaria Project research clinic. Bandiagara is a rural village located in the northeast of Mali. Malaria transmission is seasonal in this village of 13,634 inhabitants, with annual peaks in August or September. Blood collection onto filter paper 100 was performed as previously described [106]. Samples used in this analysis included 400 blood samples collected during participant screening, the days of vaccination and during each cross sectional survey. In addition to these active collections, whenever participants attended the clinic with any malaria related symptoms, blood smears we re collected for malaria diagnosis and parasite genotyping. DNA extraction, ama1 gene amplification and sequencing The QIAamp manufacturer's instructions for the 96 DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) were followed to extract malaria parasite DNA from fi lter paper blood spots. The entire 1861 bp ectodomain coding sequence of the Pfama1 gene was amplified following a previously described nested PCR protocol [106]. Purified products were sequenced as described by Duan et al. [68] using an ABI 3730XL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). Sequences were edited and aligned using 3D7 (Genbank number AF512508) as the reference sequence. Sequencher 4.8 so ftware (Gene Codes Corporation, MI) was used to align and edit DNA sequences. Sequences were defined as collected from single/predominant infections or multiple infections based on the peak height of the electropherogram. Multiple -allele infections were de fined as those with a secondary peak height of 50% or more of the primary peak height at any polymorphic site. 101 Statistical analysis Haplotypes were defined only for single/predominant infections. MEGA 4.50.3 [71] and DNASP 4.50.3 [72] software were used to estimate amino acid differences between the 3D7 ref erence sequence and single/predominant sequences. To assess the cross -protective efficacy of the FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine, SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC) was used to assess the time to the first clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 (DERHFDKY) and non - 3D7 AMA1 c1L haploty pes based on Kaplan -Meier survival curves. To evaluate the cross - protective efficacy of the malaria vaccine, the time to first clinical malaria episode with during the first malaria transmission season (days 0 to 240) was also estimated using a Kaplan -Meier approach. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between vaccine group and risk of a clinical episode with parasites having an AMA1 c1L haplotype identical to 3D7 or any of the aforementioned alleles, and Chi2 tests were used to compare the frequency of c1L haplotypes in the two vaccine groups. To assess whether c1L was the main target of vaccine -induced immune responses, haplo types were defined based on polymorphic codons that discriminate between 3D7 and FVO in Domain 2 (positions 308, 330 332, 404 ) and Domain 3 (positions 439, 451 ). These polymorphic codons were chosen because they were the only polymorphisms that were preval ent enough in the dataset to perform meaningful analysis. Haplotypes defined based on these codon positions were used to estimate the time to first clinical malaria episode with a 3D7 -type haplotype. 102 Furthermore, we grouped sequences into groupings of high , medium and low homology to 3D7 based on the number of codon difference in c1L. These groups were used in a time to the first clinical malaria episode analysis using a Kaplan -Meier approach and a Cox proportional hazards analysis. To estimate the incide nce of malaria clinical episodes with 3D7 alleles defined based on the whole AMA1 ectodomain we used a clustering method applied in Structure 2.3.3 [91] to identify groups of similar haplotypes. The distribution of each group of haplotypes was then compared in the two vaccine groups. Haplotype clustering was conducted as follows. First we used Structurama software version 2.0, [116] which treats the number of populations as a random variable, to determine our posterior number of populations. We identified 13 populations by this Dirichlet process. We then used Structure version 2.3.3 [91] to assign AMA1 sequences to haplotype groups. Ten runs of 50,000 burn -ins and 100,000 iterations were performed for K=13 using an admixture model. Amino acids relevant to vaccine escape were identified by comparing the incidence of vaccine allele codons across all polymorphic sites in the malaria and rabies vaccine groups during and just after the vaccination period (days 0 to day 74, with the last vaccination occurring on day 60) and starting two weeks after the last vaccination (after day 74). Data collected from the two vaccine groups were used to compute the relative risk ratio (RRR) of the incidence of vaccine - type amin o acids at each polymorphic AMA1 position. The RRR was estimated as: 103 Relative risk ratio (vaccine -type amino acid) = (Incidence of amino acid in rabies group after vaccination /Incidence of amino acid in AMA1 group after vaccination)/ (Incidence of amino acid in rabies group during vaccination /Incidence of amino acid in AMA1 group during vaccination) To investigate the shift from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type alleles at individual polymorphic amino acid sites in the two vaccine groups, we compared th e frequency of residues that changed from 3D7 -type to non -3D7-type in consecutive clinical malaria episodes in sequences identified prior to the final vaccine dose to those collected after the final vaccination, with the hypothesis that this frequency woul d increase following vaccination in the malaria vaccine group compared to the rabies group ( Figure 4 .9). Data from the two vaccine groups were used to estimate the relative risk ratio of having a shift from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type amino acids at e ach polymorphic position in AMA1 . The formula used to compute the RRR of amino acid shifts from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type alleles (amino acid dynamics) can be written as: Relative risk ratio (amino acid dynamics) = ((3D7 -type to other -type) in AMA1 group after vaccination / (All changes) in AMA1 group after vaccination)/( (3D7 - type to other -type) in AMA1 group during vaccination /(All changes) in AMA1 group during vaccination) The importance of individual polymorphic positions as indicators of over all AMA1 divergence from the vaccine strain was a ssessed by identifying individual amino acids that were positively 104 associated with antigenic distance between the AMA1 ectodomain sequences they were observed in, and the 3D7 AMA1 sequence. We used a stepwis e linear regression with no intercept to select candidate amino acids at a selection threshold of p = 0.15. Candidate amino acids were used in a linear regression model with the dependent variable being the natural log transformation of amino acid distance when sequences were compared to 3D7 allele while the predictor was individual amino acids [117]. Amino acid s were considered significantly associated to p -distance at p 0.0012 (0.05/42) accounting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method [118], 42 being the number of comparisons made during this analysis (42 polymorphic codons were prevalent enough in the dataset to perform meaningful analysis). 6. Supporting information Figure 4.S1. Clustering of sequences based on the whole apical membrane a ntigen 1 (AMA1) ectodomain in all clinical malaria episodes experienced by children vaccinated with the AMA1 malaria vaccine (A) or rabies control vaccine (R). A Dirichlet process applied in Structurama 2.0 was used to determine the number of haplotype gro ups corresponding to the highest posterior probability. Structure 2.3.3 was used to assign haplotypes to haplotype groups using the number of groups identified by Structurama (K=13). Each allele is represented by a vertical bar with 'R' denoting AMA1 seque nces from clinical episodes experienced by children who received the rabies vaccine, and 'A' denoting AMA1 sequences from clinical episodes experienced by children vaccinated with malaria vaccine. Each color represents a different haplotype group, with thirteen groups in total. The group that corresponds to the 3D7 vaccine allele is highlighted in a red rectangle. The incidence of the 3D7 -type allele based on the whole AMA1 was more 105 common in clinical episodes experienced by the rabies group than in malaria vaccine group (p=0.014). Figure 4.S2.

Figure 4.8. Shifts from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type alleles of four apical 1 amino acids (AA162, AA197, AA206 and AA243) identified in two representative study participants durin g six months of follow -up. The shift from vaccine -type to non - vaccine -type alleles between consecutive infections was assessed during the vaccination period (with vaccinations occurring on days 0, 30 and 60, from days 0 to day 74, two weeks after the last vaccination, before vaccine -induced selection should be strong) and after vaccination (after day 74, when vaccine -induced selection should be most evident). Malaria vaccine allele (3D7) amino acids are shown in the first column, each color representing a d ifferent amino acid. Amino 107 acid changes (or lack of change) occurring during consecutive infections are shown along the horizontal lines. The dynamics of amino acid changes observed during the vaccination period were compared to those observed starting two weeks after the third and last vaccination, with the hypotheses that at amino acid positions under selection by the malaria vaccine, 1) non -vaccine - type amino acids would be observed more often in the period after vaccination in the malaria vaccine group than in the control group; and 2) in paired consecutive infections, changes from vaccine -type amino acids to non -vaccine -type amino acids would be observed more often in the period after vaccination in the malaria vaccine group than in the control group. Figure 4 .9. Relative risk ratio of the incidence of vaccine -type amino acids (panel A) and shifts from vaccine -type to non -vaccine -type alleles (panel B) during the vaccination period (up to day 74) compared to the period after vaccination (day 75 to 240) in the malaria vaccine and rabies vaccine groups . In panel A, at positions 175, 187, 172, 332, 197, 3D7 -type amino acids were more prevalent after vaccination in the rabies vaccine group compared to the malaria vaccine group. Codons for which the two vacc ine groups were significantly different have a relative risk ratio > 3 (cut -off point of a significant difference in amino acid prevalence between sequences generated before and after vaccination). In panel B, amino acids from consecutive clinical malaria episodes experienced by the same study participants may change from 3D7 -type (i.e. vaccine -type) to 3D7 other other to 3D7-type or from other -type to other -type. The ratio of the incidence of changes from 3D7 to other -type divided by the incidence of all other types of changes should increase after vaccination in malaria vaccine group but not in the rabies vaccine group if an amino acid 108 position is under selection by the vaccine. The ratio of the relative risk observed after vaccination divided by during vaccination risk is plotted for all polymorphic codons of the ama1 ectodomain. This ratio is high at positions where change from 3D7 -to other -type increased after vaccination, indicating vaccine selection. A significant ly increased relative risk ratio (RRR > 38; cut-off point of a significant difference in amino acid shift from the vaccine type between sequences generated before and after vaccination ) is observed at positions 485, 435 and 197.

Choice of malaria vaccine candidate antigens and allele -specific efficacy Blood -stage malaria vaccine candidates tested so far have been based on conveniently available strains, rather than on any assessment of wh ich strains or serotypes are most common in nature. In contrast to influenza and polio vaccine s, which are designed based on knowledge of natural strains and retain broad efficacy (with annual re -design for influenza vaccine), bacterial vaccines originated from strains have been culture -adapted in the laboratory and are thus readily and reproducibly available to be transformed and expressed in vectors. This approach has led to the discovery of most bacteria l vaccines currently in use. However, bacterial v accines designed based on this approach may not have a broad efficacy due to emergence of \"vaccine resistance \". The shifts in the genetic distributions of hepatitis B virus [119] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [120] alleles following the introduction of vaccines against these pathogens, and an in vitro study [52] of the allele specific -efficacy of malaria vaccine, have raised concerns that a vaccine based on a polymorphic antigen may not be effective against heterologous strains. In addition, even if initially efficacious, such vaccines may introduce positive selection for new strains in the population, resulting in loss of efficacy. Recent studies in animal mo dels have suggested the allele -specific efficacy of AMA1 based vaccine s [56]. However, a monovalent pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine which show ed efficacy in the field [108] did not affect local allele distribution s. Determining vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains and identifying immunologically important epitopes will be helpful in the design of a broadly efficacious malaria vaccine. The determinatio n 119 of the AMA1 protein 's crystal structure [39] has allowed identification of immunologically relevant polymorphic codons using both animal models [42] and molecular epidemiological approaches [69]. These findings have provided a clear insight and tools that can be used to assess the impact of malaria vaccine on strains observed during field trials. Sequences collected in clinical trials may also be relevant in confirming and/or identifying codons which are the target s of immune response s. Using the largest set of sequences collected during a malaria vaccine trial , we aimed to fulfill that go al. The evidence that a monovalent AMA1 vaccine was effective only against homologous allele s confirm ed observations made in earlier in vitro [100] and in vivo studies [1,56]. These observations are consistent with the slow acquisition of natural protection in malaria transmission areas. Participant s must be exposed to circulating strains in order to develop immune memory against similar parasites [110]. The observati on that some participant s had multiple episodes with the same allele corroborates this observation. The underlying hypothesis was that children aged less than 5 years have an immature immune system. It may take multiple exposures to develop efficient memor y cells or memory cells which are produced are not fit enough to survive for long time. The concern of vaccine -induced selection provides the rationale for this dissertation, which was to assess whether two malaria vaccines based on a prominent highly poly morphic blood -stage malaria vaccine antigen, Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) had allele -specific efficacy. Molecular epidemiology methods used in this study may inform the choice of effective antigens for improved next -generation malaria vaccines in the future and provide insight on the molecular evolution of malaria in real time using vaccine trials as a controlled experiment to study directional selection. 120 In specific aim 1 of this dissertation we measured the selection induced by a bivalent AMA1 malaria vaccine (based on the laboratory strains of P. falciparum 3D7 and FVO) in Bancoumana, Mali, while in specific aim 2 we evaluated the allele -specific effect of a monovalent AMA1 malaria vaccine (3D7 -based) in Bandiagara, Mali and as sessed the role of individual polymorphic codons in vaccine efficacy. Finally, in our discussion, we considered the long-term effect s and the future of AMA1 -based malaria vaccines. 2. A bivalent blood stage vaccine was not effective in reducing the number of malaria clinical episodes with 3D7 and FVO -type alleles in AMA1 -C1 vaccine recipients compared to the control group In this study, we used a total of 3 15 single haplotype infections for a global diversity analysis that resulted in identifying 186 unique h aplotypes. Only eight of these sequences had amino acids identical to those of 3D7, while none were identical to FVO. Five strains with an amino acid composition identical to 3D7 were in the vaccine group, while three were in the control group. The parasit e population in the study sites showed considerable genetic diversity as described elsewhere in an area with comparable intensity of transmission [36]. When we assessed whether vaccination affected malaria morbidity by increasing the prevalence of disease due to the spread of non -vaccine strain s in the vaccinated group compared to the control group, we found both groups had similar frequencies of non -vaccine strain s prior to vaccination, and this remained true after immunization. The genetic diversity of the parasite population was found to increase slightly in the control group, while a modest reduc tion was seen in the vaccinated group. However, none of these changes achieved statistical significance that would indicate a change in AMA1 haplotype diversity within the group. Similar results were observed in a study conducted in Mozambique [76] with the RTS,S/AS02 A malaria vaccine, 121 which was not allele -specific in protecting against malaria i nfection and disease. Our results are also consistent with findings in a study conducted in Gambia where the RTS,S/AS02 A vaccine was tested. That study showed no differences in the prevalence of vaccine -type allele based on sequences of the T -cell epitopes of the gene encoding the vaccine antigen in the vaccinated and control groups [55]. The major difference between these two vaccines is that RTS,S/AS02 A has an efficacy of ~30 -50% in reducing first clinical mala ria episodes [114]. All of these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the AMA1 -C1 vaccine was not immunogenic enough to induce protection, with an associated effect on allele efficacy. In fact, A MA1 -C1 vaccine produced antibody responses that were low and short -lived compared to other AMA1 vaccines (FMP2.1/AS02 A malaria vaccine) with more potent adjuvants. As shown in the next section, using a more immunogenic AMA1 malaria vaccine (FMP2.1/AS02 A) we were able to assess whether the immune response generates by FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine is directed against diverse or conserved epitopes. When we used a Cox proportional hazards analysis to assess the risk of first clinical disease with a limited set of eight immunologically important codons in the two treatment arms, we did not observe any association between vaccination status and risk of clinical malaria episode s with a given haplotype reflecting significant changes that may have occurred in these eight codons. Thus, the malaria vaccine group was not significantly different from the control group with respect to AMA1 amino acid sequence . In addition, based on survival analysis, the time to the first clinical episode with the set of eight immunologically impo rtant codons matching exactly those of the 3D7 or FVO vaccine strains was not statistically significant different when AMA1 -vaccinated participants were compared to controls. 122 The lack of allele -specific efficacy may be explained by the fact that the vacci ne had insufficient immunogenicity [96]. Another possible explanation for the failure of AMA1 -C1 to demonstrate protection was that allele -specific immune responses were induced by the vaccine, and even if there were highly effective against parasites carrying homologous forms of AMA1 (either with respect to the whole AMA1 sequence or a subset of immunologically important epitopes), were not broadly cross -protective enough to result in measurable efficacy against parasitemia . If an insufficiently broad immune response explained the lack of overall efficacy, however, allele -specific vaccine -induced immune responses should still have been directed against the fraction of parasites with partial or full homology to 3D 7 and FVO AMA1, leading to a reduction in the frequency of these alleles following immunization. Thus, the results of this study provide evidence that insufficient coverage of AMA1 diversity does not explain the lack of vaccine efficacy. It is more likely that AMA -C1 vaccine failed to protect due to insufficient immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. For this reason, a new formulation of AMA1 -C1 that includes the Toll-like receptor agonist CPG 7909 has been developed and tested in Phase 1 trials, which show an approximately 12 -14-fold increase in post -immunization antibody levels compared to the formulation without this additional adjuvant in malaria na\u00efve populations, and a 2.5-3-fold increase in antibody levels in malaria exposed adults [89,96-98]. A monovalent AMA1 vaccine based on the 3D7 strain and formulated with the AS02 A adjuvant system has also shown strong and sustained antibody responses in Malian adults [3] and children [99] Results of the allele -specific efficacy of this vaccine are discussed in the next section. These results highlight the recommendation that molecular typing should be a part of malaria vacci ne testing or monitoring. 123 3. The monovalent blood stage malaria vaccine was efficacious against vaccine -type alleles in Bandiagara, Mali In contrast to a previous AMA1 bivalent vaccine which did not show any efficacy against homologous strains [106], the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was highly efficacious against 3D7 allele presumably, due to it s higher immune response. A comparison of the immunological data shows that the mean antibody response of the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccin e was two times higher and constant during the follow up compared to the bivalent AMA1 vaccine response. Overall, the FMP2.1/AS02 A vaccine was shown to have a bout 20% efficacy , reaching statistical significance only in some secondary endpoint measures [105]. This response may represent the vaccine effect exclusively directed against parasites with 3D7-type AMA1 and closely -related strains. The consistency of our findings using different methods of analysis streng thens confidence that the observation of allele -specific efficacy is genuine. These results were confirmed by a neighbor joining network analysis which revealed a decrease of alleles related to 3D7 in the FMP2.1/AS02 A group compared to the rabies group fol lowing the three doses of vaccine. With 3D7 representing 13.5% of c1L alleles, the vaccine 20% overall efficacy suggest that they may be a degree of cross -protective efficacy against strains which are identical with respect to c1L but dissimilar in other p art of the ama1 gene. However the number of clinical cases with these alleles did not allow an assessment of vaccine specific efficacy against these individual strains. The findings that FMP2.1/AS02 A is efficacious only against strains with homologous AMA 1 and our limit ed knowledge on immune correlates and vaccine adjuvants make it unlikely that a multivalent vaccine could be designed which includes all alleles identified in the field. 124 However, using molecular epidemiology analysis as applied in this study it may be possible to group sequences that are closely related. Individual alleles representing clusters that cover a large proportion of the population may be selected and used as vaccine antigens in a multivalent malaria vaccine as has been done with mu ltivalent vaccines against polio, pneumococcus and other polymorphic pathogens . Our analyses suggested that a small cluster of amino acid residues near the invasion binding site are the main correlate of antigenic escape. Amino acid frequency distribution s in the vaccine and control groups during post -immunization follow up and the pattern of amino acid changes led to the identification of polymorphic sites 197, 200, 204, 206, 225 404, 435, 451, and 485 as being relevant in allele -specific efficacy. Howeve r, none of these positions was individually associated with protection against clinical malaria when treatment arms were compared. Moreover, polymorphic codons that discriminate 3D7 from FVO strain in domain 3 were likewise unrelated to protection. Several of these important amino acid positions (197, 200, 204, and 206) are located in the c1L of domain 1, which has been described as critical in antibod y binding. Due to AMA1 function, natural immun e pressure is already taking place at these polymorphic posit ions. However, with the random allocation of our study participant s to FMP2.1/AS02 A and rabies group, the background immunologic pressure should be similar in these groups. Therefore, instead of considering all 52 polymorphic codons of ama1 gene while defining haplotypes, c1L can be chosen as a surrogate. This could drastically reduce the number of alleles required for a multivalent AMA1 -based vaccine that offers broad protection against diverse AMA1 variants. Our results suggest that a multivalent vaccine which comprises 10 of the most prevalent c1L alleles may cover almost 80% of alleles identified in this area . Such a 125 vaccine construct may have even a broader coverage if there is a significant degree of cross - protection. The latest findings [113] that a mixed antigen formulation may produce the same immunological response as sequential infections with the same antigens supports the feasibility of developing an efficacious multivalent AMA1 vaccine. This first efficacy trial of the AMA1 malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02 A, which did not show statistically significant overall efficacy based on the primary efficacy endpoint [61], did show evidence of strong allele -specific efficacy. This was the first evidence that a single -antigen blood -stage malaria vaccine can provide any degree of protection against homologous strains. No evidence of cross -protective effect against strains with c1L sequence not identical to 3D7 was observed. These results suggest that it may be possible to design a polyvalent or chimeric AMA1 vaccine that provides broader cross -protection by including 10 alleles representing the most important groups of c1L in a multivalent vaccine formulation. Thes e results support a possible role for AMA1 in the design of the next generation multivalent, multistage AMA1 vaccine. Although it may be necessary to reduce the number of variants below ten for a multivalent malaria vaccine to be commercially viable, there are examples of licensed subunit vaccines with more than 20 variants [21]. 4. Study strengths and limitations The molecular epidemiological dynamics of AMA1 observed in these vaccine trial sites in Mali may differ from those in other areas with different m alaria endemicity, limiting the generalizability of our findings. Since AMA1 vaccinees and controls were from the same geographical area, there may not have been within -site difference s. We are assuming that 126 immunological backgrounds of individuals in our study population may be different such that children with a history of natural exposure to different AMA1 alleles may have naturally variable susceptibility to vaccine -type and non -vaccine type AMA1. However, we expect the randomization process will have d istributed these differences equally between AMA1 vaccinees and control groups. A different adjuvant was used in each trial, which may account for different results in the two trials. However, this limitation was also an advantage because we may be able t o measure any additional effect of the adjuvant \u2014indeed, the lack of immunogenicity of AMA1 -C1 is thought to account for the lack of both overall and allele -specific efficacy. The limited sensitivity of thick smear microscopy may also affect the frequency distribution of AMA1 alleles. To overcome this limitation, we processed our samples by PCR including 20% of microscopy -negative samples of all samples collected from study participant s. Even so, alleles that were present at very low parasite densities may not have been detected even by the sensitive molecular techniques that were used in this study. One limitation of this study is the use of data collected only from participant s harboring single AMA1 sequences to define haplotypes. Almost a third of the se quences were not used in the analysis because they were polyclonal and AMA1 haplotypes could not be resolved, leading to some loss of information. However, when we took into consideration these multipl y-infected participant sequence data in the analysis of p-distances and mean differences with 3D7 -type sequence, we reached the same conclusion as with single sequences. This loss of information in the two treatment arms may not be significant. 127 The key strengths of this study were our access to samples from t wo of the very few efficacy trials of malaria vaccines and our use of samples collected in a prospective, longitudinal fashion over a period of more than six months, allowing us to assess genetic changes using the whole sequence of the AMA1 ectodomain. Fin ally, one of the greatest strengths of our study is our ability to compare monovalent and bivalent vaccines targeting the same antigen in the same country. 5. Summary and implications of research The results of these studies show that a long way on the road to a blood -stage malaria vaccine is still ahead of us. Additional research and development are needed to identify important antigens and alleles that may be included in future vaccines. Our results suggest that the small effect of FMP2.1/AS02 A against fi rst clinical malaria episodes (~20% protection against first and multiple episodes) may be explained by the allele - specific efficacy of the vaccine, highlighting the need for a polyvalent or chimeric AMA1 vaccine that covers most strains or haplotypes in o rder to achieve broader cross -protection. We have also shown that AMA1, which is a very polymorphic antigen, faces a great challenge for its use as a vaccine candidate antigen. Overall, we conclude that AMA1 is probably not suitable as a stand -alone vacci ne. Research needs to be directed towards the design of a multi -antigen (based on different antigens of the blood stage) and multi -allelic (including different strains of the same antigen) vaccine. 128 Finally, our findings suggest that molecular epidemiology surveillance studies should be integrated into vaccine trials to measure vaccine efficacy at the molecular level and to detect the effects of vaccines on antigen diversity. In conclusion, these results indicate the importance of antigenic polymorphism as an effective parasite evasion mechanism that malaria vaccine researchers have to account for in the design of next -generation vaccines. 129 VI.
