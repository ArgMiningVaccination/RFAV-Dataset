While in the NICU, Rayden, now 10 months old, had hernia surgery\u2014the first such surgery at MMC, which is beginning to offer additional neonatal services to more babies.2 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS (breakdown of red blood cells), el- evated liver enzymes, and low platelet counts which affects a small percent- age of pregnancies. As a result, she needed to deliver her son Rayden immediately by cesarean section. Rayden, who was born 13 weeks early, weighing just 2 pounds, would spend the next five months in MMC's Neo- natal Intensive Care Unit. Eastman and her husband, Jeremiah, spent as much time with their son as possible. Being able to stay close to the hospital at Munson Manor Hospitality House, and knowing Rayden was in loving hands in the NICU helped tremen- dously during this challenging time, Eastman said.When the couple learned Rayden would need hernia surgery, they felt confident in the care their son would receive and relieved that the surgery could take place at MMC. \"He got to stay here with his primary care nurses, \" she said. \" And knowing that the surgeon specializes in this procedure and could do it here \u2014 it meant a lot. \" Health Care Team Performs First Infant Hernia Surgery at MMC Rayden's hernia surgery marked a first for MMC, which is beginning to offer additional neonatal services to more babies, said Lisa Allred, MD, one of two on-staff neonatologists who were part of Rayden's care team. Hernia surgery, which is a fairly common procedure for premature babies, is typically done at either Helen DeVos Children's Hospital or University of Michigan Hospital. However, a partnership with pediat- ric urologist Kirstan Meldrum, MD, of Covenant Hospital in Saginaw made the procedure possible in Traverse City. The surgeon, anesthesiologists, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists worked hard to ensure the proce- dure was a success. This involved hours of planning, including a night- before \"surgery walk-through. \" Being transparent with the East- man's and letting them know this would be a first for MMC was also important, Dr. Allred said, because having their full support was essential. \"They told us, 'We trust the team. Y ou know him. Y ou've cared for him since he was at his sickest and we 145 Days in Munson Medical Center's NICU: Rayden's Story Jeremiah and Melinda Eastman with their daughter Brooke, 8, and son Rayden, 10 months. Six months into her pregnancy, Melinda Eastman suddenly got ill \u2014 so ill that she went to Cadillac Hospital Urgent Care. \"It kind of came on like a strike of lightning, \" said Eastman, whose preg- nancy up until that point had been uneventful. \"It was pretty scary. \" Eastman was then sent to the hos- pital's emergency department for evaluation. Fairly quickly, doctors determined she needed to be taken by ambulance to Munson Medical Center for additional care. After arriving, Eastman learned she had HELLP Syndrome, a series of symptoms including hemolysis 3 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS want him to stay here. ' For us, that was really a motivator to do this and do it right, \" Dr. Allred said. And the team did. Rayden's surgery was a success and a second success- ful infant hernia surgery took place earlier this year. Inside Our NICU and Pediatric Services MMC's NICU is the only one in northern Michigan, serving 21 counties across the Munson Healthcare region. The Health Care Team consists of board-certified neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners, and specially-trained neonatal nurses for services. In addition, we have board-certified pediatric special- ists, pediatric nurses, and child life specialists to continue care for our littlest patients. Taking a more family-integrated approach to care is the future of our neonatal and pediatric programs, Dr. Allred said. \"We know develop- mental outcomes are much better when parents are involved. So, our new model is going to be family- integrated care, where parents are active members of the care team at the bedside. They're doing the care themselves and they know their baby better than anyone else. Y ou can't do that if you have a baby displaced from the community hundreds of miles away. \" Dr. Allred said she is proud of what MMC is providing, and will provide with the new Family Birth and Chil- dren's Center. For the Eastman fami- ly, having spent months in the NICU with Rayden, the unit's current tight quarters made a stressful situation even more challenging. In the new center, however, private rooms will provide a much-improved experi- ence for NICU patients and their families. \"We're bringing in the support, equipment, and skills we need to provide better care for more babies up here, which is awesome. We do know there are going to be rare cir - cumstances where we have to rely on our colleagues downstate who pro- vide us specialty services, \" she said. \"But for the most part, anything baby needs \u2014 a sick newborn or prema- ture infant \u2014 we want to be able to provide here. And we want to be able to provide it in a very personal way that keeps that family complete- ly involved in their baby's care. I'm excited. I love, love, love being here. We are growing and we are serving northern Michigan. We owe it to our families and our communities \u2014 to be able to provide these services \u2014 and I know we can do it well. \" Members of the NICU health care team.Our Capital Campaign: The Next Chapter Munson Healthcare is three years into a five-year capital expansion project and campaign. It is the larg- est expansion project in Munson Medical Center's history and fea- tured in that expansion are addi- tional operating rooms, additional surgery capacities, and the Family Birth and Children's Center. \"We announced our campaign of $36 million dollars last August and our campaign will run through June of 2020, \" said Desiree Worthington, Chief Development Officer for Munson Healthcare and President of Munson Healthcare Foundations. \"To date, we have raised $33 million dollars, and we need to raise $3 mil- lion more ... It's time for all of us to work together to make this a reality. \" To learn more about the Family Birth and Children's Center and how to contribute, please visit munsonhealthcare.org/ thenextchapter. 4 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUSFrom NICU Baby to Thriving Toddler: Happy and Healthy Lucas Fortine, Along With Twin Brother Bode Twin brothers Lucas and Bode Fortine began walking at 13 months and haven't slowed down since, say parents Kristy and John. \" As soon as they started walking, I don't think they ever crawled again, \" John said. \" And they like to hold hands when they're walking, \" Kristy added. Y ou may remember these sweet boys and their parents\u2014we featured this Bear Lake family in the December 2017 issue of Focus . Just three months old at the time, Lucas and Bode were born at 35 weeks at Munson Health- care Manistee Hospital. Lucas spent 17 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Munson Medical Center in Traverse City. Munson Medical Center has the only NICU north of Grand Rapids\u2014its rating as a Level 3 Regional Center means it is equipped to care for in- fants with significant respiratory and critical care needs. Eight hours after the Fortine twins were born, Lucas needed to be taken to Traverse City because of respiratory issues. Kristy's mom, Minda Sievert, RN, an operating room charge nurse at Manistee Hospital, followed Lucas to Munson Medical Center and stayed in the NICU with her grandson. Two days later, Kristy, John, and Bode arrived at Munson Medical Center, staying at Munson Manor with Kristy's mom so they could be close to Lucas. The experience of having their child in the NICU was traumatic, Kristy and John said, but having an \"awe- some\" support staff made all the difference. \"The most helpful part was all of the nurses and staff were so great, \" Kristy said. John and Kristy acknowledge that having a private room for their fam- ily during those 17 days would have made the experience all the better. They say it's exciting to hear that private rooms are part of the plans for the new Family Birth and Children's Center at Munson Medical Center. \"Especially for me, with having twins, my choice was leaving my baby in the NICU and going back home to be with my other baby, or carry my preemie infant through the hospital, where there are sick people, \" she said. \"Having those private rooms will be so amazing. \" Kristy and John are enjoying their full, busy life as parents of twin toddlers. Both boys are strong and healthy. \"They caught up so fast, \" Kristy said of their growth and development. \"Their pediatrician told us by six months they were on track and right where they should be. \" And ever since having tubes placed in their ears due to recurring ear infec- tions, the boys are talking up a storm. Each morning when they wake up, they're asking for a banana, which they like to split between them. They like using their spoons and forks\u2014all by themselves\u2014to taste all sorts of food, including mashed potatoes and pasta. Making a mess of the living room with their basket of toys is another favorite pastime. \"Life is hectic, \" John said, \"but I couldn't imagine it any other way. \" Bode (left) and his twin brother Lucas.5 Munson Healthcare Foundations | FOCUS The Legacy Society represents a list of donors who have named Paul Oliver Foundation or Munson Healthcare Foundations in their will or estate plans to support Kalkaska Memorial Health Center, Munson Healthcare Hospice, Munson Medical Center, or Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital.

No formal program or supervision is scheduled, except on Thursdays. Adult supervision required. Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital Auxillary's fundraising efforts through the Tri Up North Triathlon in Frankfort made this new youth space possible. New youth classes that started in January. Instructors offer semi- structured, supervised activities in a fun, supportive environment. Adult supervision not required. Children 5 - 12 welcome.
