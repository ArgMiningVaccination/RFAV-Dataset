Executive summary Introduction On 31st December 2019, the World Hea lth O rganization (WHO) was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China , which , one week later , was attributed to a novel coronavirus (severe acute resp iratory syndrome coronavirus 2: SARS -CoV -2). The WHO assessme nt of the risk of this event is very high in China and at the regional and global level. Gaining an early understanding of the transmissibility potential and clinical features of illness associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection are key to guide containment and mitig ation measures in local settings and at global level. This protocol forms part of the South Africa preparedness plan for the investigation of SARS -CoV -2 infections following virus introduction in the country. Aim To assess the magnitude (viral load) and duration of SARS -CoV -2 shedding and the clinical features associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection among HIV-infected and HIV -uninfected hospitalized, confirmed cases of COVID -19 (corona virus disease 2019 ; i.e., patients testing positive for SARS - CoV -2 on rRT -PCR) in South Africa. Objectives Primary objectives i. To determine the time period (range and median) in days that individuals continue to shed SARS -CoV -2 from respiratory and stool specimens after symptoms onset using real -time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR) and viral culture. ii. To determine the temporal variations of SARS -CoV -2 viral -load in respiratory and stool specimens using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR). iii. To determine the viremia of SARS -CoV -2 during infection. iv. To determine the antibody response to SARS -CoV -2 during and early -post infection and whether there is an association with patient outcome. v. To determine the clinical features of COVID -19 over time, including signs and symptoms, hematologi cal changes, severity, and progression of illness. Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 5 - vi. To correlate the duration and magnitude of SARS -CoV -2 shedding detected by rRT -PCR and culture and the antibody response to the clinical features of illness. Secondary objectives i. To assess factors that may affect SARS -CoV -2 shedding duration. ii. To assess factors that may affect SARS -CoV -2 viral load. iii. To assess factors that may affect SARS -CoV -2 duration and severity of illness. iv. To determine the genetic characteristics of SARS -CoV -2 of infected patients and assess the impact of prolonged shedding on within -host SARS -CoV -2 evolution through whole genome sequencing. v. To compare validity of using nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal swab specimens for detection of SARS -CoV -2 by rRT -PCR Study procedures The identification of confirmed COVID -19 cases will rely on surveillance and case finding as described by the national guidelines. As per national guidelines confirmed COVID -19 cases will be isolated in selected facilities. Following conse nting and enrollment into the study, sequential respiratory and stool samples will be collected every two days until cessation of shedding (test negative for SARS -CoV -2 on rRT -PCR on two consecutive respiratory samples) or death of the patient . Blood sampl es will be collected at pre -defined intervals from symptoms onset during and early -post infection to assess viremia and the antibody response to the virus. The progression of illne ss will be documented in detail through the use of standard data collection form s administered at enrollment and daily thereafter until cessation of shedding or death of the patient.

Introduction On 31st December 2019, the World Hea lth O rganization (WHO) was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus -2019 ). One week later, on 7th January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of pneumonia [1]. This novel coronavirus has been named as severe acute respiratory syndro me coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses due to its genetic similarity (different strain of the same species) to the severe acute r espiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS -CoV) that emerged in 2002 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862 v1.full.pdf ). The disease associated with SARS -CoV -2 has been named by WHO as COVID -19 (for corona virus disease 20 transmission was not apparent and th e majority of the cases were epidemiologically linked to a seafood, poultry and live wildlife market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) in Jianghan District of Hubei Province. Available evidence, and experience from the SARS - CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndro me Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) suggests that the novel coronavirus has a possible zoonotic origin [ 2,3]. However, the number of cases continued to increase rapidly, and evidence of person -to-person transmission mounted in travellers diagnosed with SARS -CoV-2 who had visited Wuhan [4]. The WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee declared that the outbreak of COVID -19 meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January f 3rd March 2020, 90,870 laboratory -confirmed cases had been reported to WHO, of which 80,304 (88.4 %) had been detected in China and China special territor ies, including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) (745 cases), Maca u SAR (66 cases), and Taipei (2,359 cases). The remaining 10,566 cases have bee n reported from 72 other countries in the following WHO Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 9 - Regions: Western Pacific: 9 (Japan, Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Singapore, A ustralia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Philippines and New Zealand ); South -East Asia: 5 (Thailand, Nepal, Sri Lanka , Indonesia and I ndia); Region of the Amer icas: 6 (The United States of America , Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Dominican Republic ), European Region: 34 (Italy, France, Germany, Spain, The United Kingd om, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, Netherland, Sweden, Israel, Croatia, Iceland, San Marino, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Denmark, Azerbaijan, Czechia, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation, Portugal, Andorra, Armenia, Belarus, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco and North Macedonia ); Eastern Mediterra nean: 15 (Iran, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Oman, Pakistan, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Egypt, Qatar , Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia ); and African: 3 (Algeria , Nigeria and Senegal ). Outside of China, c ases of i n-country transmission has been reported in 20 of 58 infected countries and community transmission is presumed to occur in South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore (https://www.who.int/docs/default - source/coronaviruse/situation -reports/20200303 -sitrep -43-covid -19.pdf?sfvrsn =2c21c09c_2 ). This is a rapidly evolving situation. The daily WHO situation update can be found at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus -2019/situation -reports/ . The WHO assessme nt of the risk of this event is very high in China and at the regional and global level. The South Africa National Department of Health (NDoH) activated t he Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) on 31st January 2020 and is currently actively screening persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID -19 using a standard case definition (see Section 6.1) . The EOC task force assessed the risk of introduction of SARS -CoV -2 in South Africa to be high. Laboratory diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 infection is conducted at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) and at sentinel NHLS laboratories around the countr y. The first positive case of SARS -CoV -2 infection in South Africa was reported on 5 March 2020 from a patient in KwaZulu -Natal . 3.1. Clinical presentation There are currently limited clinical data available from confirmed COVID -19 cases. Most of the availabl e information is from the initial and more severe cases identified. A minority, but not negligible proportion of patients have had acute, severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 10 - shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. As of 3rd March 2020, of the 90,870 cases confirmed globally , 3,112 (3.4 -41-covid -19.pdf?sfvrsn=6768306d_2 ). Because investigations initially focused on severe cases the severity of the infection may be overestimated among the currently known confirmed cases. The clinical features of 41 severe cases initially detected in China have been described in detail. These patients were hospitalized in a dedicated hospital in Wuhan city. 73% were men, the median age was 49 years (IQR: 41 -58 years) and 66% had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. 32% had underlying medical conditions, including diabetes (20%), hypertension (15%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). Common symptoms at onset included fever (98%), cough (76%) and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Less common (8%), emoptysis (5%) and diarrhoea (3%). Dyspnoea developed in 22% of patients. The median time of dyspnoea development was 8 days (IQR: 0 -13 days). 63% of patients had lymphopenia and all patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest X -ray. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%) and acute cardiac injury (19%). 32% of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit ( ICU) and 15% died [5]. Another description of the clinical characteristic of 99 confirmed severe cases from China reported a median age of 55.5 years. 51% of patients had chronic diseases, 83% had fever, 82% had cough, 31% had shortness of breath, 11% had muscle ache, 9% had confusion, 8% had headache, 5% had sore throat, 4% had rhinorrhoea, 2% had chest pain, 2% had diarrhoea and 1% had nausea and vomiting. 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14% showed multiple mottling and ground - glass opacit y and 1% had pneumothorax. 17% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and of those 11% worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [6]. The first COVID -19 case identified in the United State presented at first with mild illness with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness onset [7]. Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 11 - 3.2. Duration of viral shedding and antibody response There is a dearth of information on the duration of shedding (including the fluctuation of the viral load during progression of infection ) and the antibody response to infection with COVID -19. The first case of COVID -19 identified in the United States tested positive by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) up to 12 days after onset of illness. However, it is unc lear if the patients continued to shed the virus thereafter. Patient's stools tested positive on day 7 of illness onset. No stools were collected thereafter. The same patient tested negative on serology until day 7 of illness onset . The seroconversion ther eafter is unknown [7]. SARS -CoV -2 has been detected in respiratory, stool and blood (whole blood and serum) specimens [ 8]. Data from previo us novel coronaviruses (MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV ) indicated that these viruses were shed for a prolonged period of time (up to 30 days) with peak viral load 12 -14 days post symptom onset. This had important implications for quarantine and infection control measures [9,10,11,12]. 4. Justification The detection and spread of an emerging respiratory pathogen are accompanied by uncertainty over the key epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of the novel pathogen and particularly its ability to spread in the human popu lation , its virulence (case -severity) and its behavior in HIV -coinfected individuals . This is the case for the SARS -CoV -2. Gaining an early understanding of the transmissibility potential and clinical features of illness associated with SARS - CoV -2 infection are key to guide containment and mitigation measures in local settings and at global level. The WHO recommends the implementation of special studies at the early stage of introduction of SARS -CoV -2 to inform national and global control and mitiga tion strategies (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus -2019/technical -guidance of viral shedding, the cli nical features of illness and the association between viral shedding /viral load and the symptomatology of the infection has direct practical implications to: (i) determine the required duration of isolation of infected individuals; (ii) assess Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 12 - the transmis sibility potential of the virus; and (iii) understand the clinical spectrum and progression of illness for improved treatment and mitigation strategies. This protocol forms part of the South Africa preparedness plan for the investigation of SARS -CoV -2 infection s . 5. Study aim and objectives 5.1.

Case definition and identification of cases A confirmed case of COVID -19 is a person with laboratory confirmation (detection by rRT -PCR) of infection with SARS -CoV -2. Confirmation of infection will be conducted according to the procedures outlined in the \"COVID -19 Guidelines for Case -Finding, Diagnosis, Management and Public Response in South f). Identification of confirmed cases will be implemented through active surveillance and case finding as highlig hted in the national , active surveillance and case finding will be conducted by clinicians, health facilities and designated staff through implementation of routine screening for the i dentification of suspected cases at healthcare facilities and identification and follow -up of contacts of confirmed cases . A suspected case (person under investigation - PUI) is defined as a person with acute respiratory illness with sudden onset of at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or fever [ 38\u00b0C (measured) or history of fever (subjective)] irrespective of admission status. Those at highest risk for COVID -19 include persons who have an acute respiratory illness and who, in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms, met at least one of the following epidemiological criteria: Were in close contact with a confirmed or probable case of SARS -CoV -2 infection; OR Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 14 - Had a history of travel to areas with presumed ongoing community transmission of SARS - CoV -2 (e.g., Mainland China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Iran, Hong Kong and Italy ). OR Worked in, or attended a health care facility where patients with SARS -CoV -2 infections were being treated. OR Admitted wi th severe pneumonia of unknown etiology From all PUI a standard case investigation form (CIF - Appendix I) will be completed and a n upper and/ or lower respiratory tract sample will be collected as detailed in the national guidelines. Samples with accompanying specimen submission form (Appendix II) will be sent to the national reference laboratory [the Center for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM) , National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Labora tory Service (NHLS)] or to the nearest NHLS virology laboratory offering SARS -CoV -2 rRT -PCR for testing. Figure 1 illustrates the laboratory algorithm f ollowed for testing of specimens collected from a suspected COVID -19 case shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 15 - Figure1: Algorithm for testing suspected cases for COVID -19 by rRT -PCR and sequencing Routine confirmation of cases of SARS -CoV -2 infection is based on amplification and detection of unique SARS -CoV -2 viral nucleic acid sequences by real -time reverse -transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR), with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary. Currently, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases conducts testing for SARS -CoV -2 using the Charite Institute rRT -PCR assay. The protocol for testing is based on a method described by Corman et al, 2020 [ 13]. A unique identifier will be assigned t o all COVID -19 confirmed cases and the laboratory results and the information collected on the CIF (Appendix I) will be entered daily in central databases kept at NICD. 6.2. Isolation of COVID -19 confirmed cases As per national guidelines, confirmed cases will be isolated in designated public healthcare facilities or where the patient was first admitted if the admitting facility (public or private) has adequate isolation space and they will receive relevant medica l *Rnase P negative Confirmatory Assay RdRp geneHOWEVER: Collect further Specimens and repeat tests if clinical or epidemiological Evidence is suggestive, or if initial specimen was of poor qualityPositive Negative Confirmed case Culturing and whole genome sequencingIndeterminate Repeat assay with the extracted RNA as well as the different stored specimen aliquot In parallel collect further specimens and if necessary refer to a laboratory with greater experience of testing for SARD -CoV-2Inconclusive Collect further specimens and repeat tests if clinical or epidemiological evidence is suggestive, or if initial specimen was of poor qualityNovel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 16 - health -response -in-South -Africa.pdf ). Patients will be isolated in an airborne infection isolation room if available or in adequately ventilated single rooms. 6.3. Eligibility criteria 6.3.1. Inclusion criteria i. Patient meets the case definition of COVID -19 confirmed case. ii. Patient is hospitalized and warrants admission for medical reasons at a participating GERMS -SA syndromic or enhanced laboratory -based surveillance hospital site (see table 2). iii. Patient is >18 years on the day of specimen collection for COVID -19 testing iv. Patient resides within 50km radius of the admitting hospital v. Patient is enrolled within 5 days of specimen collection for COVID -19 diagnosis 6.3.2. Exclusion criteria i. Patient does not meet the case definition of COVID -19 confirmed case. ii. Confirmatory HIV test result is not available and patient refuses HIV testing. iii. Patient is admitted and hospitalized for self -isolation purposes only 6.4. Sample size Two hundred participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study: 100 HIV- infected and 100 HIV-uninfected adults ( >18 years) . Participants will be enrolled from the GERMS - SA syndromic and enhanced laboratory -confirmed surveillance hospitals. 6.5. Enrollment and study procedures 6.5.1. Enrollment of COVID -19 confirmed cases A list of all confirmed COVID -19 cases will be obtained daily from the centralized national database kept at NICD (see Section 6.1) and from each isolation facility of the participating hospitals . The Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 17 - focal point /clinical director /infection control practit ioner at the isolation facility w here the COVID - 19 confirmed case is admitt ed will be contacted by NICD dedicated staff. The initial laboratory report and any available residual respiratory swab specimen will be collected from the initial testing laboratory. Trained NICD study personnel will approach the patient within 24 hours from admission for consenting (Appendix VIII) and enrollment . Following enrollment a study calendar will be completed (Appendix VII) and a detailed Case Record Form (CRF) (Appendix III) will be administered to collect key demographic, exposure and clinical data from the patient. HIV testing should be conducted as part of clinical manage ment. However, if HIV testing was not done, a finger prick for HIV rapid testing will be conducted with consent , if needed, to define HIV status as described below. If the patient has a documented positive HIV result (including viral load or evidence of HAART) available in the hospital records this will be considered the patient's HIV status. If the patient is not aware of their status or a previous result (>6 months old) documents a negative result the patient will b e offered voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) by rapid enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . The HIV status of the patient , along with a recent CD4 count and HIV -viral load will be recorded in the CRF. 6.5.2. Follow -up of COVID -19 confirmed cases If the hospital has adequate capacity, hospital staff will be trained by NICD/ DoH personnel on the day of enrollment for sequential sample and clinical data collection during the admission period. If the hospital has insufficient staff the sequential and clin ical data collection will be implemented by trained NICD/ DoH personnel. All procedure s required after patient's disch arge will be conducted by NICD/ DoH personnel. This includes: (i) home follow -up visit for sample and clinical data collection if the patie nt was discharged before cessation of shedding ; and (ii) the collection of convalescent serum. For home Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 18 - visits , a visit calendar will be agreed upon before discharge using a visit calendar form (Appendix VII). For each scheduled procedure (whether at the isolation facility or at home) a window period of 1 day will be allowed after the study vis it due date to accommodate emergencies and missed visits. Patients will be considered to be no longer shedding if they test negative for SARS -CoV -2 on rRT-PCR on two consecutive respiratory specimens in concomitance with remission of symptoms . 6.5.2.1. Sequential specimens collection Respiratory specimens : Oropharyngeal (NP) and nasopharyngeal (OP) swabs (place d in the same vial containing universal transport medium) will be collected on the day of enrollment and every two days from enrollment until cessation of shedding or death of the patient . In addition, a self /HCW administered nasal swab (taken from the middle nasal turbinate) will be collected at each of these time points. If the patient is transferred to a different facility or discharged before cessation of shedding the sequential respira tory specimen's collection will continue at the referred facility or at home with the same frequency until cessation of shedding or death of the patient . Respiratory specimens will be tested by SARS -CoV -2 rRT -PCR and culture assays (see Sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2). The procedures for the collection, storage and transportation of respiratory samples are provided in Appendices IX, X, XI and XIV . Stool specimens : Stool specimens , including rectal swabs and nappy liners as appropriate, will be collected following the same schedule of respiratory specimens' collection as described above . If the patient is transferred to a different facility or discharged before cessation of shedding the sequential stool specimen collection will continue at the referred facility or at home with the same frequency until cessation of shedding or death of the patient . Stool specimens will be tested by SARS -CoV -2 rRT-PCR and culture assays (see Sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2). The procedures for the collection, storage and transpo rtation of stool sp ecimens are provided in Appendices and XIV. Blood specimens: Three blood specimens ( +13ml) will be collected at each blood draw (yellow top (5ml), red top (5ml) and purple top (3ml) ) on the day of enrollment and on day 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset irrespective of time of cessation of shedding or until death of the patient . The following blood specimen(s) collection schedule will be implemented : Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 19 - If the enrolment occurs within 0 -5 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. If the enrolment occurs within 8 -12 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and a t days 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. If the enrolment occurs within 15 -19 da ys from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollm ent and at days 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. If the enrolment occurs within 22 -26 da ys from symp toms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. If the enrolment occurs 7, 14, 21 or 28 days post symptom onset a blood specimen will be collected at enrollm ent and at the remaining scheduled follow -up visits (e.g., if the enrolment occurs at 7 days post symptom onset a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset ). If the enrollment occurs 6, 13, 20 or 27 days post symptoms onset (one day before the due sample collection date) a blood specimen will not be collected at enrollment but at the next scheduled visit on the following day (e.g. day 7, 14, 21, or 28 post symptoms onset) and at the remaining scheduled follow -up visits . If the patient is transferred to a different facility or discharged during the scheduled follow -up period the sequential blood specimen's collection will continue at the referred facility or at home according to schedule. For the visit scheduled at 56 days post symptoms on set, 3 day s will be allowed on either side of the scheduled study visit date to accommodate weekends, emergencies and missed visits. Serum samples will be tested for the detection of SARS -CoV -2 using rRT -PCR and culture (to assess viremia - see Section s 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 ) and the detection and quantification of SARS -CoV -2 immunoglobulin class M (IgM) and class G (IgG) (see Section 6.6.3). In addition, whole blood will be tested for the detection of SARS -CoV -2 using rRT -PCR and culture (see Sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2) and the results will be compared to those obtained from serum samples . The procedures for the collection, storage and transportation of whole blood and serum specimens are provided in Appendix IX, XIII and IX . Laboratory slip: A laboratory slip (Appendix VI) will be completed for all samples collected and sent along with the relevant samples to the national reference laboratory at NICD within 24 hours Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 20 - from specimen collection . The patient's unique identifier provided by NICD wi ll be used to identify the patient and it will be placed on the laboratory slip and the specimen (s). A sequential number reflecting the sequential sample collection day post enrollment will be added to the unique identifier. The first sequential sample will be identified as \"D x\" (i.e., where x is the number of days post enrollment ). One laboratory slip will be complete d for all sample s that will be shipped to the laboratory with the same shipment . Samples that are collected on the same day, but will be s hipped to the laboratory on a different shipment (either the same day or not) will require a different laboratory slip to be completed. The exact date of sample collection will be reported fo r each allowed sample collection day within the follow -up window (i.e. the due sample collection date or +1 day of the due sample collection date). 6.5.2.2. Sequential clinical data collection A clinical follow -up form (Appendix IV) will be completed for every day of follow -up post enrollment until cessation of shedding or death of the patient. The form will be complete d through patient interview and , if available, review of clinical records (including hospital laboratory results) by the designated hospital staff or NICD/ DoH personnel. If the patient is transferred to a different facility or discharged before cessation of shedding the daily clinical follow -up form will be completed at the referred facility or at home with the same frequency until cessation of shedding or death of the patient. If the form cannot be completed daily (e.g. no available hospital staff and NICD/ DoH personnel visits the patient every 2 days either at the isolation facility or at home ) one form will be completed retrospectively for each day after the last completed form. A fina l outcome form (Appendix V) will be completed at any of the following instances: (i) transfer to a different facility , (ii) discharge (either before or after cessation of shedding), (iii) cessation of shedding (if the patient was not discharged before cess ation of shedding), and (iv) death of the patient. 6.6. Laboratory procedures Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 21 - All collected samples will be tested at the national reference laboratory situated at the CRDM /NICD. The infection control measures and the procedures for collection, storage and transportation of specimens are provided in Appendices IX-XIV. 6.6.1. Molecular detection Total nucleic acids will be extracted using the MagNA Pure Compact or MagNA Pure 96 instrument, as per manufacturer's instructions. r RT-PCR will be performed according to the method described by Corman et al, 2020 [ 13]. This assays detects two gene targets of the SARS -CoV -2 virus (E gene and RdRP gene). A specimen will be considered posi tive for SARS -CoV -2 if both targets are detected (Figure 1) . A real -time PCR assay targeting the human RNaseP gene will be performed for all specimens to control for the quality of the specimen and PCR inhibition. For positive specimens, further virus characterization will be performed by virus culture and whole genome seque ncing. 6.6.2. Virus isolation Vero and (100 units/ml penicillin and 15 g/ml streptomycin) will be used f or virus isolation. PCR -positive s amples will be centrifuged at 8. 000 g for 15 min, filtered and diluted 1:2 with DMEM supplied with 16 g/ml trypsin before adding to cells. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1h, the inoculum will be removed and replaced with fr esh culture medium containing antibiotics and 16 g/ml trypsin. The cells will be incubated at 37\u00b0C and observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). Viral growth will be confirmed by rRT-PCR. 6.6.3. Antibody detection A virus neutralization test will be performed in 48 -well plates. Patient serum samples will be heat - inactivated by incubation at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min before use. Serum samples (5 \u00b5L) will be diluted 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80, and following addition of an equal volume of virus stock will be incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Diluted serum samples from healthy people will be used as negative control. After incubation, 100 \u00b5L of the virus -serum mixtures will be inoculated onto monolayer Vero E6 cells for 1 hour. Each serum will be repeated duplicate. After removal of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 22 - supernatant, the plate will be washed twice with DMEM medium and then incubated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 24 hours. Finally , cells will be fixed with 4% formaldehyde and virus detected will be performed using the SL -CoV Rp3 NP antibody followed by Cy3 -conjugated mouse anti -rabbit IgG. Nuclei will be stained with DAPI. Infected cell numbers will be counted by high - content cytometers. In addition, an under -development in-house EL ISA to detect IgG and IgM responses in serum samples to the spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 will be used . 6.7. Study timelines The study will start after the first case s of COVID -19 are confirmed in South Africa and will continue until the sample size is reached. 6.8. Ethical Considerations 6.8.1. Privacy All laboratory specimens and questionnaires data will be stored in a password -protected database with limited access . All human biological materials collected as part of this protocol will be used only for the study described in this protocol. 6.8.2. Institutional Review Board This study is considered operational research and is in line with the NICD's public health mandate to conduct clinical surveillance . The study has been structured in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (last updated: October 2013), which deals with the recommendations guiding doctors in biomedical research involving human participants. Ethics approval and permissions for the study will be obtained from the relevant ethics committe es, Provincial Departments of Health and other authorities prior to study start -up 6.8.3. Informed Consent All study participants will be required to sign a consent form to participate in the study. A copy of the consent form will be given to the participant. T he consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. Consent will be Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 23 - obtained at the bedside and documented in writing. Surveillance officers will approach adult patients direct ly to obtain consent. For patients who are not able to give consent (confused, unconscious or ventilated patients) consent will be sought from a surrogate decision maker (e.g ., a next of kin or doctor managing the patient who is not part of the study); and when the patient is better and is able to make decisions the consent will be sought from the patient. If at this stage the patient refuse s participation , the decision made by the patient will override that made by the surrogate decision maker at the time of enrolment and the data and samples already collected for the study will be destroyed and not used for the study. Sample patient information and consent forms are provided in Appendix VIII. Working versions will be held by NICD and sent for approval to the relevant ethics committees if changes are made. 6.9. Risk associated with study participation 6.9.1. HIV testing Patients who undergo HIV testing will receive pre - and post -test counselling by trained nurses on site at the hospital . The choice of rapid test will be led by the current protocol being used by the National Department of Health. Referrals for continued support, CD4 testing and treatment will be facilitated within the primary health care . One drop of whole blood will be collected from the fingertip for use in the HIV rapid test using a sterile lancet cap, which may cause mild transient discomfort and bruising. The volume of blood to be dr awn and the collection method pose minimal risk of harm. 6.9.2. Nasopharyngeal , oropharyngeal and nasal specimen c ollectio n Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection may cause transient mild discomfort but pose s minimal risk of harm. Self-administered nasal swabs cause less discomfort. These procedures are done as part of standard diagnostic procedures for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses and are considered low -risk procedures . 6.9.3. Stool specimen collection Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 24 - Stool specimen collection poses no risk of harm. 6.9.4. Blood c ollection Blood will be collected from all patients at enrollment and a maximum of 5 times during the study period at an interval of 7 days for the first 4 draws and 28 days for the last draw : 3 blood tubes will be collected at each blood draw (5ml in Red top, 5ml in Yellow top and 3ml in Purple top). Blood will be collected by venipuncture, which may cause mild tran sient discomfort and bruising. The volume of blood to be drawn, the frequency of collection and the collection method pose minimal risk of harm. 6.10. Study Discontinuation Study participants will be encouraged to continue participating voluntar ily in the study. A study participant may cho ose to discontinue participation in the study at any time without threat of reprisal or risk that his or her future medical care will be compromised. Study participants will be considered \"lost to follow -up\" i f they miss two sequential scheduled study visits and cannot be contacted after at least three attempts by telephone or by home visit if the patient was discharged before cessation of shedding . 6.11. Anticipated Benefits This study will be of benefit to the in dividual participant as they will be closely monitored for the development of severe illness until cessation of shedding . In addition, the study will provide key information to guide isolation and clinical management of confirmed COVID -19 cases. 6.12. Compensati on No compensation will be given to participants. It is anticipated that most of the participant follow - up will happen while the patient is still hospitaliz ed. In the event that the patient is discharged before the end of follow -up period , study staf f will visit the patient at home or reimburse participants for reasonable transport costs incurred for follow -up at the admission facility . Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 25 - 7. Data management Data entry will be centraliz ed at the CRDM data centre at NICD and will be performed by trained data clerks. Data clerks will be supervised by the database manager and data will be stored in a password -protected database with limited access . Data will be entered into a Microsoft Access\u00ae and REDCap database s and Go.Data ( https://www.who.int/godata ). Data quality systems are already in place at the CRDM data center and they will be applied for this study . Data collection will be standardized and questionnaires will be checked by the research manager at the NICD for consistency and errors prior to data capture and queries will be generated. Regular data checks will be performed post -data entry. A data -manager will be responsible for data quality is sues. 8. Reporting and d ata analysis Key severity indicators will be monitored and reported in real time to the EOC/NDoH as part of national surveillance for COVID -19 guidelines. These indicators will monitor worsening of illness (e.g. development of acute respiratory distress syndrome) and admission to ICU and/or mechanical ventilation. The final outcome of illness (discharge or death) will also be reported in real time. In addition, the duration of shedding (based on rRT -PCR) will be calculated immediately following the cessation of shedding and communicated to the EOC/NDoH to inform isolation guidelines. Viral evolution within an individual and at a population level will be monitored through whole genome sequence analysis wit h specific focus on the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor engagement and is a current lead candidate for an antibody -mediated vaccine, as well as other genes targets of future drug and treatment regimens. This mutation data, frequency and po tential impact will be reported to the EOC/NDoH as they become available . The duration of shedding will be calculated from the day of symptoms onset to the day of cessation of shedding. At the end of the study the mean, median and interquartile range (IQR ) of the duration of shedding will be calculated for respiratory and stool specimens . The correlation of rRT -PCR positivity in NP/OP and stool specimens will be assessed using Chi -square and k -statistics. If the Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 26 - number of enrolled participants is sufficien t the factors associated with the duration of shedding will be assessed using Weibull accelerated time -failure regression . Trends of t he viral load (using the rRT -PCR cycle -threshold value as a proxy) will be described over the duration of shedding and sum marized with mean, median, min and maximum values. If the number of enrolled participants is sufficient the factors associated with the viral load will be assessed using quantile regression. The correlation between positive virus cultures and viral load (u sing the rRT -PCR cycle -threshold value as a proxy) will be evaluated using ordinal regression. The antibody response will be described over time during and early -post infection and the correlation with cessation of shedding a nd viral load (using the rRT -PCR cycle -threshold value as a proxy) will be evaluated using Weibull accelerated time -failure and logistic regression. The clinical characteristics of the patients will be summarized using mean and medians with associated standard deviation or IQR for conti nuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. Key symptoms will also be described over the duration of illness and the correlation of the duration and severity of illness wit h viral shedding, viral load and antibody response will be assessed u sing Weibull accelerated time -failure and logistic regression. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentation at conferences and publications .

Appendix VIII: Participant information leaflet and informed consent Information leaflet for cases of coronavirus (COVID -19): Adults STUDY TITLE: Characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) Shedding and the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID -19) Clinical Features among the First Confirmed Cases in South Africa Persons contemplating part icipation in this study are asked to read this document or have it read to them, if they are unable to read it for themselves and sign the attached informed consent before any study -related procedure is done. Institution : National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa; funded by core NICD funds. Investigator: Professor Cheryl Cohen 011.386.6593 (daytime) and 082.803.8093 (afterhours). Hello, my name is Professor Cheryl Cohen. I am the Head of the Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg. I would like to invite you to think about helping us with a research study called the COVID -19 shedding and disease progression study (short title) Before you decide on whether to agree to take part in this study, we would like you to read this information sheet about the study. Before you say whether you would like to take part, please make sure you understand what you will be asked to do. You should also make sure you understand the purpose of the study, the study procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts and precautions and your right to withdraw from the study at any time. This information leaflet is to help you to decide if you would like to participate. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me, or the study staff who will introduce the study to you. You should not agree to take part unless you are satisfied with all the procedures involved. Please be open with me regarding your health history, since yo u may otherwise harm yourself by participating in this study. If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign a Consent Sheet to confirm that you understand the study. You will be given a copy of the Information and Consent sheets to ke ep. Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 45 - Background/Purpose Infectious diseases are caused by different germs (virus, bacteria or parasites). By infectious we mean that the illness can be passed (transmitted) from one person to the next. It is important to understand the way these infection s are passed from one person to the next so that we can design ways to stop transmission. This information is particularly important for new viruses such as the SARS -CoV -2 (novel coronavirus), the virus that causes a novel coronavirus disease which emerged in 2019 (COVID -19). We do not have all the information about this virus and how the virus passes from one person to the next. One of the important pieces of information is to understand how long people shed the virus (this means how long people who are in fected have the virus in the nose/throat or chest after they are infected or become ill. It is also possible that the virus is in the stool). Because this is a new virus we would also like to describe what medical signs and symptoms people who are infected with this virus experience. The information from the study will help to make guidelines for the use of vaccines and other interventions when these become available, to help prevent these illnesses in people. This information will also help us to underst and how we can protect people by isolating them from non -infected people. We would also like to describe some of the characteristics of people who become ill and those who become very ill, such as your age, if you have any underlying conditions (such as h eart disease, diabetes and other lung conditions) and people who have weak immune systems (like people with HIV). We may also ask questions about people that you may have been in contact with before and during your illness. In order to help us explain all these things we are planning a study that will enroll people who are confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus in South Africa. If you agree to take part (enroll), we will be following you for at least a month (and up to 2 months). This will mean v isiting you in hospital or at home, every second day, until we are not able to find the virus in your airways (nose/throat or in their lungs) and also we will take stool and blood samples. Once we cannot find the virus we will visit you at wider intervals (like once a week) until 56 days after your symptoms started. We are doing all these samples because we are still not sure where your body sheds the virus. We are following you up for longer to see how your body reacts after the virus has gone (we do this with blood samples). During this study we will ask you to participate in the following study procedures: 1. Complete a detailed questionnaire about your age, medical history and symptoms. 2. We will ask about your HIV status and if necessary do testing for HIV ( as explained in detail below). 3. Every second day we will take samples from your nose and throat with a swab. 4. If you are in hospital we may take samples from your lungs, like sputum (phlegm). 5. Stool samples will be taken at all the visits; a nurse will talk you through the procedure. 6. A small finger prick test to test for your body's reaction to the virus, a small drop of blood will be taken from your finger. 7. Blood samples (from your arm, like routine blood tests) will be taken on the day of enrolment and a s detailed below, this will be a 3 -10ml sample (less or equal to one teaspoon of blood) taken by a registered nurse using routine sample collection techniques: Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 46 - a. If the enrolment occurs within 0 -5 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. b. If the enrolment occurs within 8 -12 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. c. If the enrolment occurs within 15 -19 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. d. If the enrolment occurs within 22 -26 days from symptoms onset, a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at da ys 28 and 56 post symptoms onset. e. If the enrolment occurs 7, 14, 21 or 28 days post symptom onset a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at the remaining scheduled follow - up visits (e.g., if the enrolment occurs at 7 days post symptom onset a blood specimen will be collected at enrollment and at days 14, 21, 28 and 56 post symptoms onset). f. If the enrollment occurs 6, 13, 20 or 27 days post symptoms onset (one day before the due sample collection date) a blood specimen will not be collected at enrollment but at the next scheduled visit on the following day (e.g. day 7, 14, 21, or 28 post symptoms onset) and at the remaining scheduled follow -up visits. As HIV infection weakens the immune system, HIV -infected people react differently to infectio n, so knowing the HIV status of people in this study is very important. There are a number of ways for us to do this. We can offer you a rapid test and you will get the result after about 15 minutes. We can take a blood sample and test it in the laboratory (you will get the result in about 2 weeks), or if you do not wish to know your results we can test the blood sample, but not give you the results. Because HIV is a treatable infection we recommend that you know your status, so that you can access treatmen t for the infection and live a healthy life. Our teams are trained in HIV pre - and post -test counselling and will provide this before and after testing. You may change your mind at any stage of the study and we can arrange for you to receive the latest HIV test results. Length of study and number of participants The study will be performed in South Africa only. We will enrol 200 hospitalised persons who have the corona virus identified. Your rights as a participant It is your right to choose if you want to take part in this study. If you chose not to participate this will not affect your right to health care, other services or your right to participate in future studies. Expected duration of participation The first visit will take about 1 hour this will include reading through this form, signing consent, collecting additional information on your signs and symptoms and collecting the initial samples. The follow -up visits will be about 30 minutes. As we will try to ar range these visits when it suits Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 47 - you, these visits may include weekend days. At each visit the study staff will tell you when the next visit will be and what you can expect at the next visit (just to remind you). Risks of this study There is minimal risk to you from participating in this study. You may find some of the questions uncomfortable. There may be minimal discomfort when we take the nasopharyngeal or throat sample. Some people may gag when we take the sample or experience a small nose bleed. However, the procedure only takes a few seconds. Venipunctures and finger pricks (i.e. drawing blood) are done as part of routine medical care and present a slight risk of discomfort. Drawing blood may result in faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site. There is also a slight possibility of infection. Your protection is that experienced personnel perform the procedures under sterile conditions. Testing for HIV may be stressful; we will have a trained counsello r to explain to you about the test and what the results will mean to you. We will also refer you directly into the treatment programme if you do test positive for HIV. Benefits of this study By taking part in this study, you will help us learn more about how certain infectious diseases affect different people and who may benefit from vaccines. You will have a chance to get the results of your HIV test and if you test positive for this infection, you will get the benefit of early treatment. As infection wit h coronavirus may be stressful, you will have regular contact with a nurse, who will be able to answer your questions about your illness and concerns. Confidentiality Every effort will be made to protect your confidentiality: study forms and blood samples will be marked with a number and not a name. Study staff will keep a log of people enrolled; these will be kept in secure locked offices. No reference to personal detail will be made in any study report or in the results of the study. Withdrawal f rom the study Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can decline to participate, or stop at any time, without stating any reason. Your withdrawal will not affect your access to other medical care. The investigators retain the righ t to withdraw you from the study if it is considered to be in your best interest. If you did not give an accurate history or did not follow the guidelines of the study and the regulations of the study facility, you may be withdrawn from the study at any t ime. Reimbursement for Participation You will not be paid to participate in this study, nor will there be any cost to you. The study will not pay for any care that you need for any illness diagnosed during this study.

Appendix IX: Infection control measures Infection control measures should be implemented in accordance with the National Guidelines for COVID -19 as follows: Key contact and droplet precautions include the following: isolate the patient (ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available, otherwise adequately ventilated single rooms) place patient in a separate room healthcare workers to use a medical (surgical/medical) mask and eye (goggles) or facial protection (face shield) heal thcare workers should wear a clean, non -sterile, long -sleeved gown and use gloves healthcare workers should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth with potentially contaminated gloves or bare hands limit movement of patient (eg. use designated portable X -ray equipment) routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the patient is in contact limit the number of healthcare workers, family and visitors in contact with suspected or confirmed cases Additional precautions to be used during aerosol -generating procedures include: performing procedures in an adequately ventilated room minimising respirator face -seal leakage to fully protect the worker from exposure to aerosolized infectious droplets whe n using particulate respirators e.g. N95 mask eye protection (goggles or face shield) to protect the eyes from respiratory splash or spray contact protection (non -sterile, long -sleeved gown and gloves) Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 52 - 10.10. Appendix X : Procedures for t he collection of oroph aryngeal ( throat ) and nasopharyngeal swabs Type of swabs Only nylon or rayon flocked nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs with perforated, flexible plastic shaft must be used for collection of specimens. There is evidence to suggest some benefit to using flocked swabs for recovery of pathogens over other types. An appropriate size of the nasopharyngeal swab should be used. Cotton -tipped, calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts should not be used as residues present in these materials may i nhibit PCR assays. Both swabs should be put in the same vial containing universal transport medium (UTM). Collecting the nasopharyngeal swab Gently insert nasopharyngeal flocked swab into the nostril aiming backwards, along the floor of the nasal cavity, until the nasopharynx is reached. Be careful not to insert swab upwards. If resistance is encountered during insertion of the swab, remove it and try the other nostril. The distance from the nose to the ear gives an estimate of the distance the swab should be inserted Gently rotate the swab and hold in place for a few seconds Slowly withdraw swab Unscrew and remove the cap from the tube with transport medium. Insert the swab directly into a vial containing universal transport medium (UTM) Break plastic shaft at the break point so that it can fit in the universal transport medium tube Close the tube with the lid Refrigerate at 2 -8 \u00b0C Collecting oropharyngeal swab (OPS) Keeping the same pair of gloves on, and holding the UTM with the nasoph aryngeal swab in, take a second flocked swab and open it at the plastic shaft Ask the patient to tilt their head back and open mouth wide Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 53 - Hold the tongue down with a tongue depressor Have the patient say \"aahh\" to elevate the uvula Swab each tonsil first, then posterior pharynx in a \"figure 8\" movement Avoid swabbing the soft palate and do not touch the tongue with the swab tip as this procedure can induce the gag reflex. Insert the swab directly into the same UTM vial containing the nasopharyngeal swa b Break plastic shaft at the break point so that it can fit in the universal transport medium tube Close the tube with the lid Refrigerate at 2 -8 \u00b0C Figure 2 : How to collect a nasopharyngeal swab (left) and oropharyngeal swab (right) Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 54 - 10.11. Appendix X I: Procedures for the collection of stool specimens Type of specimens to be collected Raw stool specimens will be collected from the nappy, underpants or bedpan of the patient. In cases where the stool is liquid and no solid material can be collected from a nappy, the whole nappy or the nappy liner/section of the nappy liner can be sent to the laboratory for analysis. In adults who are reluctant to provide a raw stool specimen, a damp wet -wipe tissue may be submitted, provided the stool material is visible on the wipe. Where a raw stool specimen cannot be obtained from the patient, a rectal swab with visible stool material (brown swab) may suffice for molecular testing. Materials and procedures for specimen collection Wooden tongue depressors may be used to scrape solid stool material out of the nappy and into a specimen container. In cases where the stool is liquid and no solid material can be collected from the nappy, scissors will be cleaned with an ethanol -based cleaner and used to cut out a stool -soiled section of the nappy liner. Forceps, cleaned with an ethanol -based cleaner, will then be used to transfer the nappy liner to a specimen container. Where cloth nappies are used, clean forceps will be used to transfer the nappy liner to a specimen container. Where the patient is collecting their own specimens using wet -wipes or rectal swabs, gloves and specimen collection materials will be provided. Collection containers Plastic specimen containers will be used for storage of raw stools or nappy liners. Eac h container should contain at least a 10 cm x 10 cm (palm sized) nappy liner, a R5 coin sized solid stool or 5ml liquid stool specimen. Ideally, surveillance officers will try to fill the containers with as much raw stool as possible as this permits the la boratory to conduct multiple tests. For specimens collected on damp wet -wipes and rectal swabs, surveillance officers must ensure that these collection devices have visible stool material to ensure sufficient specimen for molecular screening. Wet -wipes wil l be properly sealed in zip -lock bags and rectal swabs will be stored dry in plastic containers after the collection straw is cut to size. All collection containers will be marked with a unique identifier using stick -on labels supplied by the study. The co ntainer itself (not the cap) will always be marked with identifying details. Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 55 - Labelling of specimens As soon as the specimens are collected, a laboratory specimen form (Appendix VI ) will be completed for each patient. Laboratory specimen forms must be tra nsported with the specimen to the CRDM laboratory, preferably in a dual compartment specimen bag to avoid contamination of documentation should specimen contents leak from the primary plastic container. Spill clean -up procedure Surveillance officers will wear appropriate personal protective equipment including coats or plastic aprons and gloves during specimen collection. Any liquid or solid stool spills will be wiped up with paper towels and discarded in biohazard boxes. The area will be cleaned with an a ppropriate ethanol -based or disinfectant solution (10% bleach), discarding paper towels after use. All collection materials not discarded will be cleaned after each use. Specimen storage at study site Specimens will be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) at the stu dy sites and transported to the CRDM laboratory, NICD, using the NHLS transport system. Packaging and transport The samples should be packed properly to avoid leakage during transportation. The specimen container and zip -lock bags should be watertight. The zip-lock bags will be placed in a polystyrene cooler box (or equivalent) filled with frozen ice packs to maintain a cool temperature during transport to NICD.

Appendix X II: Procedures for the collection of blood specimens Blood collection for adults Specimens will be collected using the vacutainer collection system (see Figure 3 ): in older children and adults, as follows. By twisting, remove the bottom white cap ( D) of the needle. Now, firmly screw the needle in the needle holder/barrel ( B). Remove the top cap ( C) to ready the needle ( A) for use just before the sample is taken. Figure 3: The Vacutainer Needle & Barrel System Apply the tourniquet to the patient's arm (Figure 4a) and disinfect the site of venepuncture. Hold the needle holder betwe en thumb and index finger of the right hand and insert into the vein (Figure 4b). Now change the position of the hand i.e. fixes the needle holder on the patient's arm with the thumb and index finger of the left hand. The left hand now serves to keep the n eedle Immobilized in the vein during the different actions. Position the first tube in the holder (serum separator, yellow top tube) and press it onto the needle to allow the tube to fill (Figure 4c). Fill the first tube and remove once full (Figure 4d). Position the second tube in the holder (EDTA , purple top tube) and press it onto the needle to allow the tube to fill (Figure 4c). Fill the second tube and remove once full (Figure 4d).

Fill the third tube and remove once full (Figure 4d). (a) (b) (c) Figure 4: Collecting t he Sample Release the tourniquet then remove the needle from the patients arm and immediately apply pressure to the venipuncture site. Firm pressure at this time will minimize bruising and therefore discomfort and distress to the patient. Ask the patient to take over applying pressure to the site. Invert the tube(s) gently 6 to 8 times (See Figure 5).

Appendix X IV: Procedures for packaging and submission of specimens Step 1: Complete one follow -up laboratory slip (see Section 6.5.2.1 and Appendix VI) for all specimen collected and shipped together Step 2: Package specimens The principle of triple layer packaging should be follo wed (Figure 6 ). Figure 6. Example of the triple packaging system for the packing and labelling of Category B substances. It is required that designated staff members per site are trained by approved provider in the packaging and transport of dangerous goods. Primary specimen containers (properly labelled) should be wrapped in sufficient absorbent material (paper towels or tissues) to absorb the entire contents in the event of leakage. Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) viral shedding and clinical characterization protocol Version 1 .1:d 14 July 2020 HREC approval date: 28 July 2021 - 59 - The wrapped primary containers will be placed in durable, leak -proof secondary containers (i.e. rigid screw -cap plastic containers ). The secondary container will be taped closed to prevent leakage. The secondary containers and data forms, sealed separately in plastic, will be then be placed in a rigid outer (tertiary) container s uch as a fiber carton or polystyrene cold box with cold packs. The outer wrapping will be addressed to: NHLS/NICD Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis (CRDM) Lower North Wing, SAVP building 1 Modderfontein Rd, Sandringham, Johannesburg, 2131 South Africa The parcel should bear appropriate outer warning that it contains biohazardous material. Step 3: Submit specimens The specimens should be stored and shipped at t emperatures indicated in Table 3 below . Specimens should be packaged in accordance with the guidelines for the transport of dangerous biological goods (triple packaging using absorbent material) and transported directly and urgently. Transport specimens to NICD on same day as specimen collection. Please notify by email the CRDM staff below of any pending shipments: o Linda de Gouveia lindad@nicd.ac .za -6373) that the (i) complemented follow -up laboratory slip (Appendix VI) and (ii) all daily follow - up clinical forms (Appendix IV) completed from the last shipment accompanies the specimens . The case report form completed on enrolment (Appendix III) and the final outcome form(s) completed on transf er, discharge and/or cessation of shedding (Appendix V) should be shipped with the next sample shipment or immediately after completion if no specimens shipment will be done after completion of the form (i.e., form completed after cessation of shedding).
