The Ayurvedic approach is to work with the individual constitution (Vata, Pitta and Kapha and any combination of these three) and the unique presentation of your symptoms post vaccination or after a shedding incident. Use this guide below as a generic approach and remember that with the support of an Ayurvedic health practitioner your healing journey can be enhanced. Book your health consult via avida.co.nz 2. For the first 14 days post vaccination, the focus is on the removal of toxins and minimising the impact of the vaccine pathogens such as the spike protein, graphene oxide, liquid nanoparticles; clearing the channels and increasing digestive capacity with a special lifestyle and diet regime that helps to correct and increase agni (your digestive fire). When your internal fire is burning strong, your body is able to burn toxins. If you can't sustain the suggestions below for 14 days, then aim for 3 or 5 or 7 days or whatever your capacity allows you. 3. Rest Rest Rest . Take time off work if you can and allow yourself maximum amount of bed rest. The body knows how to heal itself, we just need to give it space and time. 4. Drink plenty of hot water (2-3Ltr) to help flush out the vaccine toxins and counteract the dehydrating effect of the lipid-nanoparticles which cause osmotic stress in your body. If you like you can add ginger or fennel seeds (they contain suramin) or cumin seeds to your hot water. 5. Keep warm and induce sweating . If you have access to a sauna, use it daily for as many days in a row as you can. If you don't have access to a sauna, then wrap yourself in woollen blankets, put 2-3 hot water bottles underneath the blankets and sit in front of a fireplace or a heater for 20-30min. 6. Eat the following kichari recipe as often as possible during the first 14 days - ideally three times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make a fresh batch every morning. Kichari is a whole complete meal in itself, it is so easily digestible that our digestive fire has capacity to deal with the toxins from the injection.

Eat whole foods - grains like rice, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, polenta, barley; nuts and seeds esp pumpkin seeds and brazil nuts; olives, legumes, pulses d. Eat lots of seasonal vegetables and fruits, and plenty of greens (the bitter taste in the greens help to purify your blood and act as a gentle liver detox) e. Eat organic, spray free, homegrown if you can - the vaccines contain enough genetically modified materials, don't add anymore to your system f. Go for nutrient density, every meal is a chance to nourish your whole being g. Avoid/reduce meat, sugar, alcohol, wheat, dairy, caffeine, processed food, heavy deep fried and left-over food; follow an anti-inflammatory diet 8.

Purging: after the Pippali detox has been completed, you engage in a purge to release the damaging vaccine particles. Depending on your physical strength and capacity, you may induce a colonic purge or an oral purge. Only after the purge, you can start taking other herbs.

The better and happier we feel - the higher our vibration. The higher our vibration the faster we heal.
