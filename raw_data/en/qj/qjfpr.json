I believe in Ayurveda, and it helps people recover from moderate illness. Often, we get those in our kitchen and kitchen garden, so it is economically cheap. In most cases, these treatments don't require any written prescription from a doctor. I remember in my childhood when we have stomach issues, and my grandma gave yogurt or buttermilk with cumin and salt, or lemon, salt, and sugar for vomiting and diarrhea. If we bumped our heads or got swelling because of some insect bite, cooked paste turmeric with onion was applied. Somebody got a cold and cough, tea made of tulsi leaves, and black pepper with a little salt or sugar was given, and in some families, ginger with jaggery. There are several holistic treatments across our country that might not be precisely similar from east to west and north to south. Still, the core is to utilize natural resources for treating acute illness. Our ancestors used hundreds and thousands or probably more of treatment recipes to treat their illnesses, and those were from nature like herbs, the bark of trees, seeds, spices, flowers, and many more. We are using several of them at present too. Okay, so what is the problem? Where is the gap that created so much buzz around when a famous company launched its product, alleging that it is a cure for COVID19? Rather than discussing the company's owners' claims and stepping back from it, I would like to bring attention to the state of Science in India. While this Patanjali buzz was going around, I saw an article on social media from a National Institute launching Immune booster herbal tea. The very first thought that came in was, \"okay! Good, there are people doing lab research in this area.\" But, when I looked to find more details and searched for their scientific results, this was also a claim only. There is no scientific data, and no experimental detail available in support of their interest. I was disheartened and disappointed to find it to be just a claim. As a scientist, this would be exciting for me when the team would have done, the studies of different molecular markers in human blood or even in-vitro in the presence of the tea extract in support of the above claim. To get some insight, I looked at the published literature to date available at NCBI-Pubmed, the contribution of India is only 1.5%. Further, when I started getting a closer look at the numbers or data available on the clinical trials, the world-wide total clinical trial reported is 229k however, the number of clinical trials from India is 2k, which is about 1%. The research papers published from India on herbal products in medicine are around 3%, from the United States of America, it is more than 7%, and from China, it is almost 50% of the total literature published. The next level data represent clinical trials on herbal products over the world, which is 3K for the globe, and India contributes to 1.8%, while China contributes the highest 43.6%. Perhaps this data will make us realize that we are behind in the domain that we have almost always taken as pride and applauded ourselves. So next time, when somewhere somebody establishes a milestone, we need to rethink our status at the world level as a country before taking our heads in clouds and taking pride in their long untiring efforts.
