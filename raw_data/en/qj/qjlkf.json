It is a study that focuses on family members and the achievement of satisfaction of each and every member through thoughtful effective and constructive use of resources. Home Science is both an \"art and science\" . This is because it teaches the art of using resources so that a harmonious whole someness is achieved and an overall pleasant effect is created. At the same time, it provides the scientific basis of techniques involved in making a home a happy healthy and beauti - ful place to live in. For example, the subject Home Science imparts knowledge about the different food groups, the nutrients present in them, the causes of nutrient deficiency and the dietary management of various diseases. This is the 'science' . However, the ability to prepare various recipes with required nutrients for a particular age group and serve it in a very attractive manner in a pleasant environment so as to motivate consumption of healthy foods and feeling of wellbeing is an 'art'. Interdisciplinary Nature of Home Science Home Science draws a major portion of its content from pure science disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and biology. It also draws its content equally from economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, community development, communication, media and technology. Hence, it is an interdisciplinary field with much scope as it encompasses the salient features and components of both science and arts courses. 1.2 EVOLUTION OF THE DISCIPLINE OF HOME SCIENCE In India, the study of Home Science can be traced back to the British rule between 1920 and 1940. The rulers in that period introduced Home Science in some schools and colleges. It was initially known as \"domestic science\" and was first introduced in Maharani Girl's High School, Baroda. Later the Home Science subject was included in various other states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and some southern states and thus the curriculum underwent changes over the years. Home Science has now been claimed to be an important subject in the school curriculum because it includes all significant areas of art and science which is crucial for the development of the individual, family and society. Although Home Science paved its ways into many schools all over India it was not offered at the college level for a very long time. Hence, many students were unable to pursue the study of Home Science at an advanced level. Lady Irwin College, Delhi was the first to introduce Home Science as a degree programme at college level in 1932.From 1938 onwards, Chennai University offered Home Science at the degree level. Queen Mary's College and Women's Christian College at Chennai started Home Science in 1942. Since 1950, a degree programme in Home Science was included at Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu), P . Devadass, Avinashilingam Homescience college has become a leading college in Chapter1_001-010.indd 2 18-01-2019 12:56:441 Concepts and Scope of Home Science 3South Asia in the fields of Homescience and Nutrition Initially there were few students who enrolled for the course. With the regular reconstruction of the curriculum based on the reforms in science, technology and art, there was found to be a steady increase in the number of students who enrolled for a degree in Home Science. At present thousands of post graduates and Ph.D degree holders are in prominent positions in prestigious institutions all over the country. Home Science has now been claimed to be one of the important subjects in the school curriculum because it offers fundamental opportunities to students to develop their potential for promoting the society and themselves. 1.2.1 Diploma Courses in Home Science Diploma course in Home science was offered by the Agricultural Institute of Allahabad in 1935. In 1950, Baroda became a significant nucleus and epicentre of Home Science education. In the mid 1960's and 1970's more Agricultural Universities were established throughout the country and a diploma course in Home Science was included in most of the Agricultural Universities. Eminent Pioneers in Home Science in India Dr. Rajammal P . Devadass, Dr. Flemmie.P Kittrell, Dr. Leela Shah and Ms. Dorothy Pearson. In 1951 the \" Home Science Association of India\" was formed. The constitution of the Home Science association was framed by Miss Dorothy Pearson of Women's Christian College, Chennai. Later the association became affiliated to the \" International Federation of Home Economics\". 1.3 COMPONENTS OF HOME SCIENCE There are five major components or areas of specialisation in Home Science. Foods and Nutrition Family Resource Management Textile and Clothing Human Development Communication and Extension The study of Home Science is so advanced that each specialization is a vast domain in its own ways with its areas of specialization and vocational/professional opportunities. Table- 1 emphasises the branches of Home Science along with specific areas dealt in each branch.

The first effort towards the study of the child based on direct observations were initiated by Darwin (1809-82) and Preyer (1841-97). They maintained careful notes on the development and behaviour of individual children over a period of years. Stanley Hall Human Development and its ChallengesChapter Learning Objectives (1844-1924) in United States of America, and Alfred Binet (1857- 1911) in France carried out scientific investigation to understand the causes of human behaviour. Hall studied the concepts of children and published his finding in the book \" The content of Childrens mind\" in 1883. The first intelligence scale was published in 1905 by Binet. A discipline This chapter will enable the students to Know about the various stages in life span, its meaning and subdivisions Gain knowledge about the characteristics of each stage in life span Understand the physical, social, emotional and cognitive changes in each stage Know the challenges faced by children with special needs Understand the challenges in adulthood and old age Chapter 2_011-045.indd 1 18-01-2019 13:20:592 Human Development and its Challenges 12of science called \"Human Development\" emerged in the twentieth century in order to understand the patterns of development from conception to the period of old age. In this chapter on human development we will be able to understand the stages in the life span of a human being, the developmental changes and developmental tasks in each stage starting from prenatal stage to old age. 2.2 DOMAINS AND STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT Physical Development: It includes the growth of the body and its organs during childhood, the appearance of physical signs of aging during adulthood, and the gains and losses in motor abilities that occur over the years. Motor Development: Motor development refers to the development of a child's bones, muscles and ability to move around and manipulate his or her environment . Motor development can be divided into two sections: gross motor development and fine motor development. Gross motor development involves the movement of the large muscles in the child's body. This movement including sitting, walking, running and climbing stairs. Fine motor development are those that involve the small movements of the fingers and hands. They include picking IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGIES IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Growth: It is defined as physical changes in body size, structure, bodily dimensions and increase in magnitude, muscular strength and organs. Development: It is a progressive series of changes in an orderly, coherent pattern whereby an individual adapts to their environment. Development includes physical characteristics (height, weight), intellectual functions (creativity, performance of intelligence) and social characteristics (independence, aggressiveness). Maturation: It is development of the organism as a function of time or age; it refers to neuro physiological and biochemical changes such as the time a child 's teeth erupts, the child 's developing ability to talk, walk etc. Learning and Experience: It is any relatively permanent changes in thought, feeling and behaviour caused by interaction with the environment. Maturation and Learning Interrelation: Learning and maturation cannot be isolated from each other. Development is the result of interaction of maturation and learning. This is clear in motor development especially in postural respons es, locomotion and manipulation. In summary, development is a multifaceted and complex process, involving gains and losses, growth and aging and more are brought about by both maturation and learning.

Social Development: Social development refers to the process by which a child learns to interact with others around them. Emotional Development: It refers to the ability to recognize, express, and manage feelings at different stages of life how and why they happen and to have empathy for the feelings of others. Cognitive Development: Cognitive development involves changes and stability in mental processes. Language Development: Language development is the use of arbitrary symbols in an orderly fashion to communicate verbally and individual's wants and needs. 2.2.1 Infancy Infancy is very critical and shortest of all developmental periods. Infancy is the second most rapid period of development and growth. Infancy begins with birth and ends when the infant in approximately two weeks old. Th is period is divided into two periods namely i. Period of the Partunate - from birth to fifteen to thirty minutes after birth. The infant continues to be a parasite until the umbilical cord has been cut and tied. p Fig. 1 Domains of development in the human life cycle Observe your friends and write down their physical activities. Observe differences among them.Activity 1 Chapter 2_011-045.indd 3 18-01-2019 13:21:002 Human Development and its Challenges 14Table 1 Stages in the Human development Prenatal period Conception to birth Infancy Birth to the end of the second week BabyhoodEnd of the second week to end of the second year Early childhood Two to six years Late childhood Six to twelve years Adolescence Twelve to Eighteen years Early adulthood Eighteen to forty years Chapter 2_011-045.indd 4 18-01-2019 13:21:012 Human Development and its Challenges 15Table 1 (continued) Middle age Forty to sixty years Old age After sixty years ii. Period of the Neonate - from cutting and tying of the umbilical cord to approximately the end of the second week of postnatal life. During this period, the infant must make adjustments to the new environment. a. Physical Development Infants differ greatly in appearance and physiological functions at birth and in their early adjustments after birth. Body Length and Weight At birth, the average infant weighs 3 to 3.5 kg and measures 50 cms (20 inches) in length. Weight in relation to height is less at birth. The muscles of the newborn are soft, small and uncontrolled. Physical Proportions Babies have a large head and prominent forehead, chubby cheeks and the chin is much too small. The nose is small and flat. The neck is short and almost invisible. The shoulders are narrow, while the abdomen is large and bulging. Hands and feet are miniature. With the birth cry, the lungs are inflated and respiration begins. Neonatal heart beat is more rapid. Elimination of waste products begins in a few hours after birth. The relative proportion is shown in figure 2. b. Motor Activities The first activities of human infant are random, imperfect and uncoordinated. The most common of these include visual fixation of light, spontaneous eye movement, sucking, swallowing, lifting the head, hand movements, leg and foot movements and body jerks. c. Sensory Abilities of the infant i. Sight At birth, the retina has not reached its full development. There is no coordination between both eyes. At about thirty hours, the papillary Collect photos/ Pictures of each stage of the life span and paste them on a chart. Ob - serve and record pattern of development. Activity 2 Chapter 2_011-045.indd 5 18-01-2019 13:21:022 Human Development and its Challenges 16p Fig. 2 Relative Proportions of a human being reflexes are well established. They can detect movement as early as two or three days after birth. At seventh or ninth day of life, they respond to different colours. ii. Hearing At birth, hearing is low because the middle ear has amniotic fluid. iii. Taste During the first week of life infants react differently to different tastes.iv. Smell Infants are able to sense the odours that adults can sense. v. Skin Sensitivities The skin sensations of touch, pressure, temperature and pain are present at birth. d. Adjustments during Infancy Every new born infant's adjustment to postnatal life is difficult at first. They must make 4 major adjustments before they can resume their developmental progress. i. Breathing During prenatal stage, the fetus is supplied oxygen through the umbilical cord. When the umbilical cord is cut aft er birth the infants must begin to breathe on their own. Th e infants take their fi rst breath immediately aft er birth as they cry since their lungs are fi lled with oxygen. ii. Temperature Changes Before birth, the infants are in temperature of 98o-100oF in the uterine sac, while temperature in p Fig. 3 Sensory abilities of infants Chapter 2_011-045.indd 6 18-01-2019 13:21:032 Human Development and its Challenges 17p Fig. 4 Adjustments during infancy the hospital or home may vary from 60 to 70\u00b0F. Newborns are usually kept warm by providing suitable warm clothing, warm bedroom or placed next to the mother's warm body. iii. Sucking and Swallowing Infant must now get nourishment by sucking and swallowing. These reflexes are perfectly developed at birth and are increased along with development. iv. Elimination The infant's organs of elimination begin to work soon after birth. After birth, defecation occurs at an average of 4 to 7 times and urination at an average of 18 times. d. Emotional Development of Infancy At birth, the emotions consist of only pleasure and pain. Pleasantness is expressed by relaxing of body and is elicited through patting, rocking, warmth and sucking. Unpleasantness is expressed by tensing of the body, kicking, wriggling and crying. e. Cognitive Development Newborns interact with their environment entirely through reflexive behaviours. They follow their instincts and involuntary reactions to get what they need: food, air, and attention. Babies begin to grow and learn about their environment through their senses. 2.2.2 Babyhood Babyhood continues from infancy to the second year. It is the true foundation age with rapid growth and development. a. Physical Development during Babyhood Height During babyhood, changes in the overall size of the child's body are more rapid than any other time aft er birth. Th e baby measures between 23 and 24 inches at four months, by the end of one year the baby measures between 28 and 30 inches and between 32 and 34 inches at two years. Weight During the fi rst year, weight changes are more than height changes. At four months the babies weight will double their birth weight and triple it at 1 year. At one year, babies weigh, on the average, three times as much as they did at birth, or approximately 10 kilograms. Increase in weight during babyhood comes mainly from an increase in fat tissue. Physical Proportions Growth of the head slows down in babyhood while the trunk and limb growth increases. Thus, the baby gradually becomes less top-heavy and appears more slender and less chubby by the end of babyhood. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 7 18-01-2019 13:21:032 Human Development and its Challenges 18 Bones The fusion of bones increases during babyhood. Calcification begins in the early part of the first year but is not completed until puberty. The soft spot on the skull (tontanelle) will be closed by the end of two years. and this leads to the baby's top heavy appearance. The cerebellum and the cerebrum triple its weight in one year. Immature cells, present at birth, continue to develop after birth but relatively few new cells are formed.There are 270 bones at birth, but adult humans have only 206 bones.DO YOU KNOW? Muscles and Fat Muscle fibers are present at birth but in very under developed forms. They grow slowly during babyhood and are weak. The fat tissue develops rapidly during babyhood due partly to the high fat content of milk. Body Builds Babies begin to form characteristic body builds from during their second year of life. The three most common forms of body build are ectomorphic, which tends to be long and slender, endomorphic, which tends to be round and fat, and mesomorphic which tends to be heavy, hard and rectangular. Te eth By the end of one year the baby has four to six temporary teeth and sixteen by the age of two. The teeth present in the front will emerge first and the molars which are situated at the back appears last. Nervous System The brain weight is one-eighth of the baby's total weight at birth. During the first 2 years, brain weight is gained By the end of 2nd year a baby will have more than 100 trillion synapses. Name the synapses present in the baby? DO YOU KNOW? By three months, the eye muscles are well developed and babies can see things clearly. They can also see colours. Hearing develops rapidly during this stage. Smell and taste are improved during babyhood. Babies are highly responsive to all skin stimuli because all sense organs relating to touch, pressure, pain, and temperature are present in well-developed forms. At birth babies can taste sweet, bitter and sour, but cannot taste salt until they are 4 months old.DO YOU KNOW?p Fig. 5 Types of Body buildECTOMORPH MESOMORPH ENDOMORPH Chapter 2_011-045.indd 8 18-01-2019 13:21:032 Human Development and its Challenges 19b. Motor Skills Development during Babyhood. After the fast growth spurt in infancy, the growth rate of the baby is slow. Motor development means the ability to control movement of several parts of the body through coordinated movement of muscles and limb. The sequences of postural control and locomotion among babies as reported by Schiamberg are as follows In this sequence of development it can noted that the development proceeds from head to foot as shown in figure 6 c. Social Development The baby begins to communicate with others by gestures and also develops close relation with care givers like mother and father. At about five weeks of age, the baby smiles in response to patting. By the second month it recognizes his/her mother and by the third month the baby will turn its head in response to human voice. Once the babies get attached to their mother they show fear on separation. d. Emotional Development Until use of language begins, it is emotions that make adults know the needs of baby. As age increases, emotions become less diffused and more specific and differentiated in relation to cause, and they can be aroused by a wide variety of stimuli. It is shown in figure 7 e. Cognitive Development According to Piaget's theory babyhood is the \"sensory motor\" stage. Babies understand the permanence of objects and people. They visually follow the displacement of objects and begin to use instruments and tools. They also understand discipline and what behaviour is appropriate and in appropriate. They also understand the concepts of words like \"please\" and \"thank you\" . f. Language Development Language development is an important means of becoming independent for the baby. It gives him a new power to communicate their feeling to others. Before the baby speaks words, they show the ability to produce vowel and consonants sounds.Table 2 Postural Control and Locomotion during Babyhood Age Development 1st month Holds chin up 2nd month Holds chest up Rolls from side to back 3rd month Reaches and misses object 4th month Sits with support. 5th month Sits on lap and grasp objects 6th month Sits on high chair and grasp dangling object 7th month Sits alone and starts to crawl 8th month Stands with help 9th month Stands holding furniture 10th month Creep 11th month walking with support 12th month Pulls to stand by using furni- ture 13th month Climb stairs 14th month Stands alone 15th month Walks alone Source: Schiamberg L.B (1985) Human Development, II Edition, Macmillan Publishing Company, New Y ork.

These two along with gestures are known as pre -speech forms. By six months he/she produces most of the vowels and few consonants sounds.2.2.3.1 Early Childhood 1. Pattern of Development in Early Childhood Growth during early childhood proceeds at a slow rate when compared with the rapid rate of growth in babyhood. a. Physical Development in Early Childhood i. Height The average annual increase in height is 2.5 inches. By the age of six, the average child measures 46.6 inches (118.36 centimeters). CHILDHOOD LATE CHILDHOOD (6 TO 12 YEARS)EARLY CHILDHOOD (2 TO 6 YEARS)Cooing - quick burst of squealing noise. Babbling - production of inartic - ulate meaningless speech sounds which are sequences of vowels and consonants such as da-da-da. g. Physiological Function Babyhood is the time when the fundamental physiological patterns of eating, sleeping and elimination should be established, even though the habit formation may not be completed when babyhood ends. 2.2.3 Childhood Childhood begins at the conclusion of babyhood and extends to the time when the child becomes sexually mature at thirteen years for girls and fourteen for boys. Childhood period is now divided into - early and late childhood. Two year old babies can understand 100 to 150 words and start to add about 10 new words per dayDO YOU KNOW? ii. Body weight The average annual increase in weight is around 1.6-2.3 kilograms. At age six, children should weigh approximately 7 times as much as they did at birth. An average girl weighs 25-30 kilograms and boy weighs 30-32 kilograms. iii. Body proportions Body proportions change markedly and the baby look disappears. Facial features look small but chin becomes more pronounced and neck elongates. The stockiness of the trunk is decreased and the abdomen appears flat. Chest and shoulder become broader and flatter. Muscle begins to form and growth of the head slows down. Arms and legs lengthen and hands and feet grow bigger. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 11 18-01-2019 13:21:042 Human Development and its Challenges 22calcify at different rates in different parts of the body. Bones become harder and stronger, giving the child a firmer shape and protecting internal organs. vi. Te eth At the beginning of early childhood the baby has all of their milk teeth. In the last year of early childhood iv. Body build Children have an endomorphic or mesomorphic or ectomorphic type of body build based on their gene make up, diet and physical activities. v. Bones Bone development consist of growth in bone size, change in the number of bones and composition. The bones The most important activity of Anganwadi Centre (AWC) under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme is growth monitoring of children from birth to five years. Growth monitoring means keeping a regular track of the growth and development of the child with the help of plotting the child's weight, taken every month or quarter, on the growth chart and joining these weight points with a line to form the growth curve. In the following chart green coloured zone denotes normal body weight, yellow coloured zone denotes moderately underweight and reddish orange coloured zone denotes severely underweight.DO YOU KNOW? Chapter 2_011-045.indd 12 18-01-2019 13:21:062 Human Development and its Challenges 23the baby loses its milk teeth which are replaced by permanent teeth. The permanent teeth to appear first are the front central incisors. When early childhood ends the child has one or two permanent teeth in front and some gaps where permanent teeth will eventually erupt. vii. Nervous and Muscular system The growth of the nervous system is very rapid during babyhood and slows down at 3-4 years. Development of immature to mature cells occurs at this stage. These changes are coordinated by the maturing brain and the nervous system promotes the development of a wide range of motor skills. The brain is about 75 percentage of its adult weight at five years and is 90 percentage of adult weight at eight years. viii. Sensory Organs The growth of the eyeball is not complete until puberty so young children tend to be far sighted. Vision and focusing ability improves considerably as children grow through these years. The need for corrective lenses becomes more noticeable in early childhood.b. Motor Development During the first four or five years, the child gains control over gross and fine movement. Table 3 summarizes the development of motor skill. Artistic expression seems to peak by the end of the early childhood period. During these years, children begin to paint and hold the brush with thumb and fingers. They give names to their drawings and begin to represent things. c. Social development This age is characterized by the widely expanding world and awareness of people and things. They learn how to make social contact and get along with people outside the family, especially with peer group (children of their own age). Play is an important part of social development. By the age of 3-4 years they learn to adapt and cooperate in group play activities. This increases his/her social contact which increases the chances for social behaviour of others. i. Social Behaviours Imitation- Children imitate the attitudes and behaviour of a person whom they especially admire and want to be like. Table 3 Motor Development - Gross Skill and Fine Skill Age Gross Skills Fine Skills 2 years Hops, climbs stairs with altering feet, jumps from bottom stepCopies circle, opposes thumb to finger, scrib - bling continues to improve. 3 years Runs well, skillful jumping, begins to skip, pedals tricycleHold pencil, walks balance beams 4 years Hops about 50 feet, balance on one foot, can catch large ball, skippingColors within lines, forms letters, dresses and undresses self with help, eats more readily 5 years Carries bundles, begins to ride bicycle, jumps rope, can catch tennis ballTies shoes, uses scissors, uses knife and fork, and washes self with help. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 13 18-01-2019 13:21:062 Human Development and its Challenges 24 Sharing- Sharing and caring will win social approval. Children learn this while playing with friends. ii. Unsocial Behaviors Negativism- The habit of contradicting elders starts between 3 and 4 years and then it declines. Aggressiveness- The physically aggressive behaviour that begins by the age of 2, normally declines by the age of 4 giving way to verbal attacks like name calling or blaming others. Bossiness- Children become more authoritative at the age of 3. Destruction- The children display their temper by destroying anything within their reach. d. Emotional Development The emotional expressions of children differ from those of adults. Emotions can be broadly classified as positive emotions (integrative) and negative emotions (disintegrative). Such emotions are joy, affection, curiosity and sympathy. Negative emotions on the other hand give an unpleasant feeling and disliked by others. The examples of such negative emotions are anger, fear, jealousy, envy, grief and anxiety. e. Cognitive Development The mental development that occurs in early childhood is exciting and dynamic as children explore their environment, develop ideas, learn solutions to problems, participate in imaginary play, and gain a unique understanding of the world and how it operates. Children make judgments based on a limited understanding of operations and rules and with minimal cues and information. Y oung children may have trouble telling Rivalry- Children feel an urge to out-do others at home and outside. Co-operation- Children at the end of the third year learn to socialize and co- operate with their peer group. Th eir inclination to play with other children increases. Sympathy- Play contacts develop sympathetic attitudes in children. This helps in understanding feelings and emotions of others.HANDEDNESS Early childhood may be regarded as a critical period in the establishment of handedness. During this period, chil- dren shift from the use of one hand to the other and are asked to concentrate on learning skills with one dominant hand and other as the auxiliary or helping hand. For example in case of colouring, the dominant hand is used for colouring and the auxiliary to hold the paper. Handedness Chapter 2_011-045.indd 14 18-01-2019 13:21:062 Human Development and its Challenges 25the difference between what is real and what is fantasy. With increased ability to ask questions in words, they understand people, objects and situation rapidly. After this, the child obeys commands but does not understand why things are right or wrong. f. Language Development Early childhood is known as \"the chatter box age\" because children are able to speak with ease. They may use gestures but mainly as supplements to speech. During early childhood, there is a strong motivation to learn to speak. At approximately 2 years of age, their ability to use language suddenly increases rapidly. The formation of sentences follows a fairly definite and predictable pattern in early childhood. Two to three year old children usually use short sentences of three or four words. Many of the sentences are incomplete. 2.2.3.2 Late Childhood Late childhood extends from the age of six years to the time the individual becomes sexually mature. This period is marked by conditions that profoundly affect a child's personal and social adjustment. The child enters school and experiences a major change in the life pattern. Physical Development Late childhood is a period of slow and uni - form growth until the changes of puberty begins. Height and Weight- The child 's height and weight approximately reaches 2/3rd of adult height. Both boys and girls can be expected to grow about two to three inches each year. The average height for boys is slightly greater than that of girls throughout this period. However a girl's average height between ten and twelve years exceeds that of boys. At the onset of puberty, an average 11 years old girl has a height of 58 inches while an average boy of the same age has little lesser than that. By 6 years of age, most children are about seven times their birth weight. Weight increase is at the rate of 1.3 to 2.3 kg. The average 11 year old girl weighs 40.1 kg and an average boy of the same age weighs 38.7 kg. Body proportions- Body shapes of individuals are characterized by a greater proportion of body fat to muscle among females, while the opposite is true for males. Facial disproportions disappear as the mouth and jaw become larger, the forehead broadens and becomes slimmer, the neck becomes longer, the chest broadens, the abdomen flattens, the arms and legs lengthen and hands and feet grow larger but at a slow rate. Muscle development- The increasing level and desire for physical activity in middle childhood reflects the increasing size and strength of a child's muscle. Gain in weight is due to increase in size of skeletal, Mary is 46 inches tall and weighs 18 kilograms at the end of six years. From these observations what is your inference about her weight and body type? Answer: Mary is under weight and she has an ectomorphic body build due to being under weight Chapter 2_011-045.indd 15 18-01-2019 13:21:072 Human Development and its Challenges 26muscular systems and some organs. Muscle mass and strength gradually increases as \"baby fat\" decrease in middle and late childhood. Throughout the middle years muscle growth tends to be extremely rapid, and they are firmly attached to the bones. Eye-hand coordination also improves and by twelve years of age, most children have highly coordinated muscles. Bone development- As the child approaches sexual maturity, the rate of bone development will quicken in response to stimulation due to sex hormones that are produced in large quantities. The length and width of the bones increase. In late childhood, bones are hardened and reach a final mature shape. Development of Teeth- The primary teeth that erupted during infancy and early childhood are lost from the age of six up to thirteen years. All milk teeth are replaced with primary teeth. Girls are found to have permanent teeth earlier than boys. Brain Development- About 90% of adult brain size is achieved by age six. During late childhood, brain development includes the organization of brain functioning and myelination. Functions of the right and left hemisphere become well established during this age group.spend more time in free, unstructured activities, rough games and vigorous play such as wrestling, kicking and chasing. By 6 years, most children can skip rope and begin to ride a bicycle and by 7 years most begin to perfect the movement necessary for catching, throwing, swimming and hitting ball. They develop flexibility in different parts like wrists and legs. 3. Social development A number of changes in social development occur in the late childhood years. Besides the parents and the family members, the peer group comes to take an important place in the child's life. Creation of childhood gangs- Upon beginning schooling, children enter the \"gang age\" when social consciousness develops rapidly. It is characterized by interest in peer activities and an increasingly strong desire to be an accepted member of a gang. Over sensitiveness- A common out - growth of susceptibility to social approval and disapproval is over sensitiveness. The tendency to be eas - ily hurt by peers or siblings or parents and to interpret what others say and do as hostile, is a measure of the children's desire for social acceptance. Responsibility- Children who learn to assume responsibility at home not only make better adjustment with their peer group but also are likely to be selected for leadership roles. 4. Emotional development in late childhood Temper Tantrum Tantrum or temper tantrum is an emotional outburst of children. It is typically characterized by crying and screaming. Myelination is the deposition of fatty substance around nerve cells which helps in conduction of electrical impulses. 2. Motor development during late childhood Children are eager to participate in activities that require large muscle movements. They Chapter 2_011-045.indd 16 18-01-2019 13:21:072 Human Development and its Challenges 27Children in the first grade, on average know about 20,000 to 24,000 words. By the sixth grade they will know about 50,000 words. Not only do older children learn new words, they also tend to learn new meanings for old words. The length of sentences increases from 6 years. The characteristic chatterbox stage of early childhood is replaces by more controlled and selective speech. Anger Anger is expressed when needs are not fulfilled. It is expressed through screaming, withdrawal, destructive and disrespectful behaviour. Fear Fear is still found in late childhood. A large proportion of the fears shown in childhood persist into the adulthood. Anxiety Children's anxiety increases somewhat with maturity. This anxiety makes children bored, restless and disturbed and they cannot concentrate. They feel insecure and show their anxiety by nervous mannerism and speech problems. 5. Cognitive Development As a child develops there are considerable changes in his mental abilities which include imagination, memory, creativity, questioning and perception. They can also develop a plan to meet desired goal. They have a better understanding of spatial concepts of causality of categorization of inductive reasoning. Children begin to read and write and start gaining skills in reading and writing. 6. Language Development Linguistic skills are improved or acquired by an individual with the help of parents and from the world outside the family such as television, radio, books and peers. Harish has difficulty to do home work, cannot do quiet tasks or activities. He dashes around, touching or playing with anything and everything in sight and is very impatient. He also blurts out inappropriate comments, shows his emotions without restraint, and acts without regard for consequences. From above case study what are your inferences about his condition? What is the specific name given to this condition? Answer: Harish is hyper active and his condition is called as \" Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\" . 2.2.4 Children Wth Special Needs All children are 'unique' yet similar to one another in most aspects of growth. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 17 18-01-2019 13:21:072 Human Development and its Challenges 28Baker, a well-known psychologist defines the disabled child as \"one who deviates from what is supposed to be an average child in physical, mental, emotional and social characteristics to such an extent that the child requires special educational services to help develop to the maximum capacity\" . Categories of Disabled/Disadvantaged Children: The disabled children can be broadly grouped into three categories. These are: a. Physically disabled children. b. Mentally disadvantaged children. c. Socially maladjusted children. Causes of Disability among Children: The various causes of physical disability are as follows: a. Heredity b. Unfavorable environment c. Injury during child birth d. Accidents during early childhood causing orthopedic problems. e. Surgery requiring the amputation of the diseased part. f. Mental and emotional problems in early childhood result in stam- mering, stuttering and speech defects. g. Ear infections and injuries result- ing in hearing defects. h. Psychological, emotional problems and feelings of neglect result in behavioural problems. 2.2.4.1 Visual Impairment: Vision is a critical tool that children use in obtaining information about the world in which they live. Impairment of vision can lead to partial or total blindness. Th e children with visual impairment will need However, some children are very diff erent from their age-mates that they 'stand out' . Such children have to deal with the normal/ usual problems of growth along with all those di culties that may arise because of being 'diff erent' . Th e child is unable to deal with the social and emotional problems associated with it. Th is has marked eff ect on the child's personal and social development. Normal Child and Disabled/ Disadvantaged Child A normal healthy child is able to grow and do things to equip him/her for future life. A child who is not able to withstand the challenges of day-to-day life is generally referred to as handicapped/disabled or disadvantaged children. Th ey are also known as children who are 'diff erently abled ' . Chapter 2_011-045.indd 18 18-01-2019 13:21:072 Human Development and its Challenges 29special materials and attention to develop fully. Causes of Visual Impairment Visual impairment can be caused by the following factors: a. Congenital Blindness: It refers to a child being born blind. b. Acquired Blindness: In this case the child is not born blind. The child may lose eye-sight on account of some accident. The resulting eye-defect is called acquired blindness. c. Nutritional blindness: It is a result of prolonged absence of vitamin-A rich foods in the diet. Deficiency of vitamin-A causes dryness of eyes, (xerophthalmia) and impaired vision in dim light (night blindness). Special Needs of a Visually Challenged Child: Physical Needs: Parents of a visually challenged children have to give special attention and train their children to do their daily routine jobs like toilet, bath, dressing and feeding etc. Special effort is needed to help them to move around the house without knock - ing things and hurting themselves. Emotional and Social Needs: Parents and siblings need to develop social contact and provide constant reassurance by hugging, petting and reassuring the handicapped child when scared and emo - tionally upset. Educational Needs: Books with big print and a desk with proper light and recorded tapes are of considerable help to the child with defective vision. The special tool called \"Braille\" is also helpful. The Braille dots are punched out one at a time from right to left. Children learn to use Braille with ease once coached properly. White cane day is celebrated worldwide on October 15th every year. This is cele - brated to create awareness and celebrate the importance of the white cane used by visually challenged people.DO YOU KNOW? 2.2.4.2 Hearing Impairment Definition A child with hearing impairment is one who has lost the sense of hearing before learning the language. This means that the child is born without the ability to hear. Such children are often mute and silent. Hard of hearing on the other hand is a defect that is acquired later in life. The child experiences varying degrees of hearing loss. Causes of hearing impairment Hearing impairment and loss can be due to the following factors: (a) Conductive hearing impairment The passage of air in the outer ear is called the 'Conductive Pathway' . The conductive pathway can get affected due to i. Build up of wax in the ear, ii. A foreign body in the pathway iii. Any swelling of the outer ear. These conditions can cause temporary hearing impairment that can be medically treated. (b)Sensory Neutral hearing loss is due to the damage of the ear drum, cochlea, auditory nerve and the associated brain cells. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 19 18-01-2019 13:21:072 Human Development and its Challenges 30(c)Mixed Hearing Loss is a result of hearing impairments arising due to a combination of conductive and sensory neural defects. Characteristics of a Child with Hearing Impairment: The child may be speech impaired besides having hearing impairment. They may have difficulty in learning language/vocabulary. It is an enormous challenge to learn to communicate in a language one cannot hear. Special Needs of a Child with Hearing Impairment Hearing defects cause a lot of problems ranging from language and vocabulary to comprehension and communication. Physical needs can be eff ectively taken care of by providing physical comfort. Parents can use play way techniques to help child. Emotional and Social Needs: Suspicion is almost the second nature with deaf children. Their social behaviour also needs to be improved and refined. Love and affection provide emotional security besides the much needed encouragement for better learning. Educational Needs involve child's ability to understand the language. They learn to communicate through visual and manual means. i. Oral Method or Lip-Reading is a slow method involving a lot of patience for the learner as well as the educator. ii. Manual Method or Sign Language helps the child to communicate with gestures, cues and finger-spellings. 2.2.4.3 Orthopedic Impairment A child with an affected limb is not able to fully perform the activities involving the use of bones, muscles and joints. Similar handicap is experienced by children with a missing limb. Such children are known to be orthopedically crippled. Characteristics of A Child With Affected / Missing Limb Physical defect leads to inferiority complex among young children. The feelings of inadequacy result in self-pity. The child often goes through psychological trauma because of discrepancy between his/her aspirations and the ability to perform. Special Needs of Children with Missing / Affected Limbs Physical Needs consist of being able to cope with one's daily routine. Th e attitude of parents should help the child do his/her duties independently rather than \"do things for them\" . Use of special contraptions like calipers, shoes and artifi cial limbs along with proper training has yielded very good results. Use of crutches and wheel chair improves the mobility besides boosting their confi dence. Social and Emotional Needs . Children with aff ected limbs are very oft en left out of social group activities. Th e child may feel frustrated, dejected and neglected. Loving care and proper training to be independent and self-reliant are the basic needs of all handicapped children. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 20 18-01-2019 13:21:082 Human Development and its Challenges 31tonsils, adenoids, etc. Motor activities, dramatic play of all kinds, excursions, discussing and planning group activities will help in developing correct speech patterns. Educational Needs Classes under special teachers will be use - ful for correction of pronunciation Emotional needs Children should be given opportunities to listen to stories. The teacher and par - ents should always make it a point to pro - nounce words clearly themselves. 2.2.4.5 Mentally Challenged Children The intelligence possessed by a normal individual is said to be between 90 and 110 I.Q. Some children possess less than average intelligence and they are said to be mentally challenged or mentally handicapped. Meaning of I.Q. The letters IQ stand for Intelligence Quotient. It is a measure of intelligence. The formula used to calculate the I.Q. is ma ca \u00d7 100. MA stands for Mental Age and CA stands for Chronological Age. The mental age of a person is found out by intelligence tests. If the mental age corresponds with his chronological age or the physical age, then his mental growth is said to be normal. The mentally retarded children have a lower mental age than their chronological age. Classification of mentally challenged people Depending on the I.Q possessed, mentally challenged people/children are classified as slow learners, challenged, moderately challenged and severely challenged. Educational Needs involve and include such activities that require 'doing' . Writing, playing, drawing, painting, knitting and even dancing are some much activities. 2.2.4.4 Children with Impaired Speech The main purpose of speech is effective communication. When speech is defective communication is also defective. Causes of Speech Defects There are many causes for speech defects. They are as follows: a. Physiological causes : Defects and deformities of the larynx and the vocal cords affect the speech produced. Incomplete development of the skull and head produces a cleft palate and cleft lip which produce speech defects b. Neurological causes . When nerves connected with the areas of speech and learning process are impaired, some type of speech defect or disorder of articulation occurs c. Psychogenic Causes . These are causes related to one's mind. Some types of stuttering are purely psychogenic in origin. General self consciousness added with speech defect may produce stuttering. d. (d) Sociological causes . Some speech habits such as too rapid or too slow speech, or speaking in the low tones insisted by the parent may lead to speech defects. Special need of children with speech defects Physical needs Surgery can correct some of the physiogenic causes like cleft palate, extremely enlarged Chapter 2_011-045.indd 21 18-01-2019 13:21:082 Human Development and its Challenges 32Children who are mildly retarded are referred to as educable. Those who are moderately challenged are called trainable. Those who are severely and profoundly challenged are called totally dependent. The characteristics of mentally challenged children a. Physical traits- For majority of them, their height and weight is normal for their respective ages. Muscular control is fairly well developed. Senses are well developed but occurrence of speech defects such as stammering and lisping is fairly large among these children. b. Other traits- Socially they are found to be less adjustable. Vocabulary is very much limited. They find adjustment to new situations difficult. Causes of Mental Challenges in Individuals The causes may be endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous type mainly consists of hereditary conditions. Defect in the germ cell produces a retarded condition called microcephaly. Defects in the nerv - ous system and weaker nerve potential inherited also lead to mental challenges. Marriage between men and women who are close blood relatives is said to lead to mental challenges in their children. Exogenous causes for mental challenges includes venereal diseases in the mother, brain injury at birth and various forms of anoxia at the time of birth. Toxic conditions in older mothers during pregnancy causes mongolism. Thyroid deficiency in children causes cretinism or dwarfism. Brain injury due to accidents, brain fever in the new born, also lead to mental challenges after birth. Needs of Mentally challenged Children. Proper prenatal care including immunization, good diet, and medical check-up delivery attended by a trained person, preferably hospital delivery and proper weaning foods for the baby will reduce the incidence of individual attention and instruction. In the case of slow learners they need more help and stimulation. The teacher needs to give clear direction and encouragement. The learning process must be made simple and more of concrete examples must be used. 2.2.5 Adolescence - Growth and Development WHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS LESSON? Who is an adolescent? Classification and definition of the adolescent period Characteristic changes during adolescence Definition Adolescence is derived from the Latin word \"adolescere\" meaning to grow into maturing. The World Health Organisation defines adolecence as any person between the age of 10 and 19. It is between childhood and adulthood and is closely related to the teen age years. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 22 18-01-2019 13:21:082 Human Development and its Challenges 33Stages of adolescence in boys and girls Adolescence may be divided into three stages namely pre adolescene, early adolescence and late adoelscence Table 4 Stages in Adolescence Stages in adolescence Girls (years) Boys (years ) Pre-adolescence 17-21roles they are expected to play as they are neither children nor adults. (ii) Period of change The stage of adolescence is characterized by changes in physical, cognitive, social and emotional areas of their lives. This sets them apart and uniquely distinguishes them from other stages (a) Physical changes During adolescence, primary sex characteristics (the reproductive organs) develop and mature and secondary sex characteristics appear. Primary Sex characteristics- In males, the testes grow rapidly during the first year or two of puberty. After that, the penis starts to grow in length and the seminal ducts and the prostate gland enlarge. The female uterus, fallopian tube and vagina grow rapidly through puberty. The ovaries produce ova and secrete the hormones needed for pregnancy, menstruation and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The secondary sex characteristics are those which are not directly tied to reproduction yet distinguish the male from the female species. The secondary ADOLESCENTS Persons between 10and 19 years of age The period of adolescence is extremely important in one's life because at this stage, one moves from childhood to the onset of maturity. In every period of development from birth onwards a person may face many challenges due to the changes that occur during that period. Each phase in life has distinct characteristics. Characteristics of the Adolescent Period (i) Transitional period Adolescence is a period of transition. During this phase the individuals status is vague and there is a confusion about the Table 5 Secondary sex characteristics in adolescent boys and girls Secondary sex characteristics Girls Boys Breasts develop Pubic hair appear Pubic hair appear Axillary hair appear Axillary hair appear Facial hair and body hair appear Increased width and depth of pelvisVoice change Source: Lefton, 1985 Chapter 2_011-045.indd 23 18-01-2019 13:21:082 Human Development and its Challenges 34sex characteristics between boys and girls are given in the table above: (b) Cognitive changes in adolescents . In this stage, adolescents develop the ability to process information, improve in areas of decision making, memory, critical thinking and self-regulatory learning. This is known as the 'Formal Operation Stage of Development' (c) Social Changes and Development During Adolescence Friendship during adolescence is based on similarities and interests . The common social groups in adolescence is as follows: Chums- close friends - They are inseperable companions as confidants Cliques - They are made up of groups of close friends Crowds - they are made up of cliques and close friends Organised groups - Th ese groups are planned by orgainised sectors like schools, churches or community centres Gangs- Th ey are a group of boys and/or girls who are poorly adjusted to society Who are your chums? - What criteria do you have to select your confidants? How many members are there in your clique? What are your common interests? Are you part of an organized group? List any three social causes addressed by your group.WHAT IS COGNITION? It is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understand- ing through experiences.p Fig. 8 Characteristics of the adolescent period Individual activity 3 Chapter 2_011-045.indd 24 18-01-2019 13:21:092 Human Development and its Challenges 35Every 5th person in India is an adolescent - Hence adolescents are a very precious segment of the population. DO YOU KNOW? Significant changes in the area of social development occur in the period of adolescence with regard to their peers and relationship with adults. Relationship with peers- Adolescents are very much influenced by their peer group. Their behaviour and attitude are affected by peers. Relationship with adults - Adolescents develop values different from the ones held by adults because the influence of peer group is more than that of adults. Hence the adolescent is torn between his loyalty to his parents and peers. Their values often clash with those of adults and many rebel against parental authority Compare And Contrast Any Six Values Between Adults And Present Generation Adolescents Values Opinion of adults Opinion of adolescents emotional experience. This period is often known as the \"period of storm and stress\" . The word storm and stress suggest anger and turmoil. (d) Emotional changes Adolescence is said to be a period of heightened emotionality. Heightened emotionality is a state of more than normal Causes for Heightened Emotionality The major causes for heightened emotion - ality are as follows: Psychological problems due to phys - ical changes - Sudden spurt in height, appearance of secondary sex characteris - tics, voice change, appearance of pimples and acne, on the face. etc. cause much embarrassment to them and they become worried about their physical appearances. Social expectations- Adolescents are treated neither as a child nor as an adult. The constant pressure to live up to social expectations causes a generalized state of anxiety in them. Unrealistic aspirations- Adolescent aspirations are sometimes unrealistic. When they are not able to attain them they feel inferior and frustrated. Urge for sex- Reproductive hormones are active and so there is the presence of sex urge. This may lead to anxiety. Identity crises- The adolescent is expected to form a realistic self- concept. They have to try out different roles and develop a holistic idea of their future role. Until they find their role they are often confused and anxious Activity 4 Chapter 2_011-045.indd 25 18-01-2019 13:21:092 Human Development and its Challenges 36 Unfavorable family relationships- Conflicts often occur between adults and adolescents due to the generation gap between them. (iii) Adolescence is a problem age Adolescence is known as a problem age because they are faced with many challenges that arise due to the anatomical, psychological changes. This is further enhanced by peer pressure and conflicts with parents and elders. Most of these problems are aggravated due to misleading and misguiding parents, teachers and friends, ignorance of elders, being half informed or ill-informed about the realities in life and wrong messages and concepts depicted though the media (iv) Adolescence is period when there is search for identity Adolescence is the period of transition between childhood and adulthood. It is a stressful and confusing period because at times they are expected by the society to think and behave in mature manner. At the same time, they are often reprimanded for the same and are demanded to be meek and submissive as they are under the control of parents, elders and teachers. The conflicts that arise due to this, cause a lot of stress among adolescents as they are confused whether they should be like children or behave as adults. (v) Adolescence is a time of unrealism Many adolescents have unrealistic goals and aspirations. They live in an imaginary world. These unrealistic thinking pattern may often lead to anxiety and depression especially when they are not able to fulfill their goals. For this purpose, it is important for parents, teachers and elders to guide adolescents into identifying their strengths, weakness, opportunities and National Youth Day is celebrated in India on 12 January on the birthday of Swami Vivekananda. In 1984 the Government of India declared the day as the National Youth Day and since 1985 the event is celebrated in India every year. To quote from the Government of India's communication, 'it was felt that the philosophy of Swamiji and the ideals for which he lived and worked could be a great source of inspiration for the Indian Youth.' challenges and help them set realistic goals based on available resources JUVENILE DELINQUENCY Delinquency is a problem associated with the period of adolescence. It is engaging in activities which are against law and are punishable. When a delinquent act is committed by a child or young person before the age of age of 18 it is called juvenile delinquency. A list of delinquent act by minors include committing theft of valuables, burglary, looting, black mailing, murdering, raping, leading immoral life like prostitution, drinking, gambling, smuggling, drug addiction and anti-social acts like damaging public utilities etc. Causes of delinquency i. Personal causes- A person's physical defects, aggressiveness and low intelligence make a person prone to delinquency. ii. Family causes- Children from broken homes lack love and affection and a feeling of security. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 26 18-01-2019 13:21:092 Human Development and its Challenges 37 Prevention of delinquency Satisfactory adult-adolescent relationship, absence of feeling of rejection and presence of love and affection among members of the family will be of much help in preventing delinquency. Community efforts by parent teachers association, schools, religious institutions, social workers, counselors and voluntary organizations play a major role in guiding children. Mass media such as radio, television and newspaper should educate parents and the society on proper treatment of children. Educational Institutions can have programmes such as \"Earn While Y ou Learn\" by engaging adolescents in useful activities. 2.2.6 Adulthood Adulthood is usually divide into subdivisions or stagesThey tend to seek the comfort from peers involving antisocial activities (iii) Community factors- Numerous of community factors are proved to instigate the adolescents towards delinquency. They are a. Poor housing - Poor housing is a symbol of poor economic and social status. Overcrowding in poor houses and lack of privacy is said to be a cause for committing sex offences. b. Poor recreational facilities - In absence of good recreational facilities, delinquency itself becomes a recreational activity. c. Poor schools - Many factors in school contribute to delinquency. Nagging by peers, lack of understanding from teachers, unhappy home- school relationship make children dislike the school and engage in antisocial behaviour d. Unemployment - Unemployment among school dropouts and those who have no secured jobs tend to cause delinquency. e. Movies and comic books- Crime, gangster movies, glamour and sex movies stimulate young people to commit offences.Table 6 Classificationofadulthood Stages Age Early adulthood 18-40 years Middle adulthood 41-60 years Late adulthood or old age 61 years and extends until death (Erickson ,1950) Expectations and developmental tasks during adulthood: Achieving a measure of personal autonomy Molding an identity Developing emotional stability Establishing and consolidating a career Becoming a part of a social group or community Selecting a mate and adjusting to marriage Chapter 2_011-045.indd 27 18-01-2019 13:21:092 Human Development and its Challenges 38 Establishing residence and managing a home Becoming a parent and rearing a child Physical and Cognitive Changes during Adulthood a. Physical Changes It has been found that the organ system of most persons show a 0.8 to 1 percent decline per year in functional ability after the age of 30. Major physical changes with ageing are described as (1) external changes (2) internal changes, and (3) changes in sensory capacities. 1. External Changes External changes refer to the outward symptoms of growing old. The more observable changes are those associated with the skin, hair, teeth, and general posture. Skin also becomes thick, hard, less elastic, brittle and dry and wrinkled. With advancing age, the hair of the person continues to turn white and loses its luster and continues to thin. Baldness and loss of teeth is common for many, dentures become a way of life. Most weakening occurs in the back and leg muscles, less in the arm muscles. There is a progressive decline in energy production. Muscle tissue decreases in size and strength. 2. Internal Changes Internal changes refer to the symptoms of growing old that are not visible or obvious. The Respiratory System: With increasing age, there is reduction in breathing efficiency. Decreased oxygen supply makes the old person less active, less aware and less strong. The Gastrointestinal System: With increasing age there is decreased capacity for biting and chewing, decrease in the production of digestive enzymes, decreased gastric and intestinal mobility and lack of appetite. The Cardiovascular System: With the aging process, there is a decrease in the elasticity of blood vessels and blood cell production as well. The Central Nervous System (CNS ): Beginning at about age 60, there is a reduction of cerebral blood flow. There is also a decline in oxygen and glucose consumption. The most definite change is the slowing down of responses. 3. Changes in Sensory Capacities With advancing age, there is gradual slow down in the sensory abilities. Vision: Increasing age brings in several problems in vision. The lens continue to lose elasticity. The pupils become smaller and irregular in shape. The eyelids have a tendency to sag. Colour vision becomes less efficient. Cognitive Changes during Adulthood and Aging The four major aspects of cognition includes memory, learning, attention and intelligence. Old persons are found to perform poorer than young ones on long-term memory tasks which require processing of information and organization of material. They are not in a position to learn skills. Attention span is also found to be lower than younger individuals. Intelligence tests indicate that old persons are slower on reaction time. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 28 18-01-2019 13:21:092 Human Development and its Challenges 39Among the elderly, we often can find reduced abilities for complex decision making and slowing of performance. 2.2.7- Old age - Personal and social adjustments The time at which old age begins is still ill defined. Sixty years is taken as the arbitrary dividing line. Age divisions during old age: The young -old (60-69 years) This is a transition period marked by many adjustments such as retirement and declining strength, sharp reduction in expectation and behaviours. Middle-aged old (70-79 years) This period is characterized by increasing deaths of friends and spouse, reduced participation in home and community activities, increasing health problems, contracting social world. Old (80-89 years) In this period, assistance is needed in maintenance of social contacts, there may be many health problems and some may become institutionalized or may lead a very sheltered life. Very old ( 90 years and above ) Health problems are more severe and serious with very limited activity in this period. Challenging Areas That Require Adjustments during Old Age There are several challenges in different areas of old age which require adjustments and intervention. For the purpose of better understanding it can be discussed at four levels- biological, psychological, sociological or psychological or behavioural. Biological aging and its challenges - It includes changes in sensory- motor performance, muscle strength, brittleness of skeletal structure, visual acuity and decreased reaction time and balance. These are examples of biological aging which may influence attitude and behaviour. Psychological aging and its adjustments - This consists of a general decline in the mental abilities that accompany old age. Sociological aging and its challenges - It refers to changes in social roles- loss of spouse, vulnerability to disease, compulsory or voluntary retirement, loss of income and loss of status. Psycho- social aging and its challenges - It refers to systematic changes in personality needs, expectations and behaviours as well as changes in roles and changes in relation to others. Specific Psychological Problems Faced By Old People a) Feeling of inadequacy. b) Lack sense of belonging and acceptance. c) Economic insecurity. d) Changing social attitudes e) Feeling of loneliness, uncertainty, restlessness. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 29 18-01-2019 13:21:102 Human Development and its Challenges 402. They need to recognize that they have to explore new ways of coping with their life events. 3. The elderly need to make greater use of \"information seeking\" and of \"problem solving\" rather than withdrawing or isolating. 4. They need to enhance their self- confidence, self reliance, develop healthy attitude about their strengths and weaknesses as well as learning and maintaining effective coping skills 5. Participate in various group activities such as joining clubs and certain organizations for informal social interaction is very helpful for the aged. 6. Involvement in grand parenting helps the elderly satisfy many of their personal and emotional needs. SUMMARY Human development and its challenges deals with the various stages of the life span a human being goes through from infancy to old age. It includes the changes (physical, emotional, social and cognitive) in the life cycle of an individual and the various developmental tasks in each stage. Specific areas of concern such as juvenile delinquency, its causes and rehabilitation measures have been addressed. Emphasis has been given to children with special needs including those who are visually challenged, mentally challenged, orthopedically challenged, hearing and speech impaired with specific reference to the various difficulties they face along with coping mechanisms.f) Feeling tired and depressed. g) High on anxiety. h) Low self-esteem and worthlessness Adjustments in old age Some of the adjustments people have to make as they move into old age include: Health adjustment: One of the threats to the elderly is prolonged illness. The aging body is highly vulnerable to ravaging diseases and injury. The psychological stressors of old age can also provoke psychological disorders. Adjustment to retirement - Retirement is separation from a sphere of activity that has provided special social order, economic remuneration, personal identity and prestige for many years. The abrupt termination of one's livelihood may be a great threat to the old people; a welcome relief to some from tedious thankless jobs or a natural conclusion of one's successful career. It may provide more time for some to pursue their dreams and pleasurable activities 1st October is celebrated as the International Day for Elderly People each year. Coping with the Problems Faced During Old Age Different people adopt different coping strategies to meet their life challenges. Some of the effective coping strategies may be summarized as follows: 1. The elderly need to develop an attitude of flexibility so that they may adapt to life's pressures and problems of old age. Chapter 2_011-045.indd 30 18-01-2019 13:21:102 Human Development and its Challenges 41 Knowledge gained though the study of this lesson on human development and its challenges will motivate students to pursue higher education in human development or psychology. The information gathered through this chapter may foster an interest among students to address the specific needs of differently abled children either by pursuing research in this domain or by specially equipping themselves to provide support to these children . Besides addressing the challenges in the adolescent stage in which the students are , this chapter will prepare students to prepare for adulthood and its various development tasks. The needs of the elderly and challenges faced by them are discussed in detail. Such knowledge will prepare students about the changes that are likely to take place during old age and mentally prepare them for the same. Socio emotional skills, cognitive skills and language skills of children 0 to 8 years are given in the consolidated form in the appendix.

Food is required for every living creature. Good food is reflected by opti - mum health and wellbeing. In early times Learning Objectives man ate food most naturally. Fruits, veg - etables, cereals, pulses, fats, oils or sugars were all consumed as they were available without any refinement or processing. Later man discovered methods of cook - ing and also preserving food according to his need. By accident man discovered fire and then experimented and began to cook non-vegetarian foods like fish, meat etc. by direct roasting on fire. This was fol - lowed by salting food and dehydration of foods as preservation techniques. The importance of food gave rise to a science called \"food science\" . This is \"a discipline in which the engineering, biological and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying In this chapter the student will Understand the diverse functions of food Gain knowledge of the various food sources and the different nutrients present in them Understand concepts of the basic four food groups, food guide pyramid and \"my plate\" Get familiar with the different cooking methods Learn the methods of enriching food Learn about various kitchen equipment required for cooking Know about techniques that would ensure safety in the kitchen The first wealth is health . \u2014 Ralph Waldo Emerson 3Food Science Chapter Chapter3_046_069.indd 1 18-01-2019 12:08:543 Food Science 47food processing, and the improvement of foods for the consuming public\" . Food has been a basic part of our sur - vival. Next to air and water, food is the utmost important thing for survival. Food is essential for growth, development, active and healthy life of an individual. Through, centuries, food has also been used, as an expression of love, friendship and social acceptance. Food refers to anything, which nour - ishes the body. It would include solids, semi- solids and liquids which when consumed help to sustain the body and keep it healthy. Food is a substance, which after ingestion, digestion and absorption is capable of being utilized by the body for its various functions. 3.2 FUNCTIONS OF FOOD Food is classified according to their func - tions in the body as shown in Figure 1. 3.2.1 Physiological Functions of Food The physiological functions of food can be further sub divided as follows a. Energy yielding foods b. Body building foods c. Protective and regulatory food.a) Energy Yielding Foods Energy is mainly provided to our body through carbohydrates and fats in the food. Carbohydrates and fats provide energy to sus - tain involuntary processes in the body for con - tinuous life, to carry out voluntary activities like professional, household and recreational activities and to convert food ingested into usa - ble nutrients in the body. The energy needed is metabolized by oxidation of foods consumed. b) Body building foods In our body there is continuous break - down of old tissues and building up of new tissues going on at all ages irrespective of the apparent growth thus maintaining a need for body building nutrients.Food Sources: Cereals, millets, roots and tubers, sweets, jaggery, sugar, fats and oils. Food Sources: Pulses, legumes, meat, fish, poultry, egg, milk and milk products. FUNCTIONS OF FOODPHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONSSOCIAL FUNCTIONS p Fig 1 Functions of food Chapter3_046_069.indd 2 18-01-2019 12:08:543 Food Science 48For the body building purpose, the major nutrients are proteins and min - erals. Foods rich in protein are called body building foods. Milk, meat, egg and fish are rich in proteins of high quality due to the presence of essential amino acids. Pulses and nuts are good sources of protein but the protein is not of good quality because they lack some of the essential amino acids which are rich in cereals. c) Regulatory and protective function of foods These foods regulate the activities of the body such as beating of the heart, mainte - nance of body temperature, muscle contrac - tion, control of water balance, clotting of blood, removal of waste products from the body, etc. Our body uses water in all its cells, organs and tissues to help regulate its tem - perature and maintain other bodily func - tions. Our body loses water through breath - ing, sweating and digestion, It is important to rehydrate our body by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. Dietary fibers found mainly in fruits and vegetables, wholegrains and legumes provide health benefits such as relieving constipation, maintaining healthy weight lowering the risk of diabetes and heart diseases. Apart from regulating our body processes, food also protects us from vari - ous infections, diseases and injuries. Food Sources: Vegetables and fruits.3.2.2 Psychological Functions of Food The second major function of food is psy - chological function. Food also satisfies certain psychological needs of human beings. Foods indirectly helps to provide a sense of security, love and acceptance. Every one grows in a particular culture with its own unique food habits. The person begins to associate the food habits and foods commonly consumed as it gives a sense of security and satiety. Even a nutritionally balanced meal may not be satisfying to the individual, if food included is unfamiliar or distasteful. 3.2.3 Social Functions of Food Food is also a symbol of social life. When a meal is shared with anyone else, the acceptance of friendship and respect for that person are expressed. Earlier only persons enjoying equal status in society ate together. A person would never share a meal with someone inferior to him in social terms. Food is a medium through which happiness is expressed. For example feasts are given at specific states of life such as birthday, marriage etc. Sweets are also distributed and exchanged to mark cer - tain auspicious occasions like festivals. Such gatherings bring people together and help to strengthen mutual friendship.For example consumption of vitamin A & vitamin C rich food help in building resistance in the body to fight against invading organisms Chapter3_046_069.indd 3 18-01-2019 12:08:543 Food Science 493.3 BASIC FOUR FOOD GROUPS AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE Food groups have been classified accord - ing to various methods from time to time. ICMR (2011) has classified the different foods items into four food groups as listed in Table 1. They are 1. Cereal, millets and pulses 2. Milk, and animal products 3. Fruits and vegetables 4. Fats, oils and nuts Significance of the Four-Food Group System The four food group system can be used for the following purposes:i. Planning wholesome balanced menus to achieve nutritional ade - quacy. ii. Assessing nutritional status - a brief diet history of an individual can disclose inadequacies of food and nutrients from any of the four groups. Based on the assessment, nutrition educa - tion can be imparted to the individual. The quantity of the meals can be improved or is said to be optimum when the diets are complete. Every meal should have foods providing energy, protein, vitamins, minerals, fibre and adequate amount of water. Table 1 Basic Four Food Groups Food Groups Main Nutrient 1 Cereal Millets and Pulses: Rice, wheat, ragi, bajra, maize, rice flakes Pulses and legumes : bengal gram, black gram, green gram, red gram, rajmahEnergy, protein, invisible fats, vit B1, B2, folic acid, iron, fibre Energy, proteins, invisible fats, vit B1, B2, folic acid, calcium, iron fibre 2 Milk and Animal products: milk, curd, skimmed milk, cheese, chicken, liver, fish, egg, meatProtein, fat, vit B2, calcium 3 Fruits and Vegetables : Mango, guava, tomato, papaya, orange, etc Green leafy vegetables: leaves, fenugreek leaves, drumstick leaves Other vegetables: carrot, brinjal, beans, Onions, etcCarotenoids, vitamin C, vit B2, fibre Carotenoids, vitamin B2,folic acid, fibre Carotenoids, folic acid, calcium 4 Oils, Fats and nuts Fats, butter, ghee, hydrogenated fat, cooking oil like groundnut, mustard, sunflower sugar, Omega 3 acid Chapter3_046_069.indd 4 18-01-2019 12:08:543 Food Science 50Millets Millets are small - seeded grasses that are hard and grow well in dry zones as rain- fed crops under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture. Millets are one of the oldest foods known to humans and possibly the first cereal grains to be used for domestic purposes. They are highly nutritious, gluten free. Hence they are soothing and easy to digest. They are con - sidered to be the least allergic and most Balanced diet can be defined as one which contains different types of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need for all the nutrients are adequately met and a small extra provision is made for nutrients as a margin of safety. Colourful rainbow of fruits and vegetables presents you with following health benefits. REAL FOOD IS THE KEY TO HEALTH What do we mean by real food? Eating fruits, vegetables and whole grains that haven't been overly pro - cessed will keep you healthy. By eating whole food, you can avoid over-pro - cessed foods that are packed with sugar, sodium, carbohydrates and fats. Chapter3_046_069.indd 5 18-01-2019 12:08:543 Food Science 51digestible grains available. Compared to rice, polished rice, millets release lesser percentage of glucose and over a longer period of time this lowers the risk of diabetes. List the Different kinds of millets available in the market 3.3.1 Types and Importance of Millets Millets are particularly high in minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorous and potassium, finger millet (ragi) is richest in calcium content. Kinds of millets: 1. Barnyard Millet - Kuthiravali 2. Finger Millet - Ragi 3. Foxtail Millet - Thinai 4. Kodo Millet - Varagu 5. Little Millet - Samai 6. Pearl Millet - Kambu 7. Proso Millet - Panivaragu 8. Sorghum - Cholam Millets can be incorporated in our daily diet for almost all the meals and dishes. Breakfast items like porridge, dosa, idli, uppuma, puttu,ragi kali, - doughnuts, vadas, bonda, chapathis, pooris etc are some of the commonly prepared items. Main meal items like ragi kali is highly nutritious. Millets can also lend themselves to the baking of cakes and biscuits as a 20% to 50% level of the cereal flour is being used and therefore enhance the nutri - tive value of the product. The nutritional content of millets is given in Table 2. 3.4 FOOD PYRAMID Food pyramid is a visual tool that is used as a guide in designing diet. It is developed as a guide to provide a frame work for the types and amounts of food that can be eaten in combination to provide a healthy diet. The Indian adaption of the food pyramid is divided into four levels Activity 1 Formulate a recipe using milletsActivity 2 Chapter3_046_069.indd 6 18-01-2019 12:08:553 Food Science 52of foods according to recommended consumption. 1. Cereals, legumes / beans, dairy prod - ucts at the base should be eaten in suf - ficient quantity. 2. Vegetables and fruits on the second level should be eaten liberally. 3. Animal source foods and oils on the third level to be eaten moderately 4. At the apex highly processed foods that are high in sugar and fat are to be eaten sparingly.Table 2 Nutritional Content in Millets MilletIron (in mg)Calcium (in mg)Minerals (in mg)Fibre (in g)Protein (in g) Pearl millet 16.9 38 2.3 1.3 10.6 Finger millet 3.9 344 2.7 3.6 7.3 Foxtail millet 2.8 31 3.3 8.0 12.3 Proso millet 0.8 14 1.9 2.2 12.5 Kodo millet 0.5 27 2.6 9 8.3 Little millet 9.3 17 1.5 7.6 7.7 Barnyard millet 15.2 11 4.4 10.1 11.2 Source: Millet Network of India p Fig 2 Food Pyramid Grains LegumesVegeta blesMilk and Milk ProductsFats / Oil, Salt and Su gar Egg, Meat Pr oducts and Fish Fruits Chapter3_046_069.indd 7 18-01-2019 12:08:563 Food Science 53Boiled rice tastes different from jeera rice or pea pulao because these are cooked differently. Similarly, a chapatti tastes different from a puree or paratha, again because all these are cooked differ - ently. Generally, vegetables like tomatoes, cucumber and fruits are best eaten raw while wheat, rice, pulses, potatoes and other vegetables must be cooked. Main objectives of cooking: Improves the taste and food quality. Cooking food to the required tempera - ture for a required length of time can destroy all harmful microorganisms in food. Cooking improves digestibility. Cooking increases variety. 3.5.1 Moist Heat Methods i) Boiling: Boiling is cooking foods by just immersing them in water at 100\u00b0C and maintaining the water at that tem - perature till the food is tender. It does not require special skill and equipment. It is time consuming. Merits: 1. Simple method, does not require skill or any particular equipment. 2. Uniform cooking can be achieved. Demerits: 1. Continuous boiling damages the structure and texture of food. 2. Vitamins B and C is lost if the cooking water is discarded. 3. It is time consuming and may lead to increased use of fuel. 4. Loss of colour \u2014Water soluble pigments may be lost during cooking.One peculiarity of the Indian adaptation of the food pyramid is the recommenda - tion to do regular physical activity. The pyramid provides information on the food types and amount necessary to meet daily dietary requirements. Each food group is represented by a band or level. Narrow bands at the apex indicate lower quanti - ties, while wider bands at the base means that more from that food group needs to be consumed. Most important is to include 2 to 3 litre of water each day as it's the most important nutrient constituting 70% of our body weight and helps to maintain our health. It is very important that an indi - vidual incorporates the principles of good nutrition such as variety, a balanced intake of nutrients and moderation. The best way to meet the daily requirements is to eat a diet that combines cereals, fruits, vegeta - bles, meat, fish, poultry legumes and dairy products. Eating a variety of foods daily as guided by the \"Food Pyramid\" will help to provide all the nutrients needed by the body. 3.5 METHODS OF COOKING Cooking has been practiced since times immemorial. The ancient man ate only raw food.Once a piece of meat fell into the fire accidentally and got roasted. The ancient man ate this piece of roasted meat and liked it. Thus began the process of cooking. It has evolved a lot since then. Cooking offers a wide variety of foods. For example food items like roti, puri, paratha, rice, pulao, pulses, vegetable, salad, chutney, pickle, curd, butter milk, fruits, etc.are prepared from different food. Chapter3_046_069.indd 8 18-01-2019 12:08:563 Food Science 54p Fig 3 Methods of cooking Stewing Steaming Pressure Cookerii) Simmering When food is cooked in a pan with a well fitted lid at a temperature just below the boiling point 82\u00b0-99\u00b0C, it is known as simmering. It is a useful method when foods have to be cooked for a long time to make it tender. (eg) vegetables. Merits: 1. Food can be cooked with less chances of burning. 2. The flavour of the food can be enhanced. Simmering Boiling Poaching Blanching METHODS OF COOKING MOIST HEAT METHODS DRY HEAT METHODS COMBINATION METHODS BOILING BAKING BRAISING GRILLING ROASTING SAUTEING FRYINGSIMMERING POACHING STEWING PRESSURE COOKING BLANCHINGSTEAMING Y ou must have eaten potatoes cooked in different ways. Can you name some? Activity 3 Chapter3_046_069.indd 9 18-01-2019 12:08:573 Food Science 553. Does not require any skill or specific equipment. Demerits: 1. Takes a long time for cooking the food. 2. Precaution must be taken to ensure that the food does not get burnt. iii) Poaching This involves cooking in the minimum amount of liquid at a temperature of 80\u00b0- 85\u00b0C. Foods generally poached are eggs and fish. Merits: 1. No special equipment is needed. 2. It is a quick method of cooking and thus saves fuel. 3. Poached foods are easily digested as no fat is added. Demerits: 1. Poached foods may not appeal to ev - erybody as they are bland to taste. 2. Foods can get burnt if not monitored closely. 3. Water soluble nutrients may be lost if they are leached into the water. iv) Stewing This is a gentle method of cooking in a pan with a tight fitting lid, using small quan - tities of liquid to cover only half the food. The liquid is brought to a boiling point and then the heat applied is reduced to maintain the cooking at simmering temperature ie., 98\u00b0C. Apples can be cooked by this method. Merits: 1. Loss of nutrients is avoided as the wa - ter used for cooking is not discarded. 2. Flavour is retained. Demerits: 1. The process is time consuming and there is wastage of fuel.v) Steaming This method requires the food to be cooked in steam. This is generated from vigorously boiling water or liquid in a pan so that the food is completely surrounded by steam and not in contact with the water or liquid. Here the food gets cooked at 100 degrees. Merits: 1. Less chances of burning. 2. Texture of food is better, as it is made light and fluffy. 3. Saves time and fuel. 4. Steamed foods like idli and idiappam have very negligible fat and are easy to digest, and are good for children, elderly and therapeutic diets. Demerits: 1. Steaming equipment is required. 2. This method is limited to the prepara - tion of selected foods. vi) Pressure cooking In pressure cooking escaping steam is trapped and kept under pressure so that the temperature of the boiling water and steam can be raised above 100\u00b0C thus reducing cooking time. Foods cooked in pressure cooker are rice, dhal, vegetables and meat. Merits: 1. Cooking time is less compared to oth - er methods. 2. Nutrient and flavour loss is minimized. 3. Conserves time, fuel and different items can be cooked at the same time. 4. Less chance of burning. 5. Constant monitoring is not necessary. Demerits: 1. The initial investment cost may not be affordable by everybody. Chapter3_046_069.indd 10 18-01-2019 12:08:573 Food Science 562. Knowledge of the use, care and main - tenance of the cooker is required to prevent accidents. 3. Careful watch on the cooking time is necessary to prevent over cooking. vii) Blanching In meal preparation, it is often necessary only to peel off the skin of fruits and veg - etables without making them tender. This can be achieved by the method of blanch - ing. In this method food is dropped in boiling water for 5 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the texture of food. This helps to remove the skin without softening the food. Blanching can also be done by pouring enough hot water on the food to immerse it for some time or subjecting foods to boiling temperatures for short periods and then immediately immersing them in cold water. This process causes the skin to become loose and then can be peeled off easily. Merits: 1. Peels can easily be removed to improve digestibility.2. Destroys enzymes that bring about spoilage. 3. Texture can be maintained, while im - proving the colour and flavor of the food. Demerits: 1. Loss of nutrients if cooking water is discarded. 3.5.2 Dry Heat Methods In this either air or fat is used as the medium of cooking. 3.5.2.1 Air as a Medium of Cooking i) Grilling Grilling consists of placing the food below or above or in between a red-hot surface. This results in the browning of the food. Merits: 1. Quick method of cooking. 2. It improves the appearance, texture and flavour of the food. 3. Minimum oil is used. Demerits: 1. Foods can be burnt due to carelessness. 2. Grilling denatures the proteins reduc - ing their availability. ii) Pan broiling or roasting When food is cooked uncovered on heated metal or a frying pan, the method is known as pan-broiling, (e.g) chapathis. Merits: 1. Quick method of cooking. 2. It improves the appearance, texture and flavor of the food. 3. Minimum oil is used. 4. Spices are easily powdered if they are first roasted. Chapter3_046_069.indd 11 18-01-2019 12:08:573 Food Science 57Demerits: 1. Foods can be burnt due to carelessness. 2. Grilling denatures the proteins. iii) Baking Here food gets cooked by hot air inside the oven. Foods baked are generally brown and crisp on the top and soft and porous in the centre, (eg) cakes and breads. The temperature that is nor - mally maintained in the oven is between 120\u00b0C-260\u00b0C. Merits: 1. It gives a unique flavour to food. 2. Foods are made light and fluffy - cakes, rolls, custard, bread. 3. Certain foods can be prepared only by this method - bread, cakes. 4. Uniform and bulk cooking can be achieved. 5. Flavour and texture of the food is en - hanced. 6. A variety of dishes can be made. Demerits: 1. Special equipment like oven is re - quired.2. Baking skills are necessary to obtain a product with ideal texture, Flavour and colour characteristics. 3. Careful monitoring needed to prevent scorching. 3.5.2.2 Fat as a Medium of Cooking i) Sauteing This method involves cooking in just enough of oil to cover the base of the pan. Foods cooked by sauteing are generally vegetables used as side dishes in a menu. Merits: 1. Takes less time. 2. Simple technique. 3. Minimum oil is used. 4. Constant monitoring is needed to pre - vent scorching. Demerits: 1. Constant monitoring is needed to pre - vent scorching. ii) Shallow and deep fat frying Here food is cooked on a tava with little oil (eg) chapathi, cutlets, etc. Deep fat frying food Deep Frying Shallow Frying Grilling Sauteing Baking Roasting Stir Frying Barbecuing Pan Frying Chapter3_046_069.indd 12 18-01-2019 12:08:593 Food Science 58is totally immersed in hot oil and cooked. The temperature maintained is 180\u00b0-220\u00b0C (eg.) Samosa, Bajji, etc. The taste of the food is improved along with texture. Merits: 1. Very quick method of cooking. 2. The calorific value of food is increased as fat is the medium of cooking. 3. It gives a delicious flavour and appear - ance to the food. 4. Taste and texture are improved. Demerits: 1. Constant monitoring is needed to pre - vent scorching. 2. The food may become soggy due to too much fat absorption. 3. Fried foods are not easily digested. 4. Repeated use of heated oils will have ill effects on health. 3.5.3 Combination Method i) Braising Braising is a combined method of roasting and stewing in a pan with a tight fitting lid. Meat is cooked by this method. Examples of foods cooked by braising are: 1. Uppuma : Roasting and boiling 2. Cutlet : Boiling and shallow frying. 3. Vermicelli payasam : Roasting and simmering. 3.5.4 Innovative Methods i) Microwave Cooking Electromagnetic waves from a power source called magnetron are absorbed by the food and food becomes hot at once. Microwave cooking enhances the flavour of food because it cooks quickly with little or no water and thus preserves the natural colour of vegetables and fruits. Merits: 1. Quick method - 10 times faster than the conventional method. So loss of nutrients can be minimized. 2. Only the food gets heated and the oven does not get heated. 3. Foods get heated uniformly. 4. Leftovers can be reheated without chang - ing the flavor and texture of the product. 5. Microwave cooking enhances the fla - vor of the food because it cooks quick - ly with little or no water. Demerits: 1. Baked products do not develop a brown surface. 2. Microwave cooking cannot be used for simmering, deep frying or stewing. 3. Flavour of all ingredients do not blend well as the cooking time is too short. ii) Solar Cooking Solar cooker works on solar energy. Solar cooker consists of well insulated box, the inside of which is painted dull black and p Fig 4 Microwave oven Chapter3_046_069.indd 13 18-01-2019 12:08:593 Food Science 59is covered by one or more transparent covers, the purpose of which is to trap the heat inside the solar cooker. The temper - ature maintained is around 140\u00b0C. Cost of the cooker and the maintenance cost is low. It takes longer time and special ves - sels need to be used Merits: 1. Simple techniques - requires no spe - cial skill. 2. Cost effective as natural sunlight is the form of energy 3. Original flavour of food is retained 4. There is no danger of scorching or burning 5. Loss of nutrients is minimum as only little amount of water is used in cooking Demerits: 1. Special equipment is needed 2. Slow cooking process 3. Cannot be used in the absence of sun - light-rainy season, late evening and night3.6 STEPS IN MINIMIZING LOSS OF NUTRIENTS DURING COOKING Some nutrients are lost when foods are cooked. Nutrients like vitamin B and C are lost when foods are boiled or soaked in water and the water is thrown away. Nutrients like vitamin A are lost when fats are used for cooking foods. Therefore we must think of ways of saving these nutrients. Wash vegetables before cutting them so that minerals and vitamins are not destroyed. Do not wash the foods more than necessary. Peel vegetables thinly as vitamins and minerals are found just under the skin. Cut vegetables into large pieces just before cooking. Small pieces mean greater loss of nutrients. If vegetables are to be cooked in water, put them into boiling water. Scrape the peels very thin. Use just enough water for cooking. Do not throw away the extra water. Use this p Fig 5 Solar cookerObserve and list the changes in the colour, texture and taste of the follow - ing food items after they are cooked. Also note the method used for cook - ing them. Spinach Rice Toor dhal Potato EggActivity 4 Chapter3_046_069.indd 14 18-01-2019 12:08:593 Food Science 60 To make proper selection and preparation of foods. To consume food in a balanced manner. To improve the flavour and texture of the food. To get variety in food. To assist in planning the daily menu, keeping in view the nutrient content of the food. To prevent deficiency diseases in the body. To develop good food habits. Methods of Enrichment of Nutrients There are three methods by which one can enhance or increase the nutrients present in food. i) Combination ii) Fermentation iii) Germination i) Combination Combination is the process of combining cheaper and commonly available foods from different food groups to improve the quality of nutrients. Combining of foods from different food groups is the easiest way of eating all nutrients.extra water to cook some other food. Do not use cooking soda. Use of tam - arind or lemon juice helps to conserve the vitamins. Cook rice in just enough water which gets absorbed during cooking. Cook in a pan which has a well fitting lid. When you cook in an uncovered pan most nutrients are lost. Do not overcook the food as many nutrients will be destroyed. Y ou love to eat boiled rice and dhal. Rice has to be boiled with lots of water and the extra water is thrown away. Y ou know that throwing this water means we throw away the soluble nutrients present in rice. Why is it necessary to break this habit? How can this problem be solved? 3.7 FORTIFICATION AND ENRICHMENT Fortification is adding nutrients to the food even though the nutrient is already present in food. Fortification is done to improve the nutritive value whereas the process of improving the nutrient levels of nutrients which might be lost during processing in foods by special methods is called Enrichment. Importance of Enhancing Nutritive Value of Food To meet the nutritional requirements of the body. Combination of foodsActivity 5 Chapter3_046_069.indd 15 18-01-2019 12:08:593 Food Science 61Combination of foods improves the quality of nutrients. Cereals lack certain essential amino acids and these are pres - ent in dhals. On the other hand dhals lack some other essential amino acids that are present in cereals. The quality of proteins becomes as good as that of milk. The com - bination of a variety of foods ensures bet - ter availability of nutrients. Combination helps to i) Eat a diet that has good quality nutrients. ii) Use cheaper and easily available foods that enhance the nutrient content of food considerably. iii) Provide balanced diet to the family. ii) Fermentation Fermentation is a process in which some micro-organisms are added to the food. They change nutrients already present in the foods into simpler and better forms and also make other new nutrients. Fermentation makes the dough rise and become almost double in quantity. During fermentation the microorganisms use up some of the nutrients present in the dough and change them into other better quality nutrients. They also make some new nutrients.Curd, bread, dhokla and idli are all examples of fermented foods. Advantages of fermentation a) Fermentation improves the digest - ibility of foods. The microorgan - isms which cause fermentation break the proteins and carbohy - drates into smaller parts, which are easier to digest. b) During fermentation of cereals and foods like peas, beans etc. the minerals, calcium, phosphorus, and iron are changed into better quality ones. These are then easily absorbed by the body. c) Fermented foods become spongy and soft and are liked by children and adults. iii) Germination Germination is a process in which small shoots come out of the dhal or cereal when these are kept with small amount of water. The grains and pulses to be sprouted need to be soaked in just enough water so that all of it is absorbed. If the extra water in which they are soaked is thrown away, a lot of nutrients are lost. Grains like wheat, bajra, jowar, etc. can also be sprouted. These grains Curd Germination Chapter3_046_069.indd 16 18-01-2019 12:09:003 Food Science 62can then be dried in shade and roasted lightly on a tawa. They can be ground and used in many dishes. Pulses are also sprouted first and then steamed and con - sumed. The time and water which each grain or pulse needs for soaking and sprouting is different. Normally 8-16 hours are needed for soaking and 12-24 hours for sprouting. The cloth in which the soaked dhal is tied should be kept moist all the time. Germination helps i) Increase the digestibility of food a) Some carbohydrates and proteins are broken down into smaller and easily digestible forms. b) Grains and pulses become soft after sprouting, so they take less time for cooking and are easy for you to digest. ii) Increase the nutritive value of food with no additional cost Some vitamins and minerals become more when foods are germinated Vitamin B becomes almost double in quantity while vitamin C increases almost 10 times. 3.8 KITCHEN EQUIPMENT Knowing the names and uses of equip - ment is as important as knowing where to find them in a kitchen. Minor Equipment: The small equipment that we use in the kitchen for food are known as minor equipment. Measuring equipment dry measuring cups for solid ingredients measuring spoons for small amounts liquid measuring cup with space at top spatula to level off dry ingredients Slicing and Cutting Tools paring knife cleans/pares fruits and vegetables utility knife for all cutting purposes butcher knife-heavy duty for large cuts of meat bread knife has serrated edge chef 's knife/French knife for slice, dice, chop a triangle blade slicing knife has a long narrow blade used for meat and cabbage carving knife for meat peeler for peeling fruits and vegeta - bles kitchen shears cutting board grater mixing tools baking tools cooking tools kitchen aids cookware cleaning equipment The minor kitchen equipment is used mostly for prepreparation of foods. Major Equipment: The major kitchen equipment that are used for everyday cooking would include a food processor (mixee cum grinder/blender), refriger - ator, microwave oven and even a small non-commercial oven cum toaster and grill. Chapter3_046_069.indd 17 18-01-2019 12:09:003 Food Science 63 Food processor (mixer) Refrigerator Oven Cum Toaster and Grill These major equipment are very essential for daily use. The refrigerator is used for stor- ing food and keeping it fresh free from spoilage. These foods include vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk and milk products and leftover cooked food also. The freezer helps to store and preserve foods, espe- cially raw food items like non-vegetar- ian foods such as fish, meat and chicken and their products at a much lower tem- perature (at zero degrees centigrade and below). Minor Equipments Chapter3_046_069.indd 18 18-01-2019 12:09:013 Food Science 643.9 BASIC RULES OF KITCHEN SAFETY Cooking is fun, but kitchen safety is a pri- ority. There are many types of equipment in the kitchen and environmental hazards that can be extremely dangerous. Sharp objects like knives, open fire by the oven, electrical appliances, and even bacteria around the kitchen. Observing basic rules of kitchen safety is a good habit to develop. To pre- vent serious injuries or accidents: always pay attention to what you're doing, adopt a plan for kitchen cleanliness, and have necessary safety equipment at your disposal. Store knives in a wooden block or in a drawer Never cook with loose clothes on and keep long hair tied back. Never cook while wearing dangling jewellery Keep pot holders nearby and use them Turn pot handles away from the front of the stove. Don't let temperature-sensitive foods sit out in the kitchen.Identify the given kitchen equipment used at home and mention their uses Thermos Cooking pot Strainer Frying pan Tongs Cutting board (Potato) peelerActivity 6 scissor Chapter3_046_069.indd 19 18-01-2019 12:09:033 Food Science 65 Wipe up spills immediately. Separate raw meat and poultry from other items whenever you use or store them. Wash your hands before handling food and after handling meat or poultry. Get a fire extinguisher for the kitchen. Follow these steps to keep cuts clean and prevent infections and scars. Wash your hands. First, wash up with soap and water so you don't get bac - teria into the cut and cause an infec - tion. If you're on the go, use hand sanitizer. Stop the bleeding. Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few min - utes. Clean the wound. Once you've stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don't get soap in the cut, because it can irri - tate the skin . And don't use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irri - tate the cut. Remove any dirt or debris. Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut. Generally a good antiseptic cream (sil - verex or burnol) should be kept handy. It is advisable to have a small first aid kit readily available in the kitchen. SUMMARY 1. Having learnt about the functions of food, the different food groups and their nutrients, one would understand the importance of a balanced diet and would also be able to plan a balanced diet from the locally available foods . 2. Knowledge of the different methods of cooking along with their merits and demerits enables one to choose the best method of cooking for any given food, so as to ensure the availability of maximum nutrients . 3.

Fresh fruits are abundant during the season and are not available during off season. Due to this the food has to be stored until the next season. Fish and meat too have to be pre - served as all that is killed or caught cannot be eaten at one time. Bacteria, fungi and yeasts tend to decay the food and render it unfit to eat. Hence all fresh foods have to be preserved if it is to be used after a period of time.Food Preservation MethodsChapter Learning Objectives Besides when food spoils, they undergo physical and chemical changes that results in the food becoming inedi - ble or hazardous to eat. The chief causes of food spoilage are; The growth of microorganisms like bac - teria, yeast and moulds. The action of enzymes that normally occur in the food. Other causes of spoilage are non enzy - matic reactions in food such as oxida - tion and mechanical damage such as bruising and damage from rodents and insects.This chapter will enable the students to Know the importance of food preservation Enhance their knowledge of different preservation techniques Know the difference between traditional techniques and modern industrial techniques Understand the steps to be taken before freezing vegetables, fruits, meat and poultry Know the different methods of food preservation Using low and high temperature Use of chemical preservatives and high osmotic pressure Dehydration Irradiation Vacuum packaging Chapter 4_070-087.indd 70 31-03-2018 13:21:374 Food Preservation Methods 71p Fig. 1 Causes of food spoilageFOOD SPOILAGEMECHANICAL DAMA GE YEAS T BACTERIA MOULDS ENZYMES DAMA GE FROM INSEC TS AND RODENT SCAUSES In order to prevent food spoilage and ensure food security and availabil - ity, various food preservation techniques have been used over the several years. The earliest steps in food preservation are drying of grains and nuts. Later salting, smoking and drying were applied to pre - serve the food. 4.1.1 DefinitionofFood Preservation Food preservation is known as \"the sci - ence which deals with the process of pre - vention of decay or spoilage of food thus allowing it to be stored in a fit condition for future use\". Preservation also can be defined as \"the state in which any food may be retained over a period of time without being contaminated by pathogenic organ - isms or chemicals, without losing opti - mum qualities of colour, texture, flavour and nutritive value\".Importance of food preservation Food production and supply does not always tally with the demand or needs of the people. In some places, there is surplus production of food product, whereas in some other place there is inadequate sup - ply. It is therefore important to improve and expand facilities for storage and pres - ervation of food to ensure its availability and acceptability at all times. Preservation ensures: Increase in shelf life of foods. Availability of seasonal foods through - out the year. Stability in prices of food as there will not be a deficit in supply. Good quality Edibility - texture and flavour Retention of nutritive value Retention of original colour of food. For the process of preservation, a preservative (e.g. salt, sugar, vinegar) is needed. Chapter 4_070-087.indd 71 31-03-2018 13:21:374 Food Preservation Methods 72A preservative is a substance that is added to food to inhibit and retard the growth of microorganisms and helps in the process of preservation.DO YOU KNOW? Principles of Food Preservation 1. Prevention or delay of microbial de - composition. a. By keeping out microorganisms and preventing contamination from pathogens. It involves apply - ing the strictest rules to minimize the risk of infection (asepsis). b. Removal of microorganism through usage of membrane which retains microorganisms (filtration). c. By hindering the growth and activity of microorganisms (refrig - eration, dehydration, addition of chemical preservatives). d. By killing microorganisms (boiling, irradiation). 2. Prevention or delay of self decomposi - tion of food a. By destruction or inactivation of enzymes (blanching). b. By prevention or delay of chemical reactions (anti oxidants). 3. Prevention of damage caused by me - chanical causes, insects and rodents. 4.2 PRESERVATION METHODS Many foods cannot be stored as such and need to undergo a treatment or a tech - nique which helps to prevent spoilage. The techniques adopted to preserve the foods are grouped into traditional tech - niques and modern industrial techniques. Traditional techniques include curing, freezing, boiling, heating, sugaring, pick - ling, canning, smoking, salting and fer - mentation. Modern industrial technique involve pasteurization, vacuum packing, artificial food additives and irradiation. In this chapter, preservation tech - niques are discussed under the following headings. They are use of low tempera - ture, use of high temperature, dehydra - tion, use of chemical preservatives and preservation by high osmotic pressure. 4.2.1 PreservationofFoods with Low Temperature Use of low temperature reduces the microbial activity and enzyme activity thus prolongs shelf life of foods. Two dif - ferent temperatures are employed in low temperature namely chilling temperature and freezer temperature. 4.2.1.1 Chill Storage Chill temperature is just above the refriger - ated temperature. In chilling fish, the tem - perature is reduced to freezing point of water. Chill temperature delays both bio-chemical and bacteriological changes. The deteriora - tive changes are retarded when low temper - ature is maintained. Hence the shelf life of food is improved and this ensures preserving natural and functional properties of food. Storage at 1\u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C can provide sta - bility in the presence of food preservation.Boil sliced potatoes in water for three minutes. Observe the changes that take place in the texture, colour and appearance.Activity 1 Chapter 4_070-087.indd 72 31-03-2018 13:21:374 Food Preservation Methods 73p Fig. 3 Techniques of food preservation p Fig. 2 Methods of food preservation Chapter 4_070-087.indd 73 31-03-2018 13:21:384 Food Preservation Methods 744.2.1.2 Freezing Freezing is a means of preserving food through the application and maintenance of extreme cold temperature ( 4\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C). It is effective because most of the water of the food tissue is changed from the liquid to the solid state . This change in the physical state of water retards enzy - matic action and stops microbial growth, the cause of food spoilage, thus preserving food. Many foods can be frozen for twelve months or more without major changes in size, shape, texture, colour and flavour. Slow freezing process It is also known as sharp freezing . In this method, the food is frozen under tem - peratures ranging from 4oC to 29oC.

Chapter 4_070-087.indd 74 31-03-2018 13:21:394 Food Preservation Methods 75Freezing may require three to seventy-two hours under such conditions . Home freez - ing is done by this method. Quick freezing process The temperatures used in the quick freez - ing process range from 32oC to 40oC. It freezes food so rapidly that fine crys - tals are formed. The time taken for quick freezing is significantly lower than that of slow freezing. In quick freezing, large quantities of food can be frozen in a short period of time. The use of very low tem - perature for both freezing and holding frozen products adds to the cost but of desirable for many products in terms of retention of palatability and nutritive value. Dehydro freezing Dehydro freezing of fruits and vegeta - bles is the drying of the food to about 50 percent of its original weight and volume and then freezing the food to preserve it. The quality of dehydro frozen fruits and vegetables is equal to that of fruits and vegetables which are frozen without pre - liminary drying. The cost is marginally less because of weight and volume savings in packing, freezing, storing and shipping. Points to be Considered Before Freezing Food Vegetables: Blanching (dipping the products in boil - ing water for two to three minutes) veg - etables before freezing reduces the num - ber of microorganisms, removes some air from the tissues, makes them more compact and enhances their colour. Its most important function is to inactivate enzymes otherwise that would cause dete - rioration in palatability, colour and ascor - bic acid content during storage. Fruits: The enzymes of fruits can be inactivated by blanching but it is not done as it gives the fruit a cooked flavour and soft texture . Rather fruits are cut directly into sugar syrup or sugar to prevent oxidation. Sugar not only increases the sweetness but helps to retain volatile aroma. Meat and poultry: Meat and poultry require only wrapping for freezing . After slaughtering the ani - mal, the pork, meat and poultry is chilled promptly to avoid spoilage. The ten - dency of the fat of the pork and poultry to become rancid during storage in a freezer is aggravated by storage before freezing. 4.2.2 Preservation by High Temperature The temperature and time used in heat processing a food depends upon the effects of heat on food and the other pre - servative methods employed.In vegetables, enzyme action may produce undesirable effects on flavour and texture during freezing. So the enzymes must be destroyed by heat - ing before the vegetables are frozen.TipsforPreservation Cryogenic liquids are liquefied gases used for freezing due to its low boiling point. The commonly used cryogenic liquids are liquid nitrogen, liquid car - bon-dioxide and Freon.DO YOU KNOW? Chapter Preservation Methods 764.2.2.1 Pasteurization Pasteurization is a heat treatment that kills part but not all the micro organisms pres - ent and involves the application of tem- peratures below 100\u00b0C. The heating, may be by means of steam, hot water, dry heat or electric currents and the products are cooled immediately after the heat treat - ment . Milk is usually pasteurized. Pasteurized products are not ster - ile. They contain vegetative organisms and spores which are still capable of growth. Hence many pasteurized foods must be stored under refrigeration . Pasteurized milk can be stored for over a week under refrigeration while pasteurized milk stored at room temperature will spoil within a day.at 180\u00b0F to 190\u00b0F. Blanching focuses on deaerating the product inactivating degradative enzymes before further pro - cessing. Blanching is an important step in freezing food , as frozen foods can develop off flavour, vitamin losses and colour changes while in storage. Blanching Prevents bacterial growth. Fixes the natural colour of vegetables - holds the colour. Shrinks the product, better for filling the container .

It is done by dipping the products in boiling water for two to three minutes 4.2.2.3 Canning Canning involves the application of tem - peratures to food that is high enough to destroy essentially all micro organisms present. It also involves airtight sealing in 1. Cut apple/banana. Expose them for 5 minutes in the air. Observe what happens. 2. Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice on a slice of apple. Does the colour change?Activity 2 Chapter 4_070-087.indd 76 31-03-2018 13:21:394 Food Preservation Methods 77sterilized containers to prevent recontam - ination. The degree of heat and the length of time of heating vary with the type of food and the kinds of micro organisms. Large quantities of food are canned for preservation. In developed countries, canned foods form a major part of the diet of the people . Items often canned are meats and meat products, fruits and vege - tables, fish products, soups, etc. The process of canning involves the following steps: Receiving, cleaning, grading and inspecting of raw commodity. Blanching to inactivate enzymes. Placing in the container with added brine or syrup and deaeration of the product. The next process is exhausting. Exhaust - ing is done to expel the air and gas from the can so that its internal pressure, after heating and cooling, is the same as the atmospheric pressure. After exhausting, the filled cans are per - manently sealed mechanically. The sealed containers are subjected to high temperatures, to destroy the most heat resistant organisms. After this, the cans are cooled by water in a cooling canal to about 38\u00b0C, before storage. The final step is casing and storing the cans. 4.2.3 Preservation by Dehydration Dehydration is the extraction of moisture from food products like fruits, vegetables, herbs and meat. It inhibits the growth of microorganisms and imparts a long stor - age life . This is a modern development of smoking and drying. Some changes that occur during the process of dehydra - tion are: Chemical changes Browning and flavour changes Denaturation of proteins Concentration on the surface of the food (case hardening) Dehydration can be done by dry- ing and salting . Evaporation is quickened with the addition of moderate heat which is sometimes provided by natural sunlight . The ultraviolet rays from the sun serve to kill microbes . Modern methods of dehy - dration use circulating air that is heated just enough to promote dehydration with - out cooking the food. Food preservation by drying is one of the oldest methods used by human beings. Drying is one of the methods used for dehydration. 4.2.3.1 Drying Drying is the method nature resorts to pre - serve foods. Natural drying was adopted by early man to dry fruits, fish and meat by exposing them to the sun. p Fig. 4 Home scale canning Chapter 4_070-087.indd 77 31-03-2018 13:21:404 Food Preservation Methods 78Sun drying is used in many parts of the world for preserving certain foods, such as fruits and nuts. However, this method can be used only if the climatic conditions are hot with low humidity. In many cases foods are pretreated before drying to make the structure more porous and to facilitate transfer of moisture, thereby speeding the drying rate. Food porosity increases the chance of quick sol - ubility on reconstitution, but is at a disad - vantage due to increased bulk and shorter storage stability. Vegetables like beans, peas, potatoes, cauliflower, ladies finger , garlic, onion and all leafy vegetables can be sundried. Changes during drying Shrinkage occurs on the surface first and then proceeds to the inner lay - ers. With quick high temperature drying of food, the surface becomes dry and rigid long before the center dries out. Dried food pieces may also contain cracks and pores of various diameters. The shrinking and pore clogging by the solutes is known as core hardening. It can be minimized by gradual drying with low surface temperature. Dried tomatoes Foods that lack good structure and are high in sugar content, give an impres - sion of retaining moisture even after the drying process. Fruits like grapes and figs have high sugar content and lack good structure, hence appearing moist even after dehydration. Complete prevention of these changes is impossible. They can be minimized by using appropriate technology. Dry figs are richer in fiber. A \u00bc - cup serving of dried figs is nutri - tionally comparable to a serving of two large fresh figs, providing about same amount of calories, fibres and potassium. Methods of Drying A number of drying methods are available; some are suitable for liquids, others for solid foods or mixtures containing food pieces. The common drier types used for liquid and solid foods may be categorized as the air-convection drier, drum or roller drier and air-con - vection drier, hot air supplies the heat for evaporation. Though there are dif - ferent types of air-convection driers, they all have an insulated enclosure, a means of circulating air through the enclosure and a means of heating this air. If liquid, the food may be sprayed or poured into pans or on belts. Food in the form of a fine spray or mist is Chapter 4_070-087.indd 78 31-03-2018 13:21:404 Food Preservation Methods 79introduced into a tower or chamber along with heated air. The small drop - lets come into contact with the hot air, blast off their moisture, become small particles and drop to the bottom where they are removed. This method can produce a high quality product even with heat sensitive products like milk, eggs and coffee. Drum or Roller drier - Liquid foods, purees and mashes are dried by this method. The food to be dried is applied, as a continuous thin layer, on to the surface of a revolving drum or between a pair of drums moving in opposite directions heated by steam. The dried layer of food is scraped by a scraper blade positioned at a point on the drum. Foods that are sticky cannot be scraped when it is hot. Such a sticky food becomes brittle when cooled, which facilitates scraping. For heat resistant food products, drum drying is one of the inexpensive dehydration methods. Vacuum driers - This method is quiet expensive but gives good quality foods. It consists of a vacuum chamber that can withstand air pressure and contains shelves to hold food. The shelves are heated. The food gets heated by con - duction and radiated heat. Liquid foods dehydrated by vacuum drying have a puffed structure and are easily dis - solved in water. There is minimum fla - vour change and heat damage because low temperature is used in this method. Dried foods are very convenient as they are light weight, take up little storage space and can be stored for long periods as emergency foods.4.2.4 SmokingofFoods Smoking is mostly done to preserve the meat. This process helps to develop fla - vours in it. Wood smoke contains small amounts of formaldehyde, higher alde - hydes, formic acid, acetic acid and resins. These compounds have antiseptic proper - ties and destroy microorganisms present. The temperature and period of smoking vary with the type of meat. In sausages, the smoking is done for a few hours after smoking the material is packed in polythene bags and kept at refrigerated conditions. 4.2.5 Preservation by Chemical Preservatives Preservatives are chemical agents which serve to retard, hinder or mask undesir - able change in food. Preservatives help in retaining the original quality of food and delaying their spoilage. Preservatives are classified into class I and class II preservative. Class I preservatives are available at home. Class II preservatives are prepared in the industries. Sulphur dioxide is the only permit - ted preservative used in the form of sulphites. In India, sodium benzoate, sulphites and sorbic acids are permitted preser - vatives used in fruits and vegetables. Dried fruits are treated with sul - phur dioxide to conserve the colour and to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Sodium benzoate is preferred to ben - zoic acid because of its solubility and used in tomato ketchups, sauces, jams, jellies, pickles and fruit juices. Chapter 4_070-087.indd 79 31-03-2018 13:21:404 Food Preservation Methods 80 Sorbic acid and its salts are effective against yeasts and moulds but less effective against bacteria. They are good preservatives for foods with high fat content e.g., low fat spreads and processed cheese. Sulphite Fact It is an effective and economical ad - ditive. Sulphites decolourise the an - thocyanin pigment present in food; hence it is not used in grape crush and squashes. Instead sodium benzo - ate is used which retains the colour. Household preservatives - vinegar (acetic acid) and ascorbic acid (in lemon) are used for preservation. 4.2.6 Preservation by High Osmotic Pressure The principle of osmosis is used to pre - serve jams, jellies and pickles. In this process, water tends to draw out from microbes ( plasmolysis) and makes it dehy - drated, thus killing them. But yeasts and moulds are relatively resistant to high osmotic pressure. Hence, preserved foods like pickles tend to spoil if not stored properly. Mango jam 4.2.6.1 High Concentration ofSugar Sugar is used to preserve fruits. Preserving fruits in honey to avoid spoilage is a well known practice. Nowadays jams and jellies prepared from fruits have a high concen - tration of sugar and it acts as a preserva - tive. Pectin, acid and sugar are essential to prepare jam. Jam or jelly are prepared by adding commercially prepared pectin and (Salt, Sugar, Spices, Vinegar, Honey and edible vegetable oils.)Benzoic acid and its sodiu m and potassium salts) Sorbic acid and its sodium and potassium salts)CHEMICAL I Food Preservation Methods 81Preparation of jam: Fruits like apples are cooked with skin and made into pulp with the strainer for making jam Equal quantities of sugar and pulp are taken to make jam. After it is cooked, it is transferred to a sterilized bottle and allowed to cool. Test for doneness for jam Sheet test - the mixture is allowed to drip from a large cool spoon. If the syrup forms a sheet instead of two separate drops, the jam is done. Bubble test - when the end point reaches, big bubbles can be seen throughout the jam. Plate test - set a plate in the freezer for some time. Put the jam and tilt the plate slowly. The jam should come down as a whole mass forming \"U\" shape. Water should not separate out. Fork test - dip the fork into the jam or jelly. Jam of correct consistency forms a sheet between the needles of the fork. Honey Honey is a natural preservative in its orig - inal state and was one of the earliest pre - servatives used by ancient civilizations. It has a high concentration of sugar that draws out the water out of yeast or bacte - ria cells which contaminate the food. 4.2.6.2 High Concentration ofSalt Foods are also preserved by the principle of osmotic pressure in salting and pick - ling. Most commonly used preservative is sodium chloride. Required quantity may be added to slow down or prevent the growth of microorganisms or enough to permit lactic acid fermentation to take place.it also reduces the cooking time. Jellies are clear substances made of fruit juice or the extract of a fruit. Sugar acts in the following ways: Sugar draws the water out of food therefore making it unavailable for microorganisms. As a result of water loss, microbial metabolism is stopped. Hence, the growth of microorganisms is stopped Preparation of jelly: Under-ripe fruits are used, because the pectin content is high and good acidity is essential for a good jelly. Pieces of fruit are completely immersed in water and cooked for 10-20 min - utes. Hard fruits like guavas need to be cooked for 45 minutes. After the fruit is cooked, it is strained without disturbing the fruit pieces. The fruit extracts contain pectin which determines the addition of sugar. When the level of pectin is high, it needs more sugar but requires less boiling time. Rapid boiling facilitates rapid evapora - tion, which avoids strong flavour and darkened colour. Then the jelly is poured in bottles or moulds, and allowed to set without any disturbance. Case study 1 After a grand marriage function, 50 bananas, 5 kgs of tomatoes and 3 kgs of lime were left unused. Suggest ways to preserve these food items. Chapter 4_070-087.indd 81 31-03-2018 13:21:404 Food Preservation Methods 82Sodium chloride preserves the food by the following principles: It causes the high osmotic pressure and hence plasmolysis occurs. It dehydrates foods by drawing out and tying up moisture, as it dehy - drates microbial cell. It ionizes to yield the chlorine ion which is harmful to organisms. It reduces the solubility of oxygen in the moisture. It sensitizes the cell against carbon dioxide. It interferes with the action of pro - teolytic enzymes. Pickling: In pickling, food is placed in edible liq - uids like brine, vinegar or vegetable oil which inhibit or kill microorganisms. Sometimes, food is heated along with pickling agent so that it gets saturated with it. Pickles may be broadly divided into three groups: Sweet pickles e.g., tomato sweet pickle, mango sweet pickle. Sour pickles e.g., mango pickle, lime pickle. Fermented pickles e.g., cucumber pick - le, cabbage pickle, chilli pickle, meat and sausages. The important preservative agents in pickles are salt, vinegar, sugar, oil, spices and condiments. Each has a specific role in preservation.Salted mangoes and cucumber Mango pickle Lemon pickle Cut a lemon into two. On one half, add some salt and leave the other as it is. Leave it aside for a week. Note the changes.Activity 3 Chapter 4_070-087.indd 82 31-03-2018 13:21:414 Food Preservation Methods 83Salt: Salt is employed to control microbial pop - ulation in foods such as butter, cheese, cabbage, olives, cucumbers, meats, fish and bread. There are four methods of salt curing; dry salting (fish), brimming (vadu manga), low salt fermentation (chilli pickle, sauerkraut from cabbage) and pickling (lime pickle). Sodium chlo - ride or common salt is used primarily as a preservative and flavouring agent. Vinegar: Vinegar is a natural preservative. Vinegar is made from a two step process. The first process involves the carbohydrate being converted into alcohol by fermentation. The second step is its conversion to an acetic acid. The acetic acid in vinegar kills microbes and stops food spoilage. Pickling is a common method of using vinegar as a preservative. It is also used to improve the flavour of foods. Spices and condiments: These have bacteriostatic effect (slowing the growth and multiplication of microbes). The essential oil of spices is inhibitor of microorganism. The inhibitory effects of the spices differ with the kind of spice and the microorganisms being tested. Mustard flour and the volatile oil of mus - tard, for example, are very effective against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In pickles like avakai and chilli pickle, mustard flour helps in the prevention of the growth of spoilage organisms in the food. Turmeric powder, tamarind, chilli powder, asafoetida, fenugreek seed, cin - namon and cloves are usually bacterio - static. Ground pepper corn and all spices are less inhibitory than cinnamon and cloves. Extracts of these plants have been shown to be inhibitory to Bacillus subtilis and E. coli . Allicin is the active principle in onions and garlic that kills bacteria and acts against fungi. Bacteriostatic effect - prevents the growth of bacteria (i.e., it keeps them in the stationary phase of growth) Bactericidal effect - means that it kills bacteria (cidal-killing) Oil: In addition to salt and several spices, oils are used in making pickles. Spice mixtures and oil are added to the fruit or vegetable. It is allowed to ferment for a month or so. The fermentation process renders fruits soft and the fruit take on the additional aroma and flavour of the spices. Aerobic bacteria and mould growth are prevented by covering the top with oil. Properly pre - pared and stored pickles can last upto a year or more without spoilage. Spoiled pickleCase study 2 During harvest festival season, to - matoes are available in abundance. How can we make use of this? Chapter 4_070-087.indd 83 31-03-2018 13:21:414 Food Preservation Methods 84Latest techniques in food preservation 4.2.7 Food Irradiation Food irradiation is a process of food preservation in which food is exposed to ionizing energy - radio isotope cobalt 60 and cesium-137 . The electromagnetic radiation suppresses the growth of most microorganisms. Hospitalized patients , who have compromised immune systems and astro - nauts in space , consume irradiated foods. More than forty years of scientific research show that this process is safe. The radiant energy kills the bacteria in the food, but it does not touch the food directly. The uses of food irradiation are: To avoid the use of harmful chemical compounds in insect disinfestations of stored products and microbial decon - tamination of spices. To extend the shelf life of meat, poultry and sea foods by killing microorgan - isms which cause spoilage. To replace the chemicals used for slow - ing sprouting in tubers and bulbs and delay ripening of fruits. 4.2.8 Vacuum Packing Vacuum packing is a process that removes air from the package prior to sealing. This method involves placing items in a plastic film package, removing air from inside, and sealing the package. This technology is widely used all over the world in the pack - aging of milk and milk products, juice etc.Any part of pickle which sticks out of oil gets acted by yeast decreasing the acid level. Once this acid level goes down, the bacteria starts acting on the pickle, making it slimy and slippery. This is how pickles get spoilt .DO YOU KNOW? SUMMARY Millions of fruits and vegetables are produced each year and they are lost due to poor processing and preservation. Hence all fresh foods have to be pre - served to avoid spoilage. Preservation ensures increase in shelf life of foods, the quality, the edibility, retention of nutritive value and reten - tion of original colour of food The principles of food preservation techniques are prevention or delay of microbial decomposition, preven - tion and delay of self-decomposition of food, and prevention of damage caused by mechanical causes, insects and rodents. Preservation methods include tradi - tional techniques and modern indus - trial techniques. In traditional techniques curing, freezing, boiling, pickling and salting, etc., helps to preserve the food for future use. Advanced techniques like vacuum packing, irradiation improves the quality and shelf life of the food.Facts! China is the largest apple producing country in the world.

Everybody eats food and most people enjoy it. From the beginning, scientists were curious about the food they consumed, its passage in the body and its effects. In the beginning nutrition was mainly related to the energy needs of the body from carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Minerals were studied in detail when they were discovered to be important nutrients. Along with the minerals came the discovery of vitamins. Now nutrition is an important part of our life. We have realized that quality of our health depends upon the nourishment we provide to our body. Most people eat what they like and their choice of food is not influenced by the awareness of its nutritive value. It is always necessary to understand that a delicious dish is not necessarily a nutritious one.Learning Objectives 5.1.1 Introduction to Nutrition Science Definition: Nutrition is the science of foods, the nutrients and their action, interaction and balance in relationship to health and disease; the process by which the organism ingests, digests, absorbs, transports and utilizes nutrients and disposes of their end products. This chapter helps the students to travel through the world of nutrients and their impact on health of humans. It also serves to: Be an eye opener towards the concept of nutrition Give an understanding of macronutrients and micronutrients Study the role of nutrients and their vitality in human life Enlighten the hazards of improper nutrition Gain knowledge about the likelihood of overcoming deficiency disorders Nutrients are the constituents in food that must be supplied to the body in suitable amounts. They are classified as macronutrients and micronutrients.Antoine Lavoisier is the father of Nutrition. He designed a calorimeter which measured the heat produced by the body from work and consumption of varying amounts and types of foods5Nutrition Chapter Chapter5_088-119.indd 1 18-01-2019 12:29:065 Nutrition 89 5.2 MACRONUTRIENTS Macronutrients refer to the nutrients that are needed in large quantities. They are broadly classified as carbohydrates, protein and lipids/fats. 5.2.1 Carbohydrates Definition: Carbohydrates are sugars or polymers of sugars such as starch that can be hydrolyzed to simple sugars by the action of digestive enzymes or by heating with dilute acids. Generally but p Fig. 1 Depiction of Poorly nourished children and wellnourished children Nutrients Macro nutrients Micro nutrients Carbohydrates Vitamins Proteins Minerals Lipids/fats not always, the hydrogen and oxygen in them are in proportion to form water, hence the term carbohydrate. The predominant function of the carbohydrates is to provide energy needed by our body. Starch found in cereals and sugar in sugarcane and fruits are examples of carbohydrates in foods. Classification: The dietary carbohydrates are classified as: Poorly nourished children Wellnourished children Chapter5_088-119.indd 2 18-01-2019 12:29:075 Nutrition 90 Functions: The functions of carbohydrates include Carbohydrates are a source of energy. Each gram of carbohydrate yields 4 kilo calories Adequate supply of carbohydrate ensures that proteins are spared from performing the role of giving energy. Major source of energy for muscular work.

Stimulates the peristaltic movement in the form of dietary fiber which helps in preventing heart diseases, diabetes mellitus and cancer. Food Sources: Carbohydrates are found in cereals like Rice, Wheat, Bajra, Jowar. Fruits, Honey and Jaggery are also rich sources of carbohydrates Food sources of carbohydrates Chapter5_088-119.indd 3 18-01-2019 12:29:075 Nutrition 915.2.2 Proteins: Definition The word ' protein ' is derived from the Greek word protos meaning 'first' . Protein is the basic chemical unit of living organisms and is essential for nutrition, building of new tissues (growth) and maintaining and repairing of those already built. Casein from milk, albumin in egg and gluten in wheat, are examples of proteins occurring in foods. Classification: The proteins are classified as: Complete proteins e.g. Egg proteins Partially complete proteins e.g. wheat proteins Incomplete proteins e.g. Gelatin or zein Functions : Proteins perform the following functions; Necessary for growth Wear and tear of human body is repaired For regular supply of raw materials for the formation of digestive juices, hormones, plasma proteins, hemoglobin, vitamins and enzymes. p Bajra p Jowar p Honey p Fruits p Jaggery Chapter5_088-119.indd 4 18-01-2019 12:29:095 Nutrition 92 p Meat p Pulses p Fish p Oil seeds Each gram of protein supplies 4 Kcal of energy Food Sources: Animal foods like Meat, Fish, Eggs and Milk are excellent sources of proteins.

Protein energy malnutrition is due to \"food gap\" between the intake and requirement. The average energy deficit in Indian children is 300kcal/ day. Deficiency of protein is discussed in detail in the section protein energy malnutrition 5.2.3 Lipids/Fats Definition: Lipids are organic substances soluble in fat solvents such as alcohol, ether, and chloroform but not in water. The term includes fatty acids, soaps, neutral fats, phospholipids, steroids and waxes. Oils found in seeds, butter from milk, and lard from meat, are examples of fats found in foods. Classification: Lipids are classified as follows Functions: The functions of lipids are to Provide energy reserve and supply 9 kcal/gram. Serve as a vehicle for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K Supply essential fatty acids necessary for growth and functionTable 1 ClassificationofLipids Simple Lipids Compound Lipids Derived Lipids Fats and Oils lipids Waxes Glycolipids Lipoprotein Source: Swaminathan.M 2012, Foods and Nutrition, Bangalore Printing and Publishing Company, Bangalore. p Butter p Ghee Provide energy source so that proteins are spared for tissue growth and repair Gives satiety Act as insulators against heat and cold.

It was observed that the macronutrients alone were not sufficient to promote and sustain growth. Th is led to the discovery of the micronutrients namely the minerals and vitamins which are essential for growth and maintenance. Macro minerals are those which are present at levels more than 0.05 percent in the human body. Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium belong to this category. Other minerals present at less than 0.05 percent in the human body are defi ned as micro minerals. Th e micro minerals are also Chapter5_088-119.indd 7 18-01-2019 12:29:145 Nutrition 95known as the trace elements. Some micro minerals are iron, iodine, zinc, copper, fluorine, selenium, chromium, manganese, cobalt and molybdenum. 5.3.1 Minerals The minerals calcium, phosphorus, iron iodine, sodium and others are found in various foods in combination with organic and inorganic compounds. Minerals are necessary for body building, for building bones, teeth and structural parts of soft tissues. (i) Calcium Distribution: Calcium makes up between 1.5 to 2 percent of body weight accounting for 1200-1600 g of the adult male body. Ninety percent of calcium is found in mineralized tissues such as bones and teeth as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. The remaining 1% is found in blood, extracellular fluid (ECF), muscle and tissues. Functions: The functions of calcium in humans are manifold: Bone formation: The important minerals within bone are calcium phosphate and magnesium. There is 1 kg of calcium in the adult skeleton as a complete crystalline material with phosphate. Tooth formation: The enamel and dentin of tooth contain considerable amounts of calcium which are dense and are present along with keratin. Growth: It is required for growth as it forms an important part of the bones and teeth and proper functioning of every cell in the body. Blood clotting: Calcium contributes to clotting of blood. Contraction of the muscle: Calcium ions are bound by the electrostatic forces to the proteins inside and outside the cells and to cell membranes. Proteins bound by calcium alter their configuration at the neuro muscular junction by the nerve impulses causing free calcium to be released. The free calcium bound to troponin leads to an internal trigger and so the contraction of the muscle takes place Metabolic essentiality: Calcium acts as a activator for the enzyme renin present in gastric juice which aids the digestion of milk. Food sources: Calcium is present in both animal and plant foods. The richest source of calcium among animal foods is milk and Chapter5_088-119.indd 8 18-01-2019 12:29:145 Nutrition 96among the vegetable sources it is green leafy vegetables. Among the green leafy vegetables, amaranth, fenugreek and drumstick leaves are rich sources of calcium. Ragi among cereals is a rich source of calcium. Small dried fish, nuts and oil seeds like gingelly seeds, betel leaf with slaked lime are also a rich source. Absorption: Factors increasing absorption of calcium: Vitamin D, acidity of digestive mass, lactose, protein and phosphorus are the factors which favor the absorption of calcium. Factors decreasing absorption of calcium: Oxalic acid, phytic acid, high fat diets including steatorrhea, emotional instability, increased gastrointestinal mobility, lack of exercise, ageing, caffeine and drugs decrease the absorption of calcium resorption predominates bone formation resulting in osteoporosis. Risk factors for osteoporosis include Females who are fair complexioned are at eight times more at risk Asian Race Family history Prolonged dietary insufficiency Poor absorption and utilization of calcium Restricted movement Decreased levels of estrogen Hyper parathyroidism Vitamin D insufficiency Osteomalacia: It is a condition where the quality of the bone is diminished and the quantity of the bone is not compromised. Osteopenia: It refers to the bone density that is lower than normal peak density but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. Food for thought: Cola beverages and bone fractures Drinking cola beverages which contain phosphoric acid and often caffeine may increase the fragility of bones in children and adolescents. So it's better to avoid cola drinks. in the body. Health Problems/ Deficiency: Osteoporosis: This is a condition associated with a loss in bone density and bone mass which literally means \"porous bone\" . With the ageing process The strength of the bone is measured by a bone density test using a CT (Computed Tomography) scan or DEXA (Dual energy X ray Absorptiometry). The numerical result of the bone density is quantified as a \"T score\". The lower the T score, the lower the bone density. T scores greater than 1.0 are considered normal and indicate healthy bone. T scores between 1.0 and -2.5 indicate osteopenia. T scores lower than -2.5 indicate osteoporosis. Chapter5_088-119.indd 9 18-01-2019 12:29:145 Nutrition 97The difference between osteopenia and osteoporosis is a matter of severity of the loss of bone density. Tetany : A decrease in serum calcium levels gives rise to a condition called tetany. The symptoms of tetany are severe intermittent spasms of the muscles of hands and feet accompanied by muscular pain. Twitching of facial muscles occurs. (ii) Phosphorus Distribution: It comprises 1 percent of total body weight along with calcium. An adult human body contains about 400-700 g of phosphorus as phosphates. Bones and teeth contain 85 percent of phosphorus and soft tissues contain15 percent of phosphorus. Functions: Formation of bone and teeth along with calcium and magnesium. Formation of phospholipids which are integral parts of cell structure. Constituent of co enzymes like coenzyme I and co - carboxylase. Integral constituent of DNA and RNA (nucleic acids) and nucleoproteins. Buffering of acid or alkali excesses to maintain normal pH. Temporary storage and transfer of the energy derived from metabolic fuels. As part of enzymes needed for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. Food Sources: Phosphorus is widely distributed in foods. Milk and meat are rich in phosphorus. Whole grain cereals, legumes, nuts, carrots and fish are also rich sources of phosphorus. Calcium Phosphorus ratio: Nutritionists recommend that a Ca:P ratio between 1:1 to 2:1 should be provided by the total diet. Deficiency: Phosphorus is so ubiquitous in various foods that near total starvation is required to produce dietary phosphorus deficiency. Inadequate phosphorus intake is expressed as hypophosphatemia which manifests in the form of anemia, anorexia , muscle weakness, bone pain, rickets, osteomalacia, general weakness and increased susceptibility to infection. (iii) Iron Distribution: Iron content of normal adult man is estimated to be about 4 grams. Iron is distributed as 60% in the circulating hemoglobin , non heme enzymes (5%). The remaining iron is found in body storage as ferritin (20%) and hemosiderin (10%) the two major iron storage proteins. Low iron status, Low heam iron intake. Factors decreasing the absorption of iron: Binding agents like fiber, phosphates, phytates and oxalates, High calcium intake, Achlorohydria (low gastric acid) Infection Gastrointestinal disease. Functions: Iron has varied significant functions in human body. They include: Transport and storage of oxygen where each gram of hemoglobin contains about 3.34 mg of iron. As myoglobin iron is required for oxygen storage in muscle. Iron acts as a cofactor of enzymes. It is a component of cell enzyme systems that oxidize glucose and other energy yielding nutrients. Production of immune cells that attack foreign bacteria invading the body. Positive iron balance is necessary for continued growth. To build reserves for physiologic stress during adolescence for both boys and girls. Necessary for brain development, cognitive function, the synthesis and breakdown of neurotransmitters. Food sources: Rich sources of iron are cereals, millets, pulses and green leafy vegetables. Of the cereal grains and millets bajra and ragi are very good sources of iron. Other sources of plant foods include manathakali Heme absorption varies from 15-35 % depending on the iron status of the consumer. Non heme iron absorption can vary widely from less than 1% to more than 90% but usually in the range of 1-20%. In developing countries estimated prevalence of anemia is 39 percent in children and 42 percent in women. In Asia 12.8 of maternal mortality deaths are caused by anemia. Forms of dietary iron Heme iron: Heme iron is the iron associated to the protein globin to form hemoglobin and is found in flesh foods only Non heme iron: This form is present in all plant sources in addition to 60% of animal sources. Absorption: Several factors favor and inhibit iron absorption Factors favoring absorption of Iron: Body needs, Ascorbic acid, Animal tissues, Pregnancy, Chapter5_088-119.indd 11 18-01-2019 12:29:155 Nutrition 99leaves, rice flakes, mint, soya bean, cow pea, gingelly seeds and dates. Animal food sources include red meat, and fishes like herring and mackerel. Causes: Low iron intake, blood loss, malabsorption chronic diseases, obesity Regular consumption of iron rich foods, vitamin C rich foods, seasonal fruits and vegetables can definitely prevent anemia. Deficiency Iron Deficiency anemia: When there is an insufficiency of iron for the formation of hemoglobin, the RBC's become pale and small. The resulting anemia is called hypochromic and microcytic anaemia which is the most common form of anaemia throughout the world affecting women mainly in their reproductive years, infants and children. p Normal RBC p Microcytic and hypochromic RBC Signs of Iron Deficiency Fatigue Muscle weakness, Pale color Decreased resistance to infection Spoon nails(Koilonchyia) Angular stomatitis Dizziness Dimness of vision Insomnia Headache Chapter5_088-119.indd 12 18-01-2019 12:29:155 Nutrition 100quantities to produce normal quantity of thyroxine. It also arises from eating foods (goitrogens) that inhibit the synthesis of thyroxine. Prepare recipes using low cost iron rich food sources for breakfast kunch and dinner for an adolescent girl with anemia (iv) Iodine Distribution: It is one of the essential micronutrients required for normal growth and development of human brain and body. Human body contains a total of 15-20 mg of iodine. Thyroid gland contains 75% of iodine and is an essential constituent of thyroxine the active principle of thyroid gland Functions: Iodine though required in small quantities is needed to perform the following functions Synthesis of thyroxine which regulates growth, development and reproduction. Helps the thyroid hormones to increase and regulate the processes of brain function Enables the thyroid hormones to regulate the conversion of carotene to active vitamin A. Food sources: Marine fish and eggs are good sources of iodine. Based on the dietary pattern and analysis of raw foods, iodine content of various regional diets range from 170-300 g/ day Deficiency: It covers a collection of disorders at all stages of human growth and development. Goiter: Goiter is the enlargement of thyroid gland which results when iodine is not available in sufficient Cretinism: A congenital disease resulting from a lack of iodine and thyroxin secretion characterized by physical deformity, dwarfism, men - tal retardation and often goiters.REMEMBER 21st October is Global Iodine Deficiency Disorder DayActivity 1 Chapter5_088-119.indd 13 18-01-2019 12:29:155 Nutrition 101Dietary improvement: Salt iodization remains the most cost effective way to deliver iodine to both humans and livestock and is credited with eradicating iodine deficiency. the zinc is found in the outer fiber rich part of the kernel.

What is the condition she is suf - fering from? 2. What is the nutrient deficient in her food? 3. Suggest some foods for her quick recovery (v) Zinc Distribution: Zinc is the most important intracellular trace element. An adult human contains 2g of zinc of which 60% is in skeletal muscle, 30% in bone and 4-6% is present in zinc. Functions: The functions of zinc include Important constituent of enzymes like alkaline phosphatase and carbonic anhydrase. Required by protein kinases that participate in gene expression. Also a component of metalloenzymes. Food sources: Meat, seafood and liver are good sources of bioavailable zinc. In cereals most of Deficiency: The clinical manifestations of severe zinc deficiency in humans are growth retardation, dermatitis, hair loss, diarrohea, increased infections, delayed wound healing, loss of appetite, hypoguesia (diminished taste) dysguesia (altered taste) hyposmia (diminished smell). Decreased zinc intake is associated with increased risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. 5.3.2. Vitamins Fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and also water-soluble vitamins C and B group are found in foods. These are needed for Fat Soluble Water Soluble A, D, E, K B complex group and C Chapter5_088-119.indd 14 18-01-2019 12:29:165 Nutrition 102 Food sources: In the animal foods vitamin A is present in the form of retinol which are identified to be liver, cream, butter and egg yolk. Liver oils of fish like cod, halibut and shark are the richest sources of vitamin A. The main contributors of beta carotene are the yellow and green vegetable fruit sources of carotene- carrots, papaya, mango, sweet potatoes, g for Vision Light Sensin g for Biological Clock Homo sapiensLight-Sensitive Ganglion CellsPhototac tic or Photophobic ResponseEyespo t Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth, normal function of the body and normal body processes. 5.3.2.1 Fat Soluble Vitamins (a) Vitamin A: The vitamin A compounds include retinol, retinal and retinoic acid. Because it has a specific function in the retina of the eye and because it is an alcohol it was given the name retinol. Beta carotene is precursor of vitamin A and is found in large quantities in vegetables and fruits. Functions: Vitamin A performs the following functions: Vitamin A is essential for vision in normal and dim light. Formation and maintenance of healthy functioning epithelial tissue. Glycoprotein and mucoprotein synthesis Cancer prevention Prevention of degeneration of myelin sheath Normal bone formation and reproduction. Deficiency: Decreased Vitamin A intake leads to vision problems Night blindness: People suffering from night blindness cannot see objects in dim light Xerosis Conjunctiva: The conjunctiva is dry, thickened, wrinkled and pigmented. This is due to the keratinization of the epithelial cells. Xerosis Cornea: This manifests in the form of corneal dryness which gives the cornea a dull Chapter5_088-119.indd 15 18-01-2019 12:29:165 Nutrition 103hazy These greyish or glistening white plaques occurring in the conjunctiva usually triangular in shape and are found in children. Keratomalacia: When Xerosis of vitamin A rich food, improve - ment in household food security and availability of vitamin A rich foods and a periodic massive dose of vitamin A. of the conjunctiva and cornea is not treated it may develop into the condition called kerato malacia which is characterized by necrosis, ulceration and bacterial invasion of cornea leading to the total destruction of the eyeball and eventually total blindness. WHO in 2013 has estimated 44 percent of South Asians suffer from Vitamin A deficiency and it has been identified as a major public health problem.INTERESTING FACT UNICEF-supported Vitamin A sup - plementation programmes have been reaching children aged 6 to 59 months across the globe. They have improved the immunity of children and their chance of survival has increased from 12 to 24 per cent. Suggest simple dietary tips to enhance the intake of Vitamin A for school children (b) Vitamin D: Vitamin D is known to be a prohormone of a sterol type and the synthesis of active form of vitamin D is known as the 1,25 - dihydroxycholecalciferol which is accomplished by the combined action of skin, liver and kidneys. Functions Maintains balance with parathyroid hormone to stimulate the active transport of calcium and phosphorus. Acts on the bones promoting calcification. Facilitates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestines. Involved in widespread basic cell processes with targets Prevention of vitamin A deficiency The strategy should be a combina - tion of long term nutrition educa - tion programme, enhanced intake Activity 2 Chapter5_088-119.indd 16 18-01-2019 12:29:165 Nutrition 104in brain, kidney, liver, skin, reproductive tissues. Food sources: Vitamin D is present only in some foods of animal origin. Certain marine fishes and fresh water fishes are known to be good sources of vitamin D. The most important sources are egg yolk, butter, cheese, milk. Deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency occurs in children who are not adequately exposed to sunlight. It is characterized by inadequate mineralization of the bone. In children the condition is known as rickets and in adults it is called Osteomalacia. Rickets: In rickets there is softening of the skull bones and the head is enlarged, elongated and flattened on the vertex. Softening of the ribs, sinking of the chest, beaded junctions of the ribs with cartilages (rickety rosary), pigeon chest, knock knees and bow legs. Deformities of the long bones spine, pelvis, muscles, and feet are observed. Dentition is delayed. Osteomalacia: It is the adult counterpart of rickets. It occurs in women of child bearing age and in those who consume poor cereal diets deficient in vitamin D and calcium. Besides it is found among those who stay indoors all day and seldom go out in the sun. (c) Vitamin E: Vitamin E is the generic name for a group of vitamins, three of which -alpha tocopherol, beta tocopherol and gamma tocopherol display the greatest biologic activity. Of these three, alpha tocopherol is the most significant form of Vitamin E Functions Vitamin E a major antioxidant which reduces the incidence of heart diseases. It is essential for normal reproduction in man. It acts along with selenium in reducing the body's requirement for each other. It plays a vital role in the immune function of the body. Chapter5_088-119.indd 17 18-01-2019 12:29:175 Nutrition 105 Food sources: Vegetable oils, nuts and whole grams are the richest sources of vitamin E (eg. Wheat germ oil). It is present in small quantities in lettuce, grasses and embryos of many seeds. In general, plant foods are richer sources of vitamin E than animal foods. Functions: The major functions of Vitamin K though not many are listed as follows: Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting. Required for the synthesis of blood clotting factors by the liver. Vitamin K is vital to maintain normal levels and activation of blood clotting factor like prothrombin, Food Sources: The major dietary source of vitamin K is Phyllo Quinone which is present in high concentration in most vegetables like cabbage, spinach and cauliflower. Animal food sources include cheese, egg yolk, and liver. Deficiency: Vitamin E deficiency has been associated with irritability, edema and hemolytic anemia among infants. Also muscular dystrophy is common to all species in which there is degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle with vitamin E deficiency. (d) Vitamin K Vitamin K occurs in two forms. 1. Phylloquinones (vitamin K1) - plant source and dietary form of vitamin K 2. Menaquinone (vitamin K2) - synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora.

The Philippino word beri beri means \"I Can't\" refers to the lack of neuromotor coordination in persons with the disease. Deficiency: It manifests in the form of defective blood clotting. Low levels of prothrombin and hemorrhage are seen in severe forms of deficiency. 5.3.2.2 Water Soluble Vitamins (a) Thiamin (B1): Thiamin is the first member of the B complex vitamins which is essential to the body in its coenzyme form. Functions: The coenzyme of thiamin is Thiamin Pyro Phosphate (TPP). Thiamin is useful in our body for the following functions It enhances growth in human beings. It plays an important role as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism Maintenance of nerves in normal condition. Food sources: Good food sources include lean pork, beef, liver, whole or enriched grams and legumes.p Fig. 3 Types of Beri BeriBeri Beridry wet Beri Beri is of two types: dry and wet type. In dry beri beri the muscles become progressively wasted, weak and walking becomes difficult. If not treated the patient becomes bedridden and will die. In wet beri beri edema is present which involves the face, trunk and serous cavities. Palpitation and breathlessness are present. The heart becomes weak Deficiency of thiamin: The discovery of thiamin provided the answer to the puzzle of a nutritional problem called beri Chapter5_088-119.indd 19 18-01-2019 12:29:175 Nutrition 107and death occurs due to heart failure. Infantile beri beri is seen in many South East Asian countries where the diets consist mostly of \"polished rice\" . (b) Riboflavin (B2): Riboflavin is a stable vitamin which is resistant to acid, heat and oxidation. But it is unstable in the presence of alkali and light. Functions: The two (FAD) perform the following functions Formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Regulates the functions of hormones in carbohydrate metabolism. Present in the retina in the free form which gets converted to a compound which stimulates the optic nerve. Release of energy from glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Food sources: Good sources of riboflavin are milk and milk products, eggs, liver, whole or enriched grains and green leafy vegetables. Deficiency: The deficiency of riboflavin (ariboflavinosis) leads to glossitis (swollen and reddened tongue), swollen lips, cheilosis (inflammation of the corners of the mouth, are some of the common symptoms observed. Further deficiency states are marked by chronic conditions like tuberculosis, prolonged fevers, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism and malignancy. (c) Niacin: Niacin formerly known as nicotinic acid was obtained by the oxidation of nicotinic acid. Apart from the food sources, Niacin is also obtained from tryptophan (60mg) an essential amino acid which can be converted (1mg). required for: Release of energy from all energy yielding nutrients like carbohydrate, protein and fat. Normal functioning of the skin, intestinal tract and the nervous system. Chapter5_088-119.indd 20 18-01-2019 12:29:175 Nutrition 108 Synthesis of protein and fat for the formation of DNA and RNA. Food sources: Whole cereals, pulses, nuts and meat are good sources of Niacin. Groundnut is rich in Niacin. Milk is rich in Tryptophan the precursor of Niacin in the body.Consumption of diets rich in corn can create amino acid imbalance as corn is rich in leucine and deficient in tryptophan. The typical features of pellagra are loss of weight and increasing weakness. Non- specific signs like anorexia, nausea, digestive disturbances and emotional changes like anxiety, irritability and insomnia may be present. Deficiency: Deficiency of Niacin causes Pellagra which is the 3D (Dermatitis, diarrohea, dementia or depression) disease leading to the fourth D (Death). p Fig. 4 Pellagra or 3D diseaseDeath 3D'sDermatitis Diarrohea Dementia (d) Pyridoxine co-enzyme form of pyridoxine. Functions: Pyridoxal 5 phosphate acts as a coenzyme in protein metabolism. Its functions include Amino acid transport. Essential for the growth of infants. Food sources: Good food sources include grains, seeds, liver, kidney and other meats. Food sources: The rich sources of folate are fish, mutton, liver, egg, chicken, green leafy vegetables and pulses. Deficiency: Clinical Symptoms of pyridoxine deficiency have not been clearly defined. Some types of angular stomatitis (cracking at the corners of the lips) and certain types of anaemia have been reported due to decreased intake of pyridoxine. (e) Folic acid: The term folic acid was coined to as it was first extracted from dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach. Functions: The different functions of folate include: Normal growth and division of all cells. Maturation of red blood cells. Vital role in the metabolism of some amino acids. Deficiency: Deficiency of folic acid causes megaloblastic anaemia. Megaloblasts appear in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Poor dietary intake of folic acid, low absorption, increased losses, increased requirements, infestation, infection and drugs also cause folic acid deficiency. Symptoms include weakness, tiredness, dyspnea, sore tongue, headache and palpitation. Folate Chapter5_088-119.indd 22 18-01-2019 12:29:185 Nutrition 110deficiency during pregnancy can result in neural tube defects like spina bifida and anencephaly. (f) Cyanocobalamin (B12): The vitamin is named as cyanocobalamin because of the presence of cobalt and cyanide in its structure. It can be absorbed in the body only in the presence of Intrinsic Factor (IF). Functions: Physiological functions and biochemical functions of cyanocobalmin are: Maturation of erythrocytes Synthesis of myelin (white sheath of lipoprotein) that surrounds many nerve fibres. Increase in White Blood Corpuscle (WBC) count and platelet. Stimulation of appetite and general wellbeing of the people. Cures neurological symptoms of pernicious anemia. Food sources: Cyanocobalmin is synthesized by bacteria and is found in foods of animal origin. Liver is the richest source of cyanocobalmin. Meat, fish, kidney, brain and eggs are good sources of cyanocobalmin. Deficiency: Inability to produce the intrinsic factor which binds cyanocobalmin leads to pernicious anemia. The red blood cells are macrocytic and the count is often less than 2.5 million. Symptoms include soreness and inflammation of the tongue, paresthesia (numbness and tingling) in fingers and toes, demyelination of the white fibres of the spinal cord and in severe cases degeneration of the spinal cord. Other B complex vitamins include biotin, pantothenic acid which do have their vital functions as coenzymes in various biochemical functions of the body (g) Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid): Ascorbic acid is the chemical name of vitamin C which can be synthesized from glucose but humans depend on their diet for vitamin C as they do not have an enzyme gulonolactone oxidase which catalyzes the conversion reaction. Functions: Functions of vitamin C include: Collagen formation of bone, teeth, cartilage, skin and scar tissue. Formation of dentin layer of tooth Wound healing. Activation of calcitonin, gastrin, oxytocin, thyrotropin, vasopressin. Drug detoxification Regulation of cholesterol, maintenance of the blood vessel structure and antioxidant effects.

Adrenal cortex function. Enhances calcium absorption. Food Sources: Citrus fruits like orange, lemon, tomatoes, guava, watermelon are good sources of Vitamin C 5.4 WATER Water : Water is defined as an essential nutrient because it is required in amounts that exceed the body's ability to produce it. All biochemical reactions occur in water. It fills the spaces in and between cells and Deficiency: Scurvy the most severe form of vitamin C deficiency arises mainly due to faulty cooking habits and inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. The clinical features of scurvy are characterized by gingivitis (bleeding gums) petechiae (small hemorrhagic spots), arthralgia (pain in the joint), depression, postural hypotension, delayed wound healing. Main deficiency symptoms in infants include tender bones, cessation of bone growth, anaemia and pyrexia.Scurvy Scurvy leg Scurvy Chapter5_088-119.indd 24 18-01-2019 12:29:195 Nutrition 112helps form structures of large molecules such as protein and glycogen. In human adults total body water accounts for about 70 per cent of the lean body mass. Distribution: In an adult male of 70 kg body weight, 70, percent of water that is 30 litres is found in intracellular fluids. Of this about 4 litres are found in bones. The remaining 30 percent of water is extra cellular fluid found in 3 litres of plasma and 8.5 litres of interstitial fluid and one litre of transcellular fluid which includes saliva, pancreatic juice, aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid. Functions: Water performs the following functions in the body Controls body temperature Transports nutrients and waste Dissolves important substances in tissues and cells Dissolves medications Lubricate the cushion joints Protect the spinal cord and other sensitive tissues Get rid of wastes through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements. Requirements: the requirement of water depends on person's age, weight and life style. Adults should consume 1 litre of water for every 1000kcal in their diet, infants should consume 1.5 litre/1000kcal. Overall water balance: The average adult processes 2.5 litres to 3 litres of water each day. Water enters the body in three forms: Water taken in as water or in other beverages Preformed water in food Metabolic water produced by cell oxidation Water leaves the body in the follow - ing ways via the Kidneys Skin Lungs Faeces Water imbalance: Water can be depleted in the body due to reduced intake caused by unavailability of water, inability to obtain water and swallow it. Increased losses of water are also experienced due to hot environment, hyperventilation, prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, kidney disorders and diabetes insipidus. Water deprivation: Dehydration of body occurs when water is not taken in adequate amounts to make up for the water loss. It occurs in severe diarrhea and vomiting. Evidence of dehydration manifests in the form of sunken eyes, dry tongue, loose and inelastic skin. Simple water deprivation also causes loss of sodium and potassium.

Steps to alleviate malnutrition Health Promotion: Measures direct to pregnant and lactating women (education, supplement) Promotion of breastfeeding Development of low cost weaning food Educating mothers to plan and space child birth Ensuring food security in the home Ensuring clean environment Specific protection: Increase intake of protein and energy rich food (e.g. milk, egg, fresh fruits) Educating people towards regular immunization Promote intake of fortified foods. Early diagnosis and treatment: Baseline information Early detection of clinical signs of protein energy malnutrition Regular assessment of body mass index Biochemical and laboratory investigations. Rehabilitation: Hospital treatment Nutritional rehabilitation services (NRC i.e. Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers) Follow up care SUMMARY Nutrients are essential for providing nourishment to the body. They are broadly classified as macronutrients and micronutrients. Humans contract nutritional deficiencies if the nutrients are not consumed in right amounts and right proportion. Macronutrient deficiencies are mainly related to proteins of the body. Protein energy malnutrition results in conditions like Marasmus and Kwashiorkor which predominantly affect children in their developmental years. Deficiency of Minerals like calcium causes bone related disorders like osteopenia, osteoporosis. Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by consumption of iron rich foods like ragi, dates, jaggery and green leafy vegetables. Iodine is an essential mineral to prevent goiter. Fat soluble and water soluble vitamins are essential for the normal functioning of the body and their deficiencies lead to multiple deficiency disorders. Fat soluble vitamin deficiencies are predominantly related to vision, bone health, child birth and blood clotting. Water soluble vitamin deficiencies can lead to diseases like beriberi, pellagra, scurvy, megaloblastic anemia and pernicious anemia. Water the universal solvent is also considered as a nutrient Water dehydration and intoxication can also lead to fatal consequences.

It reflects cultural heritage and gives a feeling of security and pleas - ure. Healthy food intake is an important To provide an indepth understanding of meal management for people of different age groups. To provide a body of knowledge relevant to the study of the role of nutrition throughout the lifecycle. To provide an understanding about the link between nutri - tional needs and nutrition related problems To identify and overcome obstacles in the provision of healthy diets for specific age groups. Chapter6_120-155.indd 120 31-03-2018 13:24:566 Family Meal Management 121Health: Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO, 1948). Nutrient requirement: It is defined as the minimum amount of the absorbed nutrient that is necessary for maintaining the normal physiological functions of the body. Calorie: A calorie is the energy it takes to raise the temperature of I gram of water to 1 degree Celsius. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): The amount of energy expended daily when the body is at complete rest. Dietary Fibre: Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is important for proper bowel function, to reduce chronic constipation, diver - ticular disease, haemorrhoids, coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. They protect against colon cancer. Antioxidants: Antioxidants restrict the damage that reactive oxygen free radicals can cause cellular components. They are of primary biological value in giving protection from certain diseases. Raw and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots and fresh fruits including citrus fruits and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants.Important terminologies part of life. Hence, it is very essential to gain knowledge about food, its planning, preparation and service. Creative meal management for people at different age groups can add pleasure and satisfaction to their lives and ensure healthy living.basic food groups. The nutrient require - ments vary with age, gender, physiologi - cal status and physical activity. A balanced diet provides (i) 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, (ii) about 10-15% from proteins (iii) and 20-30% from both visible and invisible fat. In addition, a balanced diet should provide other non- nutrients such as dietary fiber, antioxi - dants and phytochemicals. 6.1.2 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) presented are in estimates of nu - trients to be consumed daily to ensure that the requirements of all individu - als in a given population are met. The Vegans eat no foods of animal origin 6.1.1 Balanced Diet A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper proportions so that the need for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients are adequately met. It can be easily achieved through a blend of four Chapter6_120-155.indd 121 31-03-2018 13:24:566 Family Meal Management 122 recommended levels depend upon the bio availability of nutrients from a given diet. The term bio availability indicates what is absorbed and utilised by the body. In ad - dition RDA includes a margin of safety, to cover variation between individuals, die - tary traditions and practices. The RDAs are suggested for all age groups such as infants, pre-schoolers, children, adoles - cents, pregnant women, lactating mothers and adult men and women taking into ac - count their physical activity. The RDA of an individual depends upon various fac - tors which are as follows: 1. Age: Adults require more total calories than a child, whereas a growing child requires more calories per kg of body weight than an adult. 2. Sex: Males with high Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) require more calories than females. 3. Activity: The type of activity also determines the energy requirements. The activities are classified as sedentary, moderate and heavy based on the occupation of an individual as given in the table 1 below 4. Physiological: Nutrient requirements Stress are increased in conditions of physiological stress such as pregnancy and lactation. 6.1.3 Steps in Planning Balanced Diets or Menu Using Food Guide Pyramid and Exchange Lists Menu planning is the process of planning and scheduling intake of meals for general or specific individual requirements. The four food groups suggested by ICMR given in unit-III (Food Science), permits an indi - vidual to plan a menu to achieve nutrient intake as specified by recommended die - tary allowances. There are certain princi - ples in planning menus. They are: 1. A good menu plan should meet the nu - tritional requirements of each member of the family. 2. Meal pattern must fulfill family needs. 3. Meal planning should save time and energy. 4. Meal planning should satisfy the bud - get of the family. 5. Meal plan should give maximum nutrients.

The meal planned should consider in - dividual likes and dislikes. 7. Planned meals should provide variety. 8. Meals should give satiety. 9. Menus should include available foods. There are three steps involved in planning a menu Step1: Recommended dietary allowance: To plan a balanced diet the first step is to know the recommended dietary allow - ances for different age groups.The Recommended Dietary Allowance for Indians ICMR (2010) is given in the Table 2.

This can be done by: Selecting food from all the four food groups. Deciding the quantities of the selected as multiples of portion sizes. Food list can be prepared either by using ICMR tables or exchange lists. i. Using ICMR tables To make menu planning more con - venient ICMR has suggested the portion size and balanced diets for adults and for different age groups. The portion sizes are given in terms of raw food. ii. The Exchange Lists The Exchange Lists are the basis of a meal planning. Food exchange lists are groups of measured foods of the same calorific value and similar protein, fat and carbohydrate content. All foods of exchange lists make a specific contribution to a good diet. Food exchange lists help in manipulation of protein, calories and other nutrients. Step 3: Meal plan The foods that are listed are converted into recipes and distributed in various meals like breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The de velopment during infancy is more rapid than during at any other period in the life time of an individual.Growth and Development The growth and development is accompa - nie d by a number of physiological changes which include changes in body size and body composition, changes in the gastro intestinal system, excretory system and circulatory sys- tem. Nutrition is crucial and proper dietary modifications are vital during this period. Immunization Malnutrition during infancy leads to a high- er in cidence of infant mortality. Besides malnutrition,infection causes mortality. Immunization protects the children against disease. Table 6 below presents the immuni- zation schedule for infants and children. Good nutrition is essential for the growth and development that occurs dur - ing an infant's first year of life. As an infant's mouth, tongue, and digestive tract mature, the infant shifts from being able to only suckle, swallow, and take in liquid foods, such as breast milk or infant formula, to Vegetarians use meat replacements m ade of textured vegetable protein (soy Protein) Folic acid is also called pteroylglu - t amic acid, a deficiency of which results in macrocytic anaemia.

Energy: Infants need energy from food for activity, growth, and normal development. Energy comes from foods containing car - bohydrate, protein, or fat. A general indi - cator of infant consuming an adequate kil - ocalories per day is the infant's growth rate in length, weight, and head circumference. Carbohydrate The major type of carbohydrate nor - mally consumed by young infants is lac - tose, the carbohydrate source in breast milk. Lactose-free infant formulas, such as soy-based infant formulas provide car - bohydrates in the form of sucrose. In later infancy, infants derive carbohydrates from additional sources including cereal and other grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Protein Breast milk and infant formula contains protein. The complementary foods such as meat, poultry, fish, egg yolks, cheese, yogurt, pulses, cereals and other grain products provide adequate protein. Fat Breast milk and infant formula are impor - tant sources of lipids, including essential fatty acids, during infancy. Vitamin A Breast milk and infant formula are major food sources of vitamin A. Additional sources of vitamin A or carotenes for infants consuming complementary foods include egg yolks, yellow and dark green leafy vegetables and fruits e.g., spinach, greens, sweet potatoes and liver. Vitamin E Infants receive vitamin E from breast milk and infant formula. Other vitamin E sources for older infants include green leafy vegetables, vegetable oils and their products, wheat germ, whole-grain breads, cereals and other fortified or enriched grain products, butter, liver, and egg yolks. Vitamin K Sources of vitamin K include infant formula, green leafy vegetables, pork, and liver. Vitamin C Breast milk and infant formulas are major food sources of vitamin C. Additional vitamin C sources include vegetables (e.g., tomatoes), fruits (e.g., citrus fruits, papaya, and strawberries), and regular fruit and vegetable juices which are natu - rally high or fortified with vitamin C. Vitamin B12 An infant's vitamin B12 stores at birth gen - erally supply his or her needs for approx - imately 8 months. Infants consuming appropriate amounts of breast milk from mothers with adequate B12 stores or infant formula receive adequate amounts of this vitamin. Complementary foods such as meat, egg yolks, and dairy products pro - vide this vitamin later in infancy as well. Calcium An infant can obtain sufficient calcium by consuming adequate amounts of breast milk or infant formula. Older infants can obtain additional calcium from complementary foods such as yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese (paneer), fortified or enriched grain prod - ucts, some green leafy vegetables (such as turnip and greens), and tofu. Iron Sources of iron for infants include breast milk, infant formula, meat, liver legumes, whole-grain breads, cereals, or fortified or enriched grain products, and dark Chapter6_120-155.indd 129 31-03-2018 13:24:576 Family Meal Management 130green vegetables. Heme iron is found primarily in animal tissues, including red meat, liver, poultry and fish and non - heme iron is found in breast milk, infant formula, cereals, or other grain products legumes, fruits and vegetables. Infants receive most of the iron in their diets as non heme iron. Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular food derived from soya. It is a staple ingredient in Chinese cookery and is a good source of protein, containing all eight essential amino acids. It is also an excellent source of iron and calcium and the minerals man - ganese, selenium and phosphorous. Zinc Infants obtain zinc from breast milk, infant formula, meat, poultry, liver egg yolks, cheese, yogurt, legumes, and whole- grain breads, cereals, and other fortified or enriched grain products. Sodium Healthy, full-term infants consuming pri - marily breast milk or infant formula of standard dilution receive a relatively small amount of sodium but an amount ade - quate for growth. Fiber Breast milk contains no dietary fiber, and infants generally consume no fiber in the first 6 months of life. As complementary foods are introduced to the diet, fiber intake increases. Dietary fiber is found in legumes, whole grain foods, fruits, and vegetables. Water Infants' water needs are met from consum - ing breast milk, infant formula, and com - plementary foods. Water is also formed in the body in chemical reactions occurring to metabolize protein, fats, and carbohy - drates. Under normal circumstances, the water requirements of healthy infants who are fed adequate amounts of breast milk or properly reconstituted infant formula are met by the breast milk or infant for - mula alone. 6.2.1 Breast Feeding Infants who are exclusively breast fed for the first 6 months of life grow well and breast feeding is beneficial not only during this period but also during later years of life. The infant is put on the breast within half an hour after a normal delivery. American Academy of Paediatrics(2005) firmly adheres to the position that breast - feeding ensures the best possible health as well as the best developmental and psy - chosocial outcomes for the infants Colostrum: During first two or three days colostrum is secreted in small quantities of about 10-40 ml.

It contains a B12 binding protein making it unavailable for the growth of E-coli and other bacteria. It also contains antibodies against viral infection. Advantages of breast feeding Breast feeding is the simple and best method of feeding and has the following advantages 1. Nutritional factor The composition of human milk is best suited for infants. In human milk the pro - tein content is lower but the content of car - bohydrate, namely lactose is higher. The fat content is comparatively less. The pro - tein is present as lactalbumin which is bet - ter digested than the protein in cow's milk. Lactose provides natural sweetness and also helps in absorption of calcium and iron. Fat though less is highly emulsified and therefore better digested. When compared to animal milk, breast milk provides higher amount of vitamin C. Similarly calcium in breast milk though less when compared to cow's milk is better absorbed by the infant. The composi - tion of human milk is best suited for infants. The table 8 below shows the comparison of Human milk and cow's milk. 2. Hormones and growth factors: Breast milk is a rich source of hormones like Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), thyroxin, insulin and prolactin. It also contains growth regulating factors, growth promoters and growth modulators.3. Immunological factors: The following factors in breast milk pro - vide passive immunity. a. Macrophages: They can digest bac - teria and also develop immunity against infectious diseases. b. Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes produce antiviral substances like interferon. c. Lactoferrin: It is an iron binding protein that inhibits the growth of E.coli and other bacteria. d. Enzymes: Breast milk also sup - plies enzymes like lipase, amylase and lactoperoxidase which increase digestibility and also destroy the harmful microorganisms. e. Immunoglobulin: They are defen - sive proteins which include all types of antibodies.

Economic factors Breast milk is the most economical food for the baby. Even after accounting the extra food cost required by the mother, breast milk is cheaper than any other type of artificial feed. 5. Psychological factors Breast feeding is essential for a healthy, happy and emotional relationship between the mother and the infant. 6. Natural contraceptive Breast feeding prevents the onset of another pregnancy and also prevents breast cancer. 7. Other advantages: a. Infants jaw is more fully developed. b. Breast milk is microbiologically sterile. c. Human milk is always fresh and at the right temperature. d. It is convenient to administer at any time. e. Breast fed babies have better cogni - tion and IQ later in life when com - pared to bottle fed babies. Artificialfeeding Though breast milk is the best milk and there can be no substitute for it, there are certain circumstances during which the infant needs to be given artificial feeds. Reasons 1. Illness of short duration like fever, or severe illness like tuberculosis and heart disease.2. The mother is on steroids, antico - agulants or radioactive drugs. 3. Insufficient milk secretion. 4. Death of mother. Premature Infants are born before 37 weeks of gestation6.2.1.2 Complementary Foods and Weaning Foods Milk provides all the food a baby needs for at least the first four months of life. As babies gain weight and grow older they need a more varied diet. The change over from milk to more solid food is called weaning. The idea of weaning is the process of gradual introduction to a wide range of 'non milk' foods to infants in addition to breast milk. Weaning the baby from breast or bottle feed starts by four months. Stages of Weaning Weaning is a transition from breast milk or formula milk to solid foods. It is divided into the following stages: STAGE I - Babies are usually ready to start on solid foods between 4-6 months STAGE II - 6-9 months STAGE III - 9-12 months Stage I Babies cannot chew and the first weaning foods need to be similar in consistency to milk. Cereals such as rice or wheat flours mixed with milk is a suitable first wean - ing food. Food should be the same tem - perature as their usual milk feed. Mashed, pureed, starchy vegetables made to the same consistency are also suitable foods. Solid food added to an infant's diet is called beikost Chapter6_120-155.indd 132 31-03-2018 13:24:576 Family Meal Management 133e.g.potato, carrot. Foods should be salted or sweetened. Babies should have 600ml of breast or infant formula milk daily along with the weaning foods. Stage II Babies get used to spoon feeding and will take more solid foods. They can begin to have the same foods as the rest of the fam - ily, but in mashed or pureed form. They are able to chew foods at six months, so can be given hard foods to chew. These are called finger foods. These include foods such as raw soft fruits and vegetables, raw strips of carrot, cooked green beans and soft banana. Foods with increased quantity, dif - ferent texture and stronger tastes should be encouraged. Stage III At this stage babies will probably eat solid foods in addition to 500-600ml breast milk or infant formula after nine months. Wide variety foods should be given with a range of textures, because the baby can cope up with food that is lumpier in texture. Important points to be considered while introducing supplementary foods Introduce only one food at a time. Allow the infant to become familiar with the food before trying to give another. Fruit juice should be fed only by cup not by bottle. When the baby is able to chew, gradu - ally substitute finely chopped fruit and vegetables usually at 8 to 9 months. Variety in choice of foods is important. Infants may object to eat some foods by themselves but will take them will -ingly if one is mixed with another. Egg may be mixed with formula cereal or vegetable. The child can be fed with a spoon until the baby gets used to an adult method of feeding. Give freshly prepared food. Food should be given between breast feeds. The temperature of the food should not be hot or cold. Supplementary Foods Foods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing suf - ficient nutrients are known as supplemen - tary or complementary foods. These could be liquid foods like milk or semi-solid foods in the case of gruels or porridge or solid preparations like rice, which can be given to children over the age of one year. Types of Supplementary Foods Liquid Supplements Milk: The frequency of breast feeding is reduced to 3 to 4 times a day and cow's milk is substituted in 6 months. Cow's milk is diluted with water in the proportion of 2:1 for the first feed. Sugar can be added to increase taste and calories. Juice of Fresh Fruits: Small quantities of fresh fruit juices should be given in the 3rd and 4th month of the infant. In early stages fruit juice is diluted with water and only a couple of teaspoons are fed and the amount is gradually increased. Soup from Green Leafy Vegeta - bles: Green leafy vegetables can be Chapter6_120-155.indd 133 31-03-2018 13:24:576 Family Meal Management 134 substituted as an alternative if fruits are not available. Solid Supplements Mashed Foods: Mashed food should be given around the 7th and 8th month along with the liquid supplements for the infant. Cereal and Starchy Gruels : Mashed cereals are rice, wheat and ragi which are usually eaten as porridge with the addition of vegetable oil. Vegetables: Cooked, mashed vegeta - bles like potato, green leafy vegeta - bles and carrots can be introduced to get vitamins and minerals in the diet. Fruits: Fruits should be stewed and sieved. Sugar and lime can be added for flavor. Non Vegetarian Food: Egg yolk is given as good source of protein and it is usually introduced in soft cus - tards. Egg white is not given until the infant is 10 months old, as it causes allergic manifestations. Minced, cooked meat or boiled fish with salt can be given. Case study 1 Kavitha has a 6 month year old baby. Outline an appropriate schedule for her to use as a guide for adding solid foods to her baby's diet during the first year of life. What foods are not appropriate at this age?Guess the nutreints thar are present in the foods listed below Activity 2 Chapter6_120-155.indd 134 31-03-2018 13:24:586 Family Meal Management 135between one to six years. The child becomes more active and the social and environmental influences have a great impact on their food behaviour and eat - ing pattern. The need for nutrients is increased as growth and development continues. Growth Pattern During the second year, the increase in height is about 10 cm and weight gain is 2 to 2.5 kg. After two years annual gain in height and weight is only 6 to 7 cm and 1.5 to 2 kg respectively. However, there is a wide variance in the physical develop - ment of children. As growth proceeds, changes occur in a) proportion of water, b) muscle tis - sue, c) fat deposits and d) skeletal struc - ture. The body water gradually decreases and there is addition of adipose tissue and minerals to the bones. Nutritional Needs During Preschool Energy The energy needs for the child is deter - mined by his basal metabolism and activ - ity. If the preschool child is not given proper complementary foods and supple - mentary foods, it may lead to protein and energy malnutrition. Protein Protein is a vital dietary component for pre-schoolers, as it is needed for optimal growth. Enough protein should be con - sumed every day for proper growth and development. Fat Adequate fat is required to provide the extra calories and reduce bulk in the diet. Prepare a weaning food using the fol - lowing ingredients Pulses RiceRagi Nuts GrainsMilletsJaggeryWheat Sugar Pulses: Pulses along with cereals in the form of porridge can be given. Pulses and meat preparation can be given alternatively Unmashed: When the infant starts developing teeth, it is the time to give lumpy foods, cooked cereals and pulses solids like idly, idiappam, bread, chap - pathi and semi solids like rice and dhal. Vegetables can be chopped and boiled into small pieces. As the child grows, it is better to give fruit segments instead of juice. Fruit provides bulk in the diet and is good for bowel movement.

The amount of calcium a child needs is determined in part by the consumption of other nutri - ents, such as protein, phosphorus and vitamin D, as well as the child's rate of growth. Iron requirement during childhood is needed for growth and for increase in the haemoglobin concentration. Dietary lack of iron accompanied by hookworm infestation can lead to anaemia. Zinc is essential for proper development. It is needed for wound healing, proper sense of taste, proper growth, and normal appetite. 30%-50% of aneamia in children and other age groups is caused by iron deficiency (World Health Organization 2007 ). Vitamins The incidence of Vitamin A deficiency is high. The recommended intake for B vita - mins is based on the energy intake. The dietary intake of vitamin C for pre-school - ers is the same as for adults i.e., 40 mg/dayDietary Guidelines Transition from an infant diet to a regular adult diet should be smooth and gradual. Factors that need to be considered while planning a diet for a preschool child are: The food should be interesting and attractive. For example, chapattis, poori and bread slices can be cut into interesting shapes to make eating interesting for a child. The diet should include enough quan - tity and quality of different nutrients. They should be encouraged to have milk every day. Milk can be given with delicious flavours. Plenty of fruits and vegetables are needed for proper elimination. Fruits are given raw or in the form of simple desserts.

Candies and sweets should be in mod - eration. Foods like tea and coffee should not be given as they are more stimulating to the system. Foods should be seasoned so that they taste better and the child takes it well. Fried foods and concentrated foods should not be given as they are diffi - cult to digest. The Child should never be forced to eat more than what he can take and the atmosphere should be peaceful, pleas - ant and lacking distraction. People feeding the child should not show dislike of any food in front of the child; this may lead to the rejection of the food by the child. Regularity of meals is essential. Food preferences of the child should be taken into consideration. Nutritional Problems among Pre-Schoolers Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) The primary cause of malnutrition is a faulty and inadequate diet. Besides diet and socioeconomic factors, various envi - ronmental factors aggravate the dietary deficiencies. These include chronic infec - tion, poor environmental sanitation, poor insanitary living conditions and poor per - sonal hygiene. The diseases that represent extreme forms of PEM are i. Kwashiorkor ii. Marasmus, and iii. Marasmic Kwashiorkor Vitamin-A deficiency Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin A or its precursor ( b-carotene) is exhibited as Nutritional Needs during School Age (6-12 Y ears) Bitot's spots, kertomalacia in preschool children. The school-age, six to twelve years, has been called the latent time of growth. The rate of growth slows down and body changes occur gradually. The slow rate of growth dur - ing this period result in a gradual decline in food requirement per unit of body weight. Energy Energy needs vary with growth rate, body size and physical activity. The require - ment for calories increases during school age. p Fig 2 Bitot's spot FPO p Fig 3 Keratomalacia Chapter6_120-155.indd 137 31-03-2018 13:24:586 Family Meal Management 138Protein Girls require more protein than boys because they are reaching menarche. The protein requirements are slightly higher for girls than boys between 10-12 years. Minerals Calcium requirements are more to meet the need for skeletal development. They need to take 2-3 glasses of milk. Iron requirement is further increased by rise in the haemoglobin concentration. Vitamins Vitamin-A requirements of children is 600\u00b5g. Vitamin-C requirements are 40mg. Vitamin B complex requirements increase with calorie needs. The RDA of vitamins A and C are same as adult RDA. Adiposity rebound is a phenomenon of normal growth, occurring at approxi - mately 6 years of age which is when a child's body fat increases.DO YOU KNOW?Food Requirements A natural increase in appetite is respon - sible for an increase in food consump - tion. Parents should encourage the child to eat appropriate portion sizes, eating a variety of food to meet their nutritional requirements. Importance of breakfast Children who skip breakfast do not make up for the nutrition and energy needs and tend to perform poorly in academics(NIN, 2003-2004) Eating breakfast is a healthy habit. An ideal breakfast should have all 4 basic food groups. Dietary Guidelines for School Children Nutritional requirements should meet their activity, growth and spe - cial requirements during sickness and injury. Menus should provide dishes that are quick to eat, nutritious and variety is needed.

Snacky meals should be given at inter - vals which can be easy to handle. Fruits and dry fruits can be given for snacks. 6.4 PACKED LUNCH: GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING NUTRITIOUS PACKED LUNCH FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN Packed lunch has become a necessity for school children as it is not possible to have lunch at home. Packed lunch is a lunch in a tiffin box to be eaten by the child while away from home. Points to be considered while planning packed lunches are: 1. It should meet one third of the day's nutritional requirements. 2. It should include food from all the four food groups though the number of dishes may be less. 3. Food stuffs providing good quality protein like egg, milk or milk products like paneer or curd would improve overall protein quality in combination with vegetable protein. 4. At least one serving of green leafy veg - etables should be included. 6.5 NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS DURING ADOLESCENCE Adolescents is the period between child - hood and adulthood. It is a period of rapid growth after infancy and it reaches its peak between 11th to 14th years for girls and 13th to 16th years for boys. Adolescence require more food for the following reasons: 5. One fruit or vegetable salad may be in - cluded every day. 6. Variety should be present. 7. Preferably the food packed should be different from that prepared for breakfast. 8. The dishes should be packed in the right consistency so as to avoid leakage or food becoming dry during lunch which may not be appetising to the child. 9. Following are two examples of a packed lunch. Vegetable peas pulao, onion raita, boiled egg, banana. Vegetable dhal rice, amaranth porial, soya gravy, and butter milk. Match the following: tomato Vitamin A lemon Calcium carrot Iron liver Vitamin D milk Vitamin C sunshine vitamin Lycopene 2. List out the junk foods that are liked by school going childrenFood insecurity means having limited or uncertain availability of nutritional - ly adequate and safe foods or a limited ability to acquire appropriate foods.DO YOU KNOW?

When protein intakes are consistently inadequate, reductions in linear growth, delays in sexual maturation and reduced accumulation of lean body mass may be seen. Fat and Essential Fatty Acids The human body requires dietary fat and essential fatty acids for normal growth and development. The intakes of total fat and saturated fat should not exceed RDA. Calcium Calcium needs during adolescence are greater than they are in either childhood or adulthood because of the dramatic increase in skeletal growth. Milk provides the greatest amount of calcium in the diets of adolescents.Ragi, green leafy vegeta - bles, milk and milk products are excellent sources of calcium. Iron Iron is vital for transporting oxygen in the bloodstream and for preventing anaemia. For both male and female adolescents, the need for iron increases with rapid growth and the expansion of blood volume and muscle mass. The onset of menstruation imposes additional iron needs for girls. Zinc Zinc is important in adolescence because of its role in growth and sexual matura - tion. Males who are zinc deficient expe - rience growth failure and delayed sexual development. Vitamins Vitamin A is important for normal vision and plays a vital role in reproduction, growth, and immune function. The most obvious symptom of inadequate vitamin A a. this period (teenage) is spread almost over a decade, b. it is characterized by rapid increase in height and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and wide swings in emotion, c. development of critical bone mass is essential during this period as this forms the ground for maintain - ing mineral integrity of the bone in later life, d. the pattern and proportion of var - ious body components like body water, muscle mass, bone and fat increase during the entire child - hood and adolescence to reach adult values by about 18 years. Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress than boys because of menstruation. Their nutritional needs are of particular importance as they have to prepare for motherhood. Nutritional Needs of Adolescents Good nutrition is critical during the teen - age years to ensure healthy growth and development. A healthy diet must meet the changing nutritional needs of a grow - ing teenager. Energy Calorie needs is influenced by activ - ity level, basal metabolic rate, increased requirements to support pubertal growth, development and energy expenditure. The energy requirements for boys are more than that of girls. Protein Protein needs of adolescents are influ - enced by the amount of protein required for maintenance of existing lean body Chapter6_120-155.indd 140 31-03-2018 13:24:586 Family Meal Management 141consumption is vision impairment, espe - cially night blindness. The low intake of fruits, vegetables and milk and dairy prod - ucts by adolescents contributes to their less than optimal intake of vitamin A. Vitamin E is well known for its anti - oxidant properties, which become increas - ingly important as body mass expands dur - ing adolescence. Fortified breakfast cereals and nuts are good sources of vitamin E. Vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of collagen and other connective tissues Fibre Dietary fibre is important for normal bowel function, and plays a role in the prevention of chronic diseases, such as certain cancers, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabe - tes mellitus and reduces the risk of obe - sity. Increased intake of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains increases the fibre intake. Adolescents who skip breakfast or do not routinely consume whole grain cereals are at high risk for having an inadequate con - sumption of fibre.Dietary Guidelines for Adolescents Diet in adolescents is very significant because it influences the nutritional status later in life. -Adequate well balanced nutritious food should be taken to prevent obesity or under nutrition. -An adolescent girl should take enough calcium rich foods in her diet to increase bone density and delay the onset of osteoporosis. -Should not miss breakfast. -Junk food should be avoided. -Avoid empty calorie foods such as carbonated beverages. -Iron rich foods may be included in the diet to prevent anaemia. -Calorie and protein rich foods should be taken to support the growth spurt. -Include fruits and vegetables in the diet to meet the vitamin, mineral and fibre requirement.

Physical activity regulates appetite. 6.6 NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF ADULTS When an individual reaches adulthood, body growth especially in terms of height and body status stop to a certain extent, but tissue breakdown and repair of body tissues continue even among adults. Therefore adequate amount of essential nutrients need to be provided for main - tenance of physical and mental health in adults. Energy-Kilocalories There is a gradual loss of functioning body cells and reduced physical activity so adults generally require less energy intake as they grow older. The basic fuels required to supply these energy needs are primarily carbohydrates with moderate fat.Dysphagia means difficulty in swallowingDO YOU KNOW? Competitive foods are less nutritious, such as high- fat, high-sugar snacks, soda and other sweetened beverages and these foods competes with healthier food choices for consumption. DO YOU KNOW?How to promote increased fruit and vegetable intake: -Add fruit purees and mixes into yogurt, milkshakes and pudding -Grate vegetables and add to batter and dough while making idlies, dosas and chapattis -Mix vegetable purees into soups and noodles. Reflect on your food choices as teen - ager. Do you think your meal choices were balanced and varied? What could you have done to improve your nutri - tional habits at that time?

This amount of protein provides about 13-15% of the total calorie. Carbohydrates About 50-60% of the total diet calories should come from carbohydrate foods, with the majority being mostly complex carbohydrates such as starches. Easily absorbed sugars may also be used for immediate energy. Fat It provides a back-up energy source. Sufficient fat makes food taste better, aids appetite and provides needed kcal to pre - vent excessive weight loss. Calcium and Phosphorus In adults, calcium is required for replac - ing calcium lost from body through urine, feces, sweat and bile. Of the dietary calcium only 20-30% is absorbed and this is facilitated by vitamin D. A desirable intake of phosphorus is recommended. The elemental Ca:P ratio in the diet should be maintained at 1:1. Iron The loss of iron through sweat, gastroin - testinal tract and urine is estimated to be 14 mg/kg body weight. Apart from this women have additional loss due to men - struation. Thus the iron requirements for women are more than men. Vitamins Studies have revealed that 600 mg of reti - nol daily would be sufficient to maintain a normal serum vitamin A level. The requirement for B Vitamins is based on calorie intake. Requirement of folic acid among Indians is 200\u00b5g.A daily intake of 20 mg vitamin C is sufficient to main - tain ascorbic acid status.

A well nourished foetus enters life with good physical and mental health. Physiological Changes in Pregnancy Foetal development is accompanied by many physiological, biochemical and hor - monal changes which influence the nutri - ent needs and the efficiency with which the body utilizes them. The changes include i. Increased basal metabolic rate (BMR) Due to foetal growth the BMR increases. ii. Gastro intestinal changes Gastro intestinal motility diminishes which may result in constipation. iii. Hormonal changes During pregnancy there is increased secretion of the following hormones: i) Aldosterone ii) Progesterone iii) Thyroxin iv) Parathormone. iv. Changes in body fluid The blood volume expands by 50 per - cent and this increased amount of blood is required to carry nutrients to the foe - tus and remove metabolic wastes from the foetus. v. Altered renal function Increased blood volume and increased production of waste products like creati - nine, urea and other wastes due to foetal and maternal metabolism produces a high glomerular filtration rate (GFR). vi. Weight Gain during Pregnancy Less than half of total weight gain resides in the foetus, placenta and amniotic fluid. Women with desirable body weight is 12.5 kg ranging between 11-13 kg. Malnutrition Emotional distress Poor economical statusPoor Concen trationPhysical and psychological disturbances Emotional distress and lo w ec onom y imposed on the family member s Absenteeism fr om work Chapter6_120-155.indd 144 31-03-2018 13:24:596 Family Meal Management 1456.7.1 Nutritional Needs during Pregnancy In addition to the RDA for an adult women the nutritional needs increase during pregnancy. Energy Energy requirement during pregnancy is increased because of the additional energy required for growth and activity of foetus, growth of placenta and maternal tissues, increase in maternal body size and steady rise in BMR. Protein An additional protein intake is essential for: -Growth of the foetus. -Development of placenta -Enlargement of mammary glands -Increased maternal blood volume -Formation of amniotic fluid Fat ICMR expert committee has suggested an intake of 30g of visible fat/day during pregnancy. Calcium Additional calcium is needed for the growth and development of bones as well as teeth of the foetus and also for the pro - tection of calcium resources of the mother to meet the high demand of calcium dur - ing lactation. Iron The requirement of iron increases from 21mg/day to 35mg/day during pregnancy. The increased requirement is due to i. expansion of maternal tissues including red cell mass, iron con - tent of placenta and blood loss during parturition.ii. to build the iron store in foetal liver to last for at least 4-6 months after birth. This is because the baby's first food milk is deficient in iron. Iodine Due to increase in BMR, iodine needs are also enhanced during pregnancy. Zinc Deficiency of zinc adversely affects the outcome of pregnancy. Zinc deficiency leads to foetal mortality, foetal malfor - mations and reduced intra uterine growth rate. Sodium Normal sodium intake without restric - tion is advised during pregnancy. Sodium is restricted when there is oedema or hypertension. Vitamins An additional allowance of Vitamin A is needed during pregnancy. Vitamin D is essential as it enhances maternal calcium absorption. Vitamin K is required for syn - thesis of prothrombin which is essential for normal coagulation of blood. A liberal vitamin K level in the mother's blood is helpful in preventing neonatal haemor - rhage. Vitamin C, pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 needs are increased during pregnancy. Folic acid Folic acid is essential for increased blood formation i.e. haematopoiesis and for Pica refers to the compulsion for persis - tent ingestion of unsuitable substances that have little or no nutritional value like starch, clay and chalk.DO YOU KNOW?

Problems during Pregnancy Nausea and vomiting Constipation Heart burn Oedema and leg cramps Pica Anemia Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) Gestational diabetes Lactation Adequate nutrition for the mother during lactation is also of vital importance as the infant is dependent on mother's milk for its nutrition for the first few months of life. Inadequate nutrition during lactation is reflected on both the quality and quan - tity of milk secreted. Physiology of lactation The Table 13 below gives the summary of hormonal control of lactation. Nutrient Needs during Lactation ICMR nutrient recommendations for a lactating mother are based on the com - position of breast milk and the fact that 850 ml of milk is produced daily. However, the milk secretion continues to increase in the early periods of lactation up to six months and then gradually decreases. Therefore the nutrient requirements are given for the two periods in lactation i.e. 0-6 months and 6-12 months. Energy The lactating mother requires additional energy for the production of milk. Based on the optimal output of 850 ml/day, the additional allowance is recommended during first six months of lactation. Protein Due to production of milk, protein requirement also increases. Fat The total fat in breast milk is not influ - enced by the mother's diet. The fat also provides energy density to meet the higher energy requirement during lactation. Calcium The requirement for calcium doubles dur - ing lactation. Iron Since most mothers have lactational amenorrhea, it results in saving of nearly 1mg iron per day which otherwise would Table 13 SummaryofHormonalControlofLactation S.

There is a marginal increase in the iron intake. Vitamins The additional need of vitamin A during lactation is based on the amount secreted in the mother's milk. As the calorie and protein requirements increase during lac - tation, the requirements of B vitamins also increase correspondingly. Ascorbic acid content increases during lactation. Galactogogue s Galactogogues are foods that help to pro - duce more milk. Garlic, milk and almonds are considered to increase milk pro - duction. Studies carried out on nursing mothers have revealed that extra amounts of body building foods like fish and mut - ton increase the secretion of breast milk. Lactating mothers are also given special preparations containing ajwain and fen - ugreek seeds, which supply iron, protein, calcium and B- complex vitamins. 6.8 NUTRITIONAL NEEDS AND CHALLENGES DURING OLD AGE Individuals above the age of 60 years con - stitute the elderly. Health and well- being of the elderly is given more importance and has paved way for a specific field of study called \"Geriatric Nutrition\" . Aging Aging is an irreversible biochemical change that occurs throughout an individual's life cycle and continues until death. In old age, the nutritional status is determined by the state of nutrition of an individual's cell. Conditions like dietary deficiency, Table 14 ABalancedVegetarianDietForPregnantandLactatingMotherDoingSedentary Work S.No Food group Pregnant mother Quantity (g) Lactating mother Quantity (g) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Cereals millets Pulses Milk(ml) Roots and tubers Green leafy vegetable Other vegetable Fruit Sugar Fats and oil(visible)300 60 500 100 150 100 200 20 30330 90 500 100 150 100 200 20 30 Source: Dietary Guidelines for Indians - A manual, NationalInstitute of Nutrition, ICMR, Hyderabad, India, (1999)Case study 2 Jeni is pregnant.

Chapter6_120-155.indd 147 31-03-2018 13:24:596 Family Meal Management 148improper digestion and absorption, insuf - ficient distribution of nutrients, accumula - tion of excess waste products lead to poor nourishment of cells. With increasing age, cell function - ing is slowed down and their response to hormones and synthesis of enzymes decreases. These changes are associated with a decrease in the number of function - ing cells. Since the cells are interdepend - ent, if one cell dies, others of the same or different organ lose their ability to func - tion resulting in malfunctioning of the organ. This in turn gradually affects the total body functioning leading to death. NUTRITIONAL NEEDS DURING OLD AGE Energy The calorie intake should be adjusted to maintain weight. The energy requirement decreases due to the following reasons: a. Decreased physical activity b. Reduction in lean body mass and increase in adipose tissue c. Decrease in resting metabolic rate by 15-20 percent due to changes in body composition and physical inactivity Protein The protein requirements do not change during old age. It is the same as adults i.e. 1g/kg of body weight. Carbohydrate Since the calorie requirement is reduced, the carbohydrate content should also be proportionately reduced. Due to impaired glucose tolerance and gastro - intestinal disturbances like constipation, emphasis should be on taking complex carbohydrates.Fat The fat requirements are also reduced, corresponding to the energy require - ments. The intake of saturated fats and cholesterol should be less and unsaturated fat should be used in cooking. Minerals Calcium needs increases during old age due to increasing mobilization of calcium from bones and incidence of osteoporosis. During old age 1000mg of calcium is rec - ommended per day because of the follow - ing reasons. -Limited availability of calcium from foods -To compensate age related bone loss and to improve calcium balance -To prevent fractures and tooth decay -To compensate decreased efficiency of calcium absorption Aging does not affect iron needs. Hence iron needs are same as that for adults. Mild anaemia may affect the health of old people due to inefficient circulation. Therefore iron intake should be adequate during old age. Vitamins Vitamin A requirements remain the same i.e., 600 \u00b5g of retinol. Inadequate expo - sure to sunshine may affect vitamin D lev - els. The antioxidant vitamins such as vita - min E, carotenoids and vitamin C have been identified to promote health of the elderly. Vitamin B6 requirements are also increased due to gastritis which interferes with absorption. Besides these various nutrients, water should be consumed in plenty as such or as fluids like buttermilk, fruit juice and soups. Intake of sufficient fluids reduces Chapter6_120-155.indd 148 31-03-2018 13:24:596 Family Meal Management 149the load on kidneys and relieves from con - stipation by stimulating peristalsis. Nutrition Related Problems of Elderly The elderly are at risk of poor nutrition due to economic pressure, poor dentition, aging tissues and inadequate diet, which may be compounded with the incidence of chronic disease. The commonly preva - lent nutrition related problems among the aged include: Osteoporosis Obesity Anaemia Malnutrition Constipation Diabetes Mellitus Cardiovascular disease Iron deficiency anemia is a serious public health problem throughout Central America, Like in India, Rice a staple food in Central America. It is typically pol - ished and rarely iron-fortified. 6.9 DIETARY MODIFICATION DURING OLD AGETable 15 SampleMenu Time Food Items Early morning Milk/tea/coffee Morning Idli/dosa Tomato or vegetable sambar Fruit-1 fruit salads Lunch sambhar, greens stew/dhal,fruit.

The family is a socially recognized unit of people united together by marriage, kinship or legal ties. Management in the context on the family is the natural outgrowth of human associations and interactions. Its ultimate aim is to provide for optimal development Family Resource ManagementChapter Learning Objectives of its individual members. Management of family allows us to overcome our individual limitations. Through the combination of individual efforts and resources, we achieve far more than what we could do independently. Most families are not aware of all the resources at their disposal. The quality and quantity of resources that are available to each family varies.This chapter will enable the students to: Know about resource management and its importance Understand the types of resources Gain information about values, goals, and standards Learn about the process in decision making Chapter7_156-184.indd 156 31-01-2019 15:24:357 Family Resource Management 1577.1.1 DefinitionandConcept of Family Resource Management Resources can be defined as anything we use to achieve what we want (our goals). In other words, they are the materials and human attributes which satisfy our wants. The concept of management involves planned use of resources directed towards the achievement of desired ends. This involves the weighing of values and the making of series of decisions. Home management is the vital fac - tor in every family contributing to the overall health, happiness and well- being and higher standard of living for the family members. In simpler terms, home management is defined as the mental pro - cess of utilising the available resources to achieve what you want in life. Figure - 1 indicates that manage - ment is a process involving activities, through which action is initiated and resources are used for achieving a goal . For this purpose, certain guidelines in the form of values, goals and standards can be formulated by every manager. For sure attainment of desired goals it becomes essential to plan, organise, coordinate and control all the activities, so that the resources are not wasted. Management Process: Management process consists of five steps 1) Planning 2) Organizing 3) Directing. 4) Controlling 5) Evaluating and are discussed below in detail. 1. Planning Planning is very important to the success of management process. It is basically working out ways or course of action to achieve the goals. Planning can be habitual or conscious. Planning involves thinking through the possible ways of reaching a desired goal. It also involves developing a sequence of actions within an overall organizational structure. The entire task from beginning to its completion must be viewed in whole. If the paths leading to the goals are easy to see, the choice of the best plan can be made quickly. When the path is hard to see due to some obstacle, the planner must find ways of overcoming them. As children do not have enough experience, they can get the help of an experienced adult to plan. The final act in planning is arriving at a decision. 'It is the gate that releases action' . Good planning requires the use of the powers of thinking, memory, observation, reasoning and imagination. These powers, make it easier to plan and to meet situations in everyday living. For example the following points should be borne in mind while planning a birthday party. Chapter7_156-184.indd 157 31-01-2019 15:24:357 Family Resource Management 1581. The place or the venue of the party. 2. Number of invitees 3. Menu 4. How much money are we going to spend? 5. When are we going to have the party? While planning, the following points should be considered. There should be a balance between the amount of resources available and the Types of Plan:demands or needs. The decision should be made accord - ing to individual situations. The plan should be realistic. The plan should be flexible.p Fig. 1 Management Process Repeat use plan Single-use plan Chapter7_156-184.indd 158 31-01-2019 15:24:367 Family Resource Management 159 Single-use plan is one that is developed for a specific function, event or activity with the anticipation it will not be used again. While repeat use plan is one that is developed in the anticipation, it will be modified and frequently used in similar situations, for similar demands or events or to resolve like problems. Sequencing is a phase of the planning component of management process in which all tasks necessary to achieve the goal are placed in a logical order; the standards for each task are established. Identify and record the repeat use plans you use frequently and list the sequence of activities that take place. List any two single-use plans you have developed and identify the function, situation or event for which the plan was developed.and instruction to the subordinate staff. It is, in fact, the process of supervising, guiding and motivating the employees in order to get the best out of them. By performing the directing function, the human resource manager will also be able to get the whole -hearted support and co-operation of all his subordinate staff. This help in the effective attainment of the enterprise objective. 4. Controlling Controlling is carrying out the plan. This step calls for flexibility in think - ing. At times new decisions are required which may result in changes in plan. For example: when the menus are planned for meals, if certain things are not available during shopping a fresh decision need to be made. The different phases of con - trolling are Energising: This is initiating and sustaining the action. The individuals who are involved in doing a particular task must be energized in order to get results. In spite of having a good plan, sometimes implementing the plan would become difficult. Here, the energizing function would act as a catalyst. Checking: This is a quick step by step evaluation of the progress of a plan. To go to school on time one has to get the clothes, the meals and books ready, which need checking of time at all stages. Adjusting: Adjusting is done in the plan if there is a need for fresh decisions to be taken. This should be done taking into account the problem in hand and the resources available. Getting into action, 2. Organizing Organising involves the performance of the following tasks. a. Division of work among employees (assignment of duties) b. Delegation of authority (transfer of official rights by a superior to his subordinate) c. Creation of accountability (the subordinate, to whom work has been assigned and authority has been delegated, is made answerable for the progress of work). 3. Directing Directing the human resource does not mean the process of issuing mere orders Activity 1 Chapter7_156-184.indd 159 31-01-2019 15:24:367 Family Resource Management 160keeping the resources mobile and knowledge of what is to be done are all important in this step. 5. Evaluating This is a checking up process, which may help one move forward. The efficiency of the process and the quality of the end product are to be checked. When there is clear cut objectives it becomes easier to evaluate the entire process. The success or failure of the plan must be evaluated on the basis of the set goals. In case of failure the demerits of the plan may be noted and rectified while making further plans. Evaluation can be general or more detailed. Thus management in the home is a dynamic force in day to day living and is the administrative side of family living. The steps in the management process are interdependent and interrelated for efficient, effective and dynamic use of resources which leads to the proper management of the house, whereby goals are achieved to attain maximum satisfaction. 7.2 VALUES, GOALS AND STANDARDS 7.2.1 Values Values, Goals and Standards are important factors in the management process. Values are the key to all motivating factors in human behavior. Value, as a concept is vague and subjective although it is very important to an individual. Values grow out of human desire and interest. Values differ in cultures. The family has the major responsibility for fostering values among the members. The term \"value\" signifies the meaning or definition of worth that is attached to any object, condition, principle or idea. Values provide a basis for judgement, discrimination and analysis and it is these qualities that make intelligent choices possible between alternatives. Thus, values are the fundamental forces that force or motivate human activities and endeavors. According to Gross and Crandall (1980) a value is always important to the person who holds it. It is desirable and satisfying. It has the ability to develop in self-creative way and it tends to endure. It is a concept of the desirable, explicit or implicit which governs our choice of methods, modes or goals. The following are the motivating values of human behavior-comfort, health, ambition, love, desire for knowledge, technological satisfaction, play, art, religion. 7.2.1.1 Classificationofvalues Intrinsic or Instrumental: An intrinsic value is one that is important and desirable simply for its own sake. It What is the role of management process in your daily life? The management process is a tool used to achieve your goals. Through its use you are better able to attain your desired quality of life. Through the management process you can identify the demands being placed upon the resources (skill, time and money). This knowledge is then used for effective allocation and use of re - sources and to lead a more satisfying and successful life. Chapter7_156-184.indd 160 31-01-2019 15:24:367 Family Resource Management 161is worthy of being sought for itself alone. Honesty, co-operation, creativity, beauty, discipline, respect etc. are some of the intrinsic values in management. On the other hand, instrumental values are ways of reaching intrinsic or end values, sometimes called goal values. Therefore, they form the basic values leading to another. Planning, skills, order and efficiency and technological satisfaction are examples of instrumental values. Factual and Normative Values: The other classification of values as factual or normative brings out the difference between the factual values that exist, regardless of their level of desirability and the normative values that have an ethical basis. The factual values also called descriptive, generally are based on people's preferences and desires. The normative are ethical values, which carry the idea of right or wrong. Some examples of factual values are honesty, religion, loyalty, faithfulness. What are your five highest val - ues? Describe how these values are shown in your interaction within your family sphere. 7.2.2 Goals Goals are important factors in the man - agement process. Goals are the desires that individuals or families are willing to work for. They are more definite and clear than values because they are to be accomplished. They are tangible things, objects, ends or purposes. Goal is an objective or purpose to be attained. They are specific ways of realizing the values one hold. Definition: Goal is defined as an objective, condition or something you desire to achieve or attain at any given period or time. At present, your goals are to complete your courses and obtain higher degree so as to get job in your chosen profession. As each of these goals are achieved, new goals, will emerge leading to other higher goals in your life. Goals, like values, play an important role in your life. Values give meaning to your life. Goals on the other hand, point the direction you want your path to follow. Thus, it can be said that values and goals are inter-related. Values are the vehicles and goals are the highways you use to attain your desired quality of life. 7.2.2.1 Types of Goals Goals are classified under the following heads. They are classified: I) According to the number of groups: i) Individual goals are established by an individual for himself. These are based on his own values. He puts in efforts for their achievement and receives satisfaction to himself, for example scoring 70% marks in the examination. ii) Group goals are established by the group. These are based on the some of the common values and interests of the group members, for example, achievement of 100% result of the class at the S.S.L.C. examination. Activity 2 Chapter7_156-184.indd 161 31-01-2019 15:24:367 Family Resource Management 162II) According to duration for achieve - ment of goals Throughout life each individual and each family is always seeking some objectives. According to duration for achievement, goals are classified as short-term, intermediate and long- term goals. i) Short-term goals In short term goal, the period of attainment of goal is short. Example is to successfully complete the course of study. Since the achievement is anticipated in the near future, these goals usually involve a time period of six months or less. ii) Intermediate goals Intermediate goals are nothing but the link connecting between short term and long term goals. They have definite characteristics and serve a purpose in your life time achievement. The time duration involved in intermediate goals is longer than short term goals. Achievement of these goals is measured in terms of several months or years. For example, to complete your graduation you will require few years. iii) Long term goal The duration in achieving this goal is long. Classification differs from the other two, in regard to the time period, the degree of specificity and the extent of active implementation involved in attainment. Long term goals are those you have set for yourself in the distant future. Long term goals may include one or more of the following - getting a good job in chosen profession, getting married, owning home or farm. 7.2.3 Standards Standard is a scale of measurement of values. According to Nickell and Dorsey (1970), standards are a set of measure of values stemming from our value patterns, determining the amount and kind of interest in something and the satisfaction we receive. Standards serve as a measure or criterion for measurement of objects or ways of doing things. There are standards that apply to a single situation or area such as standard of food or dress or conduct. Standards set the limits one will accept in working towards a goal. Gross and Crandall classify stand - ards as (1) conventional and (2) flexible. i) Conventional Standards: Conventional standards are those that are traditional and accepted by the community at large or by a social group within it.

This can be standard of any family. If an unexpected guest arrives and there is dust visible, the homemaker is apt to say 'I did not dust today' . ii) Flexible standards: Flexible standards can be changed to suit different situations; they give greater freedom of choice. Adjusting family standards to changing condi - tions is an example of the need to have flexibility in one's standards. Interrelationship between goals, values and standards: Using kitchen as a selected area of the house, the concept of values, goals and standards can be illustrated as follows. Values give meaning to your life. Values are a prime motivating force in all management. Values is a dominant term Goals are closely related to both values and standards in initiating management. They sten from values and are influenced by standards. Each exerts an influence on the other two. Goals are indicators of values. For example, the goal of owning one's home may be one expression of the value of security. Standards are specifications of values. They measure the degree of influence of a value. Standards set the limits one will accept in working towards a goal. p Fig. 2Inter-relationship of values, goals and standardXI & XII(P .G.) Msc.in Mgt.Ph.D in uation Bsc.

Therefore, decision making is the heart of the management. A decision can be defined as a course of action consciously chosen from the available alternatives for the purpose of desired result. So the role of decision making in management involves knowing and actually applying essential information in problem situations of day to day life. Thus it is used to achieve goals and assessing standards. Management is a mental pro - cess which involves a series of decision making. 7.3.1 Thestepsindecision making process are: 1. Defining the Problem It involves the recognition of the problem. It needs relevant information to identify and define it first. Unless the problem is clearly defined and analysed the ultimate decision would not be effective. For e.g. planning household activities, purchasing labour saving devices, selecting clothing for the family. 2. Identifying the Alternatives Decision making will be effective only when one identifies possible alternatives. The choice of best selection of alternatives requires thorough knowledge about the availability of resources and their limitations. 3. Analysing the Alternatives After identifying the alternatives, the consequences of each alternative is systematically found, considering the goals, values and standards. 4. Selecting an Alternative After analysing the problem the possible alternatives. are selected. Evaluation plays a very important role in this selection. Choosing the best from the several possible alternatives will be helpful in solving the problem. 5. Accepting the Consequences of the Decision This is the ability to assess and accept the consequences of the decision for making future decision. It is the evolutional process. The process of evaluating the alternatives is based on your goals, values and standards. This experience would indicate the final outcome of the decision making. It creates self confidence in people and gives feedback to make effective decisions in the future. Chapter7_156-184.indd 164 31-01-2019 15:24:367 Family Resource Management 165 p Fig. 3 Steps in Decision making 7.3.2 Types of Decisions There are different types of decisions namely individual decision, group decision, habitual decision, central decision, economic decision, technical decision and decision making due to experience and knowledge. Individual Decision It is the decision pertaining to an individual e.g. education. Individual decisions are more quickly made. The decision making of an individual revolves around the values, goals, standards and roles the individual assures in the relevant set of frame work. Group Decision It is made from the collective action of several individuals each of whom has distinct values, goals, standards and role perception. It is a difficult process and a slow process. Role conflicts would emerge in this situation. Habitual Decision It is the lowest level of decision. Once an individual is trained to do systematic work, he will follow that throughout his life. They are rou - tine, repetitive actions related to daily activities. Once it becomes a habitual choice, the resultant action is quick and spontaneous. Central Decision Central decision has many supporting decisions to complete the whole task e.g. purchasing a house is a central decision. This leads to look out for other supporting decisions like transportation facilities, community facilities, savings etc. Economic Decision It is based on allocation and exchange process relating to resource use. This decision needs the allocation of human and non-human resources to attain a goal. It reveals the allocation of resources among the combination of goals that will bring about the greatest degree of satisfaction. Technical Decision This decision involves a decision, which will enable the best combina - tion of resources to achieve the stated goal. Decisions must be made based on past experiences and knowledge. This helps a person to become more efficient and skilled in decision mak - ing process. 7.4 FAMILY RESOURCES Resources can be defined as anything we use to achieve what we want (our goals). In other words, they are the materials and human attributes which satisfy our wants. Chapter7_156-184.indd 165 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 1667.4.1 Types of Resources Types of Resources 2. Non-human Resources1. Human Resources a. Moneya. Knowledge b. Material goodsb. Time c. Community facilitiesc. Energy d. Abilities & Skill e. Attitude 1. Human Resources: These are the capacities and characteristics of an individual. These can be used only by the person who possesses them. They have the high potential to achieve what we want and many a times may not be cultivated or made available. Most of the time, families underestimate these resources and are unaware of them. a. Knowledge: It is important to be aware of things to be able to achieve what we want. If we want to buy a T.V . we need to know what features to look for, brands available. This will help in buying a better quality product. b. Time: It is constant for everyone, 24 hours a day. The way a person manages and uses her time is her personal choice. A student may finish all the work before going to play; another may waste his time watching television or talking on the cell phone. c. Energy: This is both mental and physical power of a person. To achieve goals, one needs to plan, organise and finally implement the plans. This would require both mental and physical energy.d. Abilities and skill: These are inher - ited and acquired. These may include skills like cooking, decorat - ing, gardening. Each individual has particular abilities with which he/ she can achieve his/her goals. These skills can also be developed by sys - tematic learning and practice. e. Attitude: These are opinions or feel - ings a person has towards a thing which may hinder or help in achiev - ing his goals. A positive attitude may help a person achieve what he wants whereas a negative attitude may hin - der her in achieving what she wants. 2. Non-human Resources: These are tools and assets that families have at their dis - posal to achieve what they want. These are available for everyone to use. A per - son works hard and earns money to be used by him and his family. He/she may buy material goods or land from this money and may build a house on this land. Community facilities like banks, post offices, parks, and library. These are tangible and are more identifiable. a. Money: It is the pivotal resource which can be exchanged to buy material things, commodities and services. It can also be used for future use and thus gives a sense of security to the family. b. Material goods: These include durable goods or perishable goods used and owned by a family in their everyday use. Land, house, furniture and vehicle are examples. These help to make life easier and more comfortable for all family members. Durable goods like land can also help families to earn or save money. If vegetables are grown Chapter7_156-184.indd 166 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 167on land, the family can save money on buying vegetables or sell these vegetables to earn money. c. Community facilities: These are those facilities which are common for all members of a community. Parks, libraries, post office, police and fire protection, banks, hospitals, transport facilities, roads, railways, electricity, water supply, markets, community centres and ration shops are examples of community facilities. All families can avail these facilities without directly paying for them but indirectly paying for them through taxes.3. All resources are inter-related. A resource cannot be used in isolation. If a homemaker has to go to the market, she will use her knowledge, skill of bargaining, time, energy, money, market and transport to achieve this goal. 4. Resources can be substituted. One can exchange one resource for another. A family uses time, skill and energy of a servant and gives her money in exchange. Similarly, material goods can be bought in exchange of money. One can exchange knowledge by paying tuition fees. 5. All resources need to be managed. Since all resources are limited, they need to be utilized properly, otherwise they may be wasted. Time and energy have to be managed by work simplification techniques, proper postures and labour saving devices. 7.5 TIME AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT Many activities are performed throughout a day. Some of the activities like eating, cooking, exercising, sleeping, bathing and entertaining are also carried out along with work related activities but all these are to be completed within the available time that is 24 hours. If energy will not be rebuilt from time to time the work would cease. The capacity needed to perform these activities is called energy. Energy is the capacity to do the work. It means that just as available time as a resource is limited, we also have limited amount of energy. So we can say that within limited time we must finish all our work with our limited energy. Develop a plan to study for your examination. Identify all of the resources you would use to complete this plan. Classify each resource as to whether it is material or human. Does this plan use more of one classification than another? Why? 7.4.2 Characteristics of Resources 1. All resources are useful and all help to achieve goals. One cannot call energy or time as a resource if it is wasted or not used. If a piece of land is lying vacant, it is not a resource, only when a family grows vegetables on it, does the land become a resource. 2. All resources are limited. There is a limit to a person's knowledge, skill, energy, material goods and money available to the family.Activity 3 Chapter7_156-184.indd 167 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 168Time and energy are the resources available to all the individuals. These two resources are very closely interlinked. Each one affects the other. Although energy available to each one is different but the time available is equal i.e. 24 hours in a day. If the work is needed to be finished properly and on time, it is needed to make best possible use of time and energy. In other words one must learn to manage time and energy properly. 7.5.1 Steps in Time-Planning 1. Listing all the activities: List activities that have to be performed on a partic - ular day. These can be eating, sleeping, going to school, school time and com - pleting homework. 2. Grouping flexible and inflexible ac - tivities: Separate the activities into two types. Those which are flexible like going to market for shopping. The timing and day for shopping can be changed as the situation demands and can be delayed to the next day. The other set of activities are those which are inflexible , like going to school, music or dance classes. The time for performing these activities is fixed and cannot be delayed or changed. 3. Estimating time required for per - forming each act ivity: In the list that is prepared in step-1, allot time required for performing each activity. Going to school may take between 7 -10 minutes or 1 hour. School time may be 5-6 hours. Fill in all other works which can be done within a short time in between all the other activities with fixed activities. 4. Balancing: Balancing is the adjustment of time for each of the activities. This is the most difficult task. After allotting time to each of the activities, you might find that the total time required by you to do all the work is more than 24 hours. This is done by the identifying the time needed for various activities in a day and allotting the time for each activity based on their priority. Classify the following activities into flexible and inflexible activities. Dusting, Mopping, Cooking food, Stitching clothes, Going to school, Washing clothes, Going for shop - ping, Preparing lunchbox for chil - dren, to attend a marriage ceremony, Ironing clothes 7.5.2 Factorsthatinfluence effective time management Make a time schedule which can be easily followed. Make a time schedule which is practical and flexible and can be changed easily in emergencies.Activity 4 Chapter7_156-184.indd 168 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 169 Work smarter not harder Think of an alternative plan of action for emergency. Allow for rest and leisure time activities. Combine activities (Dovetail) for bet - ter time utilization of time. Develop a time schedule for the coming week. Use this manage - ment tool (time schedule) for the week. Note on the time schedule for the week the use of your time resource and the factor that created the change. Record the use of energy resources for each day for one week.needed to perform different household tasks. They are mental effort, visual effort, manual effort, torsal effort and pedal effort. During the day, different types of activities are performed requiring different amount of energy. i. Heavy activities like running, jogging and mopping requires large amount of energy. ii. Moderate activities like sweeping, ironing and cooking require aver - age amount of energy. iii. Light activities like reading, watch - ing T.V . and listening to music need very little energy. 7.6 WorkSimplification Work simplification is making work easier. According to Nickell and Dorsey (1959), \"it is the conscious seeking of simplest, easiest and quickest method of doing work. \"It aims at accomplishing more work with limited amount of time and energy.7.5.3 Energy Management Energy management is a difficult task as the energy expenditure for various activ - ities depends on the individuals physical and mental health. Various efforts are Activity 5 Chapter7_156-184.indd 169 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 170Home-making involves various types of activities which are most of the time tedious, monotonous, time consuming and involves various types of skill. Most of the work if done without much skill and under pressure would lead to unhappiness or frustration. To manage the house one should know the best way of doing each household activity. To do the work easily one should know why, how, when, who and where a work should be done. Dr. Marvin Mundel (1985) has given five factors (classes of change) that influence the character of work. They are: 1. Change in hand and body motions Work can be simplified by using each part of the body properly and economically. This can be achieved by, 1. Keeping body parts in alignment 2. Using muscles effectively 3. Doing the work in rhythmic motion 4. Developing skill in work. 2. Change in equipment and work arrangement Using labor saving devices, planning work surfaces at proper height, depth and width with proper tools and adequate storage space and lighting will improve the efficiency of work. 3. Change in production sequence When there are lot of household activities to be accomplished, time and energy can be saved by simplifying the work through combining the tasks and eliminating unnecessary steps. 4. Change in finished product Simplification of work could be achieved by changing the standards or expecta - tions of the finished product. Instead of laying a dining table in a formal way, espe - cially when the mother is working outside home, she can just keep food items on the table and members in the family can help themselves. DELEGATE AUTOMATE SIMPLIFY ELIMINATE 5. Change in material This refers to the change in the raw ingre - dient to get the same final products. For example, instant Vada mix or Dosa mix can be used to prepare the same final product, at the same time requirement for pre-preparation of Vada or Dosa from raw materials can be reduced. 7.7 Money Management Among all the resources that are available to the family, the most important one is money. Money plays an important role in the life of man as an instrument through which he can satisfy his physical, material and mental needs. The income and expenditure pattern of the family decides the family's standard of living and its place in the society. Chapter7_156-184.indd 170 31-01-2019 15:24:377 Family Resource Management 171 7.7.1 Concept of Income Income is the inflow of money, goods and services. Family income is one of the concept of income. It is defined as money or purchasing power earned by family members during a specific period of time and goods and services received or created in that time by the family eg. goods like vegetables from kitchen garden, services like doing household chores, teaching children etc. Family income can be classified as: 1. Money income 2. Real income 3. Psychic income 1. Money income Money income is the cash available to a family from any source, over a period of time. The period can be daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. It is obtained in the form of a currency, bank draft or cheques. p Fig. 4Types of family income Chapter7_156-184.indd 171 31-01-2019 15:24:387 Family Resource Management 172Money income is tangible and is used for purchasing goods and services for the family. The sources of money income are given below.7.7.2 Factors Affecting Income of a Family Several factors affect income generation such as: a. Skills and talents: If a person has tailoring skills, they can start a bou - tique, while a knowledgeable home - maker can conduct bakery classes and generate income. b. Time and energy: A person with time and adequate energy would be able to supplement his income by doing additional work. c. Interest in job: A higher interest in the job increases efficiency which in turn helps in career advancement through promotions and results in a higher salary. d. Location of home: Living in a remote area may lead to lesser job opportunities as compared to Cos - mopolitan cities where there are more job opportunities. e. Investments/assets: The more a person invests, the more interest can be earned. Other assets like property/ land also help in generat - ing income through rent. 7.8 EXPENDITURE AND BUDGET MANAGEMENT Happiness of the family is secured by income use or expenditure. The outflow of money is called expenditure. After earning money, a family spends it on their various needs, basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter. After their needs are fulfilled, the family desires to have comforts and luxuries, which makes the family members more comfortable. All these expenses are referred Sources of money income Salary Rent Bonus Profits Wages Cash gifts Dividends from shares Interest from banks Pension Investments Lotteries 2. Real income Real income is the stream of goods and services available to a family over a period of time. Real income is derived from properties and possessions owned by a family, skills, efforts and abilities of the family members and also from community facilities. These goods and services may be available to a family either directly through direct contribution of family members or by community facilities or indirectly when some medium of exchange, usually money is involved. 3. Psychic income: It is the flow of satisfaction that arises out of everyday experiences, derived largely from use of money and real income. It is intangible, subjective and is the most important income in terms of quality of living. Psychic income depends on the skills of family members in utilizing their money and commodities judiciously. Satisfaction derived out of flowers obtained from the plants at home is an example for psychic income. Chapter7_156-184.indd 172 31-01-2019 15:24:387 Family Resource Management 173to as expenditure. Expenditure provides the satisfaction of life for the members of the family. 7.8.1 Factors Affecting ExpenditureofaFamily 1. Income: In low-income groups, a major portion of income is spent on food whereas in high income groups only %50 of their money is spent on food. 2. Family size: Expenses on food, clothing, and education is more in larger families as compared to small sized families. 3. Family composition: In the expanding stage of the family more money is spent on education and clothes while in the contracting stage, more expenses are incurred on medicines. 4. Family status: Influenced by the social circles they move in, a considerable amount of cash may be spent by some families on, maintaining a number of cars, designer clothes, entertainment, luxury items. 5. Type of family: In a joint family, money is saved on rent and childcare. 6. Family values: Some people give more value to education and prefer spending more on books. Those giving more importance to religion spend more on religious activities. 7. Location: There is less expense in small towns as compared to that in cities. If the school or office is nearby, less money is spent on transport. 8. Skill, knowledge and an interest to save: A homemaker with her knowledge, skill and interest in culinary arts can prepare exotic dishes at home and thus reduce her expenditure. 9. Access to community facilities: Community facilities help save expenses. A person using a library need not spend money on buying books. 7.8.2 Budgeting The common planning device for the use of money is the budget. It is a carefully prepared spending plan based on the actual family income. It is a plan based on previous experience, present needs and future expectations. A budget is always prepared for a fixed period of time generally for a month. Budget is a guide to realistic spending aimed at avoiding over expenditure. 7.8.2.1 Importance of budgeting Budget acts as an intelligent guide to spending. It enables a family to have an overall view of their income. Budgeting facilitates adjusting irregu - lar income to regular expenditure. Budgeting helps people to discuss their needs and set their own priorities on them. It helps one to cut unnecessary expenditure. It helps one to be free from debts. It helps one to live within one's income. It encourages conscious decision mak - ing which may help in including long term goals in the budget. It relieves the family members from worries of future. It forces one to decide what one wants most out of life. It provides for future saving. Its success depends upon its being simple, realistic, flexible and suited to the family or individual for whom it is made.

There are various ave - nues of investment. They are: 1. Savings Account An individual can open this account either singly or jointly. The minimum balance amount required in an account with nationalized banks is `500/- and `1000/-* with cheque book facility. This amount may vary in private banks. The deposit can be made as and when the investor desires. Withdrawals are done with the help of cheques or withdrawal slips. A passbook is also provided for the record of deposits (credits) and withdrawals (debits). Advantages of paying through cheques: Cheques are considered safe method because 1) Cheques are deposited directly into the payee's account. 2) Currency is not handled directly by either the payer or the payee. 3) Cheques are an unquestionable proof of having paid or received a payment.computerization and networking of some of the banks, their services have become faster and customers can operate their account from any of its branches.

This is simple account involving a minimum deposit of ` 50/- A cheque book facility is available; subject to a minimum balance of `500/-* in the account. Maximum amount allowed in a single account is 1 lakh * and 2 lakh in a joint account. However, there is no limit for group/ institutional account. The rate of interest is 4 %* per annum.2. Current Account This account is suitable for business persons who would like to keep their money in safe custody and withdraw or make payments as and when required. There is no limit to the number of withdrawals. A person can withdraw his money any number of times. No interest is paid in this account. The bank charges for the services of keeping the money safe and offering it whenever required. 3. Fixed Deposit Account A certain amount of money is deposited in the bank for a fixed period. The interest rate varies with the period of investment. The interest rate is higher than that of the ordinary savings account. After the stipulated period, the principal amount and the total interest is paid to the investor. An investment up to 1 lakh for 5 years qualifies for tax rebate. 4. Recurring Deposit This is an ideal form of savings for those having salaried income with a view to inculcate a regular saving habit. A fixed amount of money (core money) is deposited every month (only once, between 1st -10th). At the end of the term the amount is paid. 7.9.1.2 PostOffice Post offices are situated in every locality and are found even in remote areas. There are various post office schemes, each hav - ing its distinct advantages.Activity 7 Chapter7_156-184.indd 177 31-01-2019 15:24:397 Family Resource Management 1782.

Life Insurance Corporation is provided by government of India. It is a means of providing against loss caused by natural or man-made fac - tors. It is the most popular method of securing the future.LIC has a variety of schemes to choose from. These schemes cater to all categories of people and to their diverse needs. Some of the popular schemes are given below: 7.9.1.5 Shares Shares are a fractional part of the capital of a company. When a company wants to 1.

SUMMARY Management is a process involving activities, through which action is initiated and resources are used for achieving a goal. Planning, organizing, controlling and evaluating are essential for effective management. Values, Goals and standards are important factors in the management process. Values are the key to all motivating factors in human behaviour. Goals are the desires that individuals or families are willing to work for. Standards are a set of measure of values stemming from our value patterns, determining the amount and kind of interest in something and the satisfaction we receive. Management occurs when there is some problem to solve, some choices to make. A decision can be defined as a course of action consciously chosen from the available alternatives for the purpose of desired result. Effective management involves careful use of resource. Resources can be defined as anything we use to achieve what we want (our goals). In other words, they are the materials and human attributes which satisfy our wants. They include human resources such as a. Knowledge b. Time c. Energy d. Abilities and skill e. Attitude and Non Human resources such as a. Money b. Material Goods c. Community facilities.

Teaching is communicating and good teachers are always good communi - cators. It is also equally true for the learners. He who learns well is the one who partic - ipates well in the communication process. Good learners are always good receivers and responders. Communication, is a tool for teaching and learning, it is a two-way process. For proper interaction, teachers and students are required to acquire the art and technique of good communication. Literarily the word \"communica - tion\" means \"to connect\" , to share or exchange. Meaning of Communication The term communication is derived from the Latin word \" com - munis \" which means to make com - m o n\". Communication , therefore is the exchange of thoughts, mes - sages, information, etc, by way of speech, signals or writing.What is communication? Communication plays a key role in all aspects of life. Communications means: Contact (information exchange) between people, the exchange of thoughts, ideas and meanings. It is important to send signals (words, gestures) which can be understood by the sender and recipient. 8.1 DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATION According to W .H Norman and Summer \"Communication is an exchange of facts, ideas, opinions or emotions by two or more persons\" . According to Edger Dale \"Communication is defined as the sharing of ideas and feel - ing in a mood of mutuality\" .Why we communicate? We communicate to: Share our ideas and opinions Provide feedback to others Get information from others Gain power and influence Develop social Relationships Maintain self-expression and our culture According to Theo Haiman defined, \"Communication is the process of passing information and understanding from one person to another. \" 8.1.1 Functions of Communication Communication as a human activity always serves a function. Chapter8_185-205.indd 186 31-01-2019 15:36:218 Communication 187 Information The collection, storage, processing and dissemination of news, data, pictures, facts and messages, opinions and com - ments required to understand and react knowledgeably to personal, environ - mental, national and international con - ditions, as well as to to take appropriate decisions.

Fi - nally ask the last person to say loud - ly the message he/she received from the previous person. Now ask the first person to read the message from paper and see how it is changed and conveyed.8.1.2 Importance of communications Understanding Streng thening Relati onship s Reli eving Stress Increasing Condenc e Happiness 8.2 PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNICATION The principle of clarity: A message should be clear free from distortion and noise. A vague message is not only a bar - rier to creating effective communication but also causes the delay in the commu - nication process and this is one of the most important principles of effective communication. Principles of Brevity: Communication should be brief i.e. just necessary and sufficient. Repetition and over-expla - nation are likely to destroy the actual meaning and importance of the message. Moreover, the reader may feel disturbed by receiving a long message. The principle of simplicity: Message should be given using simple and famil - iar words. Vague and technical words should be avoided. Simple words are easy to understand and help the receiver to respond quickly. The principle of Timeliness: Communication is a means to serve a spe - cific purpose. If communication is made in time, communication becomes effec - tive. If it is made untimely then it may become useless. The principle of Compass: The com - munication net should cover the whole organization. The concerned people must know \"What exactly they need and \"when they need it. And an effective communi - cation will serve such. The principle of Integrity: Com- munication should consider the level of people, principles & objectives of an organization to create a network or chain. Such network will provide a better field of internal and external communication. 8.2.1 Process of communication Sender/Encoder Sender is a person who sends message, in classroom oral communication, the encoder is teacher, and in written com - munication writer is the encoder. Teacher uses combination of words, gestures, sym - bols, graphs and pictures. Activity 1 Chapter8_185-205.indd 188 31-01-2019 15:36:218 Communication 189Message or signal The information shared between sender and receiver. For good communication, the cen - tral idea of the message must be clear. Thus, the teacher must decide what to communi - cate keeping in mind the context and how the receiver (students) will interpret the message. Medium/Channel The sensory route through which encoder will communicate his message to the decoder. The medium can be print, elec - tronic, or sound. The choice of medium may be dependent on contextual factors, relationship between the sender. Receiver /Decoder The person to whom the message is being sent. Receiver (student) may be a listener or a reader depending on the choice of medium by sender (teacher) to transmit the instructional contents. Feedback The response or reaction of the receiver to a message. Communication is effective only when it receives some feedback as it completes the loop of communication. 8.3 METHODS OF COMMUNICATION 1. Verbal Communication Verbal communication is one way for people to communicate face-to-face. Some of the key components of ver - bal communication are sound, words, speaking and language. 2. Written communication Written communication means commu - nication by means of written symbols.Source Encoding Decoding Receiver FeedbackChannel Write any five phrases or statements you use daily.

Electronic communication Electronic communication can be re- ferred to as any communication that re- quires the use of technology. For exam- ple: Video conference, Electronic mail (E-Mail), Voice mail, Facsimile (Fax), Cellular phone and Paging system. 4. Visual communication Visual communication is a process of sending & receiving messages. Com- munication of ideas through visual images. 5. Body Language Th e process of communication through sending and receiving wordless messages is known as Non verbal communication. Such messages can be communicated through gesture, body language or pos- ture, facial expression and eye contact.8.3.1 Teaching Learning Methods Lecture Method: 1. It is one of the oldest methods of teaching 2. It refers to the teaching procedure involved in the clarification or explanation to the students of some major ideas. It places more emphasis on the presentation of the content. 3. In this method teacher is more active and the students are passive. In this method question answer procedure is used to keep the students attentive in the class. 4. This method is used to clarify matter, to expand content and motivate the students.Written Communication Electronic Communication Verbal Communication Body Language Visual Communication Chapter8_185-205.indd 190 31-01-2019 15:36:228 Communication 191Drill and practice method It promotes the acquisition of knowledge or skill through repetitive practice. \"It re - fers to small tasks such as the memoriza - tion of spelling or vocabulary words, or the practicing of arithmetic facts and may also be found in more sophisticated learn - ing tasks or physical education games and sports. Rote Learning Rote learning is a learning technique which focuses on memorization. The major practice involved in rote learn - ing is learning by repetition by which students commit information to mem - ory in a highly structured way. Discovery Methods A method in which thoughts are synthe - sized to perceive something that the indi - vidual has not known before. The learner get directly involved in learning. Learning is a result of the learners own insight, reflection, and experience. 8.4 BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION Noise represents any internal or external interference in the communication pro - cess. It can be caused by 1. Physical Noise - is the outside inter - ference that blocks the communica - tor / receiver from receiving the mes - sage. This noise can be from any loud speaker, music system, fan in the room, running water etc., 2. Physiological noise - any impairment like deafness, tooth removed, headache or pain in the body which can cause a block in effective communication. 3. Semantic problem - this problem arises from the choice of words used to convey a message. 4. Syntactical problem - caused by how a sentence is structured. 5. Psychological problem - when peo - ple are nervous, or reluctant to speak or preoccupied with other problems, then this causes a barrier to commu - nication. 6. Social noise - when preconceived ideas are strong and if an individual is influenced by the unchangeable soci - etal input, then these will cause prob - lem to communication. Select any two different group set - tings such as a meeting and a social activity. What was your role in each one? Describe the extent of your par - ticipation in each Can you recall any communica - tion barriers?Activity 3 Chapter8_185-205.indd 191 31-01-2019 15:36:228 Communication 192 8.5 COMMUNICATION SKILLShave different kinds of students in his class.

Definition of teaching aid are the aids used by the facilitator to help him/her in facilitating his/her lesson effectively. 8.6.1 Characterstics of Good Teaching aids They should be meaningful and pur - poseful They should be accurate in every aspect They should be simpleA teaching aid is a tool used by teach - ers, facilitators or tutors to help learners Activity 4 Chapter8_185-205.indd 194 31-01-2019 15:36:238 Communication 195 They should be cheap They should be improvised as for as possible They should be large enough to be properly seen by the students for whom they are meant They should be up-to-date They should be easily portable They should be according to the men - tal level of the students. They should motivate they learners8.6.2 Classificationof Teaching aids On the basis of characteristic of the material used in the process of teaching aid classifications as mentioned below: Audio-aids: Audio-aids help in developing the listening skill of a learner. Audio-aids are those aids which can be only listened. Examples, of such types of aids include, radio, gramophone, tape recorder, audio- tapes, walkman and headphones etc., Visual-aids: Aids which require the involvement of learners visual senses are called visual aids. Examples, of such types of aids include viz. graphic aids, 3d-aids, display boards and print material etc., Audio-Visual aids: In these aids both the listening (ears) and viewing faculties (eyes) are involved. Such aids include tel - evision programmes, video films, motion pictures, synchronized audio slide pro - jectors, computers and computer-assisted instructions etc., Projected: Projected refer to those aids where a bright light is passed through a transparent picture by means of a lens and an enlarged picture is thrown or projected on the screen or the white wall. Eg: film - strip projector, slide projector, overhead projector, TV/VCR etc., Non-Projected: Non-Projected aids refer to those aids which do not require projector elec - tricity or projection screen. Such materials can be simply shown, can be hanged or touched. Eg: Chalkboard, Whiteboard, Flannel board, Magnet board, Charts and Wall-Charts, Posters and Pictorial Materials, Models etc., Dr.Edgar Dale has classified and arranged audio-visual aids in a procto - rial form called \"Cone of Experience\"Uses of Teaching Aids: To help children improve reading and comprehension skills Illustrate or reinforce a skill, fact, or idea Relieve anxiety, fears or bore - dom, since many teaching aids are like games. To stimulate interest, display can call attention to products or practices. To encourage student's partici - pation - displays may be studied and discussed by students as a part of class activity To help children to communicate ideas visually Importance of Teaching aids Motivation Clarification Increase the vocabulary Save time Avoid dullness Direct experience Chapter8_185-205.indd 195 31-01-2019 15:36:238 Communication 196iii. Verbal and Symbolic Experiences: Such experiences are those which the pupils gain through word-oral or written. This type of experiences are very abstract and occur at con - ceptual level. E.g. verbal illustra - tions. This type of experience can not be properly followed at the initial stages of child-learning so at initial stage more emphasis be laid on direct and representative experiences. The above cone represents the material used for audio-visual instructions. The theory of audio-visual instruc - tion needs that education must make learning permanent and experiences usa - ble. The advocacy for the use of new mate - rial for improving instructions is based on the fact that the verbalistic learning is out The primary source of contact between the individual and external world and any intellectual activity depends on expe - riences coming through senses. Even mental activities such as concentration, reflection, conception, imagination, asso - ciation, recollection etc., have their basis in sensory experiences. Mind like stom - ach, works on what it is fed. This feeding comes through senses. The raw material for mental activity is provide by i. Direct Experiences: Such expe - riences are gained by the pupils through excursions and trips etc., ii. Representative Experiences: This type of experiences are less con - crete but are quite useful.

It helps to sustain the attention in one's efforts or task Restlessness to achieve the goal stops after the goal is reached A continuous flow in shape of a cycle named motivational cycle is explained in figure 3. Need A need is lack or deficit of some necessity. It's a state of physical deprivation that Activity 2 Chapter9_206-233.indd 211 31-01-2019 15:37:149 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 212Motivation Cycl e Need Goal Drive Incentive pFig.3Motivationalcycle causes tension. The tension caused when the person is deprived of basic necessities of life as food, water, and sleep, causes imbalance . For any goal directed behaviour, need is the first condition or stimulating factor. Drive Need leads to drive, which is the second step towards achieving goal. Drive can be defined as the state of tension or arousal produced by need. It is the state of heightened tension leading to restless activity and preparatory behaviour. For instance, when person is hungry and/or thirsty, he seeks to reduce this drive by eating and/or drinking.Incentive Environment that activates, directs, and maintains behaviour is called incentive. It can be anything as long as it has either positive or negative value in motivating behaviour. For example: behaviour like eating food is an incentive that reduces the drive of the person caused by the need to fulfill his hunger. The reduction of behav - iour then cuts off and restores balance in an organism. Goal The reduction of tension in the body can be considered as the goal of any motivated behaviour. Let's go back to the example of a hungry man. A hungry man eats food, and his body restores to a balanced condition. This then reduces the tension. This reduction of tension as a result of an energized activity is called goal. Once the goal has been completed, the organism is again ready for another goal-motivated behaviour. 9.4.4.1 Principles of Motivation Maslow's Theory of MotivationSatisfaction ActionsNeeds Wants Tensions pMaslow Maslow describes how motivation develops stage by stage from purely physiological drives to complex social purpose, as described in the figure presented below: Chapter9_206-233.indd 212 31-01-2019 15:37:159 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 2131. Physiological needs: The basic physiological desires are food, water, shelter, etc., They are the most basic and fundamental human needs. 2. Safety Needs: It arises on account of future expectations. For example, insurance against future, keeping a bank balance, investing in LIC. 3. Love and Belongingness Needs: Need for affection, praise, warmth, acceptance, approval, affiliation. 4. Self-Esteem Needs: Need for achievement, status, self-respect, self- confidence, feelings of strength and adequacy. 5. Achievement Needs: Needs for understanding implies knowledge of relationships, process, the integration of knowledge into broad structure etc. thus achievement needs are related to intellectual domination and cognitive competencies. 6.

She studies till 1 a.m. in the night. Unable to concentrate any more, she sets the alarm for 6 a.m. and tries to go off to sleep. As she is very tense, she keeps tossing and turning in bed. Images flash through her mind of not being able to secure the marks. She blames herself for fooling around with her friends and not prepar ing thoroughly for the examination. In the morning she wakes up with a heavy head, misses breakfast, and barely makes it in time to school for her examination. She opens the question paper, her heart pounding, hands clammy with sweat and then she feels her mind has gone completely blank. Some of you may have lived through an experience such as Sumithra's. The challenge posed by examinations is common to all students. Some of us succeed while others succumb to life stresses. Life poses challenges all the time. 1. Suggest 3 ways to cope with that situation? 2. what do you infer from this case study? \"The only way to solve a problem is to change the thinking that created it. \" Albert Einstein (1879-1955) 9.6 PROBLEM SOLVING 9.6.1 Definition Problem Solving is the term used for thinking or thought processes that is specifically aimed at finding Solutions to specific problems. This process continues on spectrum from conceiving an idea \"Generally people try the different strategies of solving a problem through trial and error method\" through accomplishing goal by means a set of mental operations. 9.6.2 Factors affecting problem solving Poor Intelligence Absence of sufficient concepts Wrong thought habits Limited vocabulary Prejudices Lack of awareness Chapter9_206-233.indd 216 31-01-2019 15:37:169 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 2179.6.3 Steps in Problem Solving The steps in problem solving are as follows Awareness of the problem -An individual has to be aware of the problem. If he senses that there is a problem he will know the way to solve it. 2. Collection of data - Collection of data plays an important part in solving the problems. Data regarding the problem is collected. 3. Formulation of hypothesis - Hypothesis means \"idea or suggestion put forward as a starting point for reasoning or explanation\" . Hence a hypothesis may be right or wrong, accepted or rejected after its validity is verified completely.1. Recognition of the problem - The individual has to understand the problem by comparing his past experiences faced with present situation. Example: What will happen to a boy who is absent continuously?Example: One may ask why the monitor alone was attacked by malarial fever. The boys try to formulate tentative guesses to the question. Perhaps the monitor visited someone who had malarial fever. Perhaps monitor slept without mosquito net at night, or water stagnation near his house. when monitor comes back to school after recovery from malarial fever he says that there is a big pond near his house where water stagnates and breeds mosquitoes. He also tells them that one night he did not use mosquito net because it was a very hot night. i) One should not sleep without a mosquito net at night in swampy areas. ii) One should maintain good habits so that he/she may not be attacked by a disease.Example: One of the boy who lives nearby is spotted and asked to go to the monitor house. He finds out that his monitor is suffering from malarial fever.Example: All the students want to know what has happened to their favourite monitor4. Evaluation or testing of hypothesis : Hypothesis formulated is tested. 5. Making of Generalisation -Finding a general principle to a particular situation is called generalization. Five \"I\"- approaches to Daily Problem Solving 1. Intention - State the goal of the problem to be solved Chapter9_206-233.indd 217 31-01-2019 15:37:169 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 2182. Interest - What is the problem? where do you see the problem in the process 3. Investigate - What is the root cause? 4. Intervene - Limit the effect of the problem 5. Implement - Permanently prevent the problem from reoccurring. 9.6.4 Tips to increase our Problem Solving Skills Dance Workout our brain with logic puzzles Get good night sleep Work out to some tunes Participate in yoga Problem: Write who, what, why and how the problem occurred ________ _____________________________ _____________________________ _____________________________ _____________ _______________________________ _______________________________ Write two better ways to solve the problem: 1. _____________________________ _______________________________ 2. _____________________________ _______________________________ How could I have prevented the problem ______________________________ _______________________________ In the future I will _______________ _______________________________ _______________________________ 9.7 DECISION MAKING 9.7.1 Definition According to James Stoner \"Decision making is the process of identifying and selecting a course of action to solve a specific problem. (Mathew, 2011) 9.7.2 Decision Making Process Making a good decision requires patience and careful thought. The following steps serve as important guidelines for taking good decisions 9.7.3 Factors affecting decision making The following factors influence the decision making process. Perception - people selectively interpret what they see on the basis of their interest, background, experience, and attitudes. Hence, people's decision will be impaired by wrong perception. Priority - Prioritizing the personal goals, the place of family, work, career in our Activity 4 Chapter9_206-233.indd 218 31-01-2019 15:37:169 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 219 Step 1 - Define the problem. Th e first step towards a decision- making procedure is to define the problem. There would be no need to make a decision without having a problem. So, the first thing one has to do is to state the underlying problem that has to be solved. Step 2 - Develop alternatives. The situation of making decision arises because there are many alternatives available for it. Hence, the next step after defining the main problem would be to state out the alternatives available for that particular situation. Step 3 - E valuate the alternatives. The most important stage of the decision-making procedure is to analyze each alternatives. The advantages and disadvantages of each option has to be critically assed. Rating each option with a numerical digit would also help in the filtration process. Step 5 - I mplement the solution. The next obvious step after choosing an option would be implementing the solution.This is a very crucial step because all the people involved in implementation of a solution should know about their implications. This is very essential for the decision to give successful results. Step 6 - M onitor the solution. Just making a decision and implementing it, is not the end of the decision-making procedure. It is crucial to monitor your decision regularly once they are implemented. At this stage, you have to keep a close eye on the progress made by implementing the solutions.Step 4 - C hoose and finalize the alternative. The evaluation process would help in clearly looking at the available options and deciding the most suitable alternative pFig.5Stepsindecisionmakingprocess Chapter9_206-233.indd 219 31-01-2019 15:37:179 Personality Development & Life Coping Skills 220priority list is of most importance while making good decisions. Acceptability - Those who implement the decision must accept it both intellectually and emotionally. Resources - Available resources helps to make decisions fastly. Judgment - Practical strategies helps in improving decision making process. 9.7.4 Qualities of Good decision makers Evaluate circumstances, consider alternatives. Use critical thinking skills.
