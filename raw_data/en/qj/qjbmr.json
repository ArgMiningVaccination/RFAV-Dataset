A B S T R A C T Background Following surgery, incisions are usually closed by xing the e dges together with sutures (stitches), staples, adhesives (glu e) or clips. This process helps the cut edges heal together and is called 'healing by primary intention'. However, a minority of surgical wound s are not closed in this way. Where the risk of infection is high or there ha s been signicant loss of tissue, wounds may be left open to hea l by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure; this i s known as 'healing by secondary intention'. There is a risk of infection in open wounds, which may impact on wound healing, and antisept ic or antibiotic treatments may be used with the aim of preven ting or treating such infections. This review is one of a suite of Coch rane reviews investigating the evidence on antiseptics and an tibiotics in different types of wounds. It aims to present current evide nce related to the use of antiseptics and antibiotics for surgica l wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI). Objectives T o assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and t opical antiseptics for the treatment of surgical wounds healin g by secondary intention. Search methods In November 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised R egister; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ); Ovid MEDLINE; (In-Process Cit ations); Ovid EM- BASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials re gistries and the references of included studies and relevant s ys- tematic reviews. There were no restrictions with respect to la nguage, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with a sur gical wound healing by secondary intention and assessed treat ment with an antiseptic or antibiotic treatment. Studies enrolling p eople with skin graft donor sites were not included, neither w ere studies of wounds with a non-surgical origin which had subsequently under gone sharp or surgical debridement or other surgical treatmen ts or wounds within the oral or aural cavities. 1 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently performed study selection , risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included i n the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies we re small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors redu ced the quality of the evidence. T wo comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects f or these treatments. The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a dif ference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with f oul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelih ood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compa red to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three we ek period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quali ty. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfa te group. There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds followi ng haemorrhoidectomy when treated with T riclosan post-operat ively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean di fference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds res ulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when tre ated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over th ree weeks' follow-up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group. Evidence was taken from one small stud y that only had 43 participants. There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacym\u00ae-treat ed post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes healed compared to those treated with iodine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0. 93). Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participa nts. Authors' conclusions There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of an y antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluat ed to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small particip ant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence. Th is means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect, and m ay change this estimate. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention What are surgical wounds healing by secondary intention? These are surgical wounds which are left open to heal through th e growth of new tissue, rather than being closed in the usual wa y with stitches or other methods which bring the wound edges toge ther. This is usually done when there is a high risk of infectio n or a large amount of tissue has been lost from the wound. Wounds wh ich are often treated in this way include chronic wounds in the cle ft between the buttocks (pilonidal sinuses) and some types of abs cesses. Why use antibiotics and antiseptics to treat surgical wounds healing by secondary intention? One reason for allowing a wound to heal by secondary intention after surgery is that the risk of infection in that wound is tho ught to be high. If a wound has already become infected, then antibio tics or antiseptics are used to kill or slow the growth of the micr o- organisms causing the infection and prevent it from getting wo rse or spreading. This may also help the wound to heal. Even wh ere wounds are not clearly infected, they usually have population s of micro-organisms present. It is thought that they may heal b etter if these populations are reduced by antibacterial agents. Howev er, the relationship between infection and micro-organism pop ulations in wounds and wound healing is not very clear. 2 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.What we found In November 2015 we searched for as many studies as possible th at both had a randomised controlled design and looked at the us e of an antibiotic or antiseptic in participants with surgical wou nds healing by secondary intention. We found 11 studies which i ncluded a total of 886 participants.These all looked at different comp arisons. Several different types of wounds were included. St udies looked at wounds after diabetic foot amputation, pilonidal sinus s urgery, treatment of various types of abscess, surgery for ha emorrhoids, complications after caesarean section and healing of openings cr eated by operations such as colostomy. Most studies compared a range of different types of antibacter ial treatments to treatments without antibacterial activity , but four compared different antibacterial treatments. Although some of the trials suggested that one treatment may be better than another, this evidence was limited by the size of the studies and the ways the y were carried out and reported. All of the studies had low numb ers of participants and in some cases these numbers were very small. M any of the studies did not report important information abou t how they were carried out, so it was difcult to tell whether the res ults presented were likely to be true. More, better quality, research is needed to nd out the effects of antimicrobial treatments on su rgical wounds which are healing by secondary intention. Assessed as up to date November 2015. B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Following surgery, incisions are usually closed by xing the e dges together with sutures (stitches), staples, adhesive glue or cli ps. This process helps the cut edges heal together and is called 'healing by primary intention'. However, a minority of surgical wounds are not closed in this wa y. Where the risk of infection is high or there has been signicant l oss of tissue, wounds may be left open to heal by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure; this is known as 'heali ng by secondary intention'. This practice is commonly used following excision of pilonidal sinuses (chronic wounds which arise from hair follicles in the buttock cleft) or perianal or breast absces ses (although a Cochrane review did not nd a clear benet of open healing in pilonidal sinuses ( AL-Khamis 2010 )). Wounds may also convert from healing by primary intention to healing by secondary intention when wound closure fails and de - hiscence (full or partial separation of wound edges) occurs and cannot be rectied. A recent review using elements of systemati c review methodology identied key risk factors for dehiscence a s including obesity and wound infection, particularly in abdomi - nal surgeries; however the methodology and quality of the f teen included studies were highly variable and the review process w as not well reported ( Sandy-Hodgetts 2013 ). Dehisced wounds may be allowed to heal fully through secondary intention, or close d surgically after partial healing (delayed healing by primary inten- tion). Delayed healing by primary intention may also be a plan ned approach.Standard care for surgical wounds healing by secondary intenti on includes use of a range of dressings. The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cur- rently recommends that the following not be used for SWHSI: Ed- inburgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL) and gauze; moist cotton gauze; and mercuric antiseptic solutions, as small ran - domised studies suggest that these treatments are inferior to avail- able alternatives. The use of 'an appropriate interactive dr essing' and consultation with a professional with expertise in tissu e via- bility are recommended ( NICE 2008 ). Other treatments which may be given include negative pressure wound therapy (the use o f a vacuum pump to reduce the pressure around the wound), de- bridement (the removal of foreign material and dead or damage d tissue), and skin grafting. Prevalence The data on the incidence and prevalence of SWHSI (both planned SWHSI and those that occur following breakdown of a previously closed wound) are limited. T wo published audits f rom cities in the north of England estimated that SWHSI comprise ap- proximately 28% of all acute wounds receiving care provi- sion ( Srinivasaiah 2007 ;Vowden 2009 ). A more recent UK study which evaluated the prevalence of SWHSI over a two-week pe- riod in community, primary and secondary care settings found a prevalence of 0.41 per 1000 population in a total population o f 590,585, almost half of which were planned to heal by secondary intention ( Ashby 2014 [pers comm] - paper in preparation). An evaluation of the point prevalence of all types of complex woun ds in a UK city (population 751,485) found a point prevalence of de- hisced surgical wounds of 0.07 per 1000 population ( Hall 2014 ). 3 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The same study reported a prevalence of 0.03 per 1000 populati on for pilonidal sinus surgical wounds, while the categories of ' other' and 'other surgical wound' had respective prevalences of 0.11 a nd 0.14 per 1000 population. Published time-to-healing data for SWHSI are limited. Data fro m randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show median times to heal ing of between 54 and 68 days (ranges from 33 to 168 days) depending on aetiology, with pilonidal sinus excisions taking longer t o heal than abdominal wounds ( Berry 1996 ;Shackelford 2002 ;Viciano 2000 ). Costs Without good epidemiological data it is difcult to estimate t he explicit costs to healthcare providers of managing SWHSI or the social costs including loss of income experienced by patients in work. The potential time to healing of these wounds, as well a s possible requirements for further surgery and other complica tions including infection, indicate that costs for the broad category o f SWHSI are likely to be substantial. The overwhelming majorit y of patients with SWHSI are treated with dressings of various t ypes (AL-Khamis 2010 [pers comm]). Clearly this accounts for some proportion of the total UK National Health Service (NHS) spend of GBP 116 million on dressings and related wound care products (2008/9 prices) ( MeReC 2010 ). However the majority of costs are likely to stem from the duration of hospital stays (although i t is not clear that SWHSI necessitate longer hospital stays in all in - dications ( AL-Khamis 2010 )), and subsequent care requirements in the community. Wounds which become infected (develop a surgical site infection (SSI)) also incur increased cost - previous ly estimated at between GBP 814 and GBP 6626 per patient ( Coello 2005 ;Plowman 2001 ). The prevalence of SSI was estimated at 5% of all surgeries in the UK and Ireland ( Smyth 2008 ); this is likely to be conservative as many SSIs occur post-discharge from hospital ( NICE 2008 ). These increased costs for SSI generally may apply equally to SWHSI. Impact on patients and carers In line with the paucity of epidemiological data, there is litt le ev- idence on the impact of SWHSI on patients' quality of life. A recent qualitative study explored the impact of these wounds o n 20 patients and carers. It found that the constant need for trea t- ments and care and the diminished quality of life were comparab le to those reported by patients with different types of ulcers; feel- ings of shock, anguish, frustration and powerlessness were h igh- lighted. The possibility of wound infection was viewed as a con - stant and insidious threat, representing a major setback to h ealing (McCaughan 2014 [pers comm] - paper in preparation). Wound infectionOpen wounds such as SWHSI offer an ideal environment for microbial colonisation, and most wounds will contain some micro - organisms although this will not necessarily lead to adverse events. An RCT in 54 patients with wounds with delayed healing by primary intention found 353 isolates of 44 different species ; many wounds had a bacterial load greater than 1 x 105g1(previously considered a threshold predictive of infection ( Robson 1968 )) and healed without complication ( Moues 2004 ). The isolates included Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic species, often associated w ith infection and delayed healing ( Madsen 1996 ). Bacteria may be more resistant to bacteriocidal agents because t hey grow on the surface of a wound forming a lm of cells, a 'biolm'. Recently opinion has shifted to the view that it is infection wi th enough or specic types, or both, of pathogenic micro-organism s and possibly resulting biolms ( Percival 2004 ;Wolcott 2008 ) that may lead to negative outcomes and potentially delayed healin g (Bowler 2003 ;Davies 2007 ;Madsen 1996 ever, the impact of microbial colonisation on wound healing is not independent of the host response; the ability of the host to provide adequate immune response is likely to be as critical, i f not more so, as the specics of the flora in the wound in determining whether a wound heals. The document 'Wound Infection in Clinical Practice - An Inter- national Consensus' ( WUWHS 2008 ) outlines a scenario leading to wound infection where 'bacteria multiply, healing is disru pted and wound tissues are damaged (local infection)'. The document also notes that 'Bacteria may produce problems nearby (spreadi ng infection) or cause systemic illness (systemic infection)'. Wou nd infection has also been seen as the far end of a continuum which starts with sterility (a brief period following surgery), mov ing to contamination (dened as the presence of microbes but little acti ve growth and no clinical problems), then colonisation (considered as the normal status quo with growth in wound flora being man- aged by the host immune system and no damage to wound tissues) and nally to critical colonisation and then infection ( Kingsley 2004 ). Critical colonisation is dened as a point between coloni- sation and infection where the 'healthy' balance of wound flora is no longer maintained by the host and the bacterial load or speci es present in the wound,or both shift away from a so-called safe le vel. (Kingsley 2004 ). Others have conceptualised critical colonisation as invasion of the wound surface by micro-organisms ( AWMA 2011 ;Edwards 2004 ). The classic clinical signs of infection include local pain, heat, redness, swelling and secretion of pus. The concept of critical colonisation lacks clear diagnostic criteria; it is generally d escribed as being associated with delayed healing in the absence of over t signs of wound infection ( Carville 2008 ;Cutting 2004 ) possibly with other symptoms such as increased exudate (though less than in infection) and hypergranulation/friable tissue ( Cutting 2004 ; Gardner 2001 ) although associated evidence is limited. Although there is a widespread view that healing of complex wounds is likely to be retarded by critical colonisation or topi cal/ 4 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.local infection, the empirical evidence to support this is extre mely limited ( Howell-Jones 2005 ). The of crit- ical colonisation or topical/local infection in SWHSI is even more limited and caution should be exercised in extrapolating from studies in other types of wounds healing by secondary intenti on; there are differences in the microbiology even between chronic wound types ( Dowd 2008 ). The Australian Wound Management Association states that 'the true extent of bacterial impairm ent of wound healing is unknown' ( AWMA 2011 ). Description of the intervention Where an antimicrobial intervention is considered clinically ap - propriate in the treatment of SWHSI there are two main ap- proaches: an antibiotic may be administered systemically (ora lly, intravenously or intramuscularly) or a topical antibiotic or anti- septic may be applied. Systemic antibiotics affect the whole b ody while topical treatments affect only a specic area of the body. Antibiotics are substances that destroy or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms ( Macpherson 2004 ). Systemic antibiotic treat- ments include groups of drugs which share similar modes of actio n such as penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macroli des and quinolones. Other antibiotics which do not belong to one of these main groups include clindamycin, metronidazole, trimet ho- prim and co-trimazole. T opical antimicrobial agents include both antibiotics and anti sep- tics. Antiseptics are thought to prevent the growth of pathoge nic micro-organisms without damaging living tissue ( Macpherson 2004 ). T opical applications broadly fall into two types: lotions used for wound irrigation or cleaning, or both, with a brief con - tact time (unless used as a pack/soak), and products which are in prolonged contact with the wound such as creams, ointments and impregnated dressings. Agents used primarily for wound irrigation/cleaning are com- monly based on povidone iodine, chlorhexidine and peroxide agents. Less commonly used are traditional agents such as gent ian violet and hypochlorites. Longer contact creams and ointments include fusidic acid, mupirocin, neomycin sulphate and iodine ich includes dressings impregnated with agents such as chlorhexid ine or peroxides. Recommendations on dressing type are based pri - marily on the level of wound exudate which determines the dres s- ing substrate as well as the antimicrobial agent ( BNF 2014 ). How the intervention might work The rationale for treating clinically infected wounds with ant i- microbial agents like antibiotics and antiseptics is to kill or slow the growth of the pathogenic micro-organisms, thus preventin g aninfection from worsening and spreading. Improved healing ma y be a secondary benet although evidence on the association be- tween wound healing and infection is limited ( AWMA 2011 ) (see Description of the condition ). There is a widely held view that wounds which do not have clear signs of clinical infection but which have characteristics such as retarded healing may also benet from a reduction in bacterial load. Again, evidence for this is limited (e.g. Howell-Jones 2005 ) (seeDescription of the condition ). The normal mechanism of antibiotics is by inhibiting deoxyri- bonucleic acid (DNA) or protein synthesis or by disrupting the bacterial cell wall. Antiseptics can be bacteriocidal (in that they kill micro-organisms) or they can work by slowing the growth of organisms (bacteriostatic). Antiseptics can have a wider spectrum of action than just bacteria and often work by damaging the sur- face of microbes ( Macpherson 2004 ). Why it is important to do this review Whether systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics or topical an ti- septics can promote healing in SWHSI remains uncertain. An ear- lier systematic review of antimicrobial agents used for the t reat- ment of all types of chronic wounds ( O'Meara 2001 ) included three small trials assessing topical agents for pilonidal si nus exci- sion wounds (but that were closed rather then left open) and a further three small trials of systemic antibiotics in the sam e indi- cation. The reviewers were not able to generate denitive concl u- sions about the use of systemic or topical agents in these woun ds because of methodological problems in the primary literature . A Health T echnology Assessment (HTA) review from the same year assessed debridement for SWHSI ( Lewis 2001 ). Some of these studies reported the use of chemical debriding agents with ant isep- tic properties. The review found insufcient evidence to supp ort the use of any particular dressing. A subsequent Cochrane systematic review ( Vermeulen 2004 ) iden- tied 13 RCTs of dressings and topical treatments for SWHSI, al l of which were small and of poor quality. Six of these trials enr olled only patients following surgery for pilonidal sinuses, and ve trials enrolled only patients with dehisced abdominal wounds. Inte r- ventions assessed included antiseptics such as EUSOL and povi- done iodine. There was no evidence that the choice of dressing or topical treatment had any impact on wound healing; no data on clinical infection status were reported. This review is now ove r 10 years old. The current review is one of a number of Cochrane reviews in- vestigating the use of antibiotics and antiseptics in the trea tment of different types of wounds, each of which updates elements of O'Meara 2001 . While there will be some overlap between trials in- cluded in this review and in other Cochrane reviews of individu al antimicrobial agents in wounds ( Jull 2013 ;Storm-Versloot ) or dressings for particular types of SWHSI ( Smith 2014 ), this re- 5 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.view will provide a single synthesis of the randomised evide nce relating to all systemic and topical antimicrobials for SWHSI. Many options are available to health professionals who are co n- sidering using antimicrobial therapy for patients with SWHSI , ei- ther as a treatment for, or prophylaxis against, clinical infe ction. Evidence-based decision-making on the impact of antimicrobial agents on healing of these wounds can be challenging. Key deci- sion problems include whether to use an antibacterial agent in stead of standard care and whether different antimicrobial prepara tions have a differential impact on healing when directly compared. O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and t op- ical antiseptics for the treatment of surgical wounds healing b y secondary intention. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, irrespective of language of report. Cross-over trials were only included if they reported out- come data at the end of the rst treatment period, prior to cross - over. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded. RCTs reported only as abstracts were included only when available data were s uf- cient for reasonable data extraction, either from the abstra ct itself or from the study authors. T ypes of participants People aged at least 18 years with SWHSI. Studies enrolling pe o- ple with skin graft donor sites were not included, as these sit es are supercial wounds which require specic care. Studies of wounds with a non-surgical origin which have subsequently undergone sharp or surgical debridement or other surgical treatments we re also excluded. We also excluded studies of wounds where the in- tention was delayed closure followed by healing with primary in- tent and studies of wounds which have been created in order to provide an entry or exit point such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) wounds or stoma. Wounds within the oral or aural cavities were also excluded. Studies which recruited people with a SWHSI alongside those with other types of wound were not included.T ypes of interventions The primary interventions of interest were topical antisept ic agents or antibiotic (antimicrobial) agents delivered either syste mically or topically. We included any RCT in which the use of a topical or systemic antibiotic or a topical antiseptic is the only syste matic dif- ference between treatment groups. Systemic antibiotics may h ave been administered orally or by other routes (e.g. intravenou sly, intramuscularly). Both intervention and control regimens coul d consist of antibiotics or antiseptics administered singly or i n com- bination; control regimens might also include placebo, anothe r therapy, standard care or no treatment. Studies which evaluat ed intervention schedules including other therapies (e.g. press ure re- lieving devices, dressings) were included provided that thes e treat- ments were delivered in a standardised way across the trial ar ms. We excluded trials in which the presence or absence of a specic an- tibiotic/antiseptic was not the only systematic difference b etween trial arms. We excluded studies evaluating antibiotic or antiseptic reg imes that were part of pre-, intra- or post-operative surgical site i nfection (SSI) prevention practices. We also excluded physical and biolog i- cal therapies sometimes purported to have incidental antibact erial properties such as heat therapy and larval therapy. We anticipated that likely interventions would be antisepti c and antibiotic agents, which might include (but not be limited to) the following topical agents which can be available in the form o f creams, sprays, ointments and impregnated into different ty pes of dressings: chlorhexidine; ypes of outcome measures We list primary and secondary outcome measures below. If a tria l was otherwise eligible (correct study design, population and i nter- vention/comparator) but did not report a listed outcome, then we contacted the study authors where possible in order to establi sh whether a relevant outcome was measured but not reported. Primary outcomes The primary efcacy outcome for this review was wound healing. T rialists use a range of different methods of measuring and r eport- ing this outcome. RCTs which reported one or more of the fol- lowing were considered to provide the most relevant and rigor ous measures of wound healing: Time to complete wound healing (correctly analysed using survival, time-to-event approaches). Proportion of wounds completely healed during follow-up (frequency of complete healing). 6 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We used authors' denitions of complete wound healing; these were reported where possible. We reported outcome measures a t the latest time point available (assumed to be length of follo w- up if not specied) and the time point specied in the methods as being of primary interest (if this was different from lates t time point available). Where both the outcomes above were reported, we presented all data in a summary outcome table for reference but focused on reporting time to healing where possible. When time was analy sed as a continuous measure (i.e.mean time to healing), but it was no t clear whether all wounds healed, we documented the use of the outcome in the study, but did not plan to include the data in any meta-analysis. We grouped outcome data for wound healing using the following categories; the review authors used their judgement as to whe ther statistical pooling within these time categories was appropr iate. Short term: 8 weeks Medium term: > 8 weeks but 24 weeks Long term: > 24 weeks. The primary safety outcome for the review was all reported adv erse events. Where reported, we extracted data on all serious adver se events and all non-serious adverse events where a clear method - ology for the collection of adverse event data was provided. Th is methodology should make it clear whether events were reporte d at the participant level or, where multiple events per person were reported, that an appropriate adjustment was made for data cl us- tering. We also treated wound infection as a primary safety outcome. Th is included changes in infection status as well as signs or symptom s of clinical infection. Study authors' denitions of clinical inf ection were used. We did not include data on bacterial load, diversity , or the presence of individual species where it was not clear how the outcome related to infection. Secondary outcomes The following secondary outcomes were included: Change (and rate of change) in wound size, with adjustment for baseline size (we planned to contact study autho rs to request adjusted means when not presented). When change or rate of change in wound size was reported without adjustment for baseline size, we documented use of the outcome in the study, but did not extract, summarise or use the data in any meta-analysis. Changes in bacterial (antibiotic) resistance. Health-related quality of life: quality of life was included where it was reported using a validated scale such as the SF-36 (Ware 1992 ) or EQ-5D ( EuroQoL Group 1990 ). Ideally reported data were adjusted for the baseline score. We did not include ad hoc measures of quality of life that were unlikely t o be validated and would not be common to multiple trials.Mean pain score (including pain at dressing change) as a continuous outcome using a validated scale such as a visual analogue scale (VAS) or other recognised measurement instrument. Number of wounds closed surgically (or time to surgical closure). Resource use (when presented as mean values with standard deviation) including measures of resource use such as number of dressing changes, number of nurse visits, length of hospital stay, and need for other interventions including return to theatre . Costs associated with resource use (including estimates of cost-effectiveness). Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We searched the following electronic databases to identify re ports of relevant clinical trials: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 05 November 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ) (2015, Issue November Ovid Non-Indexed (1974 November 2015); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1937 to 05 November 2015). The search strategies used for CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL Plus can be found in Appendix 1 . We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying ra n- domised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maxim is- ing version (2008 revision) ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined the EMBASE search with the Ovid EMBASE lter developed by the UK Cochrane Centre ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined the CINAHL searches with the trial lters developed by the Scottis h Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN 2011 ). There were no restrictions of the searches with respect to language, date of p ub- lication or study setting. We also searched the following clinical trials registries: ClinicalT rials.gov ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ); Platform (ICTRP) ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx Register ( https:// www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search ). Searching other resources We aimed to identify other potentially eligible trials or an cillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved incl uded 7 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.trials, as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta-analys es and Health T echnology Assessment reports. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo review authors independently assessed the titles and ab stracts of the citations retrieved by the searches for relevance. After this initial assessment, we obtained full-text copies of all studi es consid- ered to be potentially relevant. T wo review authors indepen dently checked the full papers for eligibility; we resolved disagree ments by discussion and, where required, the input of a third review au- thor. Where the eligibility of a study was unclear we attempted to contact study authors. We recorded all reasons for exclusion o f studies for which we had obtained full copies. We completed a Pre - ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Anal yses (PRISMA) flowchart to summarise this process ( Liberati 2009 ). Where studies had been reported in multiple publications/rep orts, we obtained all publications. Whilst the study was included onl y once in the review, we extracted data from all reports to ensure all available, relevant data were obtained. Data extraction and management We extracted and summarised details of the eligible studies. Where possible we extracted data by treatment group for the pre-speci ed interventions and outcomes in this review. T wo review author s independently extracted data; we resolved discrepancies thro ugh discussion or by consultation with a third review author. Where data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact the stu dy authors and request this information. Outcome data were collected for relevant time points as describe d inTypes of outcome measures . Where possible we extracted the following data: bibliographic data including date of completion/ publication; country of origin; unit of randomisation (participant/wound); unit analysis; trial design e.g. parallel, cluster; care setting; number of participants randomised to each trial arm and number included in nal analysis; eligibility criteria and key baseline participant data including indication for and type of surgery; location(s) of wounds and whether planned healing by secondary intention; details of treatment regimen received by each group; duration of treatment; details of any co-interventions;primary and secondary outcome(s) (with denitions and, where applicable, time points); outcome data for primary and secondary outcomes (by group); duration of follow-up; number of withdrawals (by group) and number of withdrawals (by group) due to adverse events; publication status of study; source of funding for trial. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo review authors independently assessed included studies using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011a ). This tool addresses six specic domains: sequence generation, all oca- tion concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome reporting and other issues - in this review we recorded issues with unit of analysis, for example where a cluster trial had been un - dertaken but analysed at the individual level in the study re port. We assessed blinding of outcome assessment and completeness o f outcome data for each of the review outcomes separately. We have presented our assessment of risk of bias using two 'Risk of bi as' summary gures; one which is a summary of bias for each item across all studies, and a second which shows a cross-tabulation of each trial by all of the 'Risk of bias' items. We summarised a study's risk of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bia s, report- ing bias and other bias. For trials using cluster randomisati on, we also planned to consider the risk of bias in relation to: recrui t- ment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters, incorrect anal ysis and comparability with individually randomised trials ( Higgins 2011b ) (Appendix 3 ). Measures of treatment effect For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% condence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcome data, we used the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs for trials that used the same assessment scale. We planned to report time-to- event data (e.g. time to complete wound healing) as hazard rati os (HRs) where possible, in accordance with the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2011 ). If studies reporting time-to-event data (e.g. time to healing) did not report a HR, then, when feasible, we plann ed to estimate this using other reported outcomes, such as number s of events, through the application of available statistical m ethods (Parmar 1998 ;Tierney 2007 ) although we did not implement such an approach here. Unit of analysis issues Where studies were randomised at the participant level and out - comes measured at the wound level, for example for wound heal- ing, we treated the participant as the unit of analysis when th e 8 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.number of wounds assessed appeared to be equal to the number of participants (e.g. one wound per person). A possible unit of analysis issue we anticipated was that rand omisa- tion had been carried out at the participant level with the allo cated treatment used on multiple wounds per participant (or perhaps only on some participants) but data were presented and analys ed per wound (clustered data). Where studies included some or all clustered data we planned to report this, noting whether data had been incorrectly treated as independent. We recorded this as part of the risk of bias asses sment. We did not plan to undertake further calculation to adjust for clustering as part of this review. Dealing with missing data It is common to have data missing from trial reports. Excluding participants from the analysis post randomisation or ignori ng par- ticipants who are lost to follow-up compromises the randomisa- tion and potentially introduces bias into the trial. If it was thought that study authors might be able to provide some missing data , we planned to contact them; however, it is likely that data will of- ten be missing because of loss to follow-up. In individual stud ies, when data on the proportion of wounds healed were presented, we assumed that randomly assigned participants not included i n an analysis had an unhealed wound at the end of the follow-up period (i.e. they were considered in the denominator but not in the numerator). When a trial did not specify participant group num- bers before dropout, we presented only complete case data. For time-to-healing analysis using survival analysis methods, d ropouts should be accounted for as censored data. Hence all participants would contribute to the analysis. We acknowledge that such anal - ysis assumes that dropouts are missing at random and there is no pattern of missingness. We have presented data for area chang e of wound and for all secondary dichotomous outcomes as a complete case analysis. For continuous secondary outcome measures e.g. length of hospi - tal stay we presented available data from the study reports/ study authors and did not impute missing data. Where measures of var i- ance were missing these were calculated ( Higgins 2011a ) or study authors contacted where possible. Where these measures of vari - ation remained unavailable we excluded the study from any rel e- vant meta-analyses. Assessment of heterogeneity Assessment of heterogeneity is a complex, multi-faceted proces s. Firstly, we planned to consider clinical and methodological het - erogeneity: that is the degree to which the included studies va r- ied in terms of participant, intervention, outcome and characte r- istics such as length of follow-up. We planned to supplement thi s assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity with in- formation regarding statistical heterogeneity - assessed u sing theChi\u00b2 test (we considered a signicance level of P < 0.10 to in- dicate statistically signicant heterogeneity) in conjunction with the I\u00b2 measure ( Higgins 2003 ). I\u00b2 examines the percentage of to- tal variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance ( Higgins 2003 ). Very broadly, we considered that I\u00b2 values of 25%, or less, meant a low level of heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ), and values of more than 75% indicated very high heterogeneity (Deeks 2011 ). Where there was evidence of high heterogeneity we planned to explore this further if required: see Data synthesis . Assessment of reporting biases Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research n dings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Publicatio n bias is one of a number of possible causes of 'small study effect s', that is, a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more benecial in smaller RCTs. Funnel plots allow a visual as - sessment of whether small study effects may be present in a met a- analysis. A funnel plot is a simple scatter plot of the interve ntion effect estimates from individual RCTs against some measure o f each trial's size or precision ( Sterne 2011 ). Funnel plots are only informative when there is a substantial number of studies in cluded in an analysis; we planned to present funnel plots for meta-an al- yses which included at least 10 RCTs using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan) ( RevMan 2014 ). Data synthesis We combined details of included studies in a narrative review a c- cording to the comparison between intervention and comparator , the population and the time point of the outcome measurement. If studies had appeared appropriately similar in terms of woun d type and location, intervention type and antibacterial agent, dur ation of treatment and outcome assessment, we would have considered clinical and methodological heterogeneity and undertaken poo l- ing. In terms of meta-analytical approach, in the presence of clinical heterogeneity (review author judgement) or evidence of stati sti- cal heterogeneity, or both, we planned to use the random-effect s model. We planned to use a xed-effect approach only when clini- cal heterogeneity was thought to be minimal and statistical he tero- geneity was estimated as non-statistically signicant for the 0% for the I\u00b2 assessment ( Kontopantelis 2013 ). This approach was planned as it is recognised that statistical asses sments can miss potentially important between-study heterogeneity in small samples, hence the preference for the more conservative r an- dom-effects model ( Kontopantelis 2012 ). Where clinical hetero- geneity was thought to be acceptable or of interest we potentia lly planned to meta-analyse even when statistical heterogeneity was high, with further exploration to interpret the causes behin d this heterogeneity and using meta-regression for that purpose, i f pos- sible ( Thompson 1999 ;Thompson 2002 ). 9 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We presented data using forest plots where possible. For tim e-to- event data, we planned to plot (and, if appropriate, pool) est imates of HRs and 95% CIs as presented in the study reports using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ). Where time to healing was analysed as a continuous measure but it was not clear if all wounds healed, we documented use of the outcome in the study but data were not summarised or used in any meta-analysis. 'Summary of ndings' tables We planned to present the main results of the review in 'Summa ry of ndings' tables. These tables present key information con cern- ing the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined and the sum of available data for the main outcomes ( Sch\u00fcnemann 2011a ). The 'Summary of ndings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recom- mendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) appro ach. The GRADE approach denes the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be condent that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specic interest . The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within - trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evid ence, heterogeneity, precision of effect ication bias ( Sch\u00fcnemann 2011b ). We planned to present the following outcomes in the 'Summary of ndings' tables. Time to complete wound healing when analysed using appropriate survival analysis methods. Proportion of wounds completely healed during the trial period. Changes in clinical infection status. Where data were not pooled we have presented GRADE assess- ment without a 'Summary of ndings' table - which was the case for all comparisons in this review. In terms of the GRADE assessment, when making decisions for the risk of bias domain we downgraded only when studies had been classed at high risk of bias for one or more domains. We did not downgrade for unclear risk of bias assessments. In assess ing the precision of effect estimates we followed GRADE guidance (GRADE 2013 ) and calculated an optimal information size (OIS) using conventional sample size calculation methods. We used th e OIS, along with the size of 95% CIs in terms of whether they spanned estimates of benet and harm, to assess for downgrad ing. We calculated the OIS based on GRADE guidance of using a relative risk reduction of between 20% and 30%. The OIS is summarised below but should not be treated as optimal sample sizes for any future research - within a GRADE assessment the OIS is used to assess the stability of CIs rather than being us ed toassess the appropriateness of a sample size to detect a differ ence per se. Time to wound healing - detect a reduction in time to healing of eight days from 28 days to 21 days (with 100 days recruitment and 100 days follow-up: 80% power; alpha 5%) = 388 participants Proportion of wounds healed - detect an increase in wound healing of 75% to 90% (80% power; alpha 5%) = 200 participants Changes in clinical infection status - detect a reduction in cases of wound infection from 14% to 10% 80% power; alpha 5%) = 2070 participants Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity If possible, we planned to assess heterogeneity across the fo llowing areas: where there was evidence of between-trial heterogenei ty we would have conducted a subgroup analysis if feasible. Locations of wound types: abdominal wounds and other wound types. Planned and unplanned healing by secondary intention. If possible we planned to perform analyses to explore the infl u- ence of risk of bias on effect size. We would have assessed the in - fluence of removing from meta-analyses studies classed as havin g high and unclear risk of bias. These analyses would have includ ed only studies assessed as having low risk of bias in all key dom ains, namely, adequate generation of the randomisation sequence, ad- equate allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor for the estimates of treatment effect. Elements of this Methods section were based on the standard Cochrane Wounds Protocol Template. R E S U L T S Description of studies Results of the search The search for this review returned 3928 citations - 10 further citations were found from screening related systematic revie ws and bibliographies. After screening we obtained full text 32 cita tions (relating to 28 studies). Of these studies 11 are included in the review: 13 were excluded. Four studies are awaiting assessme nt as they required further information before a decision on inclus ion could be made and queries with study authors or translators ar e pending.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Included studies Eleven studies (886 participants) are included in this review w ith each making a different pairwise comparison of treatment - tha t is no two studies compared the same two treatments. Nine studies investigated use of antiseptic/antibacterial solutions on w ounds post-operatively, delivering these via gauze or other inert dressings (Argen 2006 ;Brehant 2009 ;Okeniyi 2005 ;Piaggesi 2002 ;Gupta 2008 ;Schmidt 1991 ). T wo studies investigated the use of antibiotics - one ( Duong 2010 ) investigated trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole post-operatively for people following su rgery on skin abscesses while one ( Khan 2014 ) investigated the use of an- tibiotics prior to haemorrhoidectomy surgery. Included participants had a range of different wounds. Wound resulting from excision of pilonidal abscess/disease (Argen 2006 ;Fernandez 2002 ). Wound healing by secondary intention ( Brehant 2009 ). Wound resulting from incision and drainage of a skin abscess ( Duong 2010 osti Wound from wounds Giannini 2014 ;Gupta 2008 ;Khan 2014 ). Open post-surgical on the foot/feet of people with diabetes ( Piaggesi 2010 ). Wound complications following a caesarean section (c- section) resulting in an open wound Schmidt 1991 . Studies had generally small sample sizes with a minimum of 37 participants ( Fernandez 2002 ) and a maximum of 162 ( Duong 2010 ) - the median sample size for the 11 included studies was 71participants. The follow-up period of studies ranged from thr ee weeks to six months and was unclear in one case ( Schmidt 1991 ). Detailed data on each study are found in the Characteristics of included studies tables and an overview of included studies with their extracted outcome data can be found in Table 1 . Excluded studies In total we excluded 13 studies from this review for the follow ing reasons. Use of antibiotic/antiseptic was not the only difference between groups (n = 9). Not RCT (n = 1). No outcome relevant to review (n = 1). Not conducted in participants with SWHSI (n = 2). Risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias assessments are summarised in Figure 2 andFigure 3 . Briefly, two studies were considered at low risk of selection bi as (Argen 2006 ;Gupta 2008 ) the remaining studies were classed at unclear risk of bias. Four studies were classed at low risk of bl inding for both staff and patient and blinded outcome assessment ( Argen 2006 ;Duong 2010 ;Giannini 2014 ;Gupta 2008 ), two studies were classed as being at high risk of bias ( Schmidt 1991 ;T osti 2014 ); the remaining studies were classed as being at unclear risk of bias for blinding. Seven studies were classed as being at lo w risk of attrition bias ( Argen 2006 ;Fernandez 2002 ;Giannini 2014 ; 2005 ;Piaggesi 2010 ;T osti 2014 ), one study was classed at high risk of bias for attrition bias ( Schmidt 1991 ); the remaining studies were at unclear risk of bias. 12 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Antiseptic treatments compared with non-anti- microbial treatments Comparison 1: Polyvidone iodine (Povidone iodine)- impregnated mesh compared with alginate mesh (1 trial; 71 participants) This comparison includes one study which had six weeks' follow- up (Brehant 2009 ) and assessed treatment for wounds resulting from the closure of stoma orice by secondary intention. Primary outcomes Time to wound healing Mean time-to-healing data presented but not all wounds healed. Data not presented further. Proportion of wounds healed There was no clear evidence of a difference in number of wounds healed between groups. There were 25/34 (74%) wounds reported as healed in the iodine mesh group compared with 34/37 (92%) in the alginate 0.64 to 1.00 ( Analysis 1.1 ).GRADE assessment for proportion of wounds healed: Low quality evidence. Downgraded twice due to imprecision with 95% CIs for risk of wound healing in the iodine group ranging from 36% reduction in risk to 0% reduction, so condence intervals include a RR of 1 and the estimate comes from a single small study with 71 participants (OIS = 200 ). Wound infection There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of wound infections between groups. In total 2/ 29 (7%) of participants had a wound infection in the iodine- impregnated group compared with 3/37 (8%) in the alginate mesh group. It was not clear from the report that the infection event s occurred in different people but we have assumed this was the cas e: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.76 ( Analysis 1.2 ). GRADE assessment wound infection: Low quality evidence. Downgraded twice due to imprecision with 95% CIs for risk of wound infection in the iodine group ranging from a reduction in risk of 85% to an increase risk of 476% so crossing a RR of 1 and the estimate comes from a single small study with 71 participants (OIS = 2070 ). Adverse events There were 10 events in the iodine mesh group and 17 events in the alginate mesh group. It was not clear whether e ach event occurred in a different person or not. We did not analyse the data further.Secondary outcomes Resource use (mean number of dressing changes to achieve heal- ing):There was evidence of fewer dressing changes in the alginate mesh group with a mean of 17.9 (SD = 8) dressing changes in the iodine mesh group compared with a mean of 13.2 in the algi- nate mesh group (SD = 5). Mean difference = 4.70 more dressing changes in the iodine mesh group, 95% CI 1.66 to 7.74 ( Analysis 1.3). Costs associated with resource use (mean cost per participant - included nursing time for dressing changes and cost of dressing ): The mean cost of the treatment in the iodine mesh group was EUR 287 compared with EUR 268 in the alginate mesh group. The authors did not present any measures of variance around th ese estimates, and we have not analysed the data further. Comparison 2: 10% povidone iodine solution soak compared with no soak (1 trial; 100 participants) This comparison included one study which had six weeks' follow- up (T osti 2014 ) and assessed treatment for wounds resulting from the closure of stoma orice by secondary intention. Primary outcomes None reported. Secondary outcomes Resource use Mean length of stay, number of readmissions and number of re-operations are reported in Table 1 . It is not clear the number of participants that these events occurred in (thus if dat a are clustered). We have not analysed the data further here. Comparison 3: Aloe vera compared with standard care (1 trial; 40 participants) This comparison contains one study with unclear follow-up (Schmidt 1991 ) and evaluated treatment of open wounds follow- ing a c-section. Primary outcomes Time to wound healing The mean time to wound healing in the aloe vera group was 53 days (SD = 24) compared with 83 days (SD = 28) in the standard care group Table 1 . There was large loss to follow-up in this group which impacts on knowledge of who 15 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.healed, thus we have not analysed these mean time-to-healing d ata further. Adverse events The report notes that no adverse events were noted in either group, however data collection methods were not clear . Secondary outcomes None reported. Comparison 4: Zinc oxide povidone mesh dressing compared with povidone mesh dressing (classed as placebo by study authors) (1 trial; 64 participants) This comparison included one study which had 13 weeks' follow- up (Argen 2006 ) and assessed treatment for wounds resulting from excised pilonidal abscesses. Primary outcomes Time to wound healing Median time to healing was described as 54 days (interquartile range (IQR) 42 days to 71 days) in the zin c oxide mesh group and 62 days (IQR 55 to 82 days) for the placebo mesh group. The study authors presented this as an unadjuste d hazard ratio of 1.30, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.19 in the direction of the zinc oxide group. GRADE assessment: Low quality evidence - downgraded twice for imprecision: once as 95% CI were very imprecise ranging from a 23% reduction in hazard of healing in the zinc oxide group to a 219% increased hazard of healing (crossing RR 1) and once as data were from a single study with 64 participants (OIS = 388). Wound infection Study authors presented wound infection 'man- ifest on presence of foul smell' with 1/33 (3%) of participants classed as having an infected wound in the zinc oxide mesh group compared with 8/31 (26%) in the placebo group: RR 0.12, 95% CIs 0.02 to 0.89. Analysis 2.1 . GRADE assessment for wound infec- tion:Low quality evidence - downgraded once for indirectness of outcome which is a narrow denition of infection and once due to imprecision with data from a small single study with only 64 participants (OIS = 2070). The study also recorded the number of participants prescribed a n- tibiotics during the post-operative period - 3/33 (9%) of parti ci- pants in the zinc oxide group compared with 12/31 (42%) in the placebo group: RR 0.16, 95% CIs 0.04 to 0.64. ( Analysis 2.2 ). GRADE assessment for wound infection: Low quality evidence - downgraded once for indirectness of outcome and once due to imprecision with data from a small single study with only 64 participants (OIS = 2070).Secondary outcomes Pain We have extracted and presented data in Table 1 for infor- mation, however the instrument used to measure pain scores pr e- sented (at seven days pre and post mesh removal) was not clearly described. It was also not clear if a high or low score corresponde d to more (or less) pain. We have not presented data further here . 2. Antibiotic treatments compared with non- microbial treatments Comparison 5: Sucralfate cream compared with petrolatum cream (1 trial; 116 participants) This comparison contained one trial with four weeks' follow-up (Gupta 2008 ) that evaluated treatments of participants with open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy Primary outcomes Proportion of wounds healed At four weeks 45/58 (78%) par- ticipants in the sucralfate group had a healed wound compared with 30/58 (52%) in the control group RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99. Analysis 3.1 . GRADE assessment for proportion of wounds healed: Moderate quality evidence. Downgraded once due to imprecision with the estimate coming from a small study (n = 116) which did not meet the OIS (OIS = 200) Secondary outcomes Pain (measured using 10-point VAS scale 0 = no pain to 10 = very severe pain). Data are reported at seven days, 14 days and four weeks. We have presented all data in Table 1 . As noted in our methods we have summarised the latest time point here. Th e mean pain score at four weeks in the sucralfate group was 0.2 (SD = 0.1) compared with 1.4 (0.3). Mean difference = -1.20, 95% CI -1.28 to -01.12. Analysis 3.2 . Comparison 6: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with placebo (1 trial; 162 participants) This comparison includes one study which had 90 days' follow-up (Duong 2010 ) and assessed treatment for wounds resulting from incision and drainage of a skin abscess. Primary outcomes Adverse events In the trimethoprim group 14/73 (19%) partic- ipants had an adverse event attributed to medication compared with 9/76 in the placebo group. RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.98 16 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(Analysis 4.1 ). We have presented a complete case analysis. There were missing data in both groups. Secondary outcomes Wound recurrence (dened in this study as, \"new lesions within 5 cm of original wound at 10 days\" ).At three months 13/46 (28%) participants had a new lesion in the trimethoprim group compared with 15/52 (29%) in the control. We have presented a complete case analysis. There was missing data in both groups . Mean difference: 0.98, 95% 7: Metronidazole/Ceftriaxone prophylactic antibiotic use compared with standard care (1 trial; 100 participants) This comparison contained one trial with six weeks' to eight we eks' follow-up ( Khan 2014 ) that evaluated open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy. Primary outcomes Adverse events We have presented data for low grade fever in Table 1 but it is not clear how many participants had these events so we have not presented data further. Secondary outcomes None reported. 3. Antiseptic treatment compared with an alternative antiseptic treatment Comparison 8: Rhizophora mangle bark extract compared with mercurochrome. (1 trial, 37 participants) This comparison contained one trial with six weeks' follow-up (Fernandez 2002 ) that evaluated open wounds resulting from ex- cision of pilonidal cyst/stula. Primary outcomes No data available for narrative review - see Table 1 .Secondary outcomes No data available for narrative review - see Table 1 . Comparison 9: Honey-soaked gauze compared with Edin- burgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL)-soaked gauze (1 trial; 43 participants) This comparison contained one trial with three weeks' follow- up (Okeniyi 2005 ) that evaluated participants with open wounds resulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses. Primary outcomes Proportion of wounds healed In the honey group 20/23 (87%) of wounds healed compared to 11/20 (55%) in group: RR; 2.42 ( Analysis 5.1 ). GRADE assess- ment for proportion of wounds healed: Moderate quality evidence. Downgraded once due to imprecision with the estimate coming from a small study (n = 116) which did not meet the OIS (OIS = 200). Adverse events No adverse events reported in either group. Secondary outcomes Resource use (mean length of hospital stay). The mean length of hospital stay in the honey group was 16.1 days (SD = 4.16) compared to 18.6 days (SD = 2.14) in the EUSOL group. Mean difference = -2.50 days, 95% CI -4.44 to -0.56. Comparison 10: Gauze with povidone iodine compared with gauze with Dermacyn\u00ae Wound Care (1 trial; 40 participants) This comparison contained one trial with 24 weeks' follow-up (or until complete re-epithelialisation) ( Piaggesi 2010 ) that evalu- ated diabetic participants with an infection on the foot requi ring surgery resulting in an open wound. Primary outcomes Complete wound healing In the iodine group 11/20 (55%) of wounds healed during the six-month follow-up ). GRADE assessment for proportion of wounds healed: Moderate quality evidence. Downgraded once due to imprecision with the estimate coming from a small study (n = 116) which did not meet the OIS (OIS = 200). Adverse events We have presented data for number of events in Table 1 but it is not clear how many participants had these events so we have not presented data further. 17 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Secondary outcomes None reported. Comparison 11: Triclosan compared with sodium hypochlorite (1 trial; 113 participants) This comparison contained one trial with three weeks' follow- up (Giannini 2014 ) that evaluated treatment of participants with open wound following haemorrhoidectomy. Primary outcomes Time to healing The mean time to healing in the triclosan group was 21.7 days (SD = 3.8) compared with 23.4 days (SD = 5.4) in the control group. We have presented summary data but it is not clear from the report that all wounds healed - and thus not clear that the mean is a valid measure of healing here. Mean differe nce = -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01. Analysis 7.1 . GRADE assessment for time to wound healing: Low quality evidence. Downgraded once due to imprecision with 95% CIs for a difference in mean time to healing ranging from a 3.4 day reduction in time to healing in the triclosan group to almost 0 days difference; t he estimate was from a small study that did not meet the OIS (OIS = 388). The study was also downgraded once for indirectness of outcome as we could not be sure that all wounds had healed and thus that mean time to healing was a valid measure. Adverse events: The study reported only adverse events related to bleeding/secretions from the wound. At 21 days' follow-up adv erse event scores in the triclosan group were 1.5 (SD 1.7) compared with 2.5 (SD 1.9) in the control group. Mean difference = -1.00, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.34 ( Analysis 7.2 ). Secondary outcomes Table 1 reports data at one week, two weeks and three weeks for the following outcomes. Following our methods we have presented only three-week data here. Pain (measured using 10-point VAS scale where lower score is better) :At 21 days' follow-up pain scores in the triclosan group were 1.4 (SD 1.6) compared with 2.6 (SD 1.8) in the control group. Mean difference = -1.20, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.57 ( Analysis 7.3). D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main resultsThis review includes all available RCT evidence for assessmen ts of antiseptic/antibiotic agents in the treatment of populatio ns with surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. Eleven trial s with a total of 886 participants were included. Antiseptic treatments compared with non-anti-microbial treatments - four comparisons T wo comparisons compared iodine preparations with no antisep tic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects on wound healin g or wound infection for these treatments. Available outcome da ta were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One tria l reported fewer dressing changes in the povidone iodine group . One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing that was classed as placebo by study authors ( Argen 2006 ). There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a differen ce in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul sme ll and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favou red the zinc oxide group. This was low quality evidence. Antibiotic treatments compared with non-microbial treat- ments - three comparisons One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the risk of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CIs 1.13 to 1.99) over a three-week period. This evidence was graded as being of modera te quality and stems from one small study ( Gupta 2008 ). The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group. Antiseptic treatment compared with an alternative antisep tic treatment - four comparisons There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds followi ng haemorrhoidectomy when treated with triclosan post-operativ ely compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01) ( Giannini 2014 ). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds re- sulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when tr eated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over three weeks' follow-up ( Okeniyi 2005 ). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in th e honey group. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants. There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacyn\u00ae- treated post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes h ealed compared to those treated with iodine ( Piaggesi 2010 ). Again es- timates came from one small study with 40 participants. Summary: there is no robust evidence on the relative effective ness of any anti-microbial preparations evaluated to date for use o n SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small particip ant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence. Th is means it is likely or very likely that further research will ha ve an 18 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Participants in the included trials had wounds which represent ed many of the types of surgery for which healing by secondary in- tention is commonly employed, and were therefore likely to be representative of clinical practice in terms of wounds which are intentionally healing in this way. However, only one trial a ppeared to include participants whose wounds were healing by secondary intention as a consequence of prior complications in healing by primary intention. The applicability of this review to patie nts with these types of wounds is therefore less clear. Quality of the evidence There was limited evidence available for this review. There w ere a small number of relevant studies eligible for inclusion and t hese evaluated a heterogenous range of treatments. It is not clear how the treatments evaluated related to common practices in terms o f antiseptic and antibiotic use for SWHSI. The studies themsel ves had small sample sizes. RCTs need to be adequately powered so that they are able to detect treatment effects of a specied size if they exist. This means that sample size calculations should be used to help estimate the optimum number of people recruited to a trial. Evidence from limited numbers of participants or where lim- ited numbers of events occur, or both, can also lead to condence intervals that are fragile (i.e. not stable). This can be assess ed by comparing the data available for a comparison to the optimal in - formation size. All the comparisons in this review were infor med by evidence where numbers of participants/events were lower t han the calculated optimal information size. It is also important that studies consider the outcome data tha t are being collected. Several studies presented data that could not easily be analysed here. Where time-to-healing data were presented it was as a mean time to healing. This is only valid if all particip ants have had the outcome of interest, otherwise the method cannot deal easily with participants who have not had the event, as me an time to event has to be imputed in these cases. Alternatively, people may only include data from those that had the event of interest in the mean calculation which places estimates at risk of bias. Th e correct approach is the use of survival (time to event methods). It is also important that trials clearly specify how outcome dat a are collected and dened. For example healing can be dened in a number of ways and this information was limited. We also note that given included studies were assessing antiseptics a nd antibiotics there was very limited presentation of wound inf ection data. Finally, studies should also clearly report how they pl anned to collect adverse event data and how this process was implementedin a standardised way across treatment arms. Overall the qual ity of outcome data presented was limited by both design and sampl e size. Most studies were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias . However, assessing risk of bias relies on good quality repor ting of methods in study papers and this was limited in most of the ele ven included studies. Key areas of good practice are the robust gene ra- tion of a randomisation sequence, robust allocation concealmen t, and blinded outcome assessment where possible. All this info rma- tion should be clearly included in the trial report, as trial au thors should anticipate the inclusion of their trials in systematic reviews. Potential biases in the review process This review considered as much evidence as possible. It was not limited by language or publication status. We made attempts t o identify studies which were not indexed on mainstream databa ses. We also contacted authors to try to ensure that limited reporti ng did not result in studies being excluded from the review. Alth ough all of the included studies were published in English, we iden tied and assessed studies published in a range of languages. One o f the excluded studies was published in Danish ( Eldrup 1985 ) and three of the studies currently awaiting classication were publishe d in other languages ( Vasei 2008 (Farsi); Fillmann 2004 andQuilici 1998 (Portuguese)). It is possible that there may be unpublished data that we have been unable to identify. However, whilst we ac- knowledge the possibility of publication bias despite our at tempts to locate unpublished studies, there were too few trials to te st for its presence. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews No other systematic review has specically focused on antibacte rial agents for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. On e previous Cochrane review ( Vermeulen 2004 ) evaluated dressings and topical treatments for surgical wounds healing by secondar y intention. Only two of the studies in our review were publish ed before the Vermeulen review ( Fernandez 2002 ;Schmidt 1991 ); Schmidt 1991 was included by the Vermeulen 2004 review but this did not identify Fernandez 2002 . Our review identied and excluded several of the other trials included in Vermeulen's r eview (Cannavo because use of an antibacterial agent was not the onl y systematic difference between trial arms. A review of debridement for surgical wounds healing by seconda ry intention ( Lewis 2001 ) was completed before the publication of any of the included studies except Schmidt 1991 . There is overlap in scope with a more general review of treatments for wounds healing by secondary intention ( Bradley 1999 ) but this was also published before any of the included studies from our review, 19 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.except for Schmidt 1991 which is included in all three previous reviews as well as our review. As with the Vermeulen Cochrane review, our review identied and excluded some trials include d in the older reviews ( Viciano 2000 (included in Lewis 2001 );Walker 1991 ;Williams 1981 (included in both Lewis 2001 andBradley 1999 )) because of additional differences between trial arms. There was only very limited overlap between our review and re - views of specic types of antimicrobials used to treat wounds i n general: iodine ( Vermeulen 2010 ); silver honey ( Jull 2013 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice A comprehensive review of current evidence did not nd convinc- ing evidence in favour of the use of any particular antimicrobia l treatment for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention for outcomes which matter (including wound healing and infection). Although some possible treatment effects were identied, th e qual- ity of the evidence varied from moderate to very low; all of the evidence was subject to some limitations. There was almost no evidence comparing different antimicrobial treatments. All o f the evidence related to topical treatments. Implications for research Currently there is no consistent evidence of a difference in out -comes between open surgical wounds treated with antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial treatments or with different antimicro bial interventions. Any investment in future primary research on treat- ment choices for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention must maximise its value to decision-makers. Given the large nu m- ber of treatment options, the design of future trials should be driven by high priority questions from patients and other de cision makers. It is also important for research to ensure that the ou t- comes that are collected in research studies are those that matte r to patients, carers and health professionals. Where trials ar e con- ducted, good practice guidelines must be followed in their desi gn, implementation and reporting. Such trials should be adequat ely powered to detect differences in healing rates, should use app ro- priate statistical methods for time-to-event analyses and sho uld include adequate follow-up (appropriate to the type of surgery undertaken) for all participants to heal.

T wenty-one participants had verti cal incisions and 19 had transverse incisions Inclusion criteria: women with surgical wounds that required h ealing by secondary in- tention after either caesarean section or laparotomy for gyna ecological surgery. All inci- sions had opened spontaneously or had been drained to treat a seroma, haematoma or wound abscess before referral to clinic Exclusion criteria: Patients with diabetes or cancer, requirin g treatment with glucocorti- coids or immunosuppressive drugs, had a history of abdominal irradiation, or a chronic debilitating disease Interventions Group A: standard treatment and aloe vera dermal gel (Carring ton Laboratories, Irving, TX). The gel was applied with each dressing change to the granula tion tissue in the wound bed at the level of the subcutaneous tissue and dermis (n = 20; 10 with vertical incision; 9 with transverse incision) Group B: standard treatment only (n = 20; 11 with vertical incisi ons, 9 with transverse incisions) Standard treatment: blunt debridement with gauze pad or sha rp debridement of necrotic tissue. Wound then irrigated with high-volume, high-pressur e irrigations using a 60 ml Lock with an 18-gauge angiocath and an irrigating v olume of 1000 ml. A wet-to-dry dressing was applied, using a solution of equal par ts of saline and sodium hypochlorite 0.025%. Wound care was performed every 8 hours in itially and then every 12 hours after granulation tissue developed Outcomes Primary outcomes: Time to healing (dened as when wound was completely epithelia lised) Adverse events Secondary outcomes: None Notes Funding source: no information given Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias)Low risk Quote: Randomised using a random num- ber sequence generated by a computer pro- gram Comment: Adequate methodology Allocation concealment (selection bias) Unclear risk No information given 41 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

All patients received a thorough debridement in the operatin g room with excision of necrotic tissue. The wounds were irrigated with 3 L normal sal ine under a low-velocity irrigation system and then partially closed over a Penrose dr ain or an iodinated gauze wick. The wounds were then dressed with an iodine-petroleum ga uze, sterile gauze, and an orthosis. Patients returned to the operating room if pers istent or progressive erythema was noted or if purulent fluid was expressed from the wound. On the rst post-operative day, the Penrose drain or gauze wicks were removed leaving ope n areas of the wound which were then exposed to the intervention or not, based on ra ndomisation Interventions Group A: a 10% povidone iodine solution mixed with saline in a 1:1 ratio hand soak. Hands were submerged for 20 minutes, three times per day. Aft er each soak wounds were redressed with sterile gauze and an orthosis. Soaks wer e stopped on discharge. (n = 50) Group B: no soaks, the wounds were treated with a daily dressi ng change with sterile gauze and an orthosis (n = 50) Empiric antibiotic coverage at time of admission (intravenou s ampicillin-sulbactam if history of bite wound; otherwise vancomycin) 42 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley Sons, or c or (individually randomised c ontrolled trials) 1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated? Low risk of bias: The investigators describe a random component in the sequence g eneration process, such as referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; tossing a coin; shuffling ca rds or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing lots. High risk of bias: The investigators describe a non-random component in the seque nce generation process. Usually, the description would involv e some systematic, non-random approach, for example, sequence genera ted by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rul e based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Unclear: Insufcient information about the sequence generation proces s to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. 2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed? Low risk of bias: Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equ ivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central ing telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled appearan sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. High risk of bias: Participants or investigators enrolling participants could p ossibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bia s, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes used without appropr iate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or w ere not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; da te of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. 68 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Unclear: Insufcient information to permit judgement of low or high ri sk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment i s not described or is not described in sufcient detail to allow a den itive judgement, for example, if the use of assignment envel opes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequ entially numbered, opaque and sealed. 3. Blinding (participants, personnel and outcome assessors) - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately pre vented during the study? Low risk of bias: Any one of the following: No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, an d unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding o f others is unlikely to introduce bias. High risk of bias: Any one of the following: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome m easurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, and the non-blinding of others is likely to introduce bias . Unclear: Any one of the following: Insufcient information to permit judgement of low or high ri sk of bias. The study did not address this outcome. 4. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Low risk of bias: Any one of the following: No missing outcome data. Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to tru e outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introduci ng bias). Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention g roups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate . For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference i n means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on obser ved effect size. Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. High risk of bias: Any one of the following: Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true ou tcome, with imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference i n means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed e ffect size. 'As-treated' analysis done with substantial departure of th e intervention received from that assigned at randomisation . Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputatio n. Unclear: Any one of the following: Insufcient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit jud gement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not s tated, no reasons for missing data provided). The study did not address this outcome. 5. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting? 69 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Low risk of bias: Any one of the following: The study protocol is available and all of the study's prespeci ed (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecied way. The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the publ ished reports include all expected outcomes, including those th at were prespecied (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). High risk of bias: Any one of the following: Not all of the study's prespecied primary outcomes have been r eported. One or more primary outcomes are reported using measurements , analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecied. One or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecied (unl ess clear justication for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect). One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported inco mpletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis. The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear: Insufcient information to permit judgement of low or high ri sk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. 6. Other sources of potential bias Low risk of bias: The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. High risk of bias: There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study: had a potential source of bias related to the specic study desi gn used; or has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or had some other problem. Unclear: There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: insufcient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or insufcient rationale or evidence that an identied problem w ill introduce bias. Appendix 3. 'Risk of bias' assessment (cluster randomised control led trials) In cluster randomised trials, particular biases to consider in clude: (i) recruitment bias; (ii) baseline imbalance; (iii) loss o f clusters; (iv) incorrect analysis; and (v) comparability with individually ra ndomised trials. (i) Recruitment bias can occur when individuals are recruited to th e trial after the clusters have been randomised, as the knowle dge of whether each cluster is an 'intervention' or 'control' cluster co uld affect the types of participants recruited. (ii) Cluster randomised trials often randomise all clusters a t once, so lack of concealment of an allocation sequence should not u sually be an issue. However, because small numbers of clusters are ran domised, there is a possibility of chance baseline imbalance be tween the randomised groups, in terms of either the clusters or the indi viduals. Although not a form of bias as such, the risk of baseli ne differences can be reduced by using stratied or pair-matched randomisation of clusters. Reporting of the baseline comparability of cluste rs, or statistical adjustment for baseline characteristics, can help r educe concern about the effects of baseline imbalance. (iii) Occasionally complete clusters are lost from a trial, and ha ve to be omitted from the analysis. Just as for missing outcome data in individually randomised trials, this may lead to bias. In ad dition, missing outcomes for individuals within clusters may also lead to a risk of bias in cluster randomised trials. (iv) Many cluster randomised trials are analysed by incorrect st atistical methods, not taking the clustering into account. Such a nalyses create a 'unit of analysis error' and produce over-precise resul ts (the standard error of the estimated intervention effect is too small) and P values that are too small. They do not lead to biased estimat es of effect. However, if they remain uncorrected, they will rece ive too much weight in a meta-analysis. (v) In a meta-analysis including both cluster and individually r andomised trials, or including cluster randomised trials wit h different types of clusters, possible differences between the interven tion effects being estimated need to be considered. For exampl e, in a vaccine trial of infectious diseases, a vaccine applied to all individu als in a community would be expected to be more effective than if t he vaccine 70 Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.was applied to only half of the people. Another example is pro vided by discussion of a Cochrane review of hip protectors ( Hahn 2005 ). The cluster trials showed large positive effect whereas indiv idually randomised trials did not show any clear benet. One p ossibility is that there was a 'herd effect' in the cluster randomised trials (which were often performed in nursing homes, where compliance w ith using the protectors may have been enhanced). In general, such 'co ntamination' would lead to underestimates of effect. Thus, i f an intervention effect is still demonstrated despite contamina tion in those trials that were not cluster randomised, a conde nt conclusion about the presence of an effect can be drawn. However, the size of the effect is likely to be underestimated. Contamination and 'herd effects' may be different for different types of cluster.
