Coordinating Investigator: Prof Dr med Title of Trial: COVID A Phase 2b/3, Randomized, Observer -Blinded, Placebo- Controlled, Multicenter Clinical Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Investigational SARS -CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine CVnCoV in Adults 18 Years of Age and Older Rationale: Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses causing respiratory disease, ranging from a common cold to severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in humans. In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus strain was rep orted in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The novel coronavirus was named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS -CoV-2), while the disease associated with it was referred to as COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The virus spread to dif ferent parts of China and an increasing number of countries worldwide and on 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak under International Health Regulations as a public health emergency of international concern (the WHO's highest level of alarm). On 12 March 2020, the WHO announced the outbreak as a pandemic. In view of the severity of respiratory disease caused by emerging coronaviruses, development of a vaccine has been undertaken by several pharmaceutical companies, and there are now vaccines available with emergency authorization/conditional marketing authorization for prevention of COVID -19 in several countries worldwide. Development of an effective vaccine against SARS -CoV-2 represents the best hope to prevent further epidemics and outbreaks of the disease. CureVac AG is developing a novel SARS- CoV-2 vaccine referred to as CVnCoV. CVnCoV is a messenger RNA (mRNA) -based COVID -19 vaccine in which the mRNA is protected and delivered by encapsulation within lipid nanoparti (LNPs). The mRNA encodes the full -length (S) protein from the SARS -CoV-2 virus. Following intramuscular injection of CVnCoV, the S protein is translated from the mRNA stimulating an antigen- specific humoral and cellular immune respons e to the S protein. Importantly, functional viral neutralizing titers (VNTs) are induced following vaccination with CVnCoV. Phase 1 and 2a trial s are being conducted to generate initial data on the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 2 doses of CVnCoV, administered 28 days apart, to adults 18 years of age and older. In a subset of subjects, a booster dose at 2 or 6 months after the first dose will be investigated. The first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1 trial, CV -NCOV - 001, is evaluating different dose levels of CVnCoV in seronegative and seropositive adults 18 to 60 years of age. Following review of the FIH data, a Phase 2a trial, CV -NCOV -002, was initiated and is evaluat ing CVnCoV at selected dose levels in adults 61 years of age. Following the first part of Trial CV-NCOV -002, expansion cohorts of 220 subjects aged 18 to 60 years and 220 subjects aged 61 years are being enrolled and treated to generate additional safety and immunogenicity data in preparation of Phase 2b/3 trials. Dose level selection for subsequent trials will be performed based on by the safety and immunogenicity data from these 2 trials. In the FIH Phase 1 trial, a dose of 12 \u00b5g elicited the same immune response as that seen in patients who are recovering from having been infected with the real virus. Therefore, this dose was selected to be used in this trial. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 162 The present Trial CV -NCOV -004 is designed as a Phase 2b/3 pivotal efficacy and safety trial in adults 18 years of age and older. The trial will have a randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled design. Subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites globally and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 2- dose schedule of either CVnCoV at a d ose level of 12 \u00b5g mRNA or placebo { normal saline ( 0.9% NaCl) } as the control. Following completion of Trial CV -NCOV -004 on Day 393, all subjects (both Phase 2b and 3) will be asked to continue in a separate 1-year extension (Trial CV-NCOV -004Ext ). Trial Duration for Each Subject: Approximately 13.5 months Phase: 2b/3 Primary Objectives: Primary Efficacy Objective To demonstrate the efficacy of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV in the prevention of first episodes of virologically -confirmed cases of COVID -19 of any severity in SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve subjects.

Overall Design: Trial CV-NCOV -004 will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial Phase 2b trial followed by a large Phase 3 efficacy trial. Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 will be conducted as randomized, o bserver -blinded, placebo- controlled trials. Subjects 18 years of age or older will b e enrolled at multiple sites globally and will receive a 2- dose schedule of either CVnCoV at a dose level of 12 \u00b5g mRNA or placebo { normal saline ( 0.9% NaCl )} in a 1:1 ratio. Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial are consistent in design (e.g., for COVID -19 case ascertainment and case definition) so that cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2b c an be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of vaccine efficacy ( VE). Phase 2b Design and Objectives (See Table 1 and Table 2 for the Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures) The objective of Ph ase 2b is to further characterize the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to initiating Phase 3. CVnCoV will be administered at the 12 \u00b5g dose level selected for Phase 3 investigation informed by the safety and immunogenicity data fr om the initial Phase 1 and 2a trials. Phase 2b will be conducted in 2 age groups of adults: 18 to 60 and Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 162 61 years of age, which represent the age range of the intended Phase 3 trial population. Approximately 4,000 subjects will be enrolled and randomiz ed in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of either CVnCoV or placebo, administered 28 days apart (see Synopsis Figure 1 ). Of the 4,000 subjects enrolled, approximately 800 to 1,000 (20% to 25%) will be 61 years of age. Phase 2b will be performed in an observer -blinded manner to reduce any potential bias in th e safety assessments. The sample size of 4,000 subjects is based on generating a robust and detailed dataset characterizing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to entering Phase 3. Furthermore, the data generated in Phase 2b will be the main dataset to be submitted in support of early conditional approval of CVnCoV. In Phase 2b, the safety and reactogenicity of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV will be assessed in detail by measuring the frequency and severity of the following adverse events (AEs): solicited local and systemic reactions for 7 days after each vaccination; unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each vaccination; medically -attended AEs through 6 months after the second trial vaccination; and AEs of special interest (AES Is) and serious adverse events (SAEs ) through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. The immunogenicity of CVnCoV will be evaluated after 1 and 2 doses in a subset of subjects (first 600 subjects enrolled in each of the 2 age groups; a total of 1,200 s ubjects in the Immunogenicity Subset) by measuring binding antibodies to the SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein and viral neutralizing antibodies. Antibody persistence will also be evaluated. Cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2b subjects will be collected and pooled with those occurring in Phase 3 and the total number of cases will be used for the primary analysis of efficacy. Surveillance for COVID -19 cases will be identical in Phase 2b and Phase 3. In addition, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Boar d (DSMB) will periodically monitor COVID -19 cases for signals of Vaccine- dependent Disease Enhancement (VDE). Subjects participating in Phase 2b will also be evaluated for asymptomatic SARS- CoV-2 infection during the trial, as measured by the d evelopment of antibodies to the N protein of SARS -CoV-2 in seronegative subjects (i.e. seroconversion). These data will be combined with those from Phase 3 to determine if vaccination with CVnCoV can prevent or reduce the rate of asymptomatic infection by SARS -CoV-2 (one of the key secondary efficacy objectives). Initiation of subject enrollment of the 2 target age groups into Phase 2b will be flexible. Depending on the timing of data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2a trials, enrollment of the 2 age groups into Phase 2b may be staggered, initially starting with subjects 18 to 60 years of age followed by subjects 61 year s of age. As the older age group will comprise 20% to 25% of the total number of subjects in Phase 2b, the staggered start is not expected to i mpact overall enrollment of the Phase 2b cohort. An early safety review of the Phase 2b data will be performed by the DSMB. The safety review will be conducted when approximately 1,000 subjects have been enrolled in Phase 2b (25% of subjects enro lled; 500 recipients of CVnCoV and 500 recipients of placebo) and have at least 1 week of safety follow -up after the first trial vaccination. If the safety profile is judged to be acceptable and there are no safety or tolerability concerns, it is anticipat ed that enrollment of subjects into Phase 3 can begin without interruption from Phase 2b. Another safety review by the DSMB will be conducted when approximately 1,000 Phase 2b subjects have received their second trial vaccination and have at least 1 week of safety follow -up. All available first dose safety data from the Phase 2b subjects will also be reviewed at this time. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 162 Phase 3 Design and Objectives (See Table 3 for the Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures) The primary objective of the combined Phase 2b/ 3 is to demonstrate the ef f icacy of a 2 -dose schedule of CVnCoV in the prevention of COVID -19 cases of any severity . Similar to Phase 2b, Phase 3 will be conducted as a randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled trial. Approximately 32,500 subjects, 18 years of age or older, will be enrolled at multiple sites globa lly in Phase 3 and will receive a 2- dose schedule of either CVnCoV at the 12 \u00b5g dose level or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (see Synopsis Figure 1 ). Subjects will undergo active surveillance for COVID -19 (see Appendix 6). During all site visits and phone calls, subjects will be reminded to contact the site if they have an acute illness with any symptoms clinically consistent with COVID -19. In addition, subjects will be messaged up to twice a week to provide a yes or no response to having COVID -19 symptoms. Those who respond \"yes\" w ill be contacted by trial staff for a follow -up interview and assessment , if the Investigator considers the symptoms could potentially indicate a COVID -19 case. If a subject is suspected of havin g COVID -19, he/she will undergo testing for SARS -CoV-2 infection with samples collected at the site or at a home visit. If the subject is confirmed to hav e COVID -19, all subjects will be followed until resolution of their disease. Due to the uncertain incidence rate of COVID -19 cases in a pandemic setting, the trial will be conducted as a case- driven trial based on the any severity COVID -19 endpoint due to the higher number of cases required. The trial will include 2 interim analys es and a final analysis , each of which will be triggered by achieving a predefined number of cases meeting the primary efficacy case definition. As described above, cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2b will be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of VE. As suc h, subjects participating in Phase 2b will contribute to the total sample size for the primary analysis of VE (N=36,500). With an equal follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the CVnCoV and placebo groups , efficacy would be demonstrated at the final anal ysis if 53 cases or less of 1 60 total cases of COVID -19 of any severity are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE 50.5%). Two interim analyses for high efficacy or futility will be performed when 56/111 cases meeting the primary case definition of COVID -19 cases have been accrued and adjudicated (approximately 5/6.5 months after the first vaccination). If the follow -up time of evaluable subjects is equal in both groups, early high efficacy would be demonstrated if 9 /32 cases or less of the 56/111 cases are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE at interim 80.9%/59.5%); conversely, futility would be reached if 25 /40 cases or more are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE at interim 19.4%/43.7%). Similar to Phase 2b, subjects participating in Phase 3 will be evaluated for SARS- CoV-2 infection during the trial, as measured by the development of antibodies to the N protein of SARS -CoV-2 in seronegative subjects. The safety objective of Phase 3 is to generate a large -scale safety database that will demonstrate the safety of CVnCoV. All subjects participating in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial will have medically -attended AEs collected for 6 months after the second vaccination; and AESIs (see Appendix 9 and Appendix 10) and SAEs collected for 1 year after the second vaccination. Independent of the demonstration of CVnCoV efficacy at either the interim or final analyses, which are projected to occur at approximatel y 5/6.5 and 9 months after the first vaccination, respectively, the trial will continue and remain observer -blinded until the end of the trial { when the last subject has completed the last visit on Day 393 ( see Section 5.4)} (except for subjects who request to be unblinded as they become eligible to receive an authorized /licensed vaccine) . During this period, collection of placebo- controlled safety dat a and accrual of COVID -19 cases will continue.

Collection of Blood Samples: The maximum total volume of blood taken over the trial period from any subject is 304 mL. Safety Assessments: The safety and reactogenicity of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV will be assessed by measuring the frequency and severity of the following AEs as described below. Safety assessments specific for subjects in Phase 2b: Reactogenicity will be assessed daily on each vaccinat ion d ay and the following 7 days by collection of solicited local AEs (injection site pain, redness, swelling, and itching) and solicited systemic AEs (fever, headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) using electronic d iaries (eDiaries). In addition, other indicators of safety will be collected (e.g., body temperature). eDiaries will be used for collection of unsolicited AEs on each vaccination day and the following 28 days. Safety assessments for all subjects in Phase 2b and Phase 3: Medically -attended AEs will be collected through 6 months after the second trial vaccination. AESIs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. AESIs to be monitored include potential immune- mediated diseases (pIMDs) AESIs for SARS- CoV-2 vaccines, and non- serious intercurrent medical conditions that may affect the immune response to vaccination. SAEs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. AEs leading to vaccine withdrawal or trial dis continuation will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. Testing for COVID- 19: During the trial , subjects clinically suspected of having COVID -19 disease will undergo testing for the SARS -CoV-2 virus as described below. Sample collection for the tests may be performed at the site or at a home visit by trial staff. Ideally, samples should be collected within 5 days of symptom onset. Subjects with a clinical suspicion of COVID -19 will undergo testing f or SARS -CoV-2 infection using a rapid antigen test performed at the Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 162 site with the results provided to the subject. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be used to collect samples for the rapid antigen test. Regardless of the result of the rapid antigen test, a nasopharyngeal swab sample collected at the same time will be sent to a central laboratory to perform a SARS -CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test. The RT-PCR test re sult will be considered definitive. o If the RT -PCR test is negative, but COVID -19 is still suspected based on the subject's exposure history and clinical presentation, another nasopharyngeal swab sample should be taken as soon as feasible and sent to the central laboratory for RT -PCR testing. The RT -PCR retest result will be considered definitive. o For positive RT -PCR tests performed at the central laboratory, the virus will be sequenced to identify mutations in the S protein and determine viral lineages . COVID- 19 Case Detection and Case Definition for Primary Efficacy Analysis: Case Detection: During all site visits and phone calls, subjects will be reminded to contact the site if they have any one or more of the following symptoms*: o Fever or chills o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o New loss of taste or smell o Cough o Fatigue o Muscle or body aches o Headache o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea *FDA Guidance for Industry, Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19, June 2020. In addition, subjects will be messaged up to twice a week to provide a yes or no respo nse to having COVID -19 symptoms. Those who respond \"yes\" will be contacted by trial staff for follow -up information , if the Investigator considers the symptoms could potentially indicate a COVID -19 case. Based on a phone interview, if the subject is suspec ted of having COVID -19 illness, he/she will undergo RT -PCR testing for SARS- CoV-2 infection as described above. If the subject is confirmed to have COVID -19, all subjects will be followed until resolution of their disease, even if the initial presentation is considered as mild. Information on clinical signs/symptoms and duration, treatments and outcome of the disease will be documented by trial staff and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Definition of Virologically -Confirmed COVID -19 Case: A virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 is defined as a positive SARS -CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 162 disease consisting of one or more of the following symptoms (based on the same screening symptoms as above): o Feve r or chills o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o New loss of taste or smell o Cough o Fatigue o Muscle or body aches o Headache o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea This definition is intended to capture all severities of virologically -confirmed clinically symptomatic cases of COVID -19. As such, different disease severities defined for COVID -19 (e.g., mild or severe disease) will be a subset of these cases. Definition of Virologically -Confirmed COVID -19 Case for Primary Efficacy Analysis: For the primary analysis of efficacy, the case must meet the following criteria: Must be a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 defined as a positive SARS -CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic COVID -19 as described above. Symptom onset must have occurred 15 days following the second trial vaccination. The subject must not have a history of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 illness at enrollment or have developed a case of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 before 15 days following the second trial vaccination. The subject must have been SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve at baseline and Day 43 (defined as seronegative to N protein in the blood samples collected at baseline and Day 43). (Primary efficacy cases must be confirmed by the Adjudication Committee.) Planned Number of Subjects : The total enrollment for the Phase 2b/3 trial will be approxima te ly 36,500 subjects. The target enrollment for each phase of the trial is shown below: 4,000 subjects enrolled in Phase 2b. 32,500 subjects enrolled in Phase 3. Because this is a case- driven design, the final sample size will depend on the actual incidence rate of COVID -19 cases occurring during the trial . As such, during the early stages of enrollment, an unblinded review of the incidence rate of cases will be performed by the DSMB. If the case accrual rate is lower or higher than expected, the DSMB may recommend an adjustment in sample size. If needed, another unblinded review by the DSMB may be performed later in the trial to further adjust the sample size. Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Inclusion criteria for all subjects: Subjects will be enrolled in this trial only if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older. 2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any trial procedures .. 3.

Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 162 Data and Safety Monitoring Board: An independent DSMB will be convened to oversee the safety and efficacy of subjects participating in this trial , to assess the progress and conduct of the trial , to review the cumulative safety data from the trial , and to make recommendations to CureVac whether to continue, modify, or stop the trial . To ensure subject safety on an ongoing basis, a CureVac Safety Review Team reviews the safety data on a weekly basis. The outcome of these reviews and discussions are then shared with the DSMB Chair . In addition to safety data, the DSMB will be asked to review efficacy data at the interim analysis and at other time points during the trial for a continued assessment of the risk -benefit of the trial . As part of the risk -benefit analysis, the DSMB will periodically monitor COVID -19 cases for signals of VDE. The DSMB will also be asked to perform an unblinded review(s) of the incidence rate of COVID - 19 cases to recommend an adjustment (s) in sample size, if needed. The DSMB Charter will describe in detail the composit ion and objectives of the DSMB; the responsibilities of the DSMB, CureVac and the contract research organization (CRO); the schedule and conduct of the DSMB meetings; and the datasets to be reviewed . Sample Size Justification: The total sample size of approximately 36,500 subjects for the combined Phase 2b/3 trial is based on formal statistical power calculations demonstrating the efficacy of CVnCoV . This trial is planned using a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses f or high efficacy or futility using the O'Brien and Fleming error spending function for the primary endpoint of any COVID -19 cases. With an overall 2- sided alpha of 5%, 1 60 cases are needed at the final analysis for COVID -19 cases of any severi ty to reach 90% power to demonstrate that VE is above 30% (based on a margin of 30% for the lower bound of the confidence interval [ CI] for VE), when considering the VE is 60%. The sample size is based on a test for one single proportion. Assuming an incidence rate of COVID -19 of 0.15% per month in placebo subjects; a VE of 60%; an enrollment period of 3 months; and a non- evaluable rate of 20% during the trial which includes ~5% seropositivity of enrollees at baseline (i.e. non- na\u00efve subjects), then 36,500 subjects randomized to receive either CVnCoV or placebo in a 1:1 ratio will achieve the 160 cases at approximately 9 months after the first vaccination. Because this is a case- driven trial design, the final sample size will depend on the actual incidence rate of COVID -19 cases o ccurring during the trial. As such, during the early stages of enrollment, an unblinded review of the incidence rate of cases will be performed by the DSMB. If the case accrual rate is lower or higher than expected, the DSMB may recommend an adjustment in sample size. If needed, another unblinded review by the DSMB may be performed later in the trial to further adjust the sample size. The sample size of ~4,000 subjects for Phase 2b is based on generating a robust and detailed dataset characterizing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to entering Phase 3 and for the early conditional approval submission. Analysis Sets: The main analysis populations are: Safety Analysis Set (SAS) The SAS will include all randomized subjects in Phase 2b or 3 who received at least one dose of CVnCoV or placebo. The SAS will be the primary population for the safety endpoints collected on all subjects and for the objectives evaluating efficacy after t he first dose. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 162 Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) The EAS will include all subjects randomized in Phase 2b and Phase 3 who: Received both doses of trial vaccine according to the randomization (2 doses of CVnCoV or 2 doses of placebo). Had not developed a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 before trial entry (based on Exclusion Criteria 1) or before 15 days following the second trial vaccination. Had not stopped the trial before 15 days following the second trial vaccination. Were SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve at baseline and Day 43 (based on seronegativity to N protein in the blood sample taken at baseline). The EAS will be the main analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoin t and for the appropriate secondary efficacy endpoints. Per Protocol Efficacy Set (PPE) The PPE set will include EAS subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at trial entry and who have no major protocol deviations that would impact the efficacy outcomes as specified in the statistical analysis plan. The PPE will be a supportive population for the primary and appropriate secondary efficacy endpoints. Statistical Methodology: Missing Data/Discontinuation: For SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein antibodies, concentration values marked as below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to 0.5*LLOQ for the purpose of geometric mean titer (GMT) computation. No imputation of missing values will be performed for any analysis (exce pt the imputation for missing partial dates of AEs and concomitant medication). Currently no replacement of drop- out subjects is foreseen. Statistical Analyses: Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics: Data will be summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics, medical history, immune response measurements, and all safety measurements using descriptive statistics (quantitative data) and contingency tables (qualitative data) overall, by vaccine g roup, and by age group and vaccine group. Efficacy Analyses: In the primary efficacy analysis, VE, defined as the percent reduction in the frequency of any COVID -19 cases (according to the primary case definitions) in vaccinated subjects compared with subjects who received placebo will be calculated with exact 95%* CI as follows: VE = 1 - RR = 1 - (ARV/ARP) = 1 - {p / r (1 -p)} where ARV = attack rate in vaccinated group = nv/Nv = number of subjects reporting at least 1 COVID -19 episode in the CVnCoV group / total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the CVnCoV group (number of person -month) ARP = attack rate in placebo group = np/Np = number of subjects reporting at least 1 COVID -19 episode in the placebo group / total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the placebo group (number of person -month) RR = relative risk = ARV/ARP Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 162 p = proportion of COVID -19 cases (according to primary case definition) coming from the CVnCoV group among all cases = nv/(nv+np) r = ratio of total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the CVnCoV group over total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the placebo group = Nv/Np * Level of CI may be slightly adjusted due to the sequential design (see Section 10.3.8 ). The statistical hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint is: H0A: VE 30% versus H 1A: VE > 30% A is related to COVID -19 cases of any severity The trial will be successful if the lower limit (LL) of the exact 2- sided 9 5% (to be slightly adjusted to consider the sequential design) CI of the VE endpoint of all COVID -19 cases of any severity is > 30% for H 0A o r if the exact 2- sided 9 5% (to be slightly ad justed to consider the sequential design) CI of the VE endpoint of moderate to severe COVID -19 cases is > 20%. If the interim analyses and the final analysis are performed after 56/111 and 160 cases meeting the primary efficacy case definition have been reported, respectively, the 1- sided -risk to consider at time of final analysis according to O'Brien- Fleming type error -spending- function will be 0.02281. Efficacy will be demonstrated at the final analysis if 53 cases or less of the total 160 are in the CVnCoV group and if the follow -up time of evaluable subjects is equal in both groups (Nv=Np). At the first interim analysis, early high efficacy would be demonstrated if 9 cases or less of the 56 cases are in t he CVnCoV group (observed efficacy 80.9%); conversely, futility would be reached if 25 cases or more are in the CVnCoV group if Nv=Np. At the second interim analysis, early high efficacy will be demonstrated if 32 cases or less of the 111 cases are in the CVnCoV group (observed ef f icacy 59.5%); conversely, futility would be reached if 40 cases or more are in the CVnCoV group if Nv=Np. For the key secondary endpoint s, no interim analysis is planned. Ho wever descriptive statistic as VE and 95% CI will be presented. As a sensitivity analysis, the time to first -occurrence of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 cases (meeting the primary ef ficacy case definition) will also be analyzed. Kaplan- Meier curves will be displayed. Statistical testing of the 4 key secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed according to the conditional hierarchical testing procedure using the order defined in the objectives and endpoints sections. Consequently: Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to moderate and severe cases will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary ef f icacy objective . Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to severe cases will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective and the key secondary objective on moderate and severe cases. Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to (RT -PCR positive) cases of \"wild type\" (i.e., B.1.429) and \"UK\" (B.1.1.7) will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 162 and the key secondary objectives on moderate and sever e cases and severe cases . Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to asymptomatic infection (seroconversion to the N protein of the virus) will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective and the key secondary objective on m oderate and severe cases and the key secondary objectives on severe cases and on \"wild type\" (i.e., WT/D614G lineages these endpoints will be analyzed as secondary endpoints without success criteria testing. To assess the efficacy in the prevention of severe COVID -19 disease and asymptomatic infections , similar analyses to the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed. Efficacy will be demonstrated if the LL of the exact 2-sided 95% CI of the VE endpoint is > 10% for prevention of severe disease and > 0% for prevention of asympt omatic infections. Interim Analysis: Unblinded interim analyses for high efficacy, futility and for safety will be reviewed by the DSMB when 56/111 cases meeting the primary efficacy case definition have been reached. The safety and immunogenicity analyses will be performed overall and, for specified subsets, by baseline serology status for SARS -CoV-2. Safety Analyses - Solicited AEs: The frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each solicited local and systemic AE within 7 days after each vaccination will be presented by intensity and overall. The results will be tabulated by vaccine group and age groups. For subjects with more than 1 episode of the same AE within 7 days after a vaccination, the maximum intensity will be used for tabulations. Safety Analyses - Unsolicited AEs: Unsolicited AEs including SAEs and AESIs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). The frequency and percentage of subjects repor ting each unsolicited AE within the 28 days after each vaccination and overall will be tabulated at the SOC and PT levels. Additional similar tabulations will be performed to evaluate severity and relationship to trial vaccine. Immunogenicity Analysis: Descriptive statistics for the immunogenicity endpoints will be provided by vaccine group and overall, and by vaccine group and age groups . Geometric mean titers (GMT), Fold Change (FC) from baseline, Geometric mean of FC (GMFC) with their 95% CI will be computed for SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein antibody levels and for neutralizing antibodies, overall and separately in subjects seronegative at baseline and in subjects seropositive at baseline . For each readout, seroconversion rates will also be sum marized at each blood sampling time point in subjects who are SARS -CoV-2 seronegative at baseline.

The composed of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is buried inside phospholipid bilayers a nd covered by spike (S) proteins [ 2]. The membrane (M) protein (a type III transmembrane glycoprotein) and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope. CoVs were given their name based on a characteristic crown- like appearance. There are 4 Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most CoVs and CoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most CoVs and CoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens, causing generally -mild acute respiratory illnesses known as the common cold [ 4]. Prior to December 2019, when clusters of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology were detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Provinc e, China, only 2 additional strains of CoVs had caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory disease in humans: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS -CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). On 9 January 2020, a novel CoV, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2), was officially identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan. In the following weeks, the virus sprea d rapidly within China and an increasing number of count ries worldwide. On 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak under International Health Regulations as a public health emergency of international concern (the WHO's highest level of alarm) and on 12 March 2020, the WHO announced the outbreak as a pandemic. SARS- CoV-2 falls into the genus CoV, which includes CoVs discovered in humans, ba ts and other wild animals (SARS -CoV, bat SARS- like CoV, and others). Similar to other CoVs, the SARS -CoV-2 genome contains 2 flanking untra nslated regions and a single long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein [ 3]. The SARS- CoV-2 genome proteins [S -E-M-N]3' and lacks the hemagglutinin- esterase gene which is characteristically found in lineage A CoVs, as illustrated in Figure 1. High sequence similarity (> 99%) has been reported following analysis of virus isolates from patients with SARS -CoV-2 infection [ 5-8]. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 of 162 Figure 1 Genome Organization of SARS -CoV-2 Compared with Other Betacoronaviruses Source: Chan et al. , 2020 [ 3] The S gene of SARS -CoV-2 appears to be highly divergent to other CoVs, with les s tha n 75% nucleotide sequence identity to all previously described SARS -CoVs, except a 93.1% nucleotide identity to RaTG13 [ 6]. The S genes of SARS -CoV-2 and RaTG13 S gene are longer than other SARS -CoVs. The major differences in SARS -CoV-2 are 3 short insertions in the N -terminal domain, and 4/5 key residues changes in the receptor -binding motif, in comparison with SARS -CoV. At the amino acid sequence level, the S glycoprotein of SARS- CoV-2 was found to have 76.3% identity and 87.3% similarity with the S glycoprotein of SARS -CoV [ 9]. The S2 subunit of SARS -CoV-2 was found to be highly conserved, sharing 99% sequence identity with those of the 2 bat SARS -like CoVs (SL -CoV ZXC21 subunit of SARS -CoV-2 shares around 70% identity to that of the 2 bat SARS- like CoVs and human SARS -CoV. The domain of the receptor -binding doma in (RBD) (excluding the external subdomain) is highly conserved, but the external subdoma in of the SARS -CoV-2 RBD (which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor) shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS -related CoVs . Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 162 To date, there is no information available on the immune responses to SARS -CoV-2. An immunoinformatics approach predicted 5 cytotoxic T lymphocyte 3 B cell epitopes 5 B cell epitopes in the S glycoprotein [ 9]. Simulations suggested that the CTL epitopes bind the major histocompatibility complex class I peptide- binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds a nd salt bridge anchors, supporting their potential in generating immune responses. Of note, the simulations found only one overlapping CTL epitope between MERS -CoV and SARS- CoV-2 -19 D isease SARS- CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through close contact and respiratory droplets. The mean incubation period is 4- 6 days with about 95% of patients developing symptoms within 14 days after infection [ 10,11]. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disea se 2019 (COVID -19) include fever, c ough, dyspnea, and occasionally watery diarrhea. In an analysis of >1000 hospitalized patients from China, 44% initially presented with fever (although 89% developed fever at some point during hospitalization) and 68% with cough. Other symptoms included fa tigue (23%), myalgia (15%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (8%) [ 11]. As with other systemic viral infections, a large spectrum of possible clinical manifestations are being reported in COVID -19 patients, including neurological symptoms and signs, cardiac disease, and cutaneous lesions [ 12-15]. Chemosensory dysfunction, such as anosmia and dysgeusia, are increasingly reported. Data from more than 72,000 patients from China classified cases as mild (including mild pneumonia, 81%), severe (14%) or critical (5%) [ 16]. Severe and critical cases presented with severe pneumonia, septic shock and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The critically ill patients requiring intensive care management present a large spectrum of complications in addition to ARDS, such as acute cardiac injury, acute renal injury, acro-ischemia, disseminated intrava scular complications, bacterial or funga l superinfections [ 17,18]. In early stages of the outbreak, the reported case- fatality rate in China was 17% [ 19]. In admitted patients in Wuhan, mortali ty reached 25% in the middle of the epidemic. Similarly high death rates are recorded in those requiring intensive care: in a large retrospective cases series on COVID -19 confirmed patients admitted to intensive care units (Lombardy, Italy), mortality reac hed 26% [ 20]. The global mortality rate is estimated to be around 3% [21]. According to the 2020 World Health Statistics, the COVID -19 pandemic is causing significant loss of life, disrupting livelihoods, and threatening the recent advances in health and progress t owards global sustainable development goals [ 22]. On 08 November 2020, according to WHO, >50 million cases have been confirmed globally, including 1.2 5 million deaths. 3.1.3 Development of CVnCoV Despite the severity of respiratory disease caused by emerging CoVs, there is currently no fully licensed vaccine for prevention of CoV -associated disease on the market and those which received a conditional approval are still very limited and not yet availa ble for the majority of the society. CureVac AG is developing a new SARS -CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine formulated with lipid nanoparticles (LNP), referred to a s Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 of 162 CVnCoV, for the prevention of COVID -19 disease when administered as a 2- dose primary vaccination schedule. CVnCoV is an mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine in which the mRNA is protected and delivered by encapsulation within LNPs. CVnCoV has been developed with CureVac's proprietary RNActive\u00ae technology platform, which uses chemically unm odified mRNA molecules as the basis for vaccination. The mRNA encodes the stabilized full -length S protein from the SARS -CoV-2 virus. Following intramuscular injection of CVnCoV, the S protein is translated from the mRNA stimulating an antigen- specific hum oral and cellular immune response to the S protein. Importantly, functional viral neutralizing titers (VNTs) and T -cell mediated immunity are induced following vaccination with CVnCoV. Phase 1 and 2a trials are generating initial data on the safety, reac togenicity and immunogenicity of CVnCoV administered to adults 18 years of age and older. Available data from these trials are provided in the Investigator's Brochure. 3.1.4 Trial Rationale The present Trial HERALD Trial CV-NCOV -004 is designed as a Phase 2b/3 pivotal efficacy and safety trial in adults 18 years of age and ol der. The trial will be conducted a s a randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled trial. Subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites globally and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rec eive a 2- dose schedule of either CVnCoV at a dose level of 12 \u00b5g or plac ebo {normal saline (0.9% NaCl) for injection } as the control. The objective of the Phase 2b part of the trial is to further characterize the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of CVnCoV in the intended trial population of adults, 18 years of age and older, at the dose level selected for Phase 3 investigation. The design of Phase 2b is consistent with the Phase 3 efficacy part of the trial, allowing cases of COVID -19 that occur i n Phase 2b to be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of vaccine efficacy (VE), thereby increasing the efficiency of the overall Phase 2b/3 trial. Combining COVID -19 cases in Phase 2b and 3 to expedite an effica cy outcome was considered to be justified in a pandemic setting. The detailed reactogenicity and immunogenicity data generated in Phase 2b will be the main dataset to be submitted in support of early conditional a pproval of CVnCoV. The primary objective of the combined P hase 2b/3 trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-dose schedule of CVnCoV in the prevention of COVID -19 cases of any severity. Due to the uncertain incidence rate of COVID -19 cases in a pandemic sett ing, the trial will be conducted as a case- driven trial based on the any severity COVID -19 endpoint due to the higher number of cases required, which will include 2 interim analys es and a final analysis both triggered by achieving a predefined number of cases for each analysis. The safety objective of the trial is to generate a large- scale safety databas e that will demonstrate the safety of CVnCoV across the adult age groups of 18 to 60 and 61 years of age. Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure for details on the RNActive \u00ae technology and information regarding the non- clinical and clinical trials of the investigational CVnCoV vaccine. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 of 162 3.2 Risk/Benefit Assessment 3.2.1 Known Potential Risks Non-clinical studies show that CVnCoV is well- tolerated in relevant animal species with no identified safety risks. As with every vaccination and based on previous clinical experience with the rabies and CVnCoV mRNA vaccines, local reactions, i.e., pain, redness, itching and swelling at the injection site, and systemic adverse events (AEs), i.e., fever, headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nause a/vomiting and diarrhea, are expected side effects that typically resolve within 24 hours after the vaccination with or without treatment with antipyretics [23-26]. After administration of CureVac's mRNA investigational rabies vaccine formulated with LNP (CV7202), in addition to the systemic AEs described above, a few subjects experienced decreased appetite, night sweats, and tachycardia. Strictly transient lymphopenia was observed 1 day after administrati on of CV7202 (1 \u00b5g and 2 \u00b5g dosages), but not 2 days after administration (5 \u00b5g dosage). This is thought to represent lymphocyte redistribution related to the mode of action and is not considered to be a risk factor, and overall not considered clinically r elevant. As of October 2020, dose levels of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 \u00b5g have been administered to > 250 subjects in Trial CV-NCOV -001. The rate and severity of solicited AEs did not limit dose escalation or dose expansion in this trial. A total of 17 subjects did not receive the second dose administration at this time. Nine subjects were unable t o attend the visit, 4 of them because of an unrelated concurrent AE. Four subjects discontinued participation in the trial before Day 29, and 4 subjects did not r eceive the second dose administration because of an AE following the first dose administration. The majority of solicited AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and transient in nature, generally resolving to normal within 48 hours. Grade 3 solicited AEs were reported at all dose levels, consistently at a higher rate in the younger age category (18 to 40 years) as compared to the older age category (41 to 60 years). The most commonly reported investigational medicinal product (IMP )-related unsolicited AEs were: Dizziness/lightheadedness/vertigo: 19 subjects Hyper/hypo/paresthesia: 6 subjects Fatigue, sore throat, dysgeusia, palpitations: 13 subjects Abdominal pain, tachycardia, malaise, neck pain: 15 subjects Chest pain and circulatory problems: 3 subjects Individual Grade 3 unsolicited AEs considered as IMP -related by the Investigator were reported for no more than 1 subject each, except for dizziness and fatigue, reported for 2 subjects each (fatigue both reported at the 2 \u00b5g dose level, and dizziness reported for 1 subject at 8 \u00b5g and 1 subject at 12 \u00b5g). Potential allergic reactions have been reported for 2 subjects: 1 potential allergic reaction presented as a case of Grade 1 macular rash that resolved spontaneously within a few hours and was not accompanied by additional systemic signs of allergic reaction ; and 1 case of Grade 1 urticaria occurring approximately 25 hours after the first dose administration. The urticaria disappeared the next morning and was initially attributed to the use of sunscreen and/or paracetamol. After the second dose administration, the subject developed a rash 16 hours after vaccination and was accompanied by lip swelling, eye lid swelling and hoarseness. T here was no shortness of Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of 162 breath. The subject had palpitations overnight but did not have any episodes of feeling dizzy or lightheaded. Reported AEs were urticaria Grade 1, wheals, mucous membrane swelling, and palpitations Grade 2, and allergic reaction Gr ade 3. The symptoms resolved with betamethasone cream and cet irizine, with resolution after 2 days. No related serious adverse event (SAEs) have been reported. As for every vaccine, the occurrence of allergic/anaphylactic reactions cannot be excluded and emergency equipment for the treatment of such reactions must be available at the trial site. These events are unexpected and constitute a potential important medical risk. All subjects will be closely observed on site for at least 30 minutes after administr ation of each vaccine dose. Vaccine -dependent Disease Enhancement (VDE) describes a phenomenon in which pre-existing immunity is not enough to neutralize viral infection and may lead to severe disease progression. The risk of antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE), and more generally VDE, by CVnCoV is considered low. The factors that are postulated to contribute to VDE (based on observations in animal studies for SARS or MERS) are the use of inactivated virus, recombinant wild- type non- stabilized S protein, nucleoprotein vaccines, alum, or other adjuvants inducing a Th2 bias; by design these factors are not applicable to CVnCoV. The design rationale for the stabilized pre -fusion S protein in CVnCoV was also based on the strategy used for MERS -CoV [ 27] and has been shown to lead to a better ratio of functional (VNT) to binding antibodies {enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ) titers } for eliciting a mor e protective immune response. Based on its design and mode- of-action, it is expected that CVnCoV, an mRNA vaccine candidate expressing pre-fusion stabilized full -length S protein, is unlikely to induce VDE. Furthermore, CVnCoV is inducing a balanced immune response, as observed in non- clinical studies and documented in the Investigator's Brochure, and previous evidence that RNA vaccines are triggering TLR -stimulation (TLR7) resulting in type I interferon (IFN) induction 28]. Indeed, current pharmacology data with CVnCoV indicate induction of type I IFN with no interleukin (IL)-4 and IL- 13 or very low IL- 5 induction of cytokines indicative of a Th2 response. Th2 response has been shown to be associated with enhanced disease in animal models (refer to Section 4.1.2 of the Investigator's Brochure, in vivo Pharmacology Studies) [ 29]. While the VDE risk to subjects vaccinated with CVnCoV are considered minimal, nevertheless, the potential risk for VDE is evaluated in Trials CV -NCOV -001 a nd CV-NCOV -002. As part of the clinical assessment in this trial, neutralizing antibodies are determined and the induction of Th1 response is investigated by cellular immunomonitoring with the specific aim to assess the risk of VDE prior to enrolling a larger number of subjects into Phase 2b/3 clinical trials. Participa nts who experience COVID -19 disease during the trial are to be followed closely to ensure clinical symptoms and safety data are collected and disease progression is monitored and reported. Furthermore, CureVac is consulting with external regulatory and sc ientific experts to help identify the best animal models to evaluate the theoretical risk of VDE. To that end, animal models that best recapitulate human disease have been chosen, inclusive of hamster a nd non-human primate challenge studies and are being evaluated, as recommended by Wang and colleagues [ 30]. These approaches are in line with those agreed upon for Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 162 COVID -19 vaccine development by the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities [ 31]. Based on this information, the non- clinical data package and measures to minimize potential VDE risk for human subjects were considered sufficient to conduct trials in humans. In this Phase 2b/3 trial, cases of COVID -19 will be reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for potential VDE. The DSMB will periodically review cases throughout the trial as defined by the DSMB Charter. Developmental toxicity studies have not been performed for CVnCoV. No histopathological alterations in the reproductive organs were identified in the local tolerance or repeat -dose t oxicology studies in rat or rabbit, and toxicologically relevant levels of RNA were not detected in reproductive organs in the biodistribution study. Therefore, the teratogenicity risk is deemed low. However, given that human data on pregnancies is not yet available, the teratogenic risk associated with CVnCoV administration cannot be ruled out at this moment. For this reason, inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires use of a highly effective contraceptive measure from 2 weeks before the first administration of the trial vaccine until 3 months following the last administration. Due to the theoretical possibility of non- specific immune stimulating properties of CVnCoV, it cannot be excluded that pre- existing potential immune- mediated diseases (pIMDs) ma y be aggravated, become clinically apparent for the first time or triggered after vaccination with CVnCoV. Such reactions have been very rarely described after administration of other vaccines but the causal relationship between va ccination and the induction or aggravation of pIMDs is uncertain and is therefore a theoretical risk. These events are considered unexpected for CVnCoV. In addition, a list of AEs of special interest (AESIs) to be monitored following administration of investigational SARS -CoV-2 vaccines has been identified by the Brighton Collaboration Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) Project. If any suspected AESI (pIMD or other AE specific to SARS -CoV-2 vaccines, but not COVID -19) should occur in a subject w ho received CVnCoV, a diagnostic workup should be performed by a specialist depending on the type of suspected reaction (e.g., endocrinologist for suspected autoimmune thyroiditis) and this condition will be monitored and documented throughout the trial. CVnCoV has not been investigated in combination with other drugs or vaccines. Given the mechanism of action which relies on building up an adequate immune response, it is expected that immunosuppressive drugs like steroids may inhibit the desired pharmacol ogical effect of the induction of a specific immune response against the SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein. Similarly, drugs that enhance the immune response like certain cytokines (IFN -, IL-2) may increase the response to the vaccines which could theoretically result in increased efficacy, but also in an increased risk of toxicity. Risks from phlebotomy are well known and minimal. Venipuncture is a routine procedure the medical community commonly uses to obtain blood samples. Immediate complications may include slight pain during puncture of the skin and, rarely, dizziness and syncope. Additionally, a hematoma may result from the venipuncture, but this has minimal risk. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 162 Infection of the skin/soft tissue at the puncture site, vein, or blood stream can occur, but are very rare with venous blood draws. Subject monitoring and aseptic techniques, such as using sterile disposable blood collection apparatuses and adhering to standard medical precautions, reduce any risk to a minimum. The amount of blood to be taken for sampling will not be harmful to the subject's health. 3.2.2 Known Potential Benefits Subjects receiving the investigational CVnCoV vaccine may not directly benefit from this vaccination as it is not known if CVnCoV is effective in protecting against COVID -19 disease. Subjects receiving saline placebo will not directly benefit from trial vaccination. Trial subjects will receive the following benefits: Subjects participating in this trial may benefit from having regular health checks as part of the trial procedures (e.g., physical examination, vital signs assessment). Where illnesses are newly diagnosed, a referral will be made for the subject to an appropria te health provider. If CVnCoV is found to be efficacious and meets regulatory approval, subjects in th e placebo group may be offered CVnCoV as soon as feasible. If CVnCoV is found to be efficacious, then subjects will have made a significant public health contribution. 3.2.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits To minimize the risk for subjects participating in this trial, an independent DSMB will oversee the safety of the participating subjects throughout the trial (see Section 9.3.8.1 ). Potential important medical risks associated with CVnCoV, as specified in Section 3.2.1 , can be managed should they occur.

Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 will be conducted as randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled trials. Subjects 18 years of age or older will be enrolled at multiple sites globally and will receive a 2 -dose schedule of either CVnCoV a t a dose level of 12 \u00b5g mRNA or placebo {normal saline (0.9% NaCl) } in a 1:1 ratio. Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial are consistent in design (e.g. , for COVID -19 ca se ascertainment and case defi nition) so that cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2b can be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of VE. Following completion of Trial CV -NCOV -004 on Day 393, all subjects (both Phase 2b and 3) will be asked to continue in a separate 1- year extension (Trial CV-NCOV -004Ext ). Phase 2b Design and Objectives (See Table 1 and Table 2 for the Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures) The objective of Phase 2b is to further characterize the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to initiating Phase 3. CVnCoV will be administered at the 12 \u00b5g dose level selected for Phase 3 investigation informed by the safety and immunogenicity data from the initial Phase 1 and 2a trials. Phase 2b will be conducted in 2 age groups of adults: 18 to 60 and 61 years of age, which represent the age range of the intended Phase 3 trial population. Approximately 4,000 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of either CVnCoV at a dose level of 12 \u00b5g mRNA or placebo, administered 28 days apart (see Figure 2). Of the 4,000 subjects enrolled, approxima tely 800 to 1,000 (20% to 25%) will be 61 years of age. Phase 2b will be performed in an observer -blinded manner to reduce any potential bias in the safety assessments. The sample size of 4,000 subjects is based on generating a robust and detailed dataset characterizing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to entering Phase 3. Furthermore, the data generated in Phase 2b will be the main dataset to be submitted in support of early conditional approval of CVnCoV. In Phase 2b, the safety and reactogenicity of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV will be assessed in detail by measuring the frequency and severity of the following AEs: solicited local and systemic reactions for 7 days after each vaccination; unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each vaccination; medically -attended AEs through 6 months after the second trial vaccination; and AESIs and SAEs through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. The immunogenicity of CVnCoV will be evaluated after 1 and 2 doses in a subset of subj ects (first 600 subjects enrolled in each of the 2 age groups; a total of 1,200 subjects in the Immunogenicity Subset) by measuring binding antibodies to the SARS -CoV-2 RBD of S protein and viral neutralizing antibodies. Antibody persistence will also be evaluated in this trial. Cases of COVID- 19 occurring in Phase 2b subjects will be collected and pooled with those occurring in Phase 3 and the total number of cases will be used for the primary analysis Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 162 of efficacy. In addition, the DSMB will periodically m onitor COVID -19 cases for signals of VDE. Subjects participating in Phase 2b will also be evaluated for asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection during the trial, as measured by the development of antibodies to the N protein of SARS- CoV-2 (i.e. seroconversion). These data will be combined with those from Phase 3 to determine if vaccination with CVnCoV can prevent or reduce the rate of asymptomatic infection by SARS -CoV-2 (one of the key secondary efficacy objectives). Initiation of subject enrollment of the 2 tar get age groups into Phase 2b will be flexible. Depending on the timing of data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2a trials, enrollment of the 2 age groups into Phase 2b may be staggered, initially starting with subjects 18 to 60 years of age followed by subjects 61 years of age. As the older age group will comprise 20% to 25% of the total number of subjects in Phase 2b, this staggered start is not expected to impact overall enrollment of the Phase 2b cohort. An early safety review of the Phase 2b data will be performed by the DSMB (see Section 9.3.8.1 ). The safety review will be conducted when approximately 1,000 subjects have been enrolled in Phase 2b (25% of subjects enrolled; 500 recipients of CVnCoV a nd 500 recipients of placebo) and ha ve at least 1 week of safety follow -up after the first tr ial vaccination. If the safety profile is judged to be acceptable and there are no safety or tolerability concerns, it is anticipated that enrollment of subjects into Phase 3 can begin without interr uption from Phase 2b. Another safety review by the DSMB will be conducted when approximately 1,000 Phase 2b subjects have received their second trial vaccination and have at least 1 week of safety follow -up. All available first dose safety data from the Phase 2b subjects will also be reviewed at this time. Phase 3 Design and Objectives (See Table 3 for Schedule of Assessments and Procedures) The primary objective of the combined Phase 2b/ 3 trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of a 2-dose schedule of CVnCoV in the prevention of COVID -19 cases of a ny severity . Similar to Phase 2b, Phase 3 will be conducted as a randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled trial. Approximately 32,500 subjects, 18 years of age or older, will be enrolled at multiple sites globally in Phase 3 and will receive a 2- dose schedule of either CVnCoV at the 12 \u00b5g dose level or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (see Figure 2). Similar to Phase 2b, enrollment will target subjects 61 years of age to be approximately 20% to 25% of the Phase 3 trial population (6,500 to 8,125 subjects). The total enrollment of the combined Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial will be 36,500 subjects. Subjects will undergo active surveillance for COVID -19 (see Appendix 6). During all site visits and phone calls, subjects will be reminded to contact the site if they have an acute illness with any symptoms clinically consistent with COVID- 19. In addition, subjects will be messaged up to twice a week and will provide a yes or no response to having C OVID -19 symptoms. Those who respond \"yes\" will be contacted by trial staff for a follow -up interview and assessment , if the Investigator considers the symptoms could potentially indicate a COVID- 19 case . If a subject is suspected of having COVID -19 illness, he/she will undergo testing for SARS -CoV-2 infection with samples collected at the site or at a home visit. If the subject is confirmed to have COVID -19, all subjects will be followed until resolution of their disease. If the subject is hospitalized, the subject's progress must Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 of 162 continue to be followed by the Investigator and a discharge summary obtained at the end of the hospitalization. Information on clinical symptoms and signs, their duration and severity, and treatment and outcome of the COVID -19 episode will be documented by trial staff and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Upon resolution, subjects will continue to be followed through the trial end in the same manner as those who have not presented with COVID -19. A second episode of COVID -19 in a subject with prior disease will not be counted as a primary efficacy case, but will be counted for the exploratory objective assessing the reoccurrence of COVID -19 in vaccinated subjects. Due to the uncertain incidence rate of COVID -19 cases in a pandemic setting, the trial will be conducted as a case- driven trial based on the any severity COVID -19 endpoint , which will include a two interim analys es and a final analysis both triggered by achieving a predefined number of cases for each analysis. As described above, cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2b will be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of VE. As such, subjects participating in Phase 2b will contribute to the t otal sample size for the primary analysis of VE (N=36,500). For the primary analysis of efficacy, the case must meet the following criteria (modera te and severe COVID -19 disease is defined in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4): Must be a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 defined as a positive SARS- CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic COVID- 19 (see Section 9.2 ). Symptom onset must have occurred 15 days following the second trial vaccination. The subject must not have a history of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 at enrollment (based on exclusion criterion 1) or have developed a case of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 before 15 days following the second trial vaccination {see Section 10.2.3 , Efficacy Analysis Set ( EAS) population for more details }. The subject must have been demonstrated to be SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve at baseline and at Day 43 (ser onegative to N protein). Primary efficacy cases must be confirmed by the Adjudication Committee. This trial will utilize a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses for high efficacy or futility using the O'Brien and Fleming error spending function for the primary endpoint of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 cases of any severity . With an overall 2- sided alpha of 5% and a total of 160 COVID -19 cases of any severity meeting the primary efficacy case definition at the final analysis, the trial will have an overall power of 90% to demonstrate a VE greater than 30% { based on a margin of 30% for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval ( CI) for VE} when considering VE is 60%. Two interim analyses of high efficacy or futility will be performed once 56/111 cases meeting the primary case definition have been accrued and adjudicated (35%/69% of final case number). These points were chosen ba sed on 2 criteria: i) the robustness of 56/111 cases to support the decision of high efficacy or futility and ii) if high efficacy, this would shorten the duration of the trial and potentially allow the vaccine to be ava ilable earlier. Assuming an incidence rate of COVID -19 of 0.15% per month (1.5 cases/1000/month) in placebo subjects; a VE of 60%; and a non- evaluable rate of 20% during the trial which includes ~5% seropositivity of enrollees at baseline (i.e. non- na\u00efve subjects), follow -up of Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 of 162 36,500 subjects enrolled over 3 months (18,250 per vaccine group) will accrue the target 160 COVID -19 cases of any severity approximately 9 months after t he first vaccination. During the early stages of enrollment, an unblinded review of the inci dence rate of cases will be performed by the DSMB. If the case accrual rate is lower or higher than expected, the DSMB may recommend an adjustment in sample size. If needed, another unblinded review by the DSMB may be performed later in the trial to further adjust the sample size. The trial events are shown in the timeline below. Enrollment Period 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 With an equal follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the CVnCoV and placebo groups, efficacy would be demonstrated at the final analysis if 53 cases or less of 1 60 total cases of COVID -19 are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE 50.5%). Two interim analyses for high efficacy or futility will be performed when 56/111 cases meeting the primary case definition have been accrued and adjudicated (approximately 5/6.5 months after trial start). If the follow -up time of evaluable subjects is equal in both groups, early high efficacy would be demonstrated if 9/32 cases or less of t he 56/111 cases are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE at interim 80.9%/59.5%); conversely, futility would be reached if 25 /40 cases or more are in the CVnCoV group (estimated VE at interim 19.4%/ 43.7%). The assessment of the interim analyses will be performed by the DSMB and the outcome will be communicated without unblinding the Trial Team or the Sponsor. Similar to Phase 2b, subjects participating in Phase 3 will be evaluated for SARS -CoV-2 infection during the trial , as measured by the development of antibodies to the N protein of SARS- CoV-2 in seronegative subjects. The safety objective of Phase 3 is to generate a large -scale safety database that will demonstrate the safety of CVnCoV. All subjects participating in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial will have medically -attended AEs collected for 6 months after the second vaccination; and AESIs (see Appendix 9 and Appendix 10) and SAEs collected for 1 yea r after the second vaccination. Independent of the demonstration of CVnCoV efficacy at either of the interim analyses or at the final analysis, the trial will continue and remain observer -blinded until the end of the trial {when the last subject has completed the last visit on Day 393 (see Section 5.4)} (except for subjects who request to be unblinded as they become eligible to receive a n Months Study Start Final Analysis at 160 Cases Enrollment Completed N=36,500 Study Timeline - HERALD Trial CV -NCOV -004 Potential Sample Size Adjustment by DSMB Interim Analysis 1 at 56 cases Interim Analysis 2 at 111 cases Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 CureVac AG COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 162 authorized/ licensed vaccine ).

HERALD Trial CV -NCOV -004 will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial Phase 2b tr ial followed by a large Phase 3 efficacy trial. Both Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts of the trial are consistent in design, so that cases of COVID -19 occurring in Phase 2 can be pooled with those in Phase 3 for the primary analysis of VE. Combining COVID -19 case s in Phase 2 and 3 to expedite an efficacy outcome was considered warranted in a pandemic setting. Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 will be randomized, observer -blinded, and placebo- controlled. The difference in appearance and presentation of the investigational CVnCoV vaccine and placebo requires the trial to be conducted in an observer -blinded manner, which is a commonly used and well -accepted method for trial blinding. The randomized, observer -blinded, and placebo- controlled design will reduce the risk of bias in the safety and efficacy outcomes of the trial (see also Section 7.3 ). As the elderly are affected most by SARS -CoV-2 and have a high risk for severe disea se and mortality, it is critical to investigate CVnCoV in this population and therefore subjects 61 years of age will be included. The sample size of 4,000 subjects in Phase 2b is based on generating a robust and detailed dataset characterizing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CVnCoV prior to entering Phase 3. Furthermore, the data generated in Phase 2b will be the main dataset to be submitted in support of early conditional approval of CVnCoV. The total sample si ze of 36,500 subjects for the combined Phase 2b/3 trial is based on demonstrating VE above 30% (based on a margin of 30% for the lower bound of the 9 5% CI for VE) when considering VE is 60%. With a 2- sided alpha of 5% and a total of 160 COVID -19 case s, the trial will have a 90% power to demonstrate a VE above 30%. Assuming an incidence rate of COVID -19 of 0.15% per month in control subjects; and a non-evaluable rate of 20% during the trial which includes 5% seropositivity of enrollees a t baseline (i.e. non- na\u00efve subjects), follow -up of 36,500 subjects enrolled over 3 months (18,250 per vaccine group) will accrue the target 160 COVID -19 cases approximately 9 months after t he first vaccination. For the primary analys is of efficacy, COVID -19 case ascertainment begins at 15 days following the second vaccination of CVnCoV. This time point allows the immune response to mature and reach its full height following the second dose. As such, case ascertainment starting at thi s time point represents the evaluation of full VE of CVnCoV against COVID -19. The safety objective of Phase 3 is to generate a large- scale safety database that will demonstrate the safety of CVnCoV. All subjects participating in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 parts of the trial will have medically -attended AEs collected for 6 months after the second vaccination; and AESIs and SAEs collected for 1 year after the second vaccination. As such, each subject will participate in the trial for approximately 13.5 months for the safety follow- up. Individuals with history of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 illness will be excluded from participating in this trial. However, this trial will not screen for or exclude participants with history or laboratory evidence of prior S ARS- CoV-2 infection, many of which might have Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 162 been asymptomatic. Because pre- vaccination screening for prior infection is unlikely to occur in practice, it is important to understand vaccine safety and COVID -19 outcomes in in individuals with prior infecti on with SARS -CoV-2 virus. CMI will be evaluated in approximately 200 subjects: 100 who receive CVnCoV and 100 who receive placebo. The goals of this are to identify immunolog ical biomarkers to ident ify vaccine responders and people having a better immune response to CVnCoV, to better understand the biology of the immune response to CVnCoV, and to investigate the duration of the immune response to CVnCoV. Analysis of immunologically relevant genomic biomarkers will be limited to DNA s equencing of the subject's T -cell receptor and human leukocyte antigen type. The purpose is not to test for any genetic disorders or to identify predisposition to any disease. 5.3 Justification for Dose Selection of the 12 \u00b5g mRNA dose level of CVnCOV for this trial was based on the safety, tolerability , and immunogenicity results from Trial CV -NCOV Trial CV-NCOV -001, a dose of 12 \u00b5g elicited the same immune response as that seen in patients who are recovering from having been infected with the real virus. Refer to the Investigator's Brochure for an overview of these data. 5.4 End of Trial Definition A subject is considered to have completed the trial when he/she has completed all visits, and procedures and tests applicable for the group to which he/she was randomized to. End of Trial is defined as when the last subject has completed the last visit on Day 393 or prematurely discontinued the trial. 5.5 Stopping/Pausing Rules for Safety 5.5.1 Individual Subjec t Stopping Rules The individual subject stopping rules are met in case any of the following events occur after the first trial vaccination: An allergic/anaphylactic reaction considered as related to the trial vaccine Any SAE considered as related to the trial vaccine If any of these rules are met, the subject must not receive the second vaccine dose. The subject will be encouraged to continue participation until the end of the trial for safety. 5.5.2 Pausing of the Trial The decision to pause the trial (i.e. temporary stopping of enrollment and vaccinations) due to a safety signal will be based on a recommendation from the DSMB in consultation with the Sponsor (see Section 9.3.8.1 ). The DSMB may recommend pausing the trial for a safety concern following a review of accumulating safety data presented at the regula rly scheduled DSMB meetings or from an ongoing review of AEs, which include but are not limited to, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs); all SAEs judged as related to trial vaccine; concerning SAEs (e.g., AESIs); and all life- threatening CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 of 162 deaths. These events will be monitored by the DSMB on a regular basis during the trial. The selected AEs and pr ocedures for the safety review are described in detail in the DSMB Charter. To ensure subject safety on an ongoing basis, a CureVac Safety Review Team reviews the safety data on a weekly basis. The outcome of these reviews and discussions are then shared with the DSMB Chair. Based on the assessment of the benefit -risk ratio and biologic plausibility of a causal relationship of the AE(s) to the trial vaccine, the DSMB will make a recommendation to the Sponsor to either continue the trial as planned, modify its conduct, or pause the trial to allow further evaluation of the AE. If the latter, the Sponsor will make the decision to pause the study in consultation with the DSMB. Please refer to the DSMB Charter for additional discussion of the DSMB's role and responsibilities.

Subjects with impaired coagulation or any bleeding di sorder in whom an intramuscular injection or a blood draw is contraindicated. 14. Foreseeable non- compliance with the trial procedures as judged by the Investigator. 6.3 Vaccine Delay Recommendations After enrollment, subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that could warrant a delay of trial vaccine administration as described below. Subjects with a clinically significant ( Grade 2) active infection or other acute disea se (as assessed by the I nvestigator and COVID -19 is either not clinically suspected and/or SARS -CoV-2 testing is negative) or temperature 38.0\u00b0C ( 100.4\u00b0F), within 3 days of intended trial vaccination on Day 1 or Day 29. o Trial vaccination should be delayed until the active i nfection or other acute disease has recovered to Grade 1 or the subject's temperature has decreased to < 38.0\u00b0C (< 100.4\u00b0F). Following resolution of the illness, the subject may be rescheduled for trial vaccination based on the judgment of the Investigat or. o Afebrile subjects with a minor illness may be vaccinated at the discretion of the Investigator. For subjects who develop virolo gically -confirmed COVID -19 after the first trial vaccination but prior to the second; this second vaccination can be adminis tered once the subject is 2 weeks symptom -free, and provided the dose can be administered within the predefined visit window . Receipt of a licensed vaccine within 28 days (for live vaccines) or 14 days (for inactivated or any other vaccines) prior to or af ter scheduled administration of trial vaccine. As these are recommended windows, rescheduling trial vaccination to be compliant with these windows should only be done if practical. 6.4 Failure to Meet Eligibility Criteria The Investigator must account for al l subjects who sign an informed consent. If the subject is found to be not eligible (i.e., did not meet all inclusion criteria or met one or more exclusion criteria), the Investigator should document this in the subject's source documents. Re-screening, i.e., re- doing the full assessments for eligibility assessment as per Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, or re -doing one assessment is allowed based on the judgment of the Investigator.

The IMP is composed of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, an mRNA that encodes the stabilized full-length S protein, and a cationic lipid. It is supplied as a concentrate at 1 mg/mL of mRNA drug subs tance. The placebo vaccine will be sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) for injection. randomized to CVnCoV will receive 2 injections of CVnCoV at a dose level of 12 \u00b5g mRNA, administered 28 days apart. Administration of CVnCoV must be performed by intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid area, preferably in the non -dominant arm. CVnCoV is intended strictly for IM injection a nd must not be injected subcutaneously, intradermally, or intravenously. The instructions for injection as described in the Pharmacy Manual must be followed. 7.1.2.2 Placebo Control (Normal Saline) Subjects randomized to the control arm of the trial will receive 2 doses of saline placebo {normal sa line (0.9% NaCl) for injection} , administered 28 days apart. Administration of saline placebo must be performed by IM injection in the deltoid area, preferably in the non- dominant arm. The instructions for injection described in the Pharmacy Manual must b e followed. 7.1.2.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Vaccination CVnCoV should not be administered to subjects with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine. Since there is a theoretical risk of anaphylactic reactions, trial vaccine must only be administered if emergency equipment for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions (intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, H1 and H2 blocking agents, epinephrine, equipment for cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is readily available. All subjects must remain under direct supervision of personnel trained in the treatment of these reactions for at least 30 minutes following administration of trial vaccine. If anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions occur following trial vaccine administration, no further doses should be given (see Sections 5.5.1 and 8.1). 7.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed information on the preparation, handling, storage and blinding of CVnCoV and saline placebo. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 73 of 162 7.2.1 CVnCoV Pr eparation The concentrated CVnCoV must be diluted in the provided sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) diluent containing preservative to produce the dose solution for IM injection. This will be prepared by unblinded pharmacists or physicians or any other qua lified persons according to local law. These pharmacists/qualified persons will have no other trial function following preparation of the blinded syringes for vaccination and will maintain the treatment assignments in strict confidence. 7.2.2 CVnCoV Product Sto rage and Stability Concentrated CVnCoV will be shipped to the site frozen at below - 60\u00b0C. Once at the site, concentrated CVnCoV should be stored frozen at below - 60\u00b0C. 7.2.3 Placebo Control (Normal Saline) The normal saline placebo control vaccine should be stored according to the Summary of Product Characteristics. Placebo will be prepared for injection by an unblinded pharmacist/qualified site personnel . 7.2.4 Accountability It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the current and accurate records of trial supplies received, stored, and dispensed at the site are maintained using appropriate forms according to applicable regulations and guidelines. The trial supplies must be stored under the recommended storage conditions, locked with restricted access (refer to the Pharmacy Manual). Authorized personnel must dispense the vaccine at the trial site and in accordance with the protocol and applicable regulations and guidel ines. IMP accountability and inventory logs must be kept up- to-date at the trial site with the following information: Dates and quantities of CVnCoV received from CureVac. Unique subject identifier. Date and quantity of trial vaccine dispensed to each subj ect. Initials of the person preparing the dose. Initials of the person administering the vaccine. These logs must be readily available for inspections and are open to regulatory inspection at any time. 7.3 Randomization and Blinding Both Phase 2b and Phase 3 w ill be randomized, observer -blinded, and placebo- controlled. The difference in appearance of the investigational CVnCoV vaccine and placebo required the trial to be conducted in an observer -blinded manner, which is a well -accepted method for blinding. 7.3.1 Randomization Subjects 18 years of age or older will be enrolled at multiple sites globally and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CVnCoV or placebo. The randomization will be Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 74 of 162 performed centrally and stratified by country and age group (18 to 60 and 61 years of age). The randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by an Independent Statistical group at the contract research organization (CRO) . Subjects will be enrolled into the trial online and randomized using an interactiv e web response system (IWRS). After demographic and eligibility criteria are entered into the system, each subject enrolled into the trial will be assigned their treatment assignment. 7.3.2 Blinding Subjects will be randomized and vaccinated with CVnCoV or p lacebo in an observer -blinded manner (due to the difference in appearance and presentation of the investigational CVnCoV vaccine and placebo). The pharmacist /qualified site personnel who prepared the injection will not be blinded to the identity of the tri al vaccine being administered to the subject. However, the vaccinator, Investigator and all site personnel involved in the conduct of the trial (including follow -up of safety and COVID -19 case ascertainment) will be blinded to trial vaccine and subject tre atment assignments. To maintain the blinding of the vaccinator, the pharmacist /qualified site personnel who prepared the injection will provide the dose of trial vaccine to the vaccinator prefilled in a syringe with a label covering the liquid contents so that it is not visible. All personnel at the CRO and Sponsor directly involved in the conduct of the trial will also be blinded. There will be certain individuals at the CRO and Sponsor whose function requires them to be unblinded during the trial {e.g., u nblinded monitoring for trial vaccine accountability in the pharmacy; unblinded independent statistician assisting the DSMB; review of immunogenicity data (see next paragraph) }. These unblinded individuals will be identified and their responsibilities docu mented. Because the immunogenicity results would unblind the subject's treatment assignment, the independent laboratory performing the assays will keep the results in strict confidence. An unblinded person, named at the start of the trial and independent of the co nduct of the trial, will have the responsibility of reviewing the quality of the immunogenicity data as it is being generated. This person will maintain the results in strict confidence. To maintain the blind, the immunogenicity data will only be merged wi th the clinical database following unblinding of the trial. It will be at the discretion of the DSMB members whether or not safety data reviewed at the DSMB meetings will be unblinded. If there are any safety concerns, the DSMB may request unb linding of an individual subject or a specific dataset at any time. In addition, the DSMB will periodically monitor COVID -19 cases by vaccine group for signals of VDE. At the interim analyses, the DSMB will review cases of COVID -19 cases by vaccine group for efficacy or futility, and will communicate the outcome to the Sponsor in a blinded manner. For the submission of documents for regulatory approval during the ongoing conduct of Trial CV -NCOV -004 (e.g., if efficacy is demonstrated at one of the interim a nalyses), an unblinded Submission Team will be formed which will be completely independent of the team conducting the trial. The Submission Team will comprise individuals from the Sponsor and CRO, and their roles and responsibilities on the unblinded team will be clearly defined. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 of 162 7.3.3 Unblinding 7.3.3.1 Emergency Unblinding Individual unblinding should only occur in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety when knowledge of the trial vaccine is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. Unblinding in this situation will be based on the judgment of the Investigator, ideally in discussion with the Sponsor. In general, the identity of the trial vaccine should not affect the clinical management of any SAE/AE. Whenever possible, the Investigator should attempt to contact the Sponsor before breaking the blind to discuss the need for emergency unblinding. Once agreed, code- breaking will be carried out via the IWRS. When the blind is broken, the date, exact timing, and reas on must be fully documented in the source documents. The Investigator should not inform other blinded trial staff of the identity of the IMP. If the code has been broken and there are no medical reasons for discontinuation, the subject may continue in the trial. If the subject has received at least 1 dose of trial vaccine, it will be the judgment of the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, whether the subject will be vaccinated with the second dose. If the subject is discontinued from the trial, every effort should be made to continue safety follow -up of the subject until the end of the trial. 7.3.3.2 Authorized/Licensed SARS -CoV -2 Vaccine Unblinding will be allowed in case a subject becomes eligible to receive a n authorized/ licensed SARS- CoV-2 vaccine . 7.4 Vaccine Compliance The Investigator must record all trial vaccinations administered in the subject's eCRF page. 7.5 Misuse and Overdose Definition of misuse : Situations where the trial vaccine is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with t he protocol dosing instructions or authorized product information. Definition of overdose : Administration of a quantity of the trial vaccine given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the protocol dosi ng instructions or authorized product information. No toxic effects are expected from current clinical and non- clinical experience. Possible local reactions (pain) or systemic AEs (fever, headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea) may be treated symptomatically with physical measures, paracetamol, or non- steroidal COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 76 of 162 7.6 Concomitant Therapy and Vaccines Concomitant medication for underlying diseases and the underlying disease for which it is administered and vaccines must be recorded in the subject's eCRF . For all subjects , concomitant therapies associated with an SAE or an AESI w ill be collected and recorded in the eCRF from the moment of informed consent was obtained through the end of the trial. Concomitant therapies associated with medically -attended AEs occurring from the moment of vaccination until 6 months after vaccination will also be collected and recorded in the eCRF. For all subjects , concomitant therapies associated with COVID -19 will be captured in the eCRF for the duration of the trial . For subjects in the Phase 2b part, concomitant therapies associated with unsolici ted AEs occurring from the time of vaccination through 28 days after vaccination will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. Concomitant therapies associated with solicited AEs occurring from the time of vaccination through 7 days after vaccination will al so be collected and recorded in the eCRF. Throughout the entire trial, any medications/vaccines prohibited according to Section 7.6.2 , including immunosuppressants or other immune- modifying drugs need to be documented, if taken by a subject . 7.6.1 Permitted Medications/Vaccines During the Trial Subjects are permitted to use antipyretics and other pain medications to treat any ongoing condition( s) the subject may have. Antipyretics (e.g., paracetamol) or other pain medication may be used to treat any local and/or systemic reactions associated with trial vaccination. Paracetamol taken prophylactically for potential vaccine- associated reactions is also permitted in this trial. For example, if a subject experiences adverse reactions following the first trial vaccination, paracetamol may be taken prophylactically for these reactions for the second trial vaccination. In this case, paracetamol ( up to 1 gram dose) may be taken after trial vaccination and at bedtime, and then in the morning and at bedtime during the next day. Alternatively, a 500 mg dose of paracetamol may be taken every 6 hours after trial vaccination for up to 36 hours. The dose and dosi ng schedule of paracetamol should be discussed with the Investigator. Paracetamol administered as a treatment for vaccine- associated reactions or for prophylaxis, along with timing of administration with respect to trial vaccination must be documented in the eCRF. Other than the prohibited medications and vaccines described in Section 6.2 and listed below in Section 7.6.2 , medications that are required for the treatment of the subject's pre-existing medical conditions are permitted. 7.6.2 Prohibited Medications/Vaccines During the Trial Use of any investigational or non- registered product (vaccine or drug) is prohibited during the trial . Treatment with an investigational COVID -19 drug will be allowed in case of diagnosed COVID -19, and this will be recorded as concomitant medication. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 of 162 Licensed vaccines should not be administered within 28 days (for live vaccines) or 14 days (for inactivated or any other vaccines) of trial vaccine administration during the trial. Receipt of any other investigational SARS -CoV-2 vaccine or other coronavirus vaccine is prohibited during the trial. Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune- modifying drugs (including but not limited to corticosteroids, biologicals and methotrexate) is prohibited during the trial. For corticosteroid use, this means prednisone or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days or more. The use of inhaled, topical, or localized injections of corticosteroids (e.g., for joint pain/inflammation) is permitted. Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products i s prohibited during the tria l. 7.7 Therapy Leading to Discontinuation If a subject requires therapy listed as an exclusion criterion in Section 6.2 and which cannot be delayed, discontinuation would be considered to ensure integrity of the trial data, following individual case review. Every effort should be made to continue safety follow- up of the subject until the end of the trial. 7.8 Treatment After the End of Trial No post -trial care will be provided. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 78 of 162 8 DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participation in the trial is strictly voluntary. A subject has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason. The Investigator has the right to withdraw a subject from further trial vaccine administration and/or the trial if this is considered in the subject's best interest or as a result of a protocol deviation. For discontinuations due to an AE, every effort should be made to document the outcome of the event. Subjects who received at least 1 dose of trial vaccine will be encouraged to continue participation until the end of the trial for safety assessments. 8.1 Discontinuation of Trial Vaccine Administration The primary reason for discontinuation of further administration of trial vaccine will be recorded in the subject's eCRF according to the following categories: Consent withdrawal by the subject. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF. Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded (i.e., withdrawal due to an AE should not be recorded in the \"v oluntary withdrawal\" category). The subject becomes eligible to receive a n authorized/ licensed SARS- CoV-2 vaccine, requests to be unblinded, and refrains from getting the second dose of trial vaccine. AE (including known side effects of the trial vaccine). If discontinuation is due to an AE possibly related to the trial vaccine or trial procedures, the subject must be followed -up by additional examinations according to the medical judgment of the Investigator until the condition is resolved or the Investigator deems further observations or examinations to be no longer medically indicated. Change in the subject's overall medical status prohibiting further participation. Pregnancy (see Section 9.3.4 ). Any subject who, despite the requirement for adequate contraception, becomes pregnant during the trial will not receive further trial vaccine doses. The site should maintain contact with the pregnant subject and complete a \"Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form\" as soon as possible. In addition, the subject should be followed- up until the birth of the child, or spontaneous or voluntary termination. When pregnancy outcome information becomes available, the information should be captured using the same form. The subject should be reported as an IMP discontinuation and the reason (i.e. pregnancy) should be given. Trial terminated by the Sponsor (in which case the minimum safety follow -up conducted at the end of trial visit on Day 393 would be performed). Major protocol deviation. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 79 of 162 Other. Note: The spec ific reasons should be recorded in the \"specify\" field of the eCRF. For subjects who develop virolo gically -confirmed COVID -19 after the first trial vaccination but prior to the second; this second vaccination can be administered once the subject is 2 weeks symptom -free, and provided the dose can be administered within the predefined visit window. 8.2 Withdrawal from the Trial Subjects should be withdrawn from the trial in case any of the following situations occur: Continued participation jeopardizes the subjec t's health, safety, or rights. The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject's health or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the AE. The reasons for not performing further sa fety or immunogenicity assessments should be documented. The subject did not return to the site and multiple attempts (a minimum of 3 attempts) to contact the subject were unsuccessful (lost to follow -up). The subject wishes to wi thdraw from the trial. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded. All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded (i.e., withdrawal due to an AE should not be recorded in the \"voluntary withdrawal\" category). Any subject who prematurely terminates participation and who has received at least one trial vaccine dose will undergo the same procedures as for the end of trial visit, unless such procedures are considered to pose unacceptable risk to the subject. Discontinued or withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 8.3 Trial Termination The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trial at any time. Possible reasons for tria l termination include the following: Outcome of the interim analysis may show high VE or futility. Safety reasons: the incidence of AEs in this or any other trial using a related vaccine indicates a potential health risk for the subjects. New scientific kn owledge becomes known that makes the objectives of the trial no longer feasible/valid. The site is unlikely to be able to recruit sufficient subjects within the agreed time frame. The site does not respond to trial management requests. Repeated protocol deviations. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 80 of 162 Unsafe or unethical practices. Administrative decision. Following a trial termination decision, the Investigator must contact all subjects within a time period set by the Sponsor. All trial materials must be collected and relevant documentation c ompleted to the greatest extent possible. The trial can also be terminated by the Regulatory Authority for any reason or if recommended by the DSMB, or at a site level by the Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB). The Sponsor may close an individual site prematurely for reasons such as poor protocol compliance or unsatisfactory recruitment of subjects. 8.4 Lost to Follow -Up All efforts should be made to contact subjects who have not returned for the scheduled trial visit or who ar e unable to be contacted for a scheduled phone call. A minimum of 3 attempts should be made and documented. If a subject is lost to follow -up before resolution of related SAEs or AEs, the Sponsor may consider further attempts to contact the subject in order to collect follow -up safety information.

The trial assessments and procedures are discussed in this section. For subjects who are unable to come to the site for protocol -specified site visits (e.g., due to the public health emergency related to COVID -19), safety assessments may be performed using alternative methods (e.g., phone contact, virtual visit, alternative location for assessment). For further flexibility in trial conduct in the pandemic setting, home visits will be allowed to perform safety assessments and procedures including the collection of blood and any bio-samples. If site visits, phone contacts or sample collection cannot be performed within the protocol -defined windows, in such unique circumstances as a public healt h emergency, it will be acceptable to perform these tasks outside of these windows. In the pandemic setting, the protocol -defined windows for site visits and phone contacts are provided for guidance and will not be considered deviations, if not strictly adhered to. An electronic diary (eDiary) will be used during the trial for efficient collection of safety -related information. However , paper diaries may be substituted for some subjects during the trial . Initiation of subject enrollment of the 2 target age groups into Phase 2b will be flexible. Depending on the timing of data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2a trials, enrollment of the 2 age groups into Phase 2b may be staggered, initially starting with subject s 18 to 60 years of age followed by subjects 61 years of age. As the older age group will comprise 20% to 25% of the total number of subjects in Phase 2b, this staggered start is not expected to impact overall enrollment of the Phase 2b cohort. The maxim um total volume of blood taken over the trial period from any subject is 304 mL. 9.1 Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures Refer to Table 1 (Immunogenicity Subjects) and Table 2 (Non -Immunogenicity Subjects) for the Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures for Phase 2b, and Table 3 for the Schedule of Trial Assessments and Procedures for Phase 3. The trial assessments and procedures apply to all subjects, independent if they had known SARS- CoV-2 positive serology before the trial or independent of the serology status at baseline as per retrospective analysis. Subjects participating in Phase 2b will be given a thermometer to measure body temperature orally and a measuring tape to determine the size of local injection site reactions. Subjects will be instructed on how to enter the solicited AEs daily for 7 days in the eDiary. During the conduct of the trial and interactions with subjects, any person with early warning signs of COVID -19 should be referred to emergency medical care immediately.

Case detection will begin with the identification of subjects reporting at least 1 symptom from a standardized list of symptoms consistent with COVID -19 disease. Based on a phone interview with trial staff (see Appendix 6), subjects suspected of having COVID -19 disease will undergo testing for SARS -CoV-2 infect ion, consisting of a rapid antigen test performed locally by the trial staff and a molecular -ba sed RT-PCR test performed at a designated central laboratory. The testing strategy is described in Section 9.5 and Appendix 7. If the subject is confirmed to have COVID -19, subjects will be followed until resolution of their disease, even if the initial presentation is considered as mild. If the subject is hospitalized, the subject's progress must continue to be followed by the Investigator and a medical/discharge summary must be obtained at the end of the hospitalization. The following definitions will apply: Any SARS- CoV-2 infection: a SARS- CoV-2 infection detected by either RT -PCR or seroconversion to the N protein in a seronegative subject. Subject without evidence of prior SARS -CoV-2 infection: subject is seronegative to the S and N proteins by immunoassay. Subject with evidence of prior SARS -CoV-2 infection: subject is seropositive to the S and/or N proteins by immunoassay. Subject with high risk of severe COVID -19: subject's with the following conditions a re at increased risk of severe COVID -19: - Cancer - Chronic kidney disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronar y artery disease, or cardiomyopathies - Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid orga n transp lant - Obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m 2 but < 40 kg/m2) - Severe obesity (BMI 40 kg/m2) - Pregnancy - Sickle cell disease - Smoking Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 106 of 162 - Type 2 diabetes mellitus 9.2.1.1 Case Detection 9.2.1.1.1 Routine Surveillance for COVID -19 During all site visits and phone calls, subjects will be reminded to contact the site if they have any of the following symptoms*: o Fever or chills o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o New loss of taste or smell o Cough o Fatigue o Muscle or body aches o Headache o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea * FDA Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19 guidance [ 33]. Subjects will also be messaged up to twice a week to provide a yes or no response to having COVID -19 symptoms. For both of the trial vaccinations, messaging will not begin until 4 days after vaccination to avoid confusing vaccine- associated reactions occurring during this time period (e.g., fever, chills, headache, fatigue, myalgia) with potentia l COVID -19 symptoms. Those who report symptoms either at the site visit or by phone call, or respond \"yes\" to having symptoms by messaging will be contacted by trial staff for a follow -up phone interview if the I nvestigator considers the symptoms could potentially indicate a COVID -19 case. The trial staff will use a scripted interview (in which he/she has been trained on) to collect information about the subject's medical condition, which will be used to determine the probability of the subject having COVID -19. The interview script is provided in Appendix 6. If the subject is suspected of having COVID -19 illness, he/she will undergo testing for SARS -CoV-2 infection (see next section). If suspicion is low, then a subsequent phone call(s) will be performed to assess whether the subject's illness and symptoms have progressed and if the suspicion of COVID -19 has reached a sufficient level to test the subject. Based on clinical judgment, phone contact may be made as frequently as daily. All symptomatic subjects will be provided a thermometer and oxygen saturation monitor for home use. Trial staff will instruct subjects to take their oral body temperature and oxygen saturation levels at least 3 to 4 times per day, or whenever they feel symptomatic. The testing strategy for SARS -CoV-2 infection is presented in Section 9.5 and Appendix 7. Testing will consist of 2 tests: a rapid antigen test performed locally by the trial staff and a molecular -based RT -PCR test performed at a designated central laboratory. Depending on the Investigator and his/her facility and trial staff, nasopharyngeal swab samples for testing will be collected either at the site or at a home visit. The visit to the site or home visit by trial staff will be considered an \"Illness Visit\" and documented as such in the eCRF. If the subject is virologically -confirmed to have COVID -19 by a positive RT -PCR test, subjects will be followed until resolution of t heir disease, even if the initial presentation is considered as mild. If the subject is hospitalized, the subject's progress must continue to be followed by the Investigator and a discharge summary must be obtained at the end of the hospitalization. Inform ation on clinical symptoms and signs, their duration and severity, Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 of 162 and treatment and outcome of the COVID -19 episode will be documented by trial staff and recorded in the eCRF. Upon resolution, subjects will continue to be followed in the same manner as t hose who have not presented with COVID -19 (i.e. they will return to routine case surveillance) . A second episode of COVID -19 in a subject with prior disease will not be counted as a primary efficacy case, but will be included in the exploratory objective a ssessing the occurrence of second episodes of COVID -19 in vaccinated subjects. If the subject is not virologically -confirmed by RT -PCR testing, he/she will return to routine surveillance for COVID -19 disease as a subject who is na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infecti on (unless determined otherwise by a seropositive test to the N protein). 9.2.1.1.2 Non-Routine Surveillance for COVID -19 (Positive Test Outside of the Site) Subjects will be reminded to contact the site immediately if he/she has a positive SARS- CoV-2 test performed outside of the site, whether they were symptomatic (COVID -19 illness) or asymptomatic at the time of the test. If the subject was symptomatic, trial staff will use the scripted interview to collect information about the subject's COVID -19 symptoms and medical condition (interview script in Appendix 6). The subject should be retested as soon as feasible to confirm the result. A nasopharyngeal swab sample should be sent to the Sponsor -designated centra l laboratory for RT -PCR testing; the RT -PCR test result will be considered definitive as a virologica lly-confirmed case of COVID -19. If the subject is confirmed to have COVID -19, subjects will be followed unti l resolution of their disease, as described above for subjects who were detected by routine surveillance. If the subject is not virologically -confirmed by RT -PCR testing, he/she will return to routine surveillance for COVID -19 disease as a subject who i s na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infection (unless determined otherwise by a seropositive test to the N protein). 9.2.1.2 Definition of Virologically -Confirmed COVID -19 Case A virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 is defined as a positive SARS -CoV-2 specific RT-PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic disease consisting of 1 or more of the following symptoms (based on the same screening symptoms as above): o Fever or chills o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o New loss of taste or smell o Cough o Fatigue o Muscle or body aches o Headache o Sore throat o Congestion or runny nose o Nausea or vomiting o Diarrhea This definition is intended to capture all severities of virologically -confirmed clinically symptomatic cases of COVID -19. As such, COVID -19 cases classified by severity (e.g., mild or severe) will be a subset of these cases. See Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 for clinical definitions of severe and mild COVID -19, respectively. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 108 of 162 9.2.1.3 COVID -19 Case Definition for Primary Efficacy Analysis For the primary analysis of efficacy, the case must meet the following criteria: Must be a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 (of any severity) defined as a positive SARS -CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic COVID -19, as defined above in Section 9.2.1.2 . Symptom onset must have occurred 15 days following the second trial vaccination. The subject must not have a history of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 illness at enrollment or have developed a case of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 before 15 days following the second trial vaccination {see Section 10.2.3, Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) for more details }. The subject must have been SARS -CoV-2 na\u00efve at baseline and Day 43 (defined a s seronegative to N protein in the blood samples collected at baseline and Day 43). The primary efficacy cases must be confirmed by the Adjudication Committee. Day 43 is 14 days post -second dose which allows the immune response to CVnCoV to mature and reach its height following the second dose. As such, COVID -19 case ascertainment starting the next day at 15 days represents the evaluation of full VE of CVnCoV a gainst COVID -19 disease. 9.2.1.4 SARS -CoV -2 Genome Lineage Characterization The characterization of SARS -CoV-2 variants in this trial will be implemented by viral whole genome sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab samples of subjects followed by comparison with previously sequenced and typified genomes . Analysis will follow the methodology to assign names to lineages of SARS -CoV-2 using a dynamic nomenclature [34], using the ( https://cov -lineages.org/ ). The assignment algorithm uses machine learning, which offers a classification tree that has been trained using over approximately 60,000 SARS -CoV-2 sequences retrieved form GISAID, machine learning reconstruction and manual curation for all the lineages. Each base per genome was one- hot encoded, which makes every position informative for further prediction. Those models are available under cov -lineages/pangoLEARN at github (https://github.com/cov -lineages/pangoLEARN/tree/master/pangoLEARN ). The characterization will done centrally. following phylogenetic clustering will be applied: 1. \"Wild type\" variant of concern: B.1.1.7 3. All other variants of concern. In this trial, the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on all strains , the \"wild type\" virus and all SARS -CoV-2 variants (as defined under numbers 1, 2 and 3 above); the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be based on the \"wild type\" virus and the UK variant B.1.1.7 ( as defined under numbers 1 and 2 above); and the exploratory efficacy endpoint Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 109 of 162 will be based on disease caused by individual variants of concern (as defined under numbers 2 and 3 above). 9.2.1.5 Adjudication of COVID -19 Cases An independent Committee of clinicians will be formed t o adjudicate COVID -19 cases. The Committee will be blinded to the treatment assignment of the subject. The cases will be adjudicated by the members with respect to the following questions consistent with the endpoints of the trial . Is the case a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 defined as a positive SARS- CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test in a person with clinically symptomatic COVID- 19 with 1 or more of the symptoms listed above in Section 9.2.1.2 . o Was the RT -PCR test performed at the CureVac designated central laboratory? Was the symptom onset of the case 15 days following the second vaccination? Or did it occur before 15 days following the second trial vaccination? Was the subject na\u00efve or non- na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 at baseline and Day 43? (defined as being seronegative or seropositive to the SARS -CoV-2 N protein). Was the subject 18 to 60 years of age or 61 years of age? Was the subject asymptomatic? If asymptomatic, was the RT -PCR test positive 15 days following the second vaccination or before? Was it a mild or severe case of COVID -19 based on the provide d clinical definitions? Did the subject require supplemental oxygenation? What type of oxygen support did the subject receive? Was the subject hospitalized? Was the subject admitted to the intensive care unit? Did the subject die? Due to COVID -19 or other cause? 9.2.2 Asymptomatic Cases of SARS -CoV -2 Infection There will be no active surveillance in this trial for asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infections. Subjects will be reminded to contact the site immediately if he/she had a positive SARS- CoV-2 test performed outside of the site, whether they were symptomatic (COVID -19 illness) or asymptomatic at the time of the test. Subjects without symptoms may have been tested for several reasons, for example, close exposure to a known person with SARS -CoV-2 infection or as part of their routine screening as a healthcare provider. If the subject was asymptomatic, trial staff will contact the subject immediately to collect information about the positive SARS -CoV-2 test the subject reported. The subject should be retested as soon as feasible to confirm the result. A nasopharyngeal swab sample should be sent to the Sponsor -designated central laboratory for RT -PCR testing; a positive RT-PCR test result will be considered definitive as a virologically -confirmed case of SARS- CoV-2 infection. If the subject is confirmed to have SARS -CoV-2 infection, the subject will be followed by trial staff for at least 2 weeks for the development of any COVID -19 symptoms, to ensure Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 110 of 162 that this is an asymptomatic infection. If the subject develops COV ID-19, he/she will be followed -up as a COVID -19 case. If the subject is confirmed to be asymptomatic, information will be collected by the trial staff and documented on the appropriate eCRF page. If the subject is not virologically -confirmed by RT -PCR t esting, he/she will return to routine surveillance for COVID -19 disease as a subject who is na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infection (unless determined otherwise by a seropositive test to the N protein). 9.3 Safety Assessments The safety and reactogenicity of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV will be assessed as described below. 9.3.1 Safety Assessments Specific for Subjects in Phase 2b Reactogenicity will be assessed daily on each vaccination day and the following 7 days by collection of solicited local AEs (injection site pain, redness, swelling, and itching) and systemic AEs (fever, headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) using eDiaries. In addition, other indicators of safety will be collected (e.g., body temperature). The eDiary will also be used as a memory aid for the subject for the collection of unsolicited AEs on each vaccination day and the following 28 days. 9.3.2 Safety Assessments for All Subjects in Phase 2b and Phase 3 Medically -attended AEs will be collected through 6 months after the second trial vaccination. AESIs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. AESIs to be monitored include pIMDs, AESIs for SARS -CoV-2 vaccines, and non- serious intercurrent medical conditions that ma y affect the immune response to vaccination. SAEs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. AEs leading to vaccine withdrawal or trial discontinuation will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. {If the subject does not receive their second trial vaccination, the AE follow -up time (6 months or 1 year ) will be determined based on the date scheduled for their second vaccination on Day 29} . The eDiary will be used as a memory aid for the subject for t he collection of medically -attended AEs, AESIs, and SAEs. 9.3.3 Adverse Events Definitions of AEs/SAEs, procedures for recording, evaluating, follow -up and reporting of AEs/SAEs/pregnancy/overdose, as well as assessments of intensity and causality of AEs, are provided in Appendix 10. In Phase 2b, any AEs occurring during the 30- minute observation period after vaccination will be recorded in the eCRF. In P hase 3, only those AEs occurring during the 30- minute Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 111 of 162 observation period after vaccination which constitute an AESI, medically -attended A E, or an SAE will be recorded in the eCRF . It is important to note that COVID -19 illness and its complications/sequelae are consistent with the effica cy endpoints of the trial and, as such, should not be recorded a s AEs. These data will be captured on the relevant eCRF pages for cases of COVID -19 illness that occur in the trial, which are expected outcomes of the trial. Therefore, COVID -19 illness and i ts complications/sequelae as well as all symptoms listed in Section 9.2.1.2 will not be reported according to the standard expedited process for SAEs, even though the event may meet the criteria for an SAE. However please note that all f atal cases result ing from COVID -19 and its complications/sequelae and from all other events will be reported as SAE s and need to be reported to the CRO within 24 hours (see section Reporting of SAEs in Appendix 10). The reporting period for each type of AE and corresponding concomitant medication use is shown in Table 4. Table 4 Reporting Period by Type of Adverse Event AE Type Days 1 to 8 Days 29 to 36 Days 1 to 57 Day 1 to Month 6 Day 1 to End of Trial Solicited AEs (Phase 2b) X X Unsolicited AEs (Phase 2b) X Medically -attended AEs X SAE/AESI/COVID -19 X Any vaccination other than CVnCoV X Any immune -suppressive/ modulating medication or other prohibited medication X Non-serious intercurrent medical conditions that may affect the immune response to vaccination X 9.3.3.1 Solicited Adverse Events An eDiary will be distributed to all subjects in Phase 2b for collection of solicited local AEs (injection -site pain, redness, swelling and itching) and solicited systemic AEs (fever, headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea) on the da y of vaccination and the following 7 days. Subjects will be given a thermometer to measure body tempera ture orally and a measuring tape to determine the size of local injection site reactions. Subjects will be instructed on how to enter the solicited AEs daily for 7 days in the eDiary. Solicited AEs will be assessed on an intensity scale of absent, mild, moderate and severe (Table 5 and Table 6). By definition, all local solicited AEs are considered related to trial vaccination. For solicited systemic AEs, the Investigator will assess the relationship between trial vaccine and occurr ence of each AE and make an assessment of intensity for each AE. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 112 of 162 If concerning to the subject or of prolonged duration, solicited Grade 3 AEs should be reported to the Investigator immediately. In case of related Grade 3 solicited AEs reported for more tha n 1 day on the eDiary, the subject will be questioned to establish the total duration of the AE as exactly as possible.

For all subjects in Phase 2b and Phase 3, medically -attended AEs will be collected through 6 months af ter the second trial vaccination. AESIs will be collected through 1 year after Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 114 of 162 the second trial vaccination (see Table 4). SAEs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. Medically -attended AEs are defined as AEs with medically -attended visits that are not routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, such as visits for hospitalization, a n emergency room visit, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel (medical doctor) for any reason. The occurrence of AEs (serious and non- serious) will be assessed by non- directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the reporting periods specified in Table 4. Subjects should be instructed to report immediately any AEs with serious symptoms, subjective complaints or objective changes in their well -being to the Investigator or the site per sonnel, regardless of the perceived relationship between the event and the trial vaccine. The Investigator will assess the relationship between trial vaccine and occurrence of ea ch AE/SAE as well as the intensity (see Appendix 10). Non-serious intercurrent medical conditions that may affect the immune response to vaccination will also be collected throughout the trial. 9.3.3.3 Adverse Event s of Special Interest AESIs will be collected through 1 year after the second trial vaccination . The following events will be considered as AESI during this trial: AEs with a suspected immune- medicated etiology (pIMDs, see Appendix 8). Other AEs relevant to SARS -CoV-2 vaccine development or the target disease (see Appendix 9). Non-serious intercurrent medical conditions that may affect the immune response to vaccination will also be collected throughout the trial. 9.3.4 Pregnancies Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for enro llment in this trial, but subjects could potentially become pregnant during their active participation in this trial. Refer to Appendix 10 for details on the reporting and follow -up of pregnancies. 9.3.5 Safety Laboratory Assessments (See Appendix 5) A urine sample (or blood, where required according to local laws and regulations) for pregnancy testing will be taken from women of childbearing potential on Day 1 prior to trial vaccination to establish eligibility. A urine (or blood, where required according to local l aws and regulations) pregnancy test will also be performed before the second trial vaccination on Day 29 to continue to determine eligibility. 9.3.6 Vital Signs and Physical Examination At all trial visits for Phase 2b (see Table 1 and Table 2) and Phase 3 (see Table 3), vital signs (body temperature, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse) will be recorded in a standardized manner after the subject has rested in the sitting position for 5 minutes. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 115 of 162 At the first trial visit on Day 1 and end of trial visit on Day 393 (see Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3), a complete physical examination will be performed, including examination of general appearance, ey es/ears/nose/throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph node areas, cardiovascular system, lung/chest, abdomen, extremities and neurological examination, skin examination, measurement of weight and height. At all other trial visits, a symptom -directed physical exami nation will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator and should include measurement of O 2 saturation . 9.3.7 Medical and Surgical History All significant findings and pre- existing conditions present in a subject prior to enrollment must be reported on the relevant medical history/current medical conditions screen of the eCRF. Information should be provided on medical and surgical history and concomitant medical conditions specifying those ongoing on Day 1. 9.3.8 Monitoring C ommittees 9.3.8.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) An independent DSMB will be convened to i) oversee the safety of subjects participating in this trial, HERALD: CV-NCOV -004; ii) to assess the progress and conduct of the trial; iii) to review the cumulative safety data from the trial; iv) to perform an ongoing review of AEs of potential safety concern (see Section 5.5.2 ); and v) to make recommendations to the Sponsor whet her to continue, modify, or pause the trial (see Section 5.5.2 ). To ensure subject safety on an ongoing basis, a CureVac Safety Review Team reviews the safety data on a weekly basis. The outcome of these reviews and discussions are then shared with the DSMB Chair . In addition to safety data, the DSMB will be asked to review efficacy data at the interim analyses or possibly at other time points during the trial for a continued assessment of the risk-benefit of the trial. As part of the risk -benefit analysis, the DSMB will periodically monitor COVID -19 cases for signals of VDE. The DSMB will also be asked to perform a n unblinded review(s) of the incidence rate of COVID -19 cases to recommend an adjustment (s) in sample size, if needed. The DSMB Charter will describe in detail the composition and objectives of the DSMB; the responsibilities of the DSMB, CureVac, and CRO; the schedule and conduct of the DSMB meetings; and the datasets to be reviewed. The Charter will contain the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the DSMB. 9.3.8.2 Adjudication Committee An independent Committee of c linicians will be formed to adjudicate COVID -19 cases for assessment of the primary endpoint. The Committee will be blinded to the treatment assignment of the subject. The cases will be adjudicated by the members with respect to the questions presented in Section 9.2.1.5 . The schedule of the meetings and approach to adjudication of cases will be defined in the Charter. The Committee Chair will attend the DSMB meetings as an ad hoc member. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 116 of 162 9.4 Immunogenicity Assessments For Phase 2b subjects in the Immunogenicity Subset, the timing of blood sample collection for immunogenicity assessments post -vaccination is provided in Table 1. For all subjects, the timing of blood sample collection for the determination of serology status to natural SARS -CoV-2 infection at baseline and during the trial is provided in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Because the immunogenicity results would unblind the subject's treatment assignment, the laboratory performing the assays will keep the results in strict confidence. An unblinded person, named at the start of the trial and independent of the conduct of the trial, will periodically review the quality of the immunogenicity data. This person will maintain the results in strict confidence. 9.4.1 Antibody Responses to CVnCoV Vaccination ( RBD of S Protein and Viral Neutralizing Antibodies) Antibody responses to CVnCoV vaccination will only be evaluated in the Phase 2b part of the trial and only for subjects in the Immunogenicity Subset at the time points specified in Table 1. The immune response induced by vaccination with CVnCoV will be evaluated by 2 assays: Binding antibodies to the SARS -CoV-2 RBD of the S protein measured in serum by immunoassay. Viral neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS -CoV-2 measured in serum by a functional activity assay. 9.4.2 Antibody Responses to SARS -CoV -2 (N Protein) Antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2 will be evaluated in all parts of the trial and for all subjects by measuring the binding antibodies to the SARS -CoV-2 N protein (virus antig en not contained in the vaccine construct) at the time points specified in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 and will be perfor med by immunoassay. As a measure of prior infection with SARS -CoV-2, serological status to the N protein will be used for the following: 1. To determine, retrospectively, if subjects were na\u00efve or non- na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infection at trial entry and on Day 43. a. For evaluation of the efficacy of a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV in na\u00efve subjects, subjects would have to be seronegative to the N protein at baseline and Day 43. b. For evaluation of the efficacy after the first dose of CVnCoV in na\u00efve subjects, subjects would have to be seronegative to the N protein at baseline only. 2. To determine if vaccination with a 2- dose schedule of CVnCoV can reduce infection with SARS -CoV-2 by measuring seroconversion to the N protein in seronegative subjects during the trial period. As described above in 1a, these subjects would have to be seronegative to the N protein at baseline and Day 43. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 117 of 162 9.4.3 Antibody Responses to CVnCoV Vaccination in Subjects Who Develop a Case of COVID -19 For all cases of COVID- 19 that occur in the trial , the antibody response to trial vaccination will be determined in the subject's blood samples collec ted on Day 1 (pre- vaccinatio n baseline), Day 43, Day 211, and Day 393 of the trial . These assays will only need to be performed for subjects in the Phase 2b part who are not in the Immunogenicity Subset and for Phase 3 subjects. Subjects in the Phase 2b Immunogenicity Subset will alr eady have these performed as part of the cohort. These results will be used to explore correla tes of protective immunity induced by CvnCoV vaccination. 9.4.4 Cell-mediated Immunity CMI will be evaluated in approximately 200 subjects: 100 who receive C VnCoV and 100 who receive placebo. The frequency and functionality of SARS -CoV-2 RBD of S -specific T -cell response after antigen stimulation will be determined in PBMC in comparison to baseline. For example, ICS to investigate Th1 response and production of Th2 markers will be used to investigate whether vaccination induces a Th1 shift from the baseline. Further high profiling T -cell immune responses may be investigated with other technologies such as ELISpot or CyTOF , analysis of genomic biomarkers or any other established assays . CMI assessment will be performed on Day 1 (baseline), Day 29, Day 43, Day 120 and Day 211. Note that testing on Day 120 and Day 211 will only be performed on subjects who are determined as T -cell responders on D ay 29 and/or Day 43. 9.5 Testing for SARS -CoV-2 Infection 9.5.1 Virological Confirmation of COVID -19 Disease See Flow Diagrams in Appendix 6 and Appendix 7. During the trial, subjects clinically suspected of having COVID -19 disease will undergo testing for the SARS -CoV-2 virus as described below. Sample collection for the tests ma y be performed at the site or at a home visit by trial staff. Ideally, samples should be collected within 5 days of symptom onset. The test results will be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. Subjects with a clinical suspicion o f COVID -19 will undergo testing for SARS -CoV-2 infection using a rapid antigen test performed at the site with the results provided to the subject. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be used to collect samples for the rapid antigen test. Regardless of the result of the rapid antigen test, a nasopharyngeal swab sample collected at the same time will be sent to a central laboratory to perform a SARS- CoV-2 specific RT -PCR test. The RT -PCR test result will be considered definitive for SARS -CoV-2 infection. In the unlikely event that only 1 sample can be collected from the subject, the sample should be tested by RT -PCR at the centra l laboratory. o If the RT -PCR test is negative, but COVID -19 is still suspected based on the subject's exposure history and clinica l presentation, another nasopharyngeal swa b Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 118 of 162 sample should be taken as soon as feasible and sent to the central laboratory for RT-PCR testing. The RT -PCR retest result will be considered definitive for SARS- CoV-2 infection. o For positive RT -PCR tests performed at the central laboratory, the virus will be sequenced to identify mutations in the S protein and determine viral lineages . Subjects who are negative for all testing will be considered na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infection. In the unlikely case that a subject tests positive by the rapid antigen test but negative by RT -PCR, the subject will still be con sidered na\u00efve without a positive virological confirmation by RT -PCR (unless determined otherwise by a seropositive test to the N protein). 9.5.2 Confirmation of a Positive Test for SARS -CoV -2 Infection Performed Outside of the Site See Section 9.2.1.1.2 and Section 9.2.2 for follow -up of subjects who report a positive test for SARS- CoV-2 infection performed outside of the site. For subjects (symptomatic or asymptomatic) who report a positive test for SARS -CoV-2 infection which was performed outside of the site, regardless of the type of test , the subject should be retested as soon as feasible to confirm the result. A nasopharyngeal swab sample should be sent to the centr al laboratory for RT -PCR testing for confirmation. The retest result at the central laboratory will be considered definitive. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 119 of 162 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Sample Size Determination 10.1.1 Primary Efficacy Objective This is an event -driven trial. Sample size a nd power considerations are based on the primary objective for demonstrating efficacy of CVnCoV in the prevention of virologically -confirmed cases of COVID -19 of any severity meeting the primary case definition. A group sequential design with 2 interim analyses for cases of COVID -19 of any severity demonstrating a high level of efficacy or reaching futility is planned using O'Brien and Fleming type error -spending- function [ 36] and the sample size is based on the test for one single proportion (i.e. the proportion of cases in the CVnCoV group, among all cases). The group sequential design is based on the any severity COVID -19 endpoint, due to the higher case number required to meet this endpoint. With an overall 2- sided alpha of 5% , a total of 1 60 COVID -19 cases of any severity (meeting the primary efficacy case definition for COVID -19 of any severity ) are needed a t final analysis, to have a power of 90% to demonstrate the VE is above 30% based on the lower bound of the CI for VE, when considering the VE under the alternative hypothesis is 60% (i.e. equivalently to demonstrate the proportion of cases i n the CVnCoV gr oup is below 0.4118, based on the upper bound of the CI for proportion when considering the proportion under the alternative hypothesis is equal to 0.2857). The two interim analyses for high efficacy or futility of the primary objective of COVID -19 cases of any severity will be performed once 56/111 cases have been accrued and adjudicated (approxima tely 30%/60% of cases). Assuming an incidence rate of COVID -19 of 0.15% per month in placebo subjects, an overall non- evaluable rate of 20% (corresponding to subjects excluded from the EAS and drop- outs) and a VE of 60%, 36,500 subjects enrolled over approximately 3 months (18,250 per vaccine group) will accrue 160 COVID -19 cases of any severity at approximately 9 months after the first vaccination . A lower incidence rate, a longer enrollment duration, or a higher non- evaluable rate or VE will delay the acquisition of the 160 cases and the time of final analysis. Subjects will be randomized to receive either CVnCoV or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by country and age group (18 to 60 and 61 years of age). 10.1.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Objectives For the key secondary efficacy objective evaluating the prevention of virologically -confirmed moderate to severe cases of COVID -19, a lower number of cases will be collected at the time of final analysis compared to the primary endpoint. If 1/3 of COVID -19 cases of any severity are moderate to severe, then 53 moderate to severe cases can be expected when the total number of COVID -19 cases is 160. The trial will then have 91.5% power to obtain a lower limit of the 95% CI of the VE above 20% when assuming the true VE is 70%. For the key secondary efficacy objective evaluating the prevention of virologically -confirmed severe cases of COVID -19, a lower number of cases will be collected at the time of final analysis compared to the primary endpoint. B ased on an Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 120 of 162 analysis of a large database by Verity et al. [ 37], approximately 20% of COVID -19 cases can be clinically defined as severe or critical, the latter requir ing intensive care. For the key secondary efficacy objective evaluating the prevention of virologically -confirmed moderate to severe cases of COVID -19, a lower number of cases will be collected at the time of final analysis compared to the primary endpoint. If 50% of COVID -19 cases of any type are \"wild type\" (i.e., B.1.1.7 ), then 80 such cases can be expected when the total number of COVID -19 cases is 160. The trial will t hen have 90.7% power to obtain a lower limit of the 95% CI of the VE above 30% when assuming the true VE is 70%. With 32 cases of severe COVID -19 (20% of 160 cases), the trial will have 81.5% power to obtain a lower limit of the 95% CI of the VE above 10% when assuming the true VE is 70%. The power increases to 91% if the true VE against severe cases is 75%. With complete follow -up of all evaluable subjects for 1 year in this trial, it is expected that the additional number of COVID -19 cases accrued pos t-second vaccination would permit a more robust evaluation of CVnCoV efficacy against severe disease. This analysis will be presented in the SAP. 10.2 Populations for Analyses In the Safety Analysis Set (SAS), Safety Analysis Set 2 (SAS 2), and the Solicited AEs Safety Analysis Set (SASsol), subjects will be analyzed in the group they actually received (as \"treated\"). Following the \"intent to treat\" principle in the Efficacy sets and Per -Protocol Sets, subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized (as \"randomized\"). An authorized/licensed SARS- CoV-2 vaccine has become avai lable during the trial and subjects can request to be unblinded. The censoring rules to avoid any bias for such subjects will be des cribed in the SAP. 10.2.1 Safety Analysis Set (SAS) The SAS will include all subjects randomized in Phase 2b or 3 who received at least one dose of CVnCoV or placebo. The SAS will be the primary population for safety endpoints collected on all subjects (i.e. medically -attended AEs, AESI, AEs leading to wit hdrawal or trial discontinuation and SAEs) and for efficacy objectives assessing efficacy after the first dose. 10.2.2 Safety Analysis Sets 2 (SAS 2, SASsol) As solicited and unsolicited AEs are collected only for Phase 2b subjects, these analyses will then be restricted to the Phase 2b subjects. The SAS 2 population will include all Phase 2b subjects of the SAS and will be used for unsolicited AEs analysis. The SASsol population will include all Phase 2b subjects of the SAS with at least one diary collection in dicating the occurrence or lack of occurrence of solicited AEs and will be used for solicited AEs analysis. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 121 of 162 10.2.3 Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) The EAS will include all subjects randomized in Phase 2b or Phase 3 who: Received both doses of trial vaccine according to their randomization (2 doses of CVnCoV or 2 doses of placebo). Had not developed a virologically -confirmed case of COVID -19 before trial entry (based on exclusion criteria 1) or before 15 days following the second vaccination. Had not stopped the trial before 15 days following the second vaccination.

The EAS will be the primary analysis population for all efficacy endpoints (except for the key secondary efficacy endpoint related to seroconversion and for the efficacy endpoints evaluating efficacy starting after the first dose). 10.2.4 Efficacy Analysis Set for Seroconversion (EASS) The EASS population will include all subjects of the EAS who tested seronegative at baseline and Day 43 for the N protein of SARS -CoV-2 (i.e. at all the testing time points before 15 days following the second vaccination) and for whom at least one serologica l test result for N protein at 15 days followin g the second vaccination (Day 211 or 393) is available for analysis. The primary analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint related to seroconversion to the N protein of SARS -CoV-2 (asymptomatic infections) will be performed on this population. 10.2.5 Per Pr otocol Efficacy Set (PPE) The Per Protocol Efficacy set will include EAS subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at trial entry and who have no major protocol deviations that would impact the effica cy outcomes as specified in the SAP. The PPE will be a supportive population for efficacy endpoints (except for the key secondary efficacy endpoint related to seroconversion and for the efficacy seconda ry endpoint evaluating efficacy starting after the first dose). 10.2.6 Per Protocol Immunogenicity Set (PPI) The PPI set will include all Phase 2b subjects who belong to the Immunogenicity Subset (IS) {i.e. ~first 600 subjects enrolled into each of the 2 age groups in Phase 2b ( 18-60 and 61 years of age) } and who: Received both doses as randomized and within the windows defined in the protocol. Have no major protocol deviations expecting to impact the immunogenicity outcomes as specified in the SAP. Have not received medical treatments (such as blood products, immunoglobulin therapy) that may interfere with one or both of the proposed immunogenicity measurements.

An SAP for the interim and final analyses will be prepared and finalized at the latest prior to database locks. This document w ill provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all trial objectives and the handling of missing data. All analyses planned for the final analysis will also be regenerated for the 1- year follow- up. 10.3.2 Demographic, Medical History, and Other Baseline Characteristics Data will be summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics (e.g. age, gender, height, weight), medical history, baseline immune status, and all safety measurements using descriptive statistics (quantitative data) and contingency tables (qualitative data) overall, by vaccine group, and by age group and vaccine group. 10.3.3 Trial Vaccine Administration The administrations of CVnCoV or control will be listed and the number of subjects actually receiving the vaccination doses will be summarized by vaccine group. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 124 of 162 10.3.4 Concomitant Medication and Vaccinations Concomitant medication/vaccination after the start of the trial will be listed and summarized by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemica l term, overall and by vaccine group. 10.3.5 Efficacy Analyses 10.3.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis Primary Efficacy Analysis In primary efficacy analysis, the VE, defined as the percent reduction in the frequency of any COVID -19 cases (according to primary case definitions) in vaccinated subjects compared with subjects who received placebo will be calculat ed with exact 95%* CI as follows: VE = 1 - RR = 1 - (ARV/ARP) = 1 - {p / r (1 -p)} where ARV = attack rate in vaccinated group = nv/Nv = number of subjects reporting at least one COVID -19 episode in the CVnCoV group / total follow -up time of evaluable subjec ts in the CVnCoV group (number of person- month). ARP = attack rate in placebo group = np/Np = number of subjects reporting at least one COVID -19 episode in the placebo group / total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the placebo group (number of person -month). RR = relative risk = ARV/ARP p = proportion of COVID -19 cases (according to primary case definition) coming from the CVnCoV group among all cases = nv/(nv+np). r = ratio of total follow -up time of evaluable subjects in the CVnCoV group over total follow - up time of evaluable subjects in the placebo group = Nv/Np. *Level of CI may be slightly adjusted due to the sequential design (see Section 10.3.8). The statistical hypotheses for the primary efficacy endpoint is: H0A: VE 30% versus H 1A: VE > 30% A is related to COVID -19 cases of any severity The trial will be successful if either the lower limit (LL) of the exact 2- sided 95% (to be slightly adjusted to consider the sequential design) CI of VE endpoint is > 30% for all COVID -19 cases of any severity or if the lower limit (LL) of the exact 2- sided 95% CI of VE endpoint is > 20% for severe to moderate COVID -19 cases. If the 2 interim analyses and the final analysis for COVID -19 cases of any severity are performed after 56/111 and 160 cases ha ve been reported, respectively, the 1- sided -risk to consider at the time of final analysis according to O'Brien- Fleming type error spending function will be 0.02281 and efficacy will be demonstrated at the final analysis if 53 cases or less over 160 are in the CVnCoV group (observed VE 50.5 %). To note, the rule in Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 125 of 162 terms of split of cases to demonstrate efficacy can slightly differ if r 1 (total follow -up time different in both groups). Sensitivity Analysis As a key sensitivity analysis, the time to first -occurrence of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 cases (according to primary case definitions) will be analyzed. The Kaplan- Meier curves will display the estim ated probabilities of not developing COVID -19 and log- rank test will be performed. The time to first -occurrence of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 (date of symptoms onset) will start 15 days following the second vaccination. Subjects who do not develop COVID -19 will be censored at the date of trial termination or cut-off date for analysis whichever comes first. An additional sensitivity analysis may include a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for relevant bas eline covariates specified in the SAP. A subgroup analysis of region (LATAM vs EUROP) on the primary endpoint will also be performed. More details on the analysis methods will be described in the SAP. 10.3.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses Statistical tes ting of the 4 key secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed according to the conditional hierarchical testing procedure using the order defined in the objective/endpoints sections. Consequently: Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to moderate and severe cases will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective . Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to severe cases will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective and the key seconda ry objective on m oderate and severe cases. Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to (RT -PCR positive) cases of \"wild type\" (i.e., \"UK\" (B.1.1.7) will be demonstrated only if ther e is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective and the key secondary objective on moderate and severe cases and severe cases . Efficacy of CVnCoV in regard to asymptomatic infection (seroconversion to the N protein of the virus) will be demonstrated only if there is successful demonstration of the primary efficacy objective and the k ey secondary objective on moderate and severe cases and key secondary objectives on severe cases and on \"wild type\" (i.e., WT/D614G lineages these endpoints will be analyzed as exploratory endpoints without success criteria testing. To assess the efficacy in the prevention of \"w ild type\" (i.e., WT/D614G lineages severe disease and asymptomatic infections , similar an alyses to those performed on the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed. The efficacy will be demonstrated if the LL of Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 126 of 162 the exact 2- sided 95% CI of VE is above 30% for \"w ild type\" (i.e., to disease , 10% for severe disease and above 0% for asymptomatic infections. Other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary effica cy endpoint but no formal testing will be performed for those endpoints. For efficacy after the first dose, the time to first -occurrence of virologically -confirmed COVID -19 (date of symptom onset) will start after the first vaccination. The BoD will be analyzed using 2 different scoring systems. Both BoD scoring systems place more weight on effica cy against severe COVID -19 disease or severe disease as reflected by hospitaliza tion or death. In addition, VE and associated CI will be calculated for each of the BoD categories. 10.3.5.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Analyses The proportions of COVID -19 cases of any severity caused by identified SARS- CoV-2 VOCs and mild, moderate, and severe COVID -19 cases (according to primary case definition) among all cases will be summarized by group. Description of frequencies and percentages will be provided by group for subjects who: Need supplemental oxygenation due to COVID -19. Need mec hanical ventilation due to COVID -19. Are hospitalized due to COVID -19. Died due to COVID -19. Died due to any cause. This will be done for events occurring 15 days following the second trial vaccination (full VE) and then for events occurring at any tim e after the first trial vaccination. The VE in the prevention of first episodes of virologically -confirmed cases of COVID -19 of any severity will be reassessed on all subjects whatever their serological status at baseline for cases occurring 15 days following the second trial vaccination and then for all cases occurring after the first dose. Finally, the number and percentage of subjects who developed a second episode of COVID -19 will be displayed by group. 10.3.6 Secondary and Exploratory Immunogenicity Ana lysis No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. Descriptive statistics for the immunogenicity endpoints will be provided for each vaccine group and overall, and by vaccine group and age groups. Data will be presented after each vaccine dose. The following analyses will be performed for antibody levels to the SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein and for neutralizing antibodies overall and separately in subjects seronegative at baseline and in subjects seropositive at baseline: Geometric mean titers (GMT s) will be summarized with their 95% CI at each blood sampling time point. The Fold Change (FC) from baseline will be computed for each subject and Geometric mean of FC (GMFC) will be displayed with their 95% CI at each blood sampling time point after bas eline. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 127 of 162 Non-detectable antibodies will be arbitrary replaced by half of the detection cut -off for GMT and GMFC computations purpose. For each readout, the number and percentage of subjects SARS -CoV-2 seronegative a t baseline for who a seroconversion is observed will be summarized and presented at ea ch blood sampling time point after baseline with exact 95% CI. Seroconversion is defined a s detectable antibodies in the serum. Percentages of subjec ts seroconverting for SARS S protein antibodies and SARS- CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies will be summarized. The frequency of immunecell populations induced by the vaccine will be summarized. Further characterization of the T-cell immune response may be done with other technologies like ELISpot, CyTOF and/or analysis of genomic biomarkers. Additional immunogenici ty analyses including graphs will be described in the SAP as applicable. 10.3.7 Safety Analysis No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. The descriptive safety analyses will be performed overall by vaccine group, by age group and vaccine group, and by serostatus and vaccine group. Solicited AEs: The frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each solicited local and systemic AE within 7 days after each vaccination will be presented by intensity and overall. For subjects with more than 1 episode of the same AE within 7 days after a vaccination, the maximum intensity will be used for tabulations. Similar tabulations will be performed for solicited systemic AEs by relationship to trial vaccination. Solicited local AEs will be by definition considered as related to the trial vaccine. Time to onset (in days) and duration (in days) will also be summarized for each solicited local and systemic AEs. Summary tables showing the occurrence of at least one local or systemic solicited AE within 7 days after each vaccination will also be presented. Unsolicited AEs: Unsolicited AEs including SAEs and AESIs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). The frequency and percentage of subjects reporting each unsolicited AE within the 28 days after each vaccination and overall will be tabulated at the SOC and PT levels. Similar tables will be provided for: related unsolicited AEs, Grade 3 or higher unsolicited AEs, medically -attended AEs that occur within 6 months after the second trial vaccination, SAEs, related SAEs, AESIs, related AESIs, AEs leading to withdrawal or trial discontinuation and SAEs resulting in death through 1 year after the second trial vaccination. When an AE occurs more than once for a subject within the 28 days post 1 vaccination, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine group will be counted. Only AE post first vaccination will be considered in the summary tables. AE starting prior to the first vaccination will be recorded as medical history. Data listings of fatal and SAEs will be provided by subject. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 128 of 162 Vital signs will be summarized by descriptive statistics at each visit, including cha nge from baseline, and a listing will be provided. 10.3.8 Interim Analysis Two interim analyses will be performed for this trial by an unblinded independent statistician and reviewed by the DSMB when 56/111 cases of COVID -19 of any severity (meeting the primar y efficacy case definition) are observed. This analysis will aim to assess early high efficacy or futility on the primary efficacy endpoint and will be done on the EAS population only. The safety data that is available at this time point will also be descr ibed. For the analysis of early demonstration of high efficacy or futility, cumulative O'Brien -Fleming type error spending function [ 36] is used to provide statistical stopping rules for high efficacy ( -boundaries) and futility ( -boundaries) for the interim analysis, based on the information accumulated until that specific interim stage. At the interim stage, if the p- value for the test of the pr imary objective is lower than the -boundary, a high level of efficacy for CVnCoV will be declared. Conversely, demonstration of futility will occur if the p- value is higher than the -boundary. The interim analyses are planned to occur when 56/111 cases o f COVID -19 of any severity have been observed. Table 8 below shows the boundaries for demonstrating high efficacy or futility, calculated on a 1- sided p- value scale using the cumulative error spending function. At the time of the interim analysis only descriptive statistics such as the point estimate of VE and respective 95% CI for key secondary objectives will be displayed, no formal testing will be done to protect the overall type one error at the final analyses of 160 cases. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 129 of 162 Table 8 Two Stage Group Sequential Design with Interim Analyses at 56 and 111 Cases and Final Analysis at 160 Cases *Rules in terms of split of cases to demonstrate efficacy/futility can slightly differ if the total number of evaluable subjects is unequal in both groups (r 1). If the interim analysis is performed exactly after 56/111 c ases have been reported, a 1-sided p- value lower than 0.00015/ 0.00707 (i.e. lower limit of the 2 -sided 99.99%/99. 3% CI > 30%) will lead to the conclusion of high efficacy, while a 1- sided p- value higher tha n 0.66345/ 0.12356 will result in the demonstration of futility. Otherwise, the final analysis will be performed at 160 cases. Similarly, if the num ber of evaluable subjects is equal in both groups, it means that the trial will conclude early high efficacy if 9 /32 cases or less over 56/111 are coming from the CVnCoV group, while futility of the trial will be demonstrated if 25 /40 cases or more are coming from the CVnCoV group. Of note, the actual boundaries used for decision making would depend on the exact number of cases occurring and reported at each analysis (interim and final). The boundaries will be applied in a nonbinding way as there are many other factors tha t would be part of the decision- making process. 10.3.9 Missing Data and Discontinuation Analysis of vaccination variables will be done on a valid case basis, i.e., for missing observations, no imputation for missing data, such as last observation carried forward, will be applied. For SARS- CoV-2 RBD of S protein antibodies, concentration values marked as below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to 0.5*LLOQ. No imputation of missing values will be done for any analysis (except the imputation for missing partial dates of AEs and concomitant medication as specified in the SAP). Currently no replacement of drop- out subjects is foreseen. Reasons for discontinuation from the trial vaccine and trial will be listed and summarized.

All data entered into the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents at the trial site, except eDiary entries of solicited AEs , which are automatically integrated into the eCRF . Any changes to the data entered into the electronic data capture system will be recorded in the audit trail. The Investigator will maintain adequate and accurate records for each subject entered into the trial. Source documents such as hospital, clinic or office charts, laboratory reports, tria l worksheets, and signed informed consent documents are to be included in the Investigator's files along with subject trial records. The Sponsor or the CRO will check eCRF entries against source documents according to the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The consent form will include a statement by which subjects allow the Sponsor or designee, as well as authorized regulatory agencies, to have direct access to source data that support data of the eCRF (e.g., subject medic al files, appointment books, original laboratory records, etc.). The Sponsor or designee, bound by secrecy, will not disclose subject identities or personal medical information. 11.2 Audit and Inspection The trial site also may be subject to quality assurance a udits by the Sponsor or designees. In this circumstance, the Sponsor -designated auditor will contact the site in advance to arrange an auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, where the vaccine is stored and prepared, and any other facility used during the trial. In addition, there is the possibility that this trial may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including those of local or foreign governments. If the trial site is contacted for an inspect ion by a regulatory body, the Sponsor should be notified immediately. The Investigator and institution guarantee direct access for quality assurance auditors and inspectors to all trial documents and source data. 11.3 Monitoring Data for each subject will be recorded in the subject's eCRF. In accordance with GCP, and regulatory requirements, the trial monitor will carry out source document verification at regular intervals to ensure that the data collected in the eCRF are accurate and reliable. The frequency of monitoring visits will be determined by the rate of subject recruitment. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 131 of 162 The compliance with the protocol will be examined with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria, therapies leading to elimination and timing and availability of planned assessments. Protocol deviations will be monitored on an ongoing basis during the trial and closed before database lock. Protocol deviations will be classified as important or non-important . The detailed definitions of important protocol deviations leading to elimination of subjects from analysis will be provided in the final version of the SAP and/or in the final signed minutes of the data review meeting. The monitoring visits also provide the Sponsor with the opportuni ty to ensure the Investigators' obligations and all applicable International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and regulatory requirements are being met. The Investigators must permit the monitor, t he IEC, the Sponsor's and CRO's auditors and representatives from regulatory authorities direct access to all trial -related documents and pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the eCRF. Subject confidentiality will be protected at all times. An electronic medical record may be the source document; however, the trial site must provide a standard operating procedure (SOP) that details review and approval of data entries by the Principal Investigator(s) (audit trail). Furthermore, the electronic medica l record must be compliant with the applicable regulations and with the expectations of each country. 11.4 Data Management and Coding All data derived from the trial will remain the property of the Sponsor. The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals, e.g., the CRO. Data management of this trial will be performed by a CRO. The CRO's responsibilities will include setting up a relevant database and data transfer mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of queries. Data generated within this clinica l trial will be handled according to the data management plan and SAP or the relevant SOPs of the data management and biostatistics departments of the CRO. Trial sites will ent er data in the eCRF. Access to the eCRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly participating in the trial. All data entered into the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents at the trial site, except for solicited AEs recorded in the eDiary (see Section 11.3). The subject's eDiary entries of solicited AEs after vaccination will be considered source data and will be integrated automatically in the eCRF. This may include electronic source document verification. Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. Medical coding will use MedDRA for concomitant diseases and AEs and WHO D rug Dictionary for medications. Missing or inconsistent data will be queried to the Investigators for clarification. Subsequent modifications to the database will be documented.

After completion of the trial, all documents and data relating to the trial will be kept in an orderly manner by the Investigator in a secure trial file. This file will be available for audits by the Sponsor/CRO or inspections by the regulatory agencies. Essential documents should be retained for 15 years after end of the trial. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the trial site of when these documents no longer need to be retained. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor before destroying any trial -related documentation. In addition, all subject medical records and other source documentation will be kept for the maximum time required by the hospital, institution, or medical practice and in accordance with the nat ional requirements. If an Investigator moves, withdraws from the trial, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility. Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the Sponsor. In this trial processing of personal data will be carried out on behalf of Sponsor by CRO/the data processor, governed by a contract and strictly according and subject to the Genera l Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any applicable data protection rules and regulations. The Sponsor and the CRO/data processor implement appropriate technica l and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Quality control will occur at each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and hav e been processed correctly. The Sponsor will ensure oversight of any trial -related duties and functions carried out on its behalf, including trial -related duties and functions that are subcontracted to another party by the CRO. This trial will be registere d on ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with applicable laws or publication policy and may also be registered on other publicly accessible websites as necessary. 13.1 Data Protection All information generated in this trial is considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed to any person or entity not directly involved with the trial unless prior written consent is gained from the Sponsor. However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB/IEC personnel, the Sponsor, and its authorized representatives are allow ed full access to the records. All personal details will be treated as confidential by the I nvestigator and staff a t the CRO. Prior to the processing, the Sponsor performs an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data (according to Article 35 of the GDPR). Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor.

These data will be captured on the relevant eCRF pages for cases of COVID -19 that occur in the trial, which are expected outcomes of the trial. Therefore, COVID -19 and its complications/sequel ae as well as all symptoms listed in S ection 9.2.1.2 will not be reported according to the standard expedited process for SAEs, even though the event may meet the criteria for an SAE. However please note that all fatal cases result ing from COVID -19 and its complications/sequelae and from all other events will be reported as SAEs and need to be reported to the CRO within 24 hours (see section Reporting of SAEs) . An AE form should be completed for any symptoms not listed in S ection 9.2.1.2 . Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) Definition of an AE: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. All AEs fall into one of 2 categories: \"non- serious\" or \"serious\". Examples of an AE include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (i.e., not rela ted to a known concomitant disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration of the study vaccine even though it may have been present before the start of the trial. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug i nteraction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study vaccine or a concomitant medication/vaccination. An adverse effect of the study vaccine or concomitant medication/vaccination. An accident or injury. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition: Medical or surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves a re not AEs, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 152 of 162 Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the period of observation (see below) and did not worsen during trial. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the trial that do not worsen. Death is not considered an AE but an outcome. Definition of an SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death. Is life -threatening. The term 'life- threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnig ht stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitaliz ation or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalization\" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disr uption. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of the subject. Is an important medical event: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 153 of 162 one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events shou ld usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug a buse. Assessment of Intensity and Causality Assessment of Intensity The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each unsolicited AE and SAE reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories. Absent (Grade 0): No AE. Mild (Grade 1): An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. Moderate (Grade 2): An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal everyday a ctivities. Severe (Grade 3): An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed a s severe. An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study vaccine and each occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE. Causality will be determined as: Related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study vaccine and the AE. Unrelated : There is no reasonable causal relationship between the study vaccine and the AE. A \"reasonable possibility\" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship c annot be ruled out. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy or vaccination, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to the study vaccine administration will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult the Investigator's Brochure for CVnCoV in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the CRO. However, it is very important that the Investigat or always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the CRO . Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 154 of 162 The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updat ed causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. All local solicited symptoms are considered related to vaccination. Recording of AEs and/or SAEs AE and SAE Recording The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs/SAEs observed during the tria l i.e. from the time the subject gives informed consent until the end of the trial visit or until the last follow -up visit, for the period described in Table 4. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. SAEs need to be reported to the CRO within 24 hours (see section Reporting of SAEs). It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the subject's medica l records to the CRO in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF screen. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the CRO. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to the CRO. The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or ot her clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE (except for COVID -19, which should not be recorded as an AE in this trial) . AESIs and cases of overdose must be documented and m edically assessed by the Investigator and the outcome described on the SAE/AESI/overdose/misuse report form. Pregnancy must be documented and medically assessed by the Investigator and the outcome described on the Pregnancy Report Form which is to be sent to the CRO. Follow -up of Unsolicited AEs and SAEs The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplementa l measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the CRO to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the trial or during the follow -up period, the Investigator will provide the CRO with a copy of any post -mortem findings including histopathology. New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 155 of 162 The Investigator will submit any updated SAE da ta to the CRO within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of AEs Unsolicited AE Reporting It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that occur during the trial in the source documents. AEs will be elicited by asking the subject a non - leading question, for example, 'Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?'. The Investigator must document all AEs , described in Section 9.3, that occur during the reporting period set in this protocol ( Table 4) on the screens provided in the eCRF. The following approach will be taken for documentation: All Adverse Events (whether serious or non- serious) which need to be reported (not COVID -19) must be documented on the \"Adverse Event\" screen of the eCRF. All AEs will be described using the sign, symptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE eCRF in standard medical terminology in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions. Each AE will be defined as serious or non- serious according to the definitions in the section above. The Investigator will evaluate the severity of each AE and causal relationship of the event to the study vaccine. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting If the AE is serious , the Investigator must complete and sign, in addition to the \"Adverse Event\" screen in the eCRF, an \"SAE/AESI/overdose/misuse report form\" at the time the SAE is detected. Email or facsimile transmission of the SAE/AESI/overdose/misuse paper report form is the preferred method to transmit this information to the CRO/medical monitor or the SAE coordinator. This form must be marked as \"initial\" report and sent immedi ately (i.e., within 24 hours upon becoming aware of the SAE) to the CRO. The Investigator will document the date when any employee/co- Investigator had first been aware of the report and fax or email all SAE reports (initial and follow -up reports) even if t hey are incomplete within 24 hours upon receipt to the safety department of the Sponsor or CRO. In rare circumstances and in the absence of email or facsimile equipment, notification by phone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via phone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE report form within the designated reporting time frames. The \" initial SAE report \" should be as complete as possible, including causality assessment, details of the current illness and (S)AE, the reason why the event was considered serious; date of onset and end date (if applicable); diagnostic procedures and treatment of the event; relevant medical history and concomitant medication and Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 156 of 162 vaccinations; and action taken with the study vaccine(s). The SAE report form must be signed by the Investigator or his authorized designee(s) . Investigator must inform the CRO about AESIs and cases of overdose by applying the same timelines and rules of SAE reporting. Determination of Expectedness, Reference Safety Information Expectedness will be determined by the CRO according to the designated Reference Safety Information provided in the current Investigator's Brochure. Any updates or substantial amendments will be considered accordingly. Reporting Period For the purpose of this trial, the period of observation for collection of AEs required to be reported in the CRF extends from the time the subject gives informed consent until the end of the trial, for the period described in Section 5.4. The reporting period of medically -attended AEs, AESIs, SAEs, and intercurrent medical conditions is defined in Table 4. All AEs that occur in the course of the clinical trial regardless of the causal relationship should be monitored and followed- up as described in Section 9.3 and Table 4 until the outcome is known or it is evident that no further information can be obtained. There must be documented reasonable attempts to obtain follow -up information and outcome. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up procedures are performed. Post -Trial Events If the Investigator becomes aware of any SAE that occurred after the end of the trial but is considered to be caused by the study vaccine(s), this must be reported to the CRO. These SAEs will be processed by the CRO. Instructions for how to submit these SAEs will be provided in a handout in the Investigator Site File. Reporting of Other Events Reporting and Follow -up of Pregnancies Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for enrollment in this trial, but subjects could potentially become pregnant during their active participation in this trial. Any pregnancy in a subject having received a study vaccine must be reported to the CRO within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence, using a pregnancy reporting form. If the subject becomes pregnant during the trial, she will not receive any further doses of any Sponsor -supplied study vaccine. The pregnancy must be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, a nd the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if the intended duration of safety follow -up for the trial has ended. The trial site should maintain contact w ith pregnant subjects to obtain pregnancy outcome information. Any complications during pregnancy (e.g., gestational diabetes or eclampsia) are to be considered as an AE; however, these complications could result in the event being an Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 157 of 162 SAE. Spontaneous abor tions, fetal death, stillbirth and congenital anomalies reported in the baby are always considered as SAEs. The pregnancy by itself will not be processed as an SAE. The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days within completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the CRO of the outcome of the pregnancy by submitting a Follow -up Pregnancy Report. Reporting and Follow -up of SUSARs a nd Other Regulatory Reporting Any SUSAR will be the subject of expedited reporting. The Sponsor and/or the CRO shall ensure that all relevant information about a SUSAR that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to the relevant competent authorities and IEC(s) within 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor of such a case and that relevant follow- up information is communicated within an additional 8 days. The Sponsor will report all serious and unexpected AEs, which are judged by either the Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship (suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, SUSARs), to the competent authority, the concerned Independent Ethics Committee and Investigators according to applicable law. Post-trial SUSARs that occur after the subject has completed the clinical trial must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor. Reporting and Follow -up of Misuse and Overdose Drug misuse and drug overdose should always be reported in the same forma t (i.e., on SAE form) and within the same timelines as a SAE, even if they may not result in an adverse outcome. When an \"overdose\" or \"drug misuse\" of the study vaccine occurs without an AE, the Investigator should also complete an \"SAE/AESI/overdose/mis use report form\" and send this to the Sponsor's safety contact. It should be clearly stated that no AE was observed. If no SAE is associated, misuse/overdose will be assessed as non- serious. In this case, there is no need to complete the \"Averse Event\" screen in the eCRF. Product Quality Complaints Pharmaceutical Technical Complaints associated with the study vaccine must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (refer to the pharmacy manual for details). The same reporting timelines as for SAEs apply. Clinical Trial Protocol CV-NCOV -004 Site-Specific Sub-study COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine Version 3.0 (29 March 2021) CONFIDENTIAL Page 158 of 162 Appendix 11 Protocol Amendment History The trial was initiated using protocol version 1.0. Protocol version 3 .0: 29 March 2021 This amendment wa s considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. None of the below changes affect the safety and well -being of subjects; the benefit -risk ratio remains favorable. Section # and Name Description of Important Change Brief Rationale Throughout The co -primary objective (and corresponding endpoint) regarding the efficacy of CVnCoV in the prevention of moderate to severe COVID -19 was changed to a secondary objective. Subsequently, the corresponding statistical calculations were also updated. It is now generally accepted that a vaccine that protects against disease of any severity, will also (or even better) protect against more severe disease, therefore reducing the need to maintain this as a primary endpoint and thereby preserving the alpha. Throughout Addition of a key secondary efficacy objective (and corresponding endpoin t) to demonstrate the efficacy of CVnCoV in the prevention of COVID -19 caused by the \"wild type\" (i.e., \"UK\" (B.1.1.7) strai n. Various strains have been identified since the original protocol and the efficacy to each individual strain should also be evaluated. Throughout Addition of an exploratory objective (and corresponding endpoint) to demonstrate the efficacy on any other strains. Various strains have been identified since the original protocol and the efficacy to each individual strain should also be evaluated. Throughout Decrease in the number of subjects needed for exploratory immunogenicity from 400 to 200.
