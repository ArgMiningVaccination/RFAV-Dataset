In t his updated version of Essentials, there are new chapters focusing on current popular topics in plasti c surgery, including lymphedema, gender affirmation surgery and composite tissue allotransplantation . Previous chapters were modernized and now include color photographs. The book was written primarily for medical students and other students of plastic surgery to obtain a brief introduction into the specialty and provide references for further reading. It is not designed to be a comprehensive text, but rather an outline that can be read in the limited time available in a burgeoning curriculum. It is designed to be read from beginning to end. Plastic surgery had its beginning nearly 3000 years ago, when Sushruta , an Indian surgeon, reconstructed the nose by transferring a flap of cheek and then forehead skin. It is a modern field, stimulated by the challenging reconstructive problems of the unfortunate victims of the World Wars. The advent of the operatin g microscope has thrust the plastic surgeon of today into the forefront of advances in small vessel and nerve repair, culminating in the successful replantation of amputated parts as small as distal fingers and bypassing of lymphatic vessels, only a few mi llimeters in diameter . Further more , these techniques have been utilized to perform the first composite tissue transplantations of both hands and partial faces. The field is broad and varied and this book covers the many areas of involvement and training of today's plastic surgeons. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is proud to provide complimentary online copies of the Plastic Surgery Essentials for Students handbook to all medical students in the United States and Canada. Continually updated inform ation about various procedures in plastic surgery and other medical information of use to medical students and other physicians can be found at the ASPS/PSF website at www.plasticsurgery.org and the Plastic Surgery Education Network at www.psenetwork.org . The information in this book has also been converted to an app in the Android Market and the Apple App store under the name Plastic Surgery Essentials for Students. 5 CHAPTER 2 CAREERS IN PLASTIC SURGERY Chad M. Teven, MD and Ash Patel , MBChB, FACS Plastic and reconstructive surgery is one of the most diverse specialties within the field of medicine. Unlike many other fields, it is not confined to a single organ system, region of the body, or patient population. The Greek term \"plastikos\" mea ns to mold or to shape, and this is where our specialty derives its name and underlying principles. By reshaping, remolding, and manipulating both soft and hard tissues, plastic and reconstructive surgeons help patients with a myriad of issues. The goal of our specialty is to restore form and function, and to do so in an aesthetic fashion. The first known plastic surgery procedures on living patients date back to 600 BCE, when the Indian surgeon Sushruta offered reconstruction to people who had had their noses surgically removed as a form of punishment. As early as 100 BCE, the Romans began performing procedures to improve self -image and cosmetic appearance. Since, plastic surgery has come a long way and now is integral to the treatment of patients with disfigurement due to trauma, burns, scarring, cancer, infection, and more. As opposed to treating specific conditions with a limited set of procedures, plastic surgeons use skills and principles based on anatomy, physiology, and tissue transfer when mana ging patients. The challenge of plastic surgery is the combination of the surgeon's judgment and problem -solving abilities with surgical technique at any given moment. Because of this approach, the plastic surgeon often acts as a \"last resort\" surgica l consultant to surgeons and physicians in the treatment of many wound problems and is often called \"the surgeon's surgeon.\" While plastic surgeons offer life -saving procedures in many situations, an additional important theme in our specialty is the impr ovement in quality of life for patients. Plastic surgery not only restores body function, but helps to renew or improve a patient's body image and sense of self -esteem. Along with psychiatrists, plastic surgeons are especially equipped to handle the patie nt's problem of body image and to help the patient deal with either real or perceived problems. Consistent with these far-reaching goals, the scope of the operations performed by plastic surgeons is broad. As outlined by The American Board of Plastic Surg ery,\" the specialty of plastic surgery deals with the repair, replacement, and reconstruction of physical defects of form or function involving the skin, musculoskeletal system, craniomaxillofacial structures, hand, extremities, breast and trunk, and exter nal genitalia. It uses aesthetic surgical principles not only to improve undesirable qualities of normal structures, but in all reconstructive procedures as well. Among the problems managed by plastic surgeons are congenital anomalies of the head and neck. Clefts of the lip and palate are the most 6 common, but many other head and neck congenital deformities exist. In addition, the plastic surgeon treats injuries to the face, including fractures of craniofacial skeleton. Craniofacial surgery is a discipline developed to reposition and reshape the bones of the face and skull through inconspicuous incisions. Severe deformities of the cranium and face, which previously were uncorrectable or corrected with great difficulty, can now be better reconstructed employi ng these new techniques. Such deformities may result from a tumor resection, congenital defect, previous surgery, or previous injury. Treatment of tumors of the head and neck and reconstruction of these regions after the removal of these tumors is also wit hin the scope of plastic surgery. Another area of expertise for the plastic surgeon is hand surgery, including the management of acute hand injuries, the correction of hand deformities and reconstruction of the hand. Microvascular surgery, a technique th at allows the surgeon to connect blood vessels of one millimeter or less in diameter, is a necessary skill in hand surgery for re - implanting amputated parts or in moving large pieces of tissue from one part of the body to another. Defects of the body sur face resulting from burns or from injuries, previous surgical treatment, or congenital deformities may also be treated by the plastic surgeon. One of the most common of such procedures is reconstruction of the breast following mastectomy. Breasts may also be reduced in size, increased in size, or changed in shape to improve the final aesthetic appearance. Operations of this type are sometimes cosmetic in purpose, but in cases where the patient has a significant asymmetry or surgical defect, the procedure se rves important therapeutic purposes. The most highly visible area of plastic surgery is aesthetic or cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery includes facelifts, breast enlargements and enhancement, nasal surgery, body sculpting, and other similar operations t o enhance one's appearance. The results of the plastic surgeon's expertise and ability are highly visible, leading to a high degree of professional and personal satisfaction. Plastic surgery is an innovative specialty. Advances such as transplantation , microvascular surgery, fat grafting, and various medical devices have been spearheaded and advanced by plastic surgeons. The discipline requires meticulous attention to detail, sound judgment and technical expertise in performing the intricate and compl ex procedures associated with plastic surgery. In addition, plastic surgeons must possess a flexible approach that will enable them to work daily with a tremendous variety of surgical problems. Most importantly, the plastic surgeon must have creativity, cu riosity, insight, and an understanding of human psychology. Students interested in a career in plastic and reconstructive surgery would benefit from rotating on their institution's plastic surgery service to gain experience in and exposure to the field. In addition, finding a mentor within the field to help guide in one's development, decision -making, and to answer questions is advised. 7 The pathway to a career in plastic surgery can follow in one of two ways. The first is through an integrated or categorical plastic surgery residency program. Programs are six years in duration; however, several programs also dedicate one or more years to research. The other route, known as the independent route, is to complete residency in general surgery, otolaryngology, urology, orthopedic surgery, or neurosurgery and then complete a three -year independent plastic surgery residency. After the completion of either the integrated or independent pathway, one is eligible to sit for the plastic surgery board examination. In addition, one can attain further training in a plastic surgery fellowship program. Fellowships are typically one year in duration and are offered for specialty training in hand surgery, craniofacial surgery, microsurgery, facial aesthetics, cosmetic surgery, body contouring surgery, and burn surgery. Tradit ionally, plastic surgeons have established their practices in large urban settings. However, there is an increasing need for more plastic surgeons in the smaller communities and rural areas of this country - many metropolitan areas with populations of 65,000 to 268,000 have no plastic surgeons, leaving many areas needing plastic surgery expertise. There are approximately 7,000 board certified plastic surgeons in the United States; many of those currently certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery received certification in the past ten years. Despite this recent rapid growth, there are opportunities for plastic surgeons in community and academic practice. Plastic surgery is an old specialty with references that date back thousands of years. It has su rvived and flourished because it is a changing specialty built by imaginative, creative and innovative surgeons with a broad background and education. The future of this specialty is bright and will continue to progress because of students like you who choose to enter this special field.

Not so much that it may delight the eye, but that it might buoy up the spirit, and help the mind of the afflicted.\" Gaspare Tagliacozzi (1545 -1597) The origins of Plastic Surgery as a distinct field follows the history of scientific advancements, influenced by the scourge of need from social influences and wartime atrocities. Key historical figures and milestones are described in the long and illustri ous history of the development of the modern innovative field of Plastic Surgery. I.PLASTIC SURGERY ORIGINS IN ANTIQUITY A.The term \"plastic\" in plastic surgery comes from the Greek \"plastikos\" which translates to \"moldable\". B.Ancient plastic surgery has its origins in the management of wounds, with historical reference to sewing wound edges with fibers or wound edges approximated with insect mandibles. C.References in the Edwin Smyth Papyrus (~3000 to 2500 BC) to plastic surgerycases include descriptions of treating fractures, wounds, dislocations, sores and tumors.1.Early wound healing remedies included use of grease, honey, linen and swabs. D.The first semblance to modern reconstruction is found in India with nasalreconstruction. 1.Ancient cultures often punished adulterers, thieves and prisoners of war by mutilating their noses as a way of public shaming. E.Famed Indian surgeon Sushruta wrote in the Ayurvedam (Indian sacred book of medical knowledge) descriptions of transposed flaps for nasal reconstructi on (~600 BC).1.He is often credited with descriptions of the first forehead flap for nasal reconstruction, but this is controversial and unknown as the first published report of the forehead flap appears to be in 1794 (figure 1). F.Greek medical influence i s grounded in the writings of Hippocrates in the Corpus Hippocraticum (~460 BC) where descriptions of cauterization of raw surfaces, reduction of displaced fractures and trephination for hematoma evacuation aredescribed. G.Roman influence in plastic surger y can be found in the famous volumes De Medicina (~30AD) by Aulus Cornelius Celsus with descriptions of vessel ligature, lip flap reconstruction and wound closure by an advancement flap. 10 H. Writings by Claudius Galen (~129-201 AD) are famed for their intricate anatomical descriptions of muscles and cranial nerves. Figure 1. First reports of the forehead flap for nasal reconstruction From BL. Letter to the editor. Gentleman's Magazine 1794;64:891-892. II. PLASTIC SURGERY IN THE MIDDLE AGES A. Series of medical texts written by Oribasius (325-403AD) titled Synagogae Medicae describe reconstructive procedures aimed at rebuilding the cheek, nose, ears and eyebrows. B. The middle ages brought about the first independent surgical treatise in the form of Al Tasrif - On Surgery, written by Abu-l-Qasim or Albucasis (~936-1013AD) in which surgical instruments, cautery, and the first description of a syringe with a piston was given. C. The middle ages also brought about the advent of western universities which ushered anatomical classes and cadaver dissections, and anatomists as surgeons. 1. The advent of the printing press (1440AD) also allowed for the widespread dissemination of medical texts and exchange of ideas. 11 III. PLASTIC SURGERY AND THE RENAISSANCE A. Andreas Vesalius publishes his anatomical treatise De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543). B. French surgeon Ambrose Pare (1510-1590) compiled his works in Les Oeuvers, in which are described repair of cleft lip and cleft palate, in addition to disputing the practice of \"wound cleansing\" by hot cautery and pouring boiling oil into wounds. C. Gaspare Tagliacozzi (1544-1599) is widely considered the founder of plastic surgery as a distinct discipline. 1. He is credited with systematizing surgical approaches to nasal reconstruction. 2. His book De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem (On the Surgery of Injuries by Grafting) in 1597 provided step by step guidance and illustration to perform nasal repairs. (Figure 2) D. After these landmark achievements, there were limited new advances until the 19th Century. Figure 2. Nasal reconstruction with the arm flap From Tagliacozzi G. De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem. Venice: Bindoni, 1597. IV. GOLDEN AGE OF PLASTIC SURGERY A. English surgeon, Joseph Carpue composed in 1794 a letter to the editor which first described the forehead flap. His successful use of this procedure in 1814 marked the dawn of the rebirth of plastic surgery. 1. Multiple surgeons throughout Europe compared and advanced techniques in rhinoplasty, facial reconstruction, cleft lip and cleft palate repairs including key surgeons such as Carl von Grafe (1787-1840), Johann Dieffenbach (1794-1847) in Germany, and Jacque Delpech (1777-1832) in France. 12 B. The advent of anesthesia in 1846 introduced new capabilities for all surgical fields and allowed for the blossoming of the golden age of plastic surgery. C. Key Achievements in the golden age of Plastic Surgery: 1. Giuseppe Baronio (1758-1811) from Italy first describes the use of autologous skin graft in 1804. 2. First attempts at closing cleft palate defects by Roux and Von Grafe in France in 1819 and 1820, respectively. 3. Pietro Sabattini described lip reconstruction with the \"lip switch\" technique in 1838. (Figure 3) 4. Bernhard Von Langenbeck (1810-1887) outlines two mucoperichondrial flaps for cleft palate closure, described in 1862. Figure 3. Lip Switch technique described by Sabattini (1838) V. KEY FIGURES AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN MODERN PLASTIC SURGERY A. World War I created a tremendous amount of disfigured casualties with devastating reconstructive challenges which catalyzed the formation of our modern conceptualization of plastic surgeons as specialists focused on restoring bodies ravaged by war. 1. Hippolyte Morestin (1868-1919) and Charles Valadier (1873-1931) worked together, pioneering facial reconstructive surgery. 2. Sir Harold Gilles (1882-1960) - Father of the modern era of plastic surgery, developed a referral center in Europe for causalities of facial disfigurement. 3. Developed and systematically applied flap reconstructions of facial injuries. a. Employed the tubed flap, skin flaps and bone, cartilage and skin grafts. 4. Published landmark text Plastic Surgery of the Face (1920). 5. Aesthetic Plastic surgery as a distinct field is initiated with the description of the correction of prominent ears in 1881 by Edward Ely. 13 a. John Roe (1848-1915), Robert Weir (1838-1927), Jacques Joseph (1865-1934) were early pioneers Rhinoplasty. 1. Between 1916 and 1918, Johannes Esser (1877-1946) reported on local flaps commonly used today; cheek rotation, bilobed, island and \"arterialized\" flaps. 2. Training programs began developing after World War I, and spread throughout Europe and North America. 3. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons was founded in 1931 by Jacques Maliniac. 4. The American Board of Plastic Surgery was founded in 1937. 5. The Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal was founded in 1946. 6. The Plastic Surgery Foundation was established in 1948. B. Since the 1960s, new discoveries have brought about a new wave of reconstructive options. 1. Paul Tessier (1917-2008) - Father of modern craniofacial surgery, revolutionary combination of intra and extra-cranial approaches for complex cranial deformities. 2. Dawn of microsurgical techniques and advancements in knowledge of anatomy leading to free tissue transfer. 3. Angiosome concept by Taylor and Palmer in 1987 led to the development of perforator flaps (Figure 4). Figure 4. History of flap development 14 REFERENCES 1. Tagliacozzi G.

Phillips, MD and Ash Patel, MBChB, FACS Plastic surgery is a specialty defined by principles and techniques, rather than by organ system or disease process. The subdivision of plastic surgery into two types of surgical procedures\u2014reconstructive and cosmetic\u2014is another unique aspect of the specialty. While the dividing line between the two is sometimes very clear, there is often a significant amount of overlap. The goal of reconstructive surger y highlights this overlap: \"the restoration of form and function.\" Both reconstructive and aesthetic surgery rely on a detailed knowledge of anatomy and the foundational principles and techniques outlined below. I.EVALUATION AND PLANNING A.Define the defect 1.What is missing or a.Tissue layers neural network C.What is left behind? D.Is the surrounding tissue healthy, or has it been compromised (i.e. radiationtherapy, burns, traumatic injury)? E.What local tissues are availab le for use? F.What is the best way to restore form and function? G.Replace like with like: the best reconstruction will utilize tissues similar to themissing tissues (i.e., glabrous skin for reconstruction of the weight sole or I.Designing incisions. Incision design is critical, as the location of scars impacts both their visibility as well as their ability to heal. 1.Ideal incision placement a.Langer's lines: Langer, a 19 th-century anatomy professor in Vienna, first studied and described the relationship between resting skin tension andwounds. However, his studies were carried out on cadavers and were never intended to serve as a guide for surgical technique. b.Borges described relaxed skin tension lines in 1962: these lines follow thefurrows formed when skin is relaxed and are revealed by pinching the skin. (Figure 1) c.Best incision designs usually involve a combination of factorsi.Allowing for appropriate access 16 ii. Taking advantage of pre-existent scars or wrinkles iii. Placement with respect to aesthetic subunits Figure 1. Relaxed skin tension lines (RSTL) versus other skin lines From Borges A. Plast Reconstr Surg 1984;73(1):144-50. 2. Aesthetic units and subunits (Figure 2) a. Have been described for multiple anatomic regions, including breast, face, and lower extremity b. Defined by naturally-occurring concave and convex surfaces c. Scars that cross aesthetic subunits are more noticeable than those that are hidden in the boundaries between subunits 17 Figure 2. Conforming to its underlying skeleton, the surface of the nose is crossed by gentle valleys and low ridges that divide it into topographic subunits. They are the dorsum, tip, sidewalls, alar lobules, and soft tri angles. From Burget G, et al. The subunit principle in nasal reconstruction. Plast Reconstr Surg 1985 ;76(2):239 E. Methods excision 1.Elliptical a.Most common method b.Usually designed with length: width ratio of 3:1 2.Wedge a.Used for lesions located at or near a free tissue margin 3.Circulara.May be utilized when shorter scar is desired 4.Seriala.For large lesions which cannot be excised in one stage (i.e. congenital nevi) b.Frequently used in conjunction with tissue expansion II.THE RECONSTRUCTIVE LADDER A.Conceptual framework for understanding reconstructive options (Figure 3) 1.Starts with most simple option: i.e., healing by secondary intention 2.Progresses to more complex options in a step -wise fashion 18 Figure 3. An early version of the reconstructive ladder From Janis J, et al. The new reconstructive ladder: modifications to the traditional model. Jan;127 Suppl:205S-212S. B. The \"reconstructive elevator\" (Figure 4) 1. Proposed by Gottlieb and Krieger in 1994 2. Best reconstructive option is not always the least complex 19 Figure 4. The reconstructive elevator, as proposed by Gottlieb and Krieger. This formulation emphasizes the importance of selecting the most appropriate level of reconstruction as opposed to defaulting to the least complex. From Gottlieb L, et al. From the reconstructive ladder to the reconstructive elevator. Plast Reconstr Surg. 1994;93:1503-1504. III. PRINCIPLES OF SUTURING A. Layered closure. Any wound deeper than skin should be closed in layers. 1. Eliminate dead space 2. Prevent dehiscence while wound healing is occurring 3. Precisely approximate skin edges without tension B. Wound edge eversion 1. Takes advantage of scar contraction 2. Allows for optimal wound healing C. Choosing suture 1. Permanent versus absorbable 2. Monofilament versus multifilament 3. Suture size 4. Needle type a. Cutting b. Taper 5. Surgical glue 6. Staples D. Timing of suture removal 1. Sutures should be removed from face within 5-7 days 2. Sutures in other anatomic areas should be removed within 7-14 days 3. Exceptions include wounds that cross joints, wounds that are under significant tension, wounds in irradiated or otherwise damaged surgical fields IV. SUTURING TECHNIQUE A. Simple interrupted sutures: most commonly used suture technique (Figure 5) 1. Needle enters epidermis at 90-degree angle 2. Needle turned to exit immediately below deep dermis 3. Care must be taken to enter and exit at same levels on opposite side Figure 5. Simple Interrupted Suture Technique 20 A. Running simple sutures 1. Rely on well-approximated wound edges 2. Not as precise as interrupted sutures, but faster B. Subcuticular sutures 1. Needle passed horizontally through the superficial dermis, parallel to skin surface 2. Can be running or interrupted 3. Allows close approximation of skin edges without need for external skin sutures C. Horizontal mattress sutures (Figure 6) 1. Everting sutures that spread tension across a wound edge 2. Needle passed across the wound and then back the other way 3. Useful in fragile tissue 4. Also useful in suturing glabrous skin of hands/ feet 5. Can be performed as a running suture Figure 6. Horizontal Mattress Suture Technique A. Vertical mattress sutures (Figure 7) 1. Used for increased wound eversion 2. Far-far near-near suture placement Figure 7.

The injury may be intentional such as a surgical incision, or it may be accidental following trauma. I.STAGES OF WOUND HEALING Wound healing is a complex, highly- regulated, multiphase process involving inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and remodeling in the setting of tissue injury. Wounds may progress or even regress through these stages based on local and systemic factors. A.Inflammato ry phase (typically 1 -4 days, if primarily closed) 1.Physiology of inflammationa.Cytokine release is initiated by affected tissue cells and blood clot, which promotes recruitment of platelets and macrophages to the site of injury b.Leukocyte margination and emigration through neighboring vessel walls lymphatic blockade d.Neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis 2.Presence of foreign material, bacterial load, and extent of devitalized tissue and bleeding modulate the body's inflammatory response to tissue damage 3.As long as the wound remains open, wounds remain in this phase.Reestablishment of epithelium or wound closure is important in order to progress through the remaining phases of wound healing. B.Proliferative phase (days 4 -42) 1.Platelet degranulation initiates the proliferative phase of wound healing by establishing a fibrin clot that can be used as a scaffold to support angiogenesis and extracellular matrix formation 2.Synthesis of collagen tissue from fibroblasts 3.Increased rate of collagen synthesis for 42 -60 days 4.Rapid gain of tensile strength in the wound C.Remodeling phase (4 weeks -1 year) 1.Provisional tissue regenerated in the proliferative phase is revised throughcellular apoptosis and expression of matrix met alloproteases. 2.The extracellular matrix and subsequent scar is reorganized largely in responseto mechanical tension, inflammation, and genetic phenotype 3.Maturation by intermolecular cross- linking of collagen leads to flattening of scar 4.Requires approxima tely 9 -12 months in an adult, longer in children. (Scar revisions may be delayed a year or longer after injury to ensure remodeling iscomplete.)23 5.Tensile strength of a healed scar will peak at approximately 60 days post -injury and achieve up to 80% streng th of unwounded II.FACTORS (gentle handling of tissues, orienting incisions or closures alongoptimal vectors to disperse mechanical tension) and ideal suture materials B.Systemic factors - optimize nutrition, palliate or optimize chronic illness, deleterious effects of med ications that interfere with wound healing (chemotherapy, steroids, etc.) III.WOUND CLOSURE Several general surgical principles are important to keep in mind to expedite wound healing and reduce the incidence of hypertrophic or pathologic scarring. Approaches to wounds should always include adequate debridement, removal of any nonviable tissue and foreign bodies, bacteriologic control, and optimization of systemic factors governing wound healing. A.Healing by primary intention - wound closure by direct appro ximation, pedicle flap or skin graft1.Debride necrotic or and irrigate copiously to expedite inflammatory phase 2.Dermis should be accurately approximated. Skin glue may be used if the woundis limited to partial thickness depth 3.Scar may be red, raised, pruritic at peak of collagen synthesis 4.Scar remodeling occurs over approximately 9 -12 months in adults, as collagen maturation takes place (may take longer in children) 5.Final result of scar is dependent on length of time until definit ive wound closure, location, and mechanical tension, and factors influencing amount ofinflammation. B.Healing by secondary intention - wound is left open to heal 1.Myofibroblasts promote contraction of wound edges 2.Epithelialization proceeds from wound margins towards center at 1 mm/day under ideal circumstances 3.Secondary healing beneficial in heavily contaminated or \"dirty\" wounds (e.g.perineum), or wounds in areas that have excellent vascular supply (e.g. scalp) C.Healing by tertiary intention - delayed wound closure after several days 24 1. Intentional interruption of healing started as secondary intention 2. May proceed any time after granulation tissue has formed in wound 3. Delayed closure should be performed when wound is not infected. Quantitative culture should demonstrate <100 CFU bacteria/gram of tissue 4. Skin grafting may be considered in larger wounds for definitive closure after adequate debridement and presence of well-vascularized wound bed IV. MANAGEMENT OF THE CLEAN WOUND A. Aim to obtain a closed wound as soon as possible to prevent infection, fibrosis and secondary deformity B. General principles 1. Updated tetanus vaccine. Administer if not within 10 years of booster for clean minor wounds or within 5 years for contaminated wounds 2. Local anesthesia - use lidocaine with epinephrine unless contraindicated 3. Tourniquets may help provide bloodless fields in extremities 4. Surgical prep a. Aqueous-based: i. Povidone-iodine: one of the few products that is widely effective and safe on nearly all skin surfaces. Must be diluted 1:1 with normal saline when used around the eyes ii. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG): more sustained antimicrobial activity and more resistant to neutralization by blood products than iodine. Contraindicated on genitalia and open wounds 5. d. Alcohol-based: i. Ethyl and isopropyl alcohol: quick, sustained, durable, with broader spectrum antimicrobial activity ii. When used alone, alcohol is fast and short acting, has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and is inexpensive. Can also be combined with iodine or CHG. iii. Highly flammable iv. Contraindicated on open wounds and genitalia 6. Debridement and irrigation - Remove clot, debris, and necrotic tissue. Copious irrigation to remove debris and decrease bacterial inoculum 7. Closure - approximate dermis as atraumatically as possible, consider undermining of wound edges to relieve tension 8. Dressing - must provide absorption, protection, immobilization, even compression, ideally without interfering with function C. Types of wounds and their treatment 1. Superficial abrasions - cleanse to remove foreign material and apply moist dressings or ointments to provide moist environment for re-establishment of epidermis a. Remove gross debris buried in dermis within 24 hours of injury to prevent infection, prolonged inflammation, and traumatic tattoos 25 2. Contusion - evacuate soft tissue hematoma if a fluctuant, organized collection is present or if pressure of hematoma is compromising surrounding tissue (ears, nailbed, etc). a. Early - minimize by cooling with ice (24-48 hours) b. Later - warm compresses helpful to speed reabsorption of blood 3. Laceration - revise and trim wound edges as necessary, debride, and suture 4. Avulsion a. Partial - revise and suture the flap if viable b. Total - avulsed tissue may be irrigated, cleansed, defatted, and applied as a full thickness skin graft 5. Puncture wound - evaluate underlying damage, possibly explore wound for foreign body, and obtain x-ray if appropriate. If small, consider leaving open or partially open to promote egress of drainage 6. Bullet wounds -considered clean wounds that require local wound care and healing by secondary intention. 7. Animal bites - debride, irrigate, and close primarily or leave open, depending upon anatomic location, time since bite, etc. a. Augmentin is typically a mainstay of antibiotic prophylaxis. b. Consider rabies vaccine, if necessary. 8. Wounds of face a. Largely develop as result of trauma b. Important to first obtain a thorough trauma workup and rule out any intracranial injury, airway issues, or other intra-thoracic or abdominal injury. c. The face has reliable and excellent vascular supply, allowing for greater window of opportunity for delayed wound closure d. Consider serial examination and delayed closure to evaluate extent of necrotic tissue burden before definitive debridement, particularly if \"questionably viable\" tissue is in the wound bed. e. Reestablishment of symmetry: Carefully align anatomic landmarks such as vermilion border, ala, eyebrow, helical rim 9. Special Wounds a. Amputation of parts i. Place amputated part in saline soaked gauze in a plastic bag and place the bag on ice. Avoid direct contact with ice to prevent thermal injury. ii. Ischemia times for replantation are 12 hours of warm and 24 hours of cold ischemia for digits, and 6 hours of warm and 12 hours of cold ischemia for major replants of upper and lower extremity b. Cheek injury - may require exploration for parotid duct or facial nerve injury c. Intraoral injuries - tongue, cheek, palate, and lip wounds require approximation with absorbable suture d. Eyelids - align grey line and close in layers - consider temporary tarsorrhaphy e. Ear injuries i. Hematoma requires incision and drainage and well-molded dressing to prevent cauliflower ear deformity 26 requires 3-layer closure including cartilage are indicated for cartilage repair iv.Avoid oversuturing v.May require bolster dressing afterwards to stabilize tissues and avoid hematoma vi.Large composite defects must be approached in staged fashion V.MANAGEMENT OF THE \"CONTAMINATED\" WOUND A.Guidelines for management of contaminated acute wounds 1.Majority of civilian traumatic wounds may be closed primarily after adequate debridement 2.Sharp debridement followed by copious irrigation 3.Consider healing by secondary intention if: a.Heavy bacterial inoculum b.Long time lapse since initial injury or ischemic tissue - severe contused avulsion injury d.Prolonged steroid use 4.Antibi otics - systemic antibiotics are only of use if a therapeutic tissue level can be reached within four hours of injury or debridement 5.Wound closure a.Buried deep dermal sutures should be used to keep wound edge tension to a minimum. Limit the amount of foreign material in wound as much as possible. b.Monofilament sutures less prone to infection c.With regard to deep open abdominal wounds, loss of domain can occurwhen muscle, fascia, or skin necrose or retract, allowing extrusion of viscera i.Wound closure a ttempts to recreate lost domain and reestablish function of abdominal wall ii.If in doubt, it is almost always safer to delay closure and consider scar revision at a future date B.Guidelines for management of contaminated chronic wounds1.Debridement and irrigat ion, may require serial debridement to establish wound stability 2.Systemic antibiotics of little use, unless patient demonstrates systemic signs of infection 3.Topical antimicrobial creams - silver sulfadiazine superficial layer is a semi -permeable silicone membrane that mimics epidermis, deep layer is a collagen -GAG matrix that mimics dermal layer. b.The silicone layer is p eeled off after incorporation of deep layer.27 c.Useful for wound coverage over devascularized wound bed with limited immediate reconstructive options 6.Final closurea.With a delayed flap, skin graft, or flap b.Convert the chronic contaminated wound to an acute clean wound by decreasing the bacterial count (debridement) c.Quantitative cultures may help guide management with regard todetermining appropriateness for definitive closure VI.WOUND DRESSINGS Dressings serve to protect the wound from trauma and to provide an ideal environment for healing A.Antibacterial ointments 1.Bacitracin, Bacitracin/Neomycin/Polymyxin B, Mupirocin a.Provide moist environment conducive to epithelialization. Beware of secondary inflammatory reaction from antibiotic ointment that may mimic infection b.Mupirocin effective against MRSA 2.Silver has better penetration of use mafenide may promote fungal overgrowth B.Splinting and casting 1.Immobilization decreases shear forces on wounds and may help to promotewound healing 2.Avoid splint for extended period of time to avoid joint stiffness C.Pressure Dressings 1.May be useful to obliterate \"dead space\" or to prevent seroma/hematoma 2.Do not compress flaps too tightly, may risk compromising vascular supply VII. NEGATIVE PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY (NPWT) Beneficial tool for large wounds or contaminated wounds not amenable to primary closure A.Technique includes application of foam sponge or gauze covered with adhesive dressing applied to vacuum device that provides constant sub -atmospheric pressure ( -50 to -175mmHg) 1.Should not be placed in direct contact with blood vessels or other fragile structures, infected or necrotic wounds, or on denuded bone.28 2.NPWT LifeSciences Corporation) to promote development of a vascularized wou nd bed. 3.Dressing should be changed every 48 -72 hours to assess wound progress and viability of tissue B.Mechanism of action1.Maintains moist wound environment and reduces edema 2.Promotes local wound blood flow and angiogenesis, reduces presence ofinflammatory mediators, and speeds overall collagen synthesis and rate of wound closure by offloading mechanical tension on wound C.Disadvantages: Cost of device, pain or discomfort with dressing changes and peri - wound irritation secondary to adhesive tape D.Advantages: C an be used as adjunct dressing to serve as bolster for skin grafts and provide exudative management for draining wounds. Wound care regimen isless frequent for patients, making NPWT ideal for more cumbersome or extensive wounds that would otherwise requir e multiple daily dressing changes.

Purnell, MD and Ash Patel, MBChB, FACS When a deformity cannot be closed primarily, and secondary healing would be unlikely, too slow, or suboptimal, grafts and flaps are employed to restore normal function and/or anatomy. I.GRAFTS Grafts are harvested from a donor site and transferred to the recipient site without carrying its own blood supply. It relies on new blood vessels from the recipient site bed to be generated (angiogenesis). A graft MUST have a wound bed of healthy tissue (granulation tissue, muscle, fascia, bone wi th intact periosteum, tendon with intact paratenon) because the graft is totally dependent on blood supply from the wound. II.SKIN GRAFTS A.Thickness (Figure 1) 1.Full thickness - Full thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) consist of the entire epidermis and dermis. 2.Split thickness - Split thickness skin grafts (STSGs) consist of the epidermis and varying degrees of dermis. They can be described as thin, intermediate, orthick. A typical intermediate depth STSG is 12/1000 inch in depth. Figure 1. Components of a split thickness versus a full thickness skin graft B.Donor site 1.Full thickness - The full thickness skin graft leaves behind no epidermal elements in the donor site from which resurfacing can take place. Thus, thedonor site of a FTSG is usually clo sed primarily. It must be taken from an area 31 that has skin redundancy. It is usually harvested with a scalpel between the dermis and the subcutaneous fat. 2. Split thickness - The split thickness skin graft leaves behind adnexal remnants such as hair follicles and sweat glands, foci from which epidermal cells can repopulate and resurface the donor site. This is typically harvested with a pneumatic or electric dermatome. The donor site is usually covered with an occlusive dressing and left to heal secondarily. C. Recipient site 1. Full thickness - Full thickness skin grafts are usually used to resurface smaller defects because they are more limited in size. They are commonly used to resurface defects of the face or hand. They provide better color consistency, texture, and undergo less secondary contraction. 2. Split thickness - Split thickness grafts are usually used to resurface larger defects. STSGs undergo more secondary contraction as they heal compared to an FTSG. They typically darken in color compared to the area they were harvested from. D. Survival 1. Full thickness and split thickness skin grafts survive by the same mechanism. a. Plasmatic imbibition (First 24-48 hours) - Initially, the skin graft passively absorbs nutrients from the wound bed by diffusion. b. Inosculation - By day 3, the cut ends of the vessels on the underside of the dermis line up with and begin to form connections to those of the wound bed. c. Angiogenesis - By day 5, new blood vessels grow into the graft and the graft becomes vascularized. 2. Skin grafts fail by four main mechanisms: a. Poor wound bed - Because skin grafts rely on the underlying vascularity of the bed, wounds that are poorly vascularized with bare tendon or bone, or because of radiation or ischemia, will not support a skin graft. Synthetic materials cannot be covered by grafts for this reason. b. Shear - Shear forces separate the graft from the bed and prevent the contact necessary for revascularization and subsequent \"take\", which refers to the process of attachment and revascularization of a skin graft in the donor site c. Hematoma/seroma - Hematomas and seromas prevent contact of the graft to the bed and inhibit revascularization. They must be drained by day 3 to ensure \"take.\" d. Infection - Bacteria have proteolytic enzymes that lyse protein bonds needed for revascularization. Bacterial levels greater than 105 cells/gram of tissue in the wound will cause graft failure. E. Skin substitutes - These are used for temporary wound coverage, or as a bridge to another form of reconstruction, typically a skin graft. 1. Allograft/Acellular dermal matrices - Cadaveric skin or dermis 2. Xenograft - Skin from a different species, e.g. pig skin - provides only temporary coverage 32 3.Synthetic - i.e. Integra (Integra LifeSciences Corporation) - collagen/silicone bilayer designed to provide an occlusive environment as granulation forms through the tissue matrix. This granulation will then support a skin graft after the silicone is removed. III.OTHER GRAFTS A.Nerve - Most common donor site is the sural nerve B.Fat - Can be harvested as a structured graft or as lipoaspirate C.Tendon - Common donor extensor digitorum nasal septum, ear conchal bowl, rib E.Bone - Common donor are the calvarium, iliac crest, tibial tuberosity, rib F.Muscle - Typically small, can be harvested from any muscle G.Composite - A graft that has more than one component, i.e. cartilage and skin graft, or a dermal -fat graft. IV.FLAPS Flaps are tissues transferred with an intact vascular supply to the recipient site. They survive through this blood supply and are not dependent on the wound bed. Flaps ca n be used when the wound bed is unable to support a skin graft (such as over exposed hardware), or when a more complex, larger, or more aesthetic reconstruction is needed. They are the most versatile type of reconstruction used by plastic surgeons. Flap h arvest always leaves a donor site that will need to be closed either primarily, with a graft, or with another flap. V.CLASSIFICATION A.By composition - Flaps can be classified by the type of tissue transferred. 1.Single component a.Skin flap - e.g. Parascapular flap b.Muscle flap - e.g. Rectus abdominis muscle flap or latissimus dorsi muscle flap c.Bone flap - e.g. Fibula flap d.Fascia flap - e.g. Temporoparietal fascia 2.Multiple components - Named by types of tissue a.Fasciocutaneous - e.g. Radial forearm flap or anterol ateral thigh flap b.Myocutaneous flap c.Osteosecutaneous flap with a skin paddle or medial femoral condyle flap with skin paddle d.Composite flap - flap components are directly attached to each other and harvested on single pedicle (e.g. latissimus myocutaneous flap)33 e.Chimeric flap - flap components are harvested on their own vessel and freely mobile, with a single feeding vessel. (Figure 2) Figure 2. Multi -segment fibula flap with fibula bone osteotomies, harvest of soleus muscle cuff based on muscle perforators, and independent skin paddle based on cutaneous perforators. From Saint -Cyr M, et al. Replantation. Plast Reconstr Surg 2012;130(6):858e -878e. B.By location - Flaps can be described by the proximity to the primary defect that needs to be reconstructed. 1.Local flaps a.Raised from the tissue adjacent to the primary defect. b.Movement into the defect can be described as advanc ement, 2.Regional a.Raised from tissue in the vicinity but not directly a djacent to the primary defect. b.Movement is described as transposition or interpolation. c.A good example would be a la tissimus flap for breast reconstruction. 3.Distant a.Raised from tissue at a distance from the primary defect. b.Usually requires re -anastomosis of the blood vessels to recipient blood vessels in the primary defect (see \"free flaps\" below). c.There are a few examples of distant pedicled flaps, such as using a groinflap for hand reconstruction. C. By vascular pattern 1.Random vs. Axial a.Random pattern flaps i.Do not have a specific or named blood vessel as their blood supply. ii.Instead, these flaps are designed base d on the size of the flap base. iii.Because of the random nature of the vascular pattern, these flaps are limited in dimensions, specifically in a length:base width ratio of 3:1. iv.If designed longer than this ratio, a random blood supply often cannot support the flap (Figures 3, 4) . 34 b.Axial pattern flaps i.Designed with a specific named vascular system that enters the base and runs along its axis. (Figure 5) This allows the flap to be designed aslong and as wide as the territory the axial artery supplies (angiosome). ii.Blood supply requires artery and its accompanying vein iii.Greater length possible than with random flap c.All free flaps are axial (see free flap, below) d.Peninsular - skin and vessel intact in pedicle e.Island - vessels intact, but no skin over pedicle Figure 3. (Top) Advancement flap design. (Below) V -Y flap. Both are often designed as random flaps. From Buch anan P, et al. Evidence flap. (Below) Rhomboid flap. Both may be designed as random flaps. From Buchanan P, et al. Evidence -Based Medicine: Wound Closure. Plast Reconstr skin flaps 2.Pedicled vs. Free a.Pedicled flaps i.Flap blood supply remains attached to its source. ii.Transferred to the defect with its vascular pedicle acting as a leash. b.Free flaps i.Detached at the vascular pedicle and transferred from the donor site to a recipient site. ii.At the recipient site, the flap artery and vein are anastomosed to recipient vessels. iii.This allows more flexibility as tissues can be transferred nearlyanywhere but requires microsurgical skill and increased operative time. 3.Perforator Flapsa.Supplied by sm aller vessels that pass through or in between d eep tissues. b.Typically harvested without the deep tissues in order to minimize donor site morbidity and to yield only the necessary am ount of tissue for transfer. c.Can be transferred either as a pedicled or free flap. d.Perforators are described by their path fr om the main vessel to the skin (Figure 6). perforator flaps: i.Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP) a)Skin and fat of the lower abdomen supplied by the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein perforators without the rectus abdominismuscle. ii.Antero lateral thigh perforator flap (ALT) a)Skin and fat of the anterolateral thigh supplied by the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessel pe flap ) a)Skin and fat of the lateral back supplied by the thoracodorsal artery and vein perforator without the latissimus dorsi muscle. 36 Figure 6. Mathes and Nahai classified fascial and fasciocut aneous flaps based on their vascular anatomy. Type A (left) are those flaps with a direct cutaneous pedicle to the fascia. Type B (center) are those flaps with a pedicle that has a septocutaneous perforator. Type C (right) are those with a musculocutaneous perforator. From Buchanan PJ, Kung TA, Cederna PS. Medicine: Wound Closure. Plast Reconstr -270S, September 2016. II.CHOOSING THE RIGHT FLAP A.The primary defect - Recipient site considerations \"replace like with like\" 1.Size 2.Location 3.Tissue type to be replaced: Muscle can eliminate more dead space, skin is better for resurfacing 4.Functional and aesthetic considerations B.The secondary defect - Donor site considerations 1.Location 2.Adhere to an angiosome, the territory that is suppl ied by a given vessel 3.What type of tissues are needed 4.Functional and aesthetic morbidity III.FLAP SURVIVAL A.Success depends not only on its survival but also its ability to achieve the goals of reconstruction. B.Flap failure results ultimately from vascular co mpromise or the inability to achieve the goals of reconstruction. 1.Tension 2.Kinking of pedicle 3.Compression 4.Vascular thrombosis (typically more often flaps) 5.Infection 37 REFERENCES 1.Mathes, S.J.

Hemangiomas are vascular tumors characterized by increased cellular proliferation. Classically, they exhibit rapid growth and slow regression. Approximately 80% of hemangiomas are noted in the first month of life, and 60% occur in the head and neck region. Vascular malformations are present at birth and grow slowly.

The head and neck are relatively resistant to infection due to their robust vascularity B. Routes of spread 1. Upper aerodigestive infections may track into the mediastinum 2. Scalp and orbital infections may spread intracranially via the dural sinuses and ophthalmic veins C. Types 1. Facial cellulitis: mostly due to staphylococcus or streptococcus - may use a cephalosporin 2. Oral cavity infections: mostly due to anaerobic streptococcus and bacteroides. Use extended spectrum penicillin or other anaerobic coverage (Augmentin/Unasyn) 3. Acute sialadenitis: fever, pain, swelling over the involved parotid gland. Seen with dehydration, debilitation, diabetics, poor oral hygiene. Treat with antibiotics, fluids 54 4. Atypical mycobacteria: seen in enlarged lymph nodes; drainage rarely required. Special cultures may be necessary 5. NEOPLASTIC (exclusive of skin - see Chapter 7) D.

Parotid: most common (80%), most are benign (80%) b. Submandibular: 55% incidence of malignancy c. Minor salivary glands: least common, with highest incidence of malignancy (about 75%) 2. Diagnosis a. Primarily by physical examination i. Any mass in the pre-auricular region or at the angle of the jaw is a parotid tumor until proven otherwise b. Bimanual palpation: simultaneous intraoral and external palpation c. Signs more commonly seen with malignancy i. Fixed or hard mass ii. Pain iii. Loss or disturbance of facial nerve function iv. Cervical lymphadenopathy (metastases) 3. Treatment a. For benign tumors i.

Conditions, treatment principles, and concerns for certain complications are different and must be considered. The most common pediatric plastic surgery problems comprise congenital craniofacial anomalies, acquired craniofacial problems (such as faci al anomalies, congenital nevi, and vascular malformations. Cleft lip and palate are in a CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES A.Craniofacial Embryology and Development: 1.Facial embryology occurs between 3 -8 weeks of development b.Face originates from 5 prominences that appear during 4th week (Figure 1)i.Central frontonasal 1 arch d.These prominences the primitive mouth (stomodeum) e.Prominences lip (lateral to philtrum), orbital floor, inferior portion of lateral nasal wall iii.Mandibular prominence: lower jaw f.Between 5 -6 weeks nasal processes enlarge, migrate and coalesce in midline to unite with maxillary process and form upper lip. 63 Figure 1. Craniofacial embryology. The five facial prominences. From Losee, Whitaker, LA, development a. Cranium divided into i. Neurocranium: structures that surround the brain ii. Viscerocranium: structures that surround oral cavity, pharynx, upper respiratory system and face b. Ossification i. Cranial base (occipital, sphenoid and temporal vault: intramembranous ossification c. Cranial growth responds to increased brain volume i. Brain size triples by 1 year ii. Brain size quadruples by 2 years iii. Cranial vault is 90% of adult size by age 5 iv. Brain has reached 95% of adult size by age 8-10 d. Normal cranial growth occurs through i. to suture ii. Appositional growth: bone resorption of the inner surface and bone deposition on the outer surface B. Craniosynostosis (CS) 1. Definition: Premature fusion of one or more cranial vault sutures. 2. Incidence: 1:2,500 live births 3. Normal and fontanelle Suture fusion: iii. Metopic: 6-8 months i. Sagittal: 22 years ii. Coronal: 24 years iii. Lambdoid: 26 years b. Fontanelle closure: i. Posterior: 3-6 months ii. Anterior: 9-12 months 64 4. Characteristic head shape according to suture affected (Figure 2) a. Sagittal: scaphocephaly (Gr., direction) Coronal, unilateral: plagiocephaly (Gr., plagios, meaning oblique or slanted. e. Important: distinguish from positional plagiocephaly, where suture is normal. Head deformity is similar, but there is a parallelogram configuration of the head (if seen from above) with anterior displacement of the ipsilateral ear and occipital flattening. Figure 2. Craniosynostosis and cranial deformities depending on suture fused 5. Categorized into non-syndromic and syndromic types 6. Non-syndromic CS (most common, 67-80%) a. Order of frequency according to suture type b. Longstanding debate as to whether non-syndromic patients have increased incidence of developmental delay. New evidence shows some degree of executive dysfunction in up to 50% of these children. c. Treatment indications: i. Prevent potential increased intracranial pressure (ICP) ii. Correct the cranial deformity and normalize appearance e. Treatment: i. Vary depending on suture affected and severity 65 ii. Usually performed within first year of life to take advantage of molding capacity of skull iii. Minimally invasive procedures: extended strip suturectomy (<6 months) +/- springs, +/- postoperative helmet therapy. iv. Anterior vault reshaping (fronto-orbital advancement (FOA)/reshaping) v. Total vault reshaping vi. Posterior vault reshaping 7. Syndromic CS a. Higher incidence of ICP than non-syndromic b. Major associated syndromes: i. Apert: severe midfacial retrusion, complex ii. Crouzon: CS, exorbitism, Pfeiffer: CS, exorbitism, midfacial retrusion, broad thumbs and toes) c. Characteristic head shape involves turribrachycephaly (Gr., turri, tower) d. 50% of Apert syndrome patients have substantial mental delay; Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndrome patients usually have normal mental development. e. Genetic defect identified in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes (Apert, Crouzon---FGFR2, Pfeiffer\u2014FGFR1) f. Goals of surgery i. Expand intracranial volume (83% ICP in Apert, less in others) ii. Normalize head shape and appearance iii. Correct profound exorbitism to prevent corneal exposure/blindness iv. Correct malocclusion g. General timeline of surgical interventions: may vary i. Suturectomy for decompression of elevated ICP, if present (<3 months) ii. Posterior cranial vault months) Midface procedures: or monobloc advancement (4-12 years). v. Orthognathic surgery/canthopexies/other revisions. (12 years -adulthood) vi. In general, craniofacial distraction leads to greater advancement, less relapse than conventional procedures. C. Craniofacial Clefts 1. Lack of fusion of facial processes that results in abnormal separation of skeletal and soft tissue structures of the face and cranium (alternative theory of lack of mesodermal penetration) 2. Rare. Estimated 1.4 - 5.1 per 100,000 births 3. Defined by Paul Tessier, who classified them 4. Tessier Classification system relates soft tissue to skeletal landmarks (Figure 3) 5. Any combination of clefts is possible 6. Facial dysostoses are associated with certain clefts: a. Craniofacial/hemifacial Treacher Clefts # 6, 7, 8 66 Figure 3.

Comprise less than 15% of all facial fractures. 2.Frequency increases with age B.Unique characteristics in children: 1.At birth, ratio of cranial:facial volume is 8:1; by completion of growth it becomes 2.5:1. This changing ratio produces variation in fracture site frequency with age. 2.Protective anatomical factors:a.Larger fat pads b.Decreased 3.Fractures that entrap orbital contents (trap -door fractures) are more common secondary to greater bony elasticity70 4.Up to 75% can have associated serious trauma (especially cervical spine, neurological, ophthalmologic and abdominal) C.Causes: 1.Most common overall (per National Trauma Databank): Motor vehicle crashes (MVC), violence and falls 2.Some variation by age:a.0-5 years: falls b.6-11: MVC and sports sports and violence D.Fracture sites:1.Vary with age 2.Most common overall are orbital or mandible 3.Cranial vault fractures more common in younger children 4.Facial fractures more common as they grow older, following midf ace growth (maxilla, zygomaticomaxillary complex, nasal, mandible) E.General treatment principles ( see Chapter 8 ): 1.Growing skeleton possesses inherent plasticity that may render operative intervention unnecessary for a given injury 2.Usually more conservative with operative repair in this patient population due to fear of altering growing facial skeleton and developing dentition each trunk 4.Cords: Lateral, posterior and medial myocutaneous, axillary, radial, ulnar, median B.Incidence: 1.5 Erb -Duchenne palsy a.Caused by injury in Erb's point (convergence of C5 -C6 roots as they form trunk) lack of deltoid, supra spinatus and biceps functions, causing the arm to hand straight down at side with forearm pronated E.Evaluation1.Passive and active ROM71 a.Evaluate with reflexes, such as Moro 2.Imaging usually not helpful 3.Physical therapy to preserve ROM F.Indications for surgical exploration 1.Absent biceps or deltoid function by 3 -6 months 2.Absent elbow flexion, wrist, thumb or finger extension by 9 months 3.Flail limb with Horner's syndrome G.Follow patients longitudinally. Partial recoveries might need tendon transfers or nerve graft ing (controversial) H.90% will have spontaneous resolution within 2 months.

The majority of muscles innervated by the facial nerve act in facial expression, and, thus, are critical structures for communication. As a result, facial paralysis can pose both social and physical consequences for the patient. While numerous procedures for facial reanimation exist, it is important to acknowledge that no reconstructive technique is able to reproduce the delicate balance between all mimetic muscles.

After nipple sparing mastectomy blood supply is the subdermal plexus. After breastreduction or mastopexy the blood supply is the breast pedicle or parenchyma as you must divide the skin and subdermal plexus to reposition the NAC. Figure 3.

BREAST RECONSTRUCTION A.Breast cancer now affects one in eight women over the course of their lifetime andis the leading cause of cancer -related death in women. 92 B.All patients that have undergone or will undergo mastectomy are entitled to breast reconstructive surgery covered by insurance (Women's Health Act, 1998). Symmetry procedure for the contralateral breast is also covered. C.Patients undergoing mastectomy should be offered a preoperative referral to a plastic surgeon. D.In relation to the timing of the mastectomy, breast reconstruction can be: 1.Immediate (during the same anesthetic) 2.Delayed -immediate ( uncommon) different anesthesia, different surgery before the skin has fully- healed/retracted 3.Delayed E.Possible preferences of patients: 1.No reconstruction: women may choose to wear an external prosthetic. 2.Reconstruction of breast mound to attain close to natural breast shape, feel,contour. 3.Breast mound reconstruction may or may not be followed with NACreconstruction depending on patient preference. a.Mastectomy defects frequently include loss of the NAC (such as in skin - sparing mastectomy). Mastectomy skin necrosis is the unplanned loss of skin due to inadequate blood supply following surgery. b.Previous irradiation, such as in BCT, may cause difficulties with wound healing, skin contraction and discoloration, capsular contracture, and fat necrosis 4.If desired, following unilateral breast reconstruction, the opposite breast can becontoured to obtain symmetry, using mastopexy, reduction or aug mentation mammoplasty. F.Mastectomy options 1.Breast conservative therapy --BCT (50 -70% of breast cancer patients), also called partial mastectomy: removal of the tumor only. Requires post -op radiation. The patients may opt for: a.Oncoplastic surgery: i.e. small implants, thoracic latissimus dorsi flap, artery perforator flap, lipofilling with or without scar subcision. Timing of this is variable but operating on radiated tissue conveys increased risk. b.Cont ralateral breast reduction for symmetry 2.Nipple -sparing mastectomy (NSM)/Total skin sparing mastectomy (TSSM): removal of all breast tissue with preservation of all skin, including NAC (Figure5). The reconstruction can be with autologous tissue or implant -based. 93 Figure 5. Mastectomy incisions From Cordeiro P, et al . Two -Stage Implant -Based Breast Reconstruction: An Evolution of the Conceptual and Technical Approach over a Two -Deca de Period. Plast Reconstr Surg 2016 ;138(1):1 -11. 3.Simple (total) mastectomy: removal of all breast tissue, including NAC. Reconstruction in delayed fashion will require tissue expansion or autologous tissue. 4.Modified radical mastectomy: removal of all breast tissue, NAC, pectoralisfascia, as well as Level I and II lymp h nodes. Same principles of reconstruction as for simple mastectomy. 5.Halsted radical mastectomy: removal of all breast tissue, nipple/ areolar complex, pectoralis major and minor muscles, muscular fascia, Level I, II, and III lymph nodes (this procedure do es not improve disease control compared to modified radical mastectomy and is largely of historical interest now) 6.Goldilocks mastectomy: performed through a Wise skin pattern. The inferior de-epithelized mastectomy flap is folded under the Wise pattern in order to obtain a breast mound. Can be fat grafted for further volume. G.Techniques of breast reconstruction 1.Choose techniques based on: a.Patient preference b.Need for adjuvant radiotherapy before or after the breast reconstruction(Figure 6, 7) c.Uni- or bilateral mastectomy d.Defect of the breast envelope: NSM, total simple mastectomy, mastectomy skin necrosis e.Immediate or delayed reconstruction (increased skin requirements) f.Habitus of the patient: BMI, size of the breast or desired size of the reconstructed bre asts, possible donor sites for autologous reconstruction 94 Figure 6.

CT angiography may help with perforator harvest planning (Figure 13). SIEA has to be ofadequate caliber (artery with a palpable pulse, vein >1mm) to be used for anastomosis. Not all pat ients have an adequate SIEA, may be affected by the position of the lower abdominal incision. SIEV may bethe dominant venous drainage and is commonly preserved in case it is needed for venous outflow. viii.

They can also occur due to casting or splinting after surgical procedures. II.STAGIN G SYSTEM A.Stage I: non -blanchable erythema of intact skin B.Stage thickness skin loss with exposed dermis C.Stage III: full thickness skin loss D.Stage IV: full thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage, or bone E.Unstageable: full thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissuedamage cannot be determined because it is obscured by slough or eschar F.Deep tissue injury: persistent non -blanchable maroon, or purple discoloration III.\"ICEBERG PHENOMENON \" A.Since skin can withstand ischemia much better than fat or muscle, a small skinwound on surface can reflect a large amount of deeper tissue necrosis underneath. IV.EPIDEMIOLOGY in annual healthcare costs B.Additional $7,000 -43,000 dollars per hospital stay 114 C.$21,000 -152,000 to treat/heal per pressure injury D.Medicare is primary payer for ~75% of hospitalizat ions with pressure injury VI.AFFECTED BODY environmental 1.Pressure (perpendicular) leads to deep necrosis: can develop after 2 hours of unrelieved pressure 2.Shear (parallel) leads to superficial necrosis 3.Friction 4.Moisture injury risk for adults/children using 6 domains(sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction/shear) VIII. NON- SURGICAL TREATMENT A.Prevention is the best treatment1.Keep skin clean a nd dry 2.Appropriate nursing care, including turning the patient every 2 hours (avoiddragging/shearing skin of the patient while repositioning) 3.Optimizing nutrition 4.Relieving pressure using air mattresses, cushions, heel protectors 5.Air fluidized beds (Clinitron\u00ae) gold standard for pressure injury prevention B.Systemic infection/sepsis unlikely with pressure injury (unless immunocompromised): look for other source, e.g., urinary tract infection or respiratory tract when patients with pressure injuries pre sent with fevers C.If localized infection is present (look for signs of local cellulitis) topical antimicrobialagents (Silvadene, Sulfamylon) can be used 115 best method to assess osteomyelitis versus osteitis E.Can direct antibiotic therapy to treat osteomyelitis, but virtually impossible to eradicate infection with antibiotics alone 1.MRI may be helpful as imaging study, while bone scans are often nonspecific due to presence of periostitis associated with open wounds 2.Long term antibiotics are not indicated 3.Pressure injury closure may be accelerated using topical protein growth factors 4.Stage III -IV patients cl osure IX.SURGICAL TREATMENT A.Due to high recurrence rates, surgery tends to be reserved for patients with reversible pathologies B.Patient motivation is an important determinant of recurrence risk in the alert patient C.Excisional debridement of pressure injury and bursa and any heterotopic calcification D.Partial or complete ostectomy to reduce bony prominence - may lead to new pressure injuries elsewhere (be careful when off -loading) E.Closure of the wound with healthy, durable tissue that can provide adequa te padding over the bony prominence (myocutaneous vs. fasciocutaneous flap) F.Aftercare including appropriate surfaces and wound management are paramount G.Lifestyle and activity modification often required in order to reduce recurrence risk REFERENCES 1.\"National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) Announces a Change in Terminology from Pressure Ulcer to Pressure Injury and Updates the Stages of Pressure Injury.\" National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 13 April. 2016.

However, the hand is a delicately balanced organ, and when one structure is injured, the system as a whole falters. Given the variety of tissues in the hand, including soft tissue, blood vessels, nerves and bone, plastic surgeons are intimately involved in the surgical care of the upper extremity. Plastic surgeons have been pioneers in the field of hand surgery since its earliest days, from traumatic reconstruction to h and transplantation. A basic understanding of hand anatomy and care is essential to not only plastic surgery, but also orthopedics, emergency and family medicine. I.HAND ANATOMY A.Nerves 1.Sensory - median, ulnar, radial (Figure 1) 2.Motor - intrinsic muscles of hand a.Median nerve - thenar radial muscles 1. Sensory distribution of the hand B.Muscles and tendons1.Flexor system (Figure 2) a.Extrinsic flexors bends PIP joint. 117 b. Intrinsic flexors - Lumbricals bend the MCP (metacarpal-phalangeal) tendon system From Khor WS, Langer MF, Wong R, Zhou R, Peck F, Wong JKF. Improving Outcomes in Tendon Repair. Plast Reconstr extensors join the extensor hood at the proximal phalanx, and extend the proximal phalanx at the MCP joint. b. Intrinsics (interossei and lumbricals) pass volar to the axis of the MCP joint (where they act as flexors) and move dorsal to the axis of the PIP joint to 118 insert on the dorsal distal phalanx. They act as extensors to the PIP and DIP joints. Figure 3. E xtensor tendon system From Rockwell WB, Butler PN, Byrne BA. Bony skeleton From Marks, M.W., Marks, C. Fundamentals of Plastic Surgery.

Test collateral ligament stability with radial and ulnar stressing at affected joint. Test MPJ in flexion and IP joints in extension. Compare laxity to contralateral side to establish baseline. 2.Most can be treated with closed reduction; open reduction can be necessary ifsupporting structures prevent the reduction (e.g. metacarpal head through extensor mechanism) B.Ligamentous injury - usually lateral force 1.Gamekeeper's thumb - rupture of ulnar collateral ligament of MCP joint 2.Wrist injury - multiple ligaments can be involved. Diagnosis may require MRI arthrogram or arthroscopy. Clinical diagnosis by pattern of pain, x- rays, palpation for abnormal movement. C.Treatment 1.Immobilize 2 -3 weeks for digital joint injury (MP or IP dislocation), then protected motion 2.Thumb MPJ and wrist sprains require 6 weeks immobilization. (some, e.g. thumb ulnar collateral ligament, might need operative repair) VII. CONGENITAL DEFE CTS A.Common defects 1.Polydactyly - most common. Duplication of fingers, usually border digits. Duplication of 5th finger is common autosomal dominant trait in African - Americans. Thumb duplication often requires reconstructive surgery 126 2.Syndactyly - 2nd most common - May be simple, involving skin only, or complex, involving bone B.Treatment - goal to decrease deformity and improve function 1.Some problems are treated in infancy - e.g. splinting for club hand, thumb reconstruction 2.Some treated by 12 months, befor e handedness develops - e.g. separation of syndactyly 3.Some require multi -stage procedures - e.g. club hand VIII.

These include leg ulcers of various etiologies, trauma with extensive soft tissue loss or exposed bone, vascular or neural structures, and lymp hedema, which is covered in another chapter. I.CHRONIC WOUNDS Each wound requires accurate diagnosis. Not all lower extremity wounds will require surgical intervention when appropriate management is pursued. The key to healing is wound hygiene, correctio n of the underlying problem, treatment of any concurrent infection, optimizing nutrition, and specific surgical intervention when appropriate. The plastic surgeon is an integral member of the treatment team from the onset of the problem. Remember that two different predisposing conditions may occur in the same patient. If so, the treatment must address both conditions. A.Venous stasis ulcer1.Etiology - venous hypertension edema with constant bedrest and foot elevation c.\"Unna boots\" may heal ulcers in patients who are noncompliant with bedrest or must continue to work. d.Surgical treatment requires excision of entire area of ulcer, scar tissue, andsurrounding area of increased pigmentation (hemosiderin deposition). e.Pressure gradient stocking and a commitment to avoiding standing for longperiods of time are necessary for long term success B.Ischemic ulcer1.Etiology - proximal arterial than venous stasis ulcers b.Most often on lateral aspects of great and fifth toes, and dorsum of foot c.No edema require revascularization based upon angiographic findings b.Usually a skin graft will close the wound; flap closure may be required if critical structures or bone are exposed. A more proximal amputation may be required if revascularization is not possible C.Diabetic ulcer1.Etiology - decreased sensation (neurotrophic) or occasionally decreased blood flow 2.Appe arance a.Usually on plantar surface of foot over metatarsal c.No change in surrounding pigmentation 3.Treatment a.Debride necrotic tissue and use topical and systemic antibiotics to control the infection b.Be conservative in care; early amput ation is detrimental since patients often have limb -threatening infections in the other leg within a few years c.After control of bacterial contamination, small ulcers may be excised andclosed primarily; larger ulcers may require flap coverage d.Treatment sho uld also include resection of underlying bony prominence e.Postoperative diabetic foot care at home is paramount to proper management. Patient education in caring for and examining their feet is extremely important D.Pyoderma Gangrenosum1.Very difficult to tre at 2.May include anti -inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressives, as well as local wound care agents 3.Success in treatment has been reported with hyperbaric oxygen in conjunctionwith local wound care 4.Surgical treatment if often contraindicated as excision cau ses perpetuation of wounds II.ACUTE TRAUMA Lower extremity trauma is frequently very complex, and often requires a team approach involving the orthopedic, vascular and plastic surgeons. Limb salvage with bipedal ambulation, normal weight bearing, and sensation is the goal of all surgical intervention. A.Initial Management 1.All patients with lower extremity trauma should be evaluated for associated injuries, and treated according to advanced trauma life support (ATLS) criteria 130 2. Surgical debridement and irrigation of the wound in the operating room is the proper initial management. Specific management depends upon the level of injury, presence or absence of vascular, nerve, and bony injury 3. Limb threatening injuries, vascular interruption, or open fracture are best assessed and treated in the OR 4. Fasciotomy is often required to maintain tissue perfusion in severe high energy or crush injuries when compartment syndrome exists B. Fractures of the lower leg are usually classified by the Gustilo system (Table 7-1) 1. Type I and II fractures usually have a good outcome with varied treatment 2. Gustilo Type III injuries have a worse prognosis and often require plastic surgical intervention Table 1. Gustilo Classification of Open Fractures of the Lower Leg III. NON-SURGICAL CARE A. Wound vac 1. Applies negative pressure to aid in wound healing 2. Has decreased the need for flaps in many cases IV. SURGICAL CARE A. Indications for limb salvage versus amputation 1. Assessment tools - none are good enough to use as a guide in management 2. Consider co-morbidities, concomitant injuries, and whether multi-level injury 3. Posterior tibial nerve function as the determinate - has been challenged 131 4.Plastic surgery may still be involved in amputations to preserve length for prosthesis a.Fillet flaps - use tissue from amputated part to close surgical site and preserve limb length B.Essentials 1.Adequate debridement 2.Timinga.Classic Godina study from 1986 advocated early coverage - within 72 hours b.Has been challenged - especially for more extensive injuries, wou nd vac has probably helped c.Cover all vital structures (nerves, vessels, tendons, joints, hardware) within1 week 3.Zone of injurya.Need to debride all damaged, non -vital tissue b.If performing flap coverage, be aware of potential microscopic vessel injuryin surrounding tissue. This zone of injury may affect flap or recipient vessel choice. C.Need for graft vs. flap coverage1.Dermal substitutes may help convert a wound requiring flap coverage to a skin graft. D.Location - Traditional upper, middle, and lower third leg options 1.Upper thirda.Gastrocnemius i.Blood supply - medial and lateral sural vessels ii.May use medial or lateral head, although medial head is more often useddue to larger siz e and more favorable arch of rotation iii.Peroneal nerve at risk for injury with lateral head 2.Middle third a.Soleus i.Blood supply - ii.Divide distally to rota te into defect iii.May split in half if necessary 3.Lower third a.Free flap i.Considerations with flap selection - pedicle length, OR positioning (concomitant injuries), durability on heel, bony need, sensation ii.Recipient vessel selection a)Consider preoperative imagi questionable - b)Consider end - to-side versus end peroneal vessel perforators ii.Controversy over whether reliable and truly more simple than free flap 132 a)If chosen, consider surgical delay to improve the perfusion and delineate viable tissue c.Medial plantar flaps 1.Locoregional flaps ba sed off perforators near the defect 2.Not necessarily a simpler option, need to consider zone of injury F.Bony gaps - may be filled with grafts, flaps, or distraction techniques depending on length and quality or remaining bone G.Postop care1.Elevate extremity 2.Dangle protocols a.Want to slowly get flap used to being in a dependent position, will swell and get congested at first b.No hard evidence for best timeline REFERENCES 1.Godina M.

Alghoul, MD I.BROW LIFT (Figures 1 and 2) A.Open Coronal Brow Lift Technique 1.Coronal incision is ma de in the hair -bearing skin 2.Scalp flap is elevated caudally in a variety of planes towards the orbits, allowing broad exposure of the brow attachments , which can be released and repositioned B.Endoscopic Brow Lift 1.Endoscopic ports are made in the hair -bearing skin and endoscopic instruments are used to release the brow attachments under direct camera visualization 2.The repositioned brow is secured to the bone and/or periosteum through avariety of methods. C.Hairline Brow Lift1.Incision is made along the hairline and a flap is elevated caudally towards the orbits, the brow attachment s are released, and the brow is repositioned. 2.Excess skin is trimmed along the incision line and the incision is carefully closed. D.Lateral Brow Lift1.Incision is made either in the temple hair -bearing skin or along the temple hairline, dissection proceed s to the lateral eyebrow in a plane deep to the superficial temporal fascia. 2.The lateral brow is re -positioned, excess skin is excised at the incision line and the incision is carefully closed and secured to the deep temporal fascia. E.Direct Brow Lift1.Incision is made in the superior border of the eyebrow and a pre -determined amount of forehead skin is excised between the brow incision and new desiredlocation for the eyebrow. 2.Once the intervening skin tissue is excised, the incision edges are carefullyapproximated. II.NON- SURGICAL (CHEMIC AL) BROW LIFT A.A temporary brow lift can be performed with neuromodulators ( Ex. Botox or Dysport) by selectively treating the medial and lateral brow depressor muscles 134 Figure 1. Incision placement for temporal brow lift From Codner et al.

Terminates superior to the zygoma as the superficial temp oral fascia (aka Temporoparietal Fascia). V.FACELIFT OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES A.Subcutaneous only1.The facial skin is widely undermined and re -draped. The SMAS is not addressed in this technique. B.SMAS plication 1.The facial skin is undermined and the SMAS tissue is sutured together in order to tighten and reposition the SMAS architecture. C.SMAS- ectomy 1.The facial skin is undermined and an oblique piece of SMAS is excised, the cutedges of the remaining SMAS are then sutured together. D.Extended SMAS 137 1.The facial skin is undermined and a separate flap of SMAS is elevated and sutured superior -laterally to reposition the SMAS. E.Composite / Deep Plane1.A limited amount of facial skin undermining is performed and then the SMAS and skin are left adherent to each other as a \"composite flap\" while a sub -SMAS dissection is performed. Once the composite flap is adequately mobilized, it isrepositioned and excess skin/tissue is trimmed. Figure 5.

Ramanadham, MD Aesthetic surgery of the breast aims to either correct ptosis with a mastopexy, micromastia with augmentation, or macromastia with a reduction. The goals a re to create a youthful, well -appearing breast. Important considerations for all patients include an assessment of their breast history including history of breast cancer, mammographic history and measurements of the breast and chest including sternal -notch to nipple, nipple to IMF, internipple distances and breast width and areolar diameter. I.MASTOPEXY A.Goals 1.Correct breast ptosis with skin redraping and parenchymal remodeling of the breast to reduce mismatch between skin and tissue. 2.Adjust nipple position concurrently. B.Regnault Classification of breast ptosis based on two important anatomic landmarks: (1) inframammary fold (IMF) and (2) nipple position 1.Grade I - nipple at level of the IMF 2.Grade II - nipple below the level of IMF but not at the lowest point of the breast 3.Grade III - nipple at the lowest point of the breast 4.Pseudoptosis - nipple at the level of IMF but glandular tissue below the level of the IMF Figure 1. Ideal nipple position is based on its relation ship t o the inframammary fold. From Nahabedian MY. bothered by the \"shape\" of the breast or size and position of nipple - areola complex. 2.Often report deflation and sagging of breasts. D.Periareolar mastopexy 1.Incision is made around the areola as an eccentric oval 2.Can be used to raise the nippl e up to 2 cm 3.Good for patients with grade I or II ptosis 4.Disadvantages include widening of the periareolar scar, flattening and de- projecting of the breast Figure 2. Periareolar mastopexy with mesh support From made around the areola and down the meridian of the breast 2.Can be used for grade II and III ptosis 3.Usually involves removal of breast skin and underlying tissue from th e lower pole of the breast with sutures to bring the medial and lateral pillars of the breasttogether 147 4.This helps support the elevated nipple -areola complex at its new, higher position Figure 3. Vertical mastopexy From Hidalgo areola and across to the medial and lateral edges of the breast and along the IMF 2.Can be used for grade II and III ptosis and patients with severe excess of skin 3.Has largest scar burden of any mastopexy technique and can lead to\"bottoming out\" or recurrent ptosis of the gland when used with an inferiorpedicle Figure 4. Wise pattern or inver ted T mastopexy incision types From Nahabedian of the breast parenchyma either using the patient's own tissue (autologous) or a prosthetic device (saline or silicone implant) B.Patient concerns 148 1. Usually bothered by the size of the breasts. 2. Important parameters in pre-operative evaluation a. \"Base width:\" width of the breast on the chest wall b. Pinch thickness of the upper pole breast tissue. c. Ability of skin to stretch d. Chest wall asymmetry C. Augmentation with an Implant 1. Planes of placement: implant has to be covered by stable soft tissue, which includes a combination of skin, parenchyma and muscle. a. Subglandular - beneath the breast tissue but above the pectoralis muscle fascia b. Subfascial - beneath the pectoralis muscle fascia but above pectoralis muscle fibers c. Subpectoral - beneath the pectoralis major muscle d. Dual plane -pectoralis muscle is released to a variable extent with release of inferior attachments and preservation of medial attachments. Muscle covers the superior part of the implant and breast tissue covers the inferior part of the implant, depending on extent of release of muscle from overlying parenchyma. Figure 4. Subpectoral implant placement. Release of pectoralis muscle allows the muscle to rise above the implant From Hidalgo D, Spector J. Breast periareolar are the most common. 3.

BRAVA system ). 2.Auto-augmentation a.Various flaps can be designed on lateral axillary tissue or adjacent tissue and rotated, advanced or folded onto the existing breast mound to reshapeand increase the size of the breast. b.Commonly performed in massive weight loss patients. 3.Free flaps and abdominally based flaps E.Mastopexy -Augmentation 1.Combined procedure to both increase the size and alter the shape of the breast 2.Can be staged in two operations or perform simultaneously 3.Revision ra tes ~ 10-30% range III.REDUCTION A.Goals 1.Decrease the size of the breast 2.Restore nipple location to a more youthful position B.Patient concerns1.Symptomatic patients usually have a history of cervical, shoulder or back painthat have not improved with m edications or physical therapy 2.May also have a history of rashes or hygiene issues 3.Bra strap groovin g as a result of large breasts 4.Reductions can be done in asymptomatic patients as well for cosmetic reasons. C.Skin incision patterns and pedicles (which provide blood supply to the nipple areolacomplex) are two different considerations in breast r eduction and can be combined 150 (for example, Wise -pattern superomedial reduction versus Wise -pattern or Wise -pattern E.Basis of pedicles fo r blood supply to the NAC : 1.Inferior - 4th interco stal perforator 2.Superior - thoracoacromial artery Figure 5.

REFERENCES 1.Adams WP Jr, Mallucci Ali A. Qureshi, MD and Sachin M. Shridharani, MD Body contouring is an umbrella term for aesthetic surgery of the body that includes the breasts, abdomen/trunk and upper and lower extremities. It is also used to describe a set of procedures for patients who have experienced massive weight loss either from bariatric surgery and/or diet and exercise. These patients often have a disproportionate amoun t of deflated skin secondary to volume loss from atrophy underlying subcutaneous fat/adipocytes. Body contouring involves liposuction, excisional surgery and more recently non -invasive methods like cryolipolysis to achieve the patient's aesthetic goals. I.LIPOSUCTION A.Suction assisted lipectomy (SAL) 1.Goal - to improve the contour of specific anatomic regions by surgically removing targeted/focal areas of fat . 2.Surgically removes fat, but will not address excess skin. 3.Not a weight loss procedure, but rathe r a contouring/sculpting treatment. 4.In recent years, energy sources have been added to the procedure in hope tobreak apart fibrous tissue and facilitate the destruction of adipocytes viathermal mechanism (LASER and ultrasound). B.The total amount of fat in the body is fixed. However, individual adipocytes have the ability to get bigger or smaller. Liposuction can remove fat but the left over fatstill can change with fluctuations in weight. Therefore, even if fat is removed, theremaining fat can change i n volume and lead to loss of results. C.Pre-operative evaluation 1.Ideal candidates are patients who have localized deposits of diet or exerciseresistant fat with good overlying skin quality. 2.Caution in the male abdomen.a.Women tend to have extra -abdominal fat meaning the fat deposits in the subcutaneous tissue OUTSIDE the abdominal cavity. b.Men tend to have increases in intra -abdominal fat meaning the fat INSIDE the abdominal cavity can increase. Intra -abdominal fat is NOT the target of liposuction. Can be used in male pseudogynecomastia. 3.Markings are essential as well as discussion of any pre -existing asymmetries or contour irregularities that exist preoperatively. 153 4. An estimation of volume to be removed can help estimate how much wetting solution, \"tumescent\" will be needed and how much fat can eventually be removed. D. Setup: Liposuction involves two major components: tumescent of the areas to be treated and the device being used E. Tumescent: Doses of lidocaine with epinephrine can be as high as 70 mg/kg because of the large volume of distribution and slow absorption of anesthetic from fat. However, the peak plasma concentration is 10-12 hours after injection so patients after the procedure can experience lidocaine toxicity at home and they and family members should be warned about signs and symptoms to look out for post procedure. With this in mind, the accepted safe dose is typically 35 mg/kg-50 mg/kg. Tumescent Infiltrate Estimate of Blood Loss Technique (as a % of volume aspirated) Dry No infiltrate 20-45 Wet Types of tumescent solutions F. Post-operative considerations 1. Lidocaine toxicity 2. Compression garments are key to providing comfort and helping obtain the final contour after surgery. 3. Large volume liposuction: considered as liposuction > 5L of lipoaspirate in most states a. Often warrants admission to the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. 4. Patients can experience large volume shifts after surgery, so special attention should be made in patients with cardiac or renal disease. II. CRYOLIPOLYSIS A. New technology that cools pockets of fat using a non-surgical device and induces adipocytes to undergo apoptosis B. Non-invasive technology C. Relies on the body's own system of apoptosis and clearance for removal of fat 154 III.EXCISIONAL BODY CONTOURING Focuses on removal of excess skin in addition to fat and can involve the breast, abdomen, arms, thighs, upper and lower back and buttock area. Many patients have hygiene issues with chronic rashes and infections. In the breasts, patients may have associate d back pain and cervical neck pain. A.Breast1.Goal: restore normal shape of breast +/ - increase or decrease volume based on pre -existing volume of the breast 2.Often the massive weight loss patient's breasts are associated with distortion of normal anatomy 3.Breasts can have medially deviated nipples, loss of lateral breast border with excess axillary tissue, hollowing of the upper pole of the breast and a lax inframammary fold 4.May require either removal of breast tissue (reduction) or rearrangement ofexisting tissue in a mastopexy (breast lift) 5.Can also involve placement of an implant to restore volume of shape which canbe placed behind the muscle, breast tissue or both (see chapter on breast augmentation). 6.Mastopexy in massive weight loss patients can use e xisting lateral breast tissue and rearrangement to restore the shape and preserve volume of the breast B.Arms 1.Goal: remove excess skin and fat from the axilla down to the forearm whennecessary to improve the contour of the arm 2.Brachioplasty is an excisiona l body contouring procedure that removes skin and fat and can extend into the axilla and past the forearm when necessary 3.Liposuction can be used as an adjunct to help debulk the arm before removalof skin or to help smooth the contour proximally and latera lly as well as circumferentially around the arm 4.A number of scars can be designed and are commonly posterior (straight vertical along the posterior arm) or low along the bicipital groove like the seam of a shirt so the scar is hidden with the arms at the side 5.Pinch test and \"tailor -tacking\" are key when determining amount of skin and fat that can be removed 6.Most common post -operative issue is a large, widened scar 7.There are several types of important anatomic structures deep to the fascia including branches of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MABC), which when damaged can lead paresthesias along the proximal forearm or apainful neuroma 8.Some surgeons close the skin as they cut each segment to prohibit edema andinability to close the arm. This is a dreaded complication that may require skin grafting. 9.Post-operative care usually involves a compression garment 155 C.Abdomen - Panniculectomy vs. Abdominoplasty 1.Goals: restore the normal contour of the abdomen +/ - correction of rectus diastasis or widening o f the medial edges of the rectus abdominus muscles 2.Panniculectomy - generally an infraumbilical wedge excision of excess skin and fat. Does not include rectus abdominis muscle plication. May or may not include umbilicoplasty (umbilicus is transposed into the newly mobilized abdominal tissue)a.Usually performed to improve hygiene issues as tissue under panniculus can be frequently macerated, ulcerated or infected b.Can be performed in a fleur -de-lis manner to excise not only vertical but horizontal excess 3.Abdominoplasty - usually infraumbilical and often supraumbilical excision of excess skin and fat. Often includes rectus plication to correct widely separated rectus muscles. Almost always involves umbilicoplasty with transposition of the umbilicus. a.Important to rule out existing hernias (umbilical or ventral) that may need repair as well as previous incisions including C -section scars and open cholecystectomy or appendectomy scars b.Commonly combined with lateral flank liposuction c.Has high risk of DVT/PE and patients are often assessed for risk of clot formation with the Caprini score. Many patients are on post -operative chemical DVT prophylaxis d.One of the highest risk cosmetic surgeries e.More commonly being performed without a drain as a \"drainless abdominoplasty\" in which progressive tension sutures are placed to close down dead space and reduce the risk of seroma formation f.Seromas are a common complication 4.Circumferential Abdominoplasty (Belt Lipectomy or Lower Body Lift): a.Goals: excise excess skin and fat circumferentially including the posterior waistline and flank areas b.Often begins with posterior excision then anterior excision c.Can be staged as two different procedures or performed in one stage D.Medial Thigh Lift 1.Goals: removal of excess skin and fat from the medial thigh 2.Can be performed with a number of incisions placed in the medial thigh(inguinal crease) sometimes with a vertical extension down the medial thigh 3.Results improved with suspension of the superficial fascial system to Collesfascia alo ng the pubic ramus 4.Liposuction can be used as an adjunct procedure to improve contour 5.Requires careful dissection over femoral triangle to preserve lymphatics and careful dissection medially to not injure the saphenous vein 6.Often requires drains but high r isk of seroma formation 7.Involves compression garment post -procedure E.Back1.Goals: excise extra skin and fat that can get be accentuated in clothes like bra's or dresses and improve the contour of the upper back 156 2.Direct excision of back rolls can be performed 3.Excisions can be combined with breast procedures as some patients have excess that courses laterally that is not breast tissue and is considered an \"upper body lift\" F.Buttock1.Goals: improve the contour and volume of the buttock 2.Commonly involves a posterior waistline scar with undermining into the gluteal area 3.The plane of dissection can be altered so that the tissue raised can be placedon top of the existing buttock tissue and used as a form of \"auto -augmentation\" 4.Gluteal implants, fat grafting and other purse- string suture can be used to augment the buttock which is often ptotic in massive weight loss patients REFERENCES 1.Achauer, BM, Eriksson, E, Guyuron, B, Coleman III, JJ, Russell, RC, and Vander Kolk, CA, Plastic Surgery Indications, Operations, and 5 3.McCarthy, JG, Galiano, RD, Boutros SG, Current Therapy in Plastic Surgery,Saunders, Elsevier, 2006 4.Shestak, KG (edito r) Abdominoplasty, Clinics in Plastic Surgery, 31 (4) October 5.Shridharani Broyles JM, Matarasso A.

Agag , MD I.INTRODUCTION A.Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty with global roots. Records dating back to 800BC in ancient India are the earliest known records of surgical rhinoplasty based on the works of Sushruta, an ayurvedic physician. B.However, clinical and technological advancements in the past century have notbenefited patients in the developing and developed world equally. II.GLOBAL PRACTICE IN PLASTIC SURGERY A.Plastic surgery practice in the low and middle income countries (LMIC) focuses largely of chronic wound care, burn care and congenital face and hand deformity reconstruction. B.There is a lack of access to reconstructive surgery in many parts of the world,especially in children, due to factors ranging from poverty to lack of surgical manpower. III.INTERNATIONAL PLASTIC SURGERY OUTREACH A.Plastic surgeons in the United States have sought to bridge this divide by organizing surgical missions to LMICs and providin g free surgical care. B.Plastic surgical charities/NGOs such as Operation Smile, Smil e Train, Resurge International (formerly Interplast ), Rotaplast and Facing The World spearhead these efforts. C.Smaller groups of surgeons or individual have also organized short trip s to resource -poor countries D.Surgical missions provide numerous benefits to patients who are otherwise unable to access surgical care. 1.They can provide resources and improve manpower and training for local partners. 2.They improve cost -conscious practice, cultural and clinical skills in volunteers. 3.Concerns exist about the standards of practice, cultural shock and ethics of surgical care delivery. E.Three common principles described by Garfein et. al. when delivering care indeveloping countries include 1.Build and support local infrastructure 2.Create long -term, self -sufficient care 3.Adhere to the highest standards. 162 4.Patel et al have described a diagonal approach to surgical care delivery that takes all these factors into consideration (Figure 1). Figure 1. The diagonal approach to i nternational surgical outreach. From Patel, et al. An opportunity for diagonal development in global surgery: cleft lip and palate care in resource -limited settings . Plast Surg Int 2012. IV.EDUCATION A.Plastic surgical trainees also participate in surgical missions and several residency programs have obtained approval from the Residency Review Committee of the ACGME to include global health or international rotations to LMICs as part of surgical training . B.Such rotations benefit residents by exposing them to different pathologies andinnovative operative and treatment approaches. C.Global surgery fellowships focused on plastic surgery also provide post -residency clinical and research training for advanced trainees with a caree r interest in global surgery (Table 1). 163 Table 1.

Mountziaris, MD, PhD and Richard L. Agag, MD I.INTRODUCTION A.Microsurgery: type of surgery which uses precision instruments and a microscope to perform intricate surgery on small structures (arteries, veins, nerves, lymph vessels) B.Examples1.Free tissue transfer (aka \"free flap\" surgery), wherein living tissue is transplanted from one part of th e body to another (Figure 1) 2.Appendage replantation or reconstruction (Figure 2) 3.Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA), wherein living tissue is transplanted from one individual to another (face and hand transplants) C.Potential tissues transferre d: skin, muscle, tendons, bone, nerve, lymph nodes D.Transferred tissue is selected so it can survive based on a vascular pedicle. 1.Tissue is transferred to another region of the body 2.Artery and vein are re -connected (\"anastomosed\") to blood vessels in the recipient site 3.Microvascular anastomosis restores blood supply to the transferred tissue Figure 1. Free tissue transfer (\"free flap\") for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Abdominal tissue is transferred to the former breast site, including the Deep and/or Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery/Vein (DIEA/V, SIEA/V).

In the osteocutaneous free fibula flap, the fibula is harvested with a cuff of muscle, the peroneal artery, and either the lateral or posterior sural nerve to create the sensate phallus. The neourethra is created from a groin skin flap. In the r adial forearm free flap, the tube -in-tube design is used to create a neophallus and neourethra in a single flap. The radial artery and the antebrachial nerves are harvested to create the sensate phallus. The Norfolk technique is used for the radial forearm free flap to create a glans. From Morrison S , et al .

The management of the patient with a major thermal injury requires an understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment not only of the local skin injury, but also of the derangements that occur in hemodynamic, m echanisms. I.BURNS A.Pathophysiology: Amount of tissue destruction is based on temperature (> 40\u00b0 C) and time of exposure (Figure 1). Figure 1. Tissue destruction based on temperature 191 B. Diagnosis and prognosis 1. Burn size: % of total body surface area (TBSA) burned a. Rough estimate is based on rule of 9's (Figure 2) b. Different charts are required for adults and children because of head-chest size discrepancy and limb differentials for ages birth to seven years (Figures 3 and 4). c. Patient palm size can be used to estimate TBSA - palm is approximately 1% TBSA Figure 2. TBSA burn based on rule of 9's. 192 Figure 3 193 Figure 4 194 2.Age: burns at the extremes of age carry a greater morbidity and mortality 3.Depth: may be difficult to assess initially as injury can evolve and deepen over 24-48 hours a.Type and temperature of etiologic agent, and time of exposure helpful b.Classification (Figure 5 and Table 1 ) i.First degree: superficial - erythema but no skin breaks, similar to a sunburn ii.Second degree: blisters present, red and painful (a)Superficial degree: muscle, bone affected c.Zones of injury i.Coagulation (central): tissues undergo necrosis and are irreparably damaged ii.Stasis (intermediate): vasoconstriction and ischemia (can (peripheral): heals without scarring 4.Location: face and neck, hands, feet, and perineum may cause special problems and warrant careful attention; often necessitate hospitalization and/ortransfer to a burn center (See Table 2) 5.Inhalation injury: beware of burns occurring in enclosed spaces, singednasal/fa cial hair, carbon particles in pharynx, hoarseness, conjunctivitis - patients may not initially have any signs of airway compromise, so must havehigh index of suspicion. 6.Associated injuries, e.g. fractures - depending on circumstances surrounding burn, p atients may require full trauma workup 195 Figure 5. Classification of burns by depth 196 Degree Depth Layers Involved Features Healing Time Management First Superficial Epidermis only Pink, red, brisk capillary refill, painful <7 days edematous, brisk capillary refill, very painful White, pink, red, dry, no blanching, reduced sensation Variable 10-28 days Daily wound care, debride sloughed skin Daily wound care, surgical excision and resurfacing Third Full thickness Epidermis, entire dermis White, brown, dry, leathery, no blanching, insensate >21 days Surgical excision and resurfacing Fourth Full thickness Epidermis, entire dermis, fat, fascia, muscle, bone Exposed deep tissue N/A Amputation, complex reconstruction Table 1. Description and features of burns based on depth 7. Co-morbid factors, e.g. pre-existing cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and metabolic diseases; seizure disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse 8. Prognosis: best determined by burn size (TBSA) and age of patient, presence of inhalation injury (Figure 6) 9. Circumferential burns: can restrict blood flow to extremity, respiratory excursion of chest and may require escharotomies 10. Certain criteria are used to make the determination regarding whether transfer to a burn is necessary (Table 2) 197 Figure 6 Burn Center Referral Criteria (ABA Guidelines) 1.Partial thickness burns greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA) in patients <10 yr or >50 yr 2.Partial -thickness burns greater than 20% total body surface area in all patients. 3.Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints. 4.Third degree burns in any age group. 5.Electrical burns, including lightning injury. 6.Chemical burns. 7.Inhalation injury. 8.Burn injury in patients with preexisting medical disorders that couldcomplicate management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality. 9.Any patient with burns and concomitant trauma (such as fractures) inwhich the burn injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality. 10. Burned children in hospitals without qualified personnel or equipment forthe care of children. 11. Burn injury in p atients who will require special social, emotional, or rehabilitative intervention. Table 2. Burn Center referral guidelines C.Treatment plan 1.History and physical exam a.In pediatric burns where the history does not correlate with the burn injury, consider the possibility of child abuse - contact social work and/or follow hospital -specific protocols. 2.Relieve respiratory distress - escharotomies and/or intubation - see bel ow. 3.Prevent and/or treat burn shock - fluid resuscitation with large bore IV (x2) 4.Monitor resuscitation - Foley catheter and hourly urine output 5.Treat ileus and nausea - N.G. tube if chest x- ray, arterial blood gases, and carboxyhemoglobin) 9.Cleanse, debride, and treat the burn wounds D.Respiratory involvement 1.Three major causes of r espiratory distress in the burned patient a.Unyielding burn eschar encircling chesti.Distress may be apparent immediately ii.Requires escharotomies (cutting into the eschar to relieve constriction) b.Carbon monoxide poisoning i.May be present immediately or have a delayed presentation; high level of suspicion if patient exposed to smoke in an enclosed space ii.Diagnosed by carboxyhemoglobin levels measured in arterial blood gas iii.Important to remember that patients with a history of smoking may havebaseline elevated ca rboxyhemoglobin iv.Initial Rx is displacement of CO by 100% O 2 by facemask v.Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be of value, but is often not practical in many locations c.Smoke inhalation leading to pulmonary injuryi.Insidious in onset (18 -36 hours) ii.Due to incompl ete products of combustion, not heat (direct thermal injury to lungs occurs only secondary to steam burns) iii.Causes chemical injury to alveolar basement membrane andsubsequent pulmonary edema iv.Initial Rx is humidified O 2 but intubation and respiratory suppor t may be required v.Secondary bacterial infection of the initial chemical injury leads toprogressive pulmonary insufficiency and infection - mucosal barrier of respiratory tract is damaged vi.Severe inhalation injury alone or in combination with thermal injur y carries a grave prognosis vii.Three stages of presentation have been described: (a)Acute pulmonary insufficiency (immediately postburn to 48 hours) (b)Pulmonary edema (48 -72 hours) (c)Bronchopneumonia (25 days) vii.Monitor respiratory and mental status - be aware of hoarseness, wheezing, stridor. If any concerns about current or future airway involvement, best to intubate patient prior to excessive airway edema E.Burn shock1.Massive amounts of fluid, electrolytes, and protein are lost from circulation almost immediatel y after burning (Table 3) 199 Table 3. Burn shock 2.Systemic inflammatory response occurs if > 20% TBSA burn in adults, >30% TBSA in children, and >15% TBSA in elderly - results in a hypermetabolic state and increased capillary permeability - causing 3.Resu scitation requires replacement of sodium ions and water to restore plasma volume and cardiac output - initiate if adult burns >15 -20% TBSA and pediatric burns >10% TBSA a.Many formulas have been reported to achieve resuscitation - these serve only as a guide for initial IVF - must also monitor UOP to appropriately titrate rate i.Parkland formula: 2 -4cc Ringer's lactate/Kg/%TBSA burn over the first 24 hours ii.1/2 of the 24- hour fluid requirement should be given in the first eight hours postburn and the remaining 1/2 over the next 16 hours iii.Remember to factor in any fluid boluses patient may have received either in ED or at OSH when performing calculations b.Administration of colloid during or after resuscitation can vary from burncenter to burn center c.Children - should receive maintenance fluids (weight -based 5% dextrose in half-normal saline), as well as resuscitative resuscitation1.Urine output 0.5 -1cc/kg/hr in adults and 1cc/Kg/hr in children < age 12 2.A clear sensorium, pulse 140/min, BP >9 0/60 18meq/L, cardiac output > 3.5 L/min/M2 200 3.CVP in acute major burns is unreliable - use if myocardial disease, age > 65, inhalation injury, fluid requirements > 150% of expected G.Metabolic considerations 1.Increased metabolic demands in patient s with burn injury (hypermetabolic state) 2.High carbohydrate/high protein diet - dietician and tube feeds as needed 3.Early feeding (start at 12 hours) - prevents mucosal atrophy, ulceration, bacterial translocation itional status H.Treatment of the burn wound 1.Wound closure by the patient's own skin (autograft) is the ultimate goal of treatment a.By spontaneous healing b.Autograft c.Allograft d.Xenograft e.Artificial skin f.Cultured epithelial cells 2.Specific treatment of th e burn wound differs from one burn center to another a.The most commonly employed topical antibacterials are silver sulfadiazine(Silvadene\u00ae) and mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon\u00ae) b.Dressing changes at least 1x/day with soap and water - no need to scrub or remove blisters c.Status of burn wound bacterial colonization and effectiveness of topicalantibacterial treatment can be monitored by biopsies of wound for quantitative and qualitative bacteriology d.Systemic antibiotic therapy only used for sepsis, not prophyla ctically (breeds resistant organisms) 3.Necrotic tissues or any burned tissue not expected to heal within 2 -3 weeks may be removed by any of several techniques a.Formal excision b.Tangential (layered) debridement c.Enzymatic debridement d.Hydrotherapy - a useful adjunct 4.Autografts should be applied to priority areas first, such as the hands, face and important joints, as well as the neck for possible tracheostomy placement 5.Once healed, pressure with elastic support/compression garments is usually necessary to reduce hypertrophic scarring 6.Physical therapy/occupational therapy - important adjunct in burn care, helps prevent contractures, especially for burns that cross joint surfaces I.Complications: can occur in every physiologic system or se cond ary to burn injury (Table 5 ) 1.Renal failurea.From hypovolemia b.Beware of nephrotoxic antibiotics in the burn patient 201 c.Myoglobinuria associated with compartment syndrome Table 5. Burn wound infection risk factors 2.Gastrointestinal bleeding a.Curling's ulcer: gastric ulcer that results from large TBSA burn due to decreased plasma volume - causing ischemia of gastric mucosa. More likely in burns over 40% b.Usually remains subclinical c.Antacids and H 2 blockers risk with burn wound sepsis 3.Burn wound sepsis a.Monitored by tissue biopsy - qualitative and quantitative b.Must keep bacterial count < 105 bacteria/gm of tissue c.Clinically suspect global sepsis withi.Sudden onset of hyper or hypothermia ii.Unexpected congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema iii.Development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome iv.Ileus occurring after 48 hours postburn v.Mental status change vii.Thrombocytopenia viii. Hypofibrinogenemia ix.Hyper suspect if burn > 40% TBSA x.Blood cultures may be positive but in many cases are not 4.Progressive UOP, increased risk for i.Abdominal compartment syndrome a.Largely preventable b.Active range of motion of involved and adjacent joints is encouraged to prevent joint contractures from the outset i.Splints and passive range of motion are used if active range of motion is unable to be performed, e.g. elbow and knee are kept in extension and MCP joints of fingers in flexion ii.Limb elevation and range of motion are useful for reducing edema andmaintaining movement c.Timely wound closure with adequate amounts of skin should largelyeliminate these problems d.Continued postoperative splinting and elastic pressure supports are of value in the remodeling of collagen with prevention of hypertrophic scars e.Contractures may require future revision and reconstructive proceduresmonths to years after original burn injur y. II.CHEMICAL BURNS A.Pathophysiology 1.Tissue damage secondary to a a.Nature b.Concentration of the agent d.Length of time the agent is in contact with tissue e.Degree of tissue penetration f.Mechanism of action B.Diagnosis 203 1. Chemical burns are deeper than initially appear and may progress with time a. Alkali burns may be more severe due to ability to deeply penetrate tissues b. Fluid resuscitation needs often underestimated c. Watch for renal/liver/pulmonary damage C. Treatment 1. Initial treatment is dilution of the chemical with tap water a. Copious irrigation for 30 minutes b. Exception - cement/concrete/powdered lye/other powders should be brushed off dry 2. Special attention to eyes - after copious irrigation with saline, consult ophthalmologist 3. After 12 hours initial dilution, local care of the wound with debridement, topical antibacterials, and eventual wound closure is same as for thermal burn D. Of particular note are: 1. Gasoline a. Excretion by lung b. May cause large skin burn, if immersed c. Watch for atelectasis, pulmonary infiltrates; surfactant is inhibited 2. Phenol a. Dull, gray color to skin, may turn black b. Urine may appear smoky in color c. Spray water on burn surface d. Wipe with polyethylene glycol e. Direct renal toxicity 3. Hydrofluoric acid a. Irrigate copiously with water b. Subcutaneous injections of 10% calcium gluconate, or intra-arterial infusion in affected extremities c. Serial EKG and BMP monitoring of patients - may become hypocalcemic d. Pulmonary edema may occur if subjected to fumes e. Monitor effectiveness of treatment by frequent pain assessment - if treatment is working, pain should decrease 4. White phosphorous burn a. Do not allow to desiccate - may ignite b. Each particle must be removed mechanically c. Copper sulfate (2%) may counteract to make phosphorous more visible (turns black in color) d. Watch for EKG changes (Q - T interval and S - T and T wave changes) e. May cause hemoglobinemia and renal failure III. ELECTRICAL INJURIES A. Pathophysiology 1. Effects of passage of electric current through the body depend on: a. Type of circuit 204 b.Voltage of circuit c.Resistance offered by body d.Amperage of current flowing through tissue e.Pathway of current through the body f.Duration of contact 2.Tissue resistance to electrical current increases from nerve (least resistant) to vessel to muscle to skin to tendon to fat to bone B.Diagnosis1.Types of injury a.Arc injury: localized injury caused by intense heat, current does not run through patient's body b.Injury due to currenti.Due to heat generated as current flows through tissue (a)Injury more severe in tissue with high resistance (i.e. bones) (b)Vessels thrombose as current passes rapidly along them ii.Effect of current may not be immediately seen C.Special effects of electrical injury 1.Cardiopulmonary a.Anoxia and ventricular fibrillation may cause immediate death b.Early and delayed rhythm abnormalities can occur c.EKG changes may occur some time after the burn in a delayed fashion - need serial EKG monitoring 2.Renal a.High risk of renal failure due to hemoglobin and myoglobin deposits in renal tubules - important to see if myoglobinuria is present i.Requires higher IVF/urine flow (75cc/hr in adults) ii.Must alkalinize urine to keep hemoglobin and myoglobin in more solublestate iii.Mannitol may be useful to clear heavy protein load 3.Musculoskeletal a.Tetanic muscle contractions may be strong enough to fracture bones, especially spine b.Although there may be minimal external damage, have a high suspicion forcompartment syndrome in extremit ies 4.Spinal Cord Damagea.Can occur secondary to fracture or demyelinating effecting of current 5.Abdominal effectsa.Intraperitoneal damage can occur to G.I. tract secondary to current 6.Vascular effectsa.Vessel thrombosis progresses with time b.Delayed rupture of major vessels can occur 7.Cataract formation - late complication 8.Seizures D.Treatment 1.CPR if necessary 2.Fluids - usually large amounts 205 a.No formula is accurate because injury is more extensive than can be predicted by skin damage b.Alkalinize with NaHCO 3, if myo globinuria or hemoglobinuria present 3.Monitoring a.CVP or pulmonary wedge pressure helpful since total capillary leak does not occur as it does in a in thermal burn b.Maintain urine output at 75 -100cc/hr until all myoglobin and/or hemoglobin disappears from u rine 4.Wound Management a.Topical agent with good penetrating ability (Silvadene\u00ae) or mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon\u00ae)] b.Debride non -viable tissue early and repeat as necessary (every 48 hrs) to prevent sepsis c.Major amputati ons frequently required d.Technicium -99 stannous pyrophosphate scintigraphy may be useful to evaluate muscle damage 5.Treat associated injuries (e.g. fractures) IV.COLD INJURIES The two conditions of thermal injury due to cold are local injury (frostbite) and systemic injury (hypothermia) A.Frostbite 1.Pathophysiology a.Formation of ice crystals in tissue fluid i.Usually in areas which lose heat rapidly (e.g. extremities) b.Anything which increases heat loss from the body such as wind velocity, ordecreases tissue perfusion, such as tight clothing, predisposes the patient to frostbite c.Ability of various tissues to withstand cold injury is inversely proportional totheir water content 2.Treatment a.The key to successful treatment is rapid rewarming in a 40\u00b0 C water bath i.Admission to hospital usually required (a)Tetanus prophylaxis (b)Wound management (c)Physical therapy (i)Maintenance of range of motion important (ii)Daily whirlpool and exercise (d)Sympathectomy, anti -coagulants, and early amputation of questionable value in controlled studies ii.Usually wait until complete demarcation before proceeding with amputations. Non -viable portions of extremities will often autoamputate with good cosmetic and functional results. B.Hypothermia 206 1.Diagnosis a.Core temperature < 34\u00b0 C b.Symptoms and signs mimic many other diseases c.High level of suspicion necessary during cold injury season 2.Treatmenta.Must be rapid to prevent death b.Monitor EKG, CVP, and arterial blood gases and pH during andresuscitation, maintain urine output of 50cc/hr c.Begin Ringer's ampule tube if necessary e.Rapidly rewarm in 40\u00b0 C hydrotherapy tank (requires 1 -2 hours to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C) f.Treat arrhythmias with IV Lidocaine or Amiodarone drip if necessary g.Evaluate and treat a ny accompanying disease states V.LIGHTNING INJURIES A.Cutaneous effects - lightning strikes may cause cutaneous burn wounds 1.Contact burns from clothing on fire or contact with hot metal (i.e. zippers, etc) 2.Entry and exit burns are usually small, may be partial or full thickness 3.Lightning burns are not the same as electrical burns - don't get deep tissue injury B.May have temporary ischemic effects on extremity - pallor or neurologic deficits. Spontaneous rec overy after a few hours is the rule - probably due to local vasoconstriction C.Systemic effects can occur such as arrhythmias, cataracts, CNS symptoms (similar to electrical injuries) REFERENCES Wolf S.E., and Herndon D.N.

CLASSIFICATION Stage 0 (or Ia) Latent or subclinical condition where swelling is not evident despite impaired lymph transport. It may exist months or years before overt edema occurs (Stages I-III) Stage I Early accumulation of fluid relatively high in protein content that improves with limb elevation. Pitting may occur. Stage II Limb elevation alone rarely reduces tissue swelling and pitting is manifest. Stage II (late) Loss of pitting edema due to fibrosis and deposition of lymphadiposal tissue. Stage III Lymphostatic elephantiasis. Gross limb enlargement with absent pitting. Trophic skin changes develop, such as acanthosis, fat deposits, and warty overgrowths. Table 1. International Society of Lymphology (ISL) Classification A. Newer classifications consider limb circumference or estimated limb volume B. Limb circumference should be measured at defined points (reduces variability between evaluators) 216 Figure 1. Finger pressure produces pitting edema in a patient with Stage 1 lymphedema.

Lymphatic Filariasis (if patient is from or recently travelled to endemic region) B. Nocturnal blood smear: microscopic identification of microfilariae with Giemsa or hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stain. Blood collection should be done at night to coincide with peaks levels of microfilariae. C. Serum antifilarial IgG4 Assay: serologic study that detects elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in blood of patients with active filarial infection. D. Standardized limb circumference measurements: measure circumference in office at set intervals (e.g. 4 cm) from tip of 2nd toe (lower extremity) or long finger (upper extremity). Allows for calculation of estimated limb volume. E. Direct lymphangiography: visualize lymphatic channels using oil-based iodine contrast agent directly injected into lymphatics (rarely done today). F. Lymphocintigram: nuclear medicine technique to visualize lymphatic channels using injection of filtered colloid of Technetium-99m (Tc99m) subdermally into limb. Tc99m selectively taken up by lymphatics to allow visualization. G. Laser angiography with indocyanine green (ICG): similar technique to lymphocintigram but uses ICG injection that can be performed in office or operating room settings. It is commonly used intraoperative to plan the location of the lymphaticovenular anastomosis (Figure 2). H. MR-Lymphangiogram: high resolution imaging of lymphatic system. Injection of ferumoxytol can help distinguish lymphatics from veins I. Lymphedema Index (L-Dex): office-based device measures differences in fluid accumulation between limbs. J. Other possible investigations 1. Ultrasound: if clinical concerns of DVT 2. Fungal culture: if concerns of superimposed fungal infection 217 Figure 2. Imaging used to identify lymphatic channels. Magnetic resonance lymphangiogram showing (A) veins with a smoother appearance and (B) lymphatic channels with beadlike characteristics. Laser angiography with subdermal injection of indocyanine green (ICG) can also be used to observe lymphatic channels (C) that preferentially take up ICG in the interstitium.
