The development of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus highlights the need for a preventive vaccine. In the present paper we explore the structure and function of FhuD2 (ferric-hydroxamate uptake D2), a staphylococcal surface lipoprotein mediating iron uptake during invasive infection, recently described as a promising vaccine candidate. Differential scanning fluorimetry and calorimetry studies revealed that FhuD2 is stabilized by hydroxamate siderophores. The FhuD2-ferrichrome interaction was of nanomolar affinity in surface plasmon resonance experiments and fully iron(III)-dependent.

The ligand, ferrichrome, occupies a cleft between the FhuD2 N- and C-terminal lobes. Many FhuD2-siderophore interactions enable the specific recognition of ferrichrome. Biochemical data suggest that FhuD2 does not undergo significant conformational changes upon siderophore binding, supporting the hypothesis that the ligand-bound complex is essential for receptor engagement and uptake. Finally, immunizations with FhuD2 alone or FhuD2 formulated with hydroxamate siderophores were equally protective in a murine staphylococcal infection model, confirming the suitability and efficacy of apo-FhuD2 as a protective antigen, and suggesting that other class III SBPs might also be exploited as vaccine candidates.", "sitename": "Portland Press", "date": "2013-02-01", "cleaned_text": "Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen causing globally significant morbidity and mortality.
