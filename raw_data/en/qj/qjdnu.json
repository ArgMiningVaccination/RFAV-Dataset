Last updated on Aug 22, 2023. Clinical Overview Use Periwinkle alkaloids have been used to treat certain cancers; however, use of the plant for this purpose is not recommended without consulting a health care provider. Periwinkle has been studied for potential antimicrobial and antiprotozoal applications, as well as for use in diabetes and wound healing; however, clinical trial data are lacking to recommend use for these indications. Dosing There are no recent clinical data to support specific dosing recommendations for periwinkle. Traditional doses have included 10 leaves and 10 flowers boiled in water as a tea, or 9 pink flowers in 0.5 L of water for 3 hours (\"solar tea\") sipped throughout the day. Preparations of the pure alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are available, with associated therapeutic dosing recommendations. Contraindications Contraindications have not been identified. Pregnancy/Lactation Avoid use. Abortifacient effects have been documented. Interactions None well documented. Adverse Reactions Clinical information is lacking. Toxicology Severe, systemic adverse events are associated with use of the periwinkle alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine. Scientific Family - Apocyanaceae (dogbane) Botany Periwinkle, first described in Madagascar, is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 m in height. It is highly branched and develops a woody base, with flowers that can bloom throughout the year depending on the climate. The flowers are often bred for their unique colors, ranging from white to green-yellow and lavender. The seed pod dries, splits, and releases numerous tiny seeds. The stem produces a milky sap that is rich in indole alkaloids. related plant Vinca minor (common periwinkle, myrtle) is used as plant was introduced in Europe during the mid-1700s and was cultivated as an ornamental. It grows throughout the world, and periwinkle plantations have been established on continents with warmer climates. The plant has been widely used in tropical folk medicine. Decoctions of the plant have been used to treat ocular inflammation, diabetes, hemorrhage, of the most chemically, and biologically active phytomolecules. These monoterpenoid indole alkaloids have a wide activities. [Sharma 2020](#31729591) Approximately 130 terpenoid indole alkaloids Der Heijden 2004](#15032608) The concentration of alkaloids varies with the region of harvest and plant part. The most well-known of the vinca alkaloids derived from C. roseus are vinblastine and vincristine, which are widely used antineoplastic agents. Identification of other alkaloids with cytotoxic potential [Goboza 2019](#30784928), 2015](#25665941) The aqueous plant extract is rich phenolic compounds, including caffeoylquinic acid and flavonoids with antioxidant potential. The leaves also contain complex and Pharmacology Antimicrobial/Antifungal activity Animal and in vitro data In vitro studies suggest C. roseus extracts possess antimicrobial effects. [Almagro 2015](#25685907), [Nayak 2007](#17683880) extracts from different parts of C. roseus (eg, leaves, stems, roots, flowers) were tested for antibacterial activity, leaf extracts showed significantly higher activity, suggesting that bioactive compounds of C. roseus can potentially be exploited as antibacterial agents; activity has not been attributed to a single alkaloid. [Almagro 2015](#25685907) In other in vitro studies, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts were active against all tested bacteria except Salmonella typhi. [Bakht 2015](#26004715), [Nayak [Gupta 2018](#30233518) Antifungal activity of C. roseus has also been documented in vitro and in vivo. [Naz 2015](#26004716) The ethyl acetate extracts of C. roseus also showed concentration-dependent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against various bacteria, yeast, and fungi, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 7.8 to 250 mcg/mL. [Sudharshana 2018](#30834151) The C. roseus plant has been the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) [Mukunthan 2011](#23569773); in a study in which biosynthesis of AgNPs from C. roseus leaf extracts was conducted, synthesized AgNPs exhibited strong in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities against various pathogens. [Al-Shmgani 2017](#27534756) Antiparasitic activity In vitro data Anthelminthic activity of C. roseus has been described in vitro, [Kamaraj 2011](#20980034) and antimalarial properties have been highlighted, including anopheles. [Chan 2016](#27417173), [Panneerselvam 2013](#24083578), [Subarani 2013](#23790333) Cancer Animal and vitro data Numerous older animal studies using vinca alkaloids as chemotherapeutic agents have been described. [Noble the unprecedented bisindole alkaloid cathachunine (lacking C-18 and C-19) was isolated from C. roseus. This lead compound exerted a potent antitumor effect on human leukemia cells through induction of apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway. [Wang 2016](#27161405) Photosynthesized gold nanoparticles from C. roseus have demonstrated the ability to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis in cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells). [Ke 2019](#31099261) Clinical data Vincristine and vinblastine derived from periwinkle are recognized pharmacological agents in chemotherapy and are used to treat Hodgkin disease, lymphocytic leukemia, and other cancers. [Chan 2016](#27417173), [van Wyk 2015](#26498493) Extensive documentation exists regarding clinical other C. roseus purified alkaloids. [van Der Heijden 2004](#15032608) Clinical studies using the whole plant to treat cancers are lacking. Dementia In vitro data Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity has been demonstrated by the root of the plant and aqueous extracts (primarily arginine), [Pereira in dementia. [Shakir 2013](#23844333) Dermatological effects Animal and in vitro data In limited studies using rats, researchers found increased wound healing rates with topical and oral ethanolic flower extracts. [Nayak 2006](#17184528), [Nayak 2007](#17683880) An in vitro study showed limited effects of C. roseus extract on markers of psoriasis. [Pattarachotanant 2014](#25435888) In vivo assessment of wound healing in AgNPs-treated mice revealed effectiveness in closuring and reducing the size of wounds. [Al-Shmgani 2017](#27534756) Clinical data An ethnopharmacological survey conducted in Palestine showed that C. roseus was one of the most frequently used medicinal plants (often as a paste) to treat psoriasis. [Shawahna 2017](#28049474) Diabetes and hyperlipidemia Animal and in vitro data Screening studies suggest potential applications for C. roseus in diabetes. [Almagro 2015](#25685907), [van Der Heijden 2004](#15032608) Experiments using rodents showed that periwinkle crude leaf extract elucidated a mechanism of action for activity similar to that of tolbutamide because of increased glucose metabolism and transport, as well as antioxidant effects on pancreatic tissue. Animal studies have also shown that periwinkle hypolipidemic effect. [Patel 2011](#22125959), [Rasineni 2010](#21808566), [Rasineni with induced diabetes, high-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol levels were increased in those administered an ethanol leaf extract of C. roseus compared with the diabetic control group; this finding suggests that the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of C. roseus are similar to effects of the standard antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. [Chandra Mohan 2015](#Chandra-Mohan.2015) A phenolic fraction of C. roseus containing gallic acid and chlorogenic acid had a hypoglycemic effect on mice that may be explained by an increase in insulin secretion. [Espejel-Nava 2018](#30534178) Erectile dysfunction The presence of yohimbine in the C. roseus plant extract has led to its use in erectile dysfunction; however, clinical studies to support this use are lacking. [Almagro 2015](#25685907) Dosing There are no recent clinical data to support specific dosing recommendations for periwinkle. Traditional doses have included 10 leaves and 10 flowers boiled in water as a tea, or 9 pink flowers in 0.5 L of water for 3 hours (\"solar tea\") sipped throughout the day. [Duke 2002](#Duke.2002) Preparations of the pure alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are available, with associated therapeutic dosing recommendations. Pregnancy / Lactation Avoid use. Abortifacient effects have been documented. [Ernst 2002](#11950176) Interactions Case reports are lacking regarding drug interactions with C. roseus. An in vitro study evaluated the effect of periwinkle alkaloids on the CYP-450 enzyme system, and some isolated alkaloids showed potent inhibition of CYP2D6 but weak activity against CYP3A4. [Usia 2005](#15930738) Blood pressure-lowering agents: Monitor for excessive decreases in blood pressure if herbal products with hypotensive properties are used with blood pressure-lowering agents.
