The Need for the Study The goals of the educative process have been long established.\"*\" 2 These goals have also been clearly stated. There is, however, less clar\u00ad ity and less uniformity in the study of the patterns of instruction by which it is anticipated that the goals can be achieved. There is a con\u00ad tinuing need for careful study in this area. There is need to discover raw ways and to evaluate both these new ways and also those methods al\u00ad ready in common use. This study is concerned with the comparative effec\u00ad tiveness in reaching set goals of achievement when the learner partici\u00ad pates both in goal-setting and in the learning processes involved in the course-content selection. This situation is compared with so-called learn\u00ad ing situations when planning has been done by the teacher and the learner is largely a passive receiver. 1. The Problem of Instruction A review of the literature concerned with 'education shows that major emphasis has usually been placed on the ways of presenting subject matter. The method of sfeucty\" has usually been that of analysis in an attempt to locate the problem, followed by proposals to alter the method of presen\u00ad tation, without much concern for the processes try which such changes are ^W, S. Monroe, Editor, \"Method of Teaching\" Encyclopedia of Educa\u00ad \"General Education,\" pp. k&9-90. 1 2 expected to work. In the larger area of method, within which presentation of material is seen as one aspect of many methods, the term \"impart\" is frequently used. This term suggests that the basic assumption is that a \"body of knowledge\" somewhere is to be transferred to the learner, pre\u00ad sumably by word of mouth or by the printed word. There is a good deal of evidence that learning does not take place in this way. Different approaches have been used by various research workers. Per\u00ad haps the most common method which has been used might be called the philo\u00ad sophical approach. This method usually consists of considerations of the relative worth of items of fact usually taught, and, in terms of what one generation thinks would be good for another, of thinking out ways by which such learning can be transferred to the minds of the learner. Often whole methodologies have been put forth without once submitting them to a test of fact. A second method appears to rest upon a procedure in which the teacher works by inspiration, in a kind of trial and error method, and, \"after the fact,\" constructs a methodology to account for what appears to have hap\u00ad pened to the learners. A third, and more recently developed, method involves the careful planning and thoughtful analysis of the first approach} an establishment of experimental situations, controlling as many factors as possible, and a comparison of the products of the experimental group with the products of the control group. Even with all this careful planning, studies were often made without any challenging of the basic assumptions or any clari\u00ad fication of facts as opposed to opinion. The history of method also shows that progress in improving instruc\u00ad tion has been slow. It was not until this century that progress in 3 improving instruction has advanced beyond the ordinary course of events. These more recent developments have come about through the endeavors of educators who applied the scientific approach to the areas of psychology and education. Despite this fact, it cannot yet be stated ths.t actual processes of instruction are significantly different from or substantially better than the instruction of earlier periods. Current publications in this field are not generally consistent with our present knowledge of how individuals learn and now their learning may be guided. Instruction can be improved when teaching procedures are rooted in an experimental approach to learning 2# Significant Development The most significant developments in method during this centuiy have been made in the elementary school grades and have involved \"the theoiy and practice of teaching in certain subject fields. Recognizing these evi\u00ad dences of progress in selected areas, it is well established that instruc\u00ad tion has been and is a neglected aspect of American education. It is evi\u00ad dent, however, that we are now on the verge of a sharp change in educa\u00ad tional thought and practice. This change gives promise! of a new technique for teaching. Teaching procedures which consist mainly of assign-stucly- recite are based on the concept that learning is essentially a matter of memorizing. Instruction then consists of defining the content to be learned (the assignment) and of checking up to determine the amount of learning that has occurred (the recitation). The student's \"studying his lesson\" may train him in the process of memorizing, but is not very fruit\u00ad ful if that is its sole purpose. ^Nelson B. Henry, Editor, \"Learning and Instruction,\" The Forty-Ninth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education; Part I, The University of Chicago Press, 1950, pp. U-5. u Reccnt studies of the learning process lead to defining learning as change in behavior. This point of view largely excludes the older notion of transfer of fact from one head to the other. Instruction,, then, is a poor tool for our purpose, and we. shall need to lay it down, as a carpen\u00ad ter lays QO\u00ae his hammer, which was usexxil \"when he was \"driving things in,\" bub no use for catting a board. Using this conception, guidance is the proper tool since the learner is the only one who can change his behaving. A change in one's behavior means ar$r change in his action. Research in learning can make definite contributions to the area of educational objectives, to educational theory in the organisation of the content and activities that make up educative experiences, and to the de- 1 termination of how specific aspects of behavior are best learned. 3# Method Courses Inadequate. Few of the standard texts in the field of general education methods approach the problems of instruction from the point of view of a modern concept of learning. In some instances these publications might well be called books about methods rather than guides or manuals to train teachers to perform their role as instructors with art and skill# Seldom, in the educational training of the teacher are the relationships between psy\u00ad chology of learning and method of teaching made explicit and concrete. The teacher who is held responsible for the training of other teachers is often a person who has learned to perform with a certain degree of effi\u00ad ciency in the teaching process. His methods course is composed of certain teaching experiences organized into a teaching content. Such contribution that he is ahie to make to the teacher's training must be theoretical^ yet '\"Ibid., pp. 7-8. $ 1 his specific contribution to the teaching procedure is untested, ll. Problem of College Teaching The problem of college teaching is receiving greater attention. In recent y^ars there has been great dissatisfaction with the practice teach\u00ad ing offered in colleges. It has been under careful study for some time,, As it became evident that words were not as adequate as had been thought, it followed that investigators became skeptical of the usefulness of toe lecture -note-taking method of learning. There is an increasing demand for greater student participation with a decreasing attempt to cover all as\u00ad pects of every field of study. To become increasingly self-reliant, the students must be given as much freedom of choice as they can assume, freedom concerning how to approach the subject matter, how to evaluate it, and within reason, what material should be studied within the confines of the course. In addition to the question of freedom of choice on the part of the student is the parallel question: what kind gf direction or leadership should be exer\u00ad cised by the teaclsr. 5. Teaching General Education Courses There is a rapidly growing demand for systematic improvement of in\u00ad struction in general education courses. Eariy in the developmental stages of the general education movement, it, was the usual practice to divide a survey course among two or three instructors, each assigned only to course materials relating to his specialty. This factor along with the related circumstances is considered the greatest single obstacle retarding progress in the development of general education courses today. This procedure makes a difficult situation for the instructors and an unfortunate circum\u00ad stance for the students. In fact, there is no improvement shown over the \"'\"lbid., p q 6. ^Richard H. Thornton, Editor, \"Teaching College Students,11 What the Colleges are Doings New York; Ginn and Go,, No. 100, Fall, 19i?i4, p\u00ab H* 6 traditional plan, since the subject-matter areas composing ehe various courses are still being taught as isolated subjects. An increasing empha\u00ad sis on functional integration of course material reveals the need for in\u00ad structors each of whom can administer the entire course. Method studies in general education courses have been limited,, Pre\u00ad vious research in general education has sought, to determine the effective\u00ad ness of the entire program as a teaching method without necessarily reveal\u00ad ing the identity, contribution, or relative method-value of the individual courses. In many of the general education programs the course material is basic and required for subsequent work in certain fields. It is necessary in such instances to determine to what extent certain basic information is learned and how it can be learned best, 6. A New Approach to the Problem of Instruction The problem of instruction is now conceived to be concerned with how to guide, direct, and evaluate the experiences of the learner who is in the process of attaining socially approved behavior patterns. It becomes the duty of the school to appraise the needs of society and to define the kinds of behavior required of the learner for effective living. The school also has the duty to select the curriculum content and the activities designed to give such experiences required for the attainment of the desired stand- 1 ards of behavior. The instructional and activity programs organized to encourage maximum interaction of students with \"them will result in the formation of new be\u00ad havior patterns which must be evaluated in terms of the original objectives \"'\"Nelson B. Henry, Editor, 0\u00a3. Cit., pp. 1-11. 7 and repatterred if the results are undesirable,, It may be generally stated that the methods employed in the process of education should con\u00ad sist of those procedures by -which learning is most wisely guided or di\u00ad rected. A first consideration in initiating an attack on the instructional problem should be to review educational principles pertaining to the nature of objectives, the organization of content and activities, the guidance of learning experiences, and the evaluation of the educational product. This investigator is primarily concerned with the principles related to the guid\u00ad ance of the learning experiences as they can be derived from the study of how individuals learn. 7. A Local Problem in General Education The general education approach emphasizes flexibility in the classroom in order to include student participation in preparing and presenting to his class the subject-matter content. In this way, the students determine to a large measure what should be learned and how. It is theorized that through this experience of active participation the students, in addition to mastering the subject matter, will show evidence of behavioral changes including those involving personal and social adjustments based on indi\u00ad vidual needs. Many educators seem to doubt the extent of subject-matter competency acquired by students who are subjected to this approach. It is not. surprising that educators who have observed the lack of control of subject matter shown fcy students who had no investment in the procedure should anticipate an even smaller effort on the part of the learner who was not coerced. Without the experience of how students learn under their own direction, these educators have nothing with which to understand the freer way. 8 Tbs course which the author has used for his research is a course in the Bio-Social Development of the Individual. This is a course in the general education program of Alabama State College. It has been developed as a basic course for several subsequent courses. The entire staff is con\u00ad cerned -with the degree of control of the students in the general education courses. This gereral ooncern made such a study as 'this one seem extremely recessary, Since competency can be judged only in terms of what the stu\u00ad dent can do with what he knows, the participation approach appeared to be an appropriate one to vise. It was the author's assumption that the con\u00ad trol of subject matter would be increased rather than decreased under this plan. It is this hypothesis on which the study is based. B. Statement of the Problem 1. Definition of the Problem The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether or not those students who are given an opportunity to help plan the content and proce\u00ad dure for a freshman course in the general education program at Alabama State College\u2014The Bio-Social Development of the Individual--differ in cer\u00ad tain achievements and outcomes from those students for whom the course con\u00ad tent and procedure are prescribed. The study will seek to determine tte existence of a relationship between the pattern of instruction and the achievement of the students in this basic college course far freshmen. This study will tiy to discover whether there are significant differences in the outcome with respect to student participation between students whose class meetings are designed by Pattern A, by Pattern B, or by Pattern C. The general problem is to search for a relationship between the method of teaching and the student's achievement, and to determine to what extent, if arjy, a student's participation influences his achievement. The question Q / is: Do those students who are permitted to participate in the production, preparation,, and presentation of course material for class discussion differ in selected measurable achievements from those who do not so parti\u00ad al pate? 2. Basic Theory ana Hypothesis a. Theory: Student class-participation is positively related to subject-matter mastery. The more students participate in class the more knowledge and understanding they will have of the subject-matter content. b. Hypothesis: Students who participate more in class will give evidence of more knowledge and understanding of the course content by scoring significantly higher on the: (1) Inventory Test I administered near the beginning of the fall quarter and again near the end of the spring quar\u00ad ter i (2) Inventory Test II administered near the beginning of the fall quarter and again near the end of the spring quar\u00ad ter j (3) Fall Quarter Final Examination administered at the end of the fall quarter and. again at the end of the spring quarterj (U) Winter Quarter Final Examination administered at the eni of the winter quarter aid again at the end of the spring quarter; (5) Biology Test administered at the end of the spring quar\u00ad ter; (6) Psychology Test administered at the end of the spring quarter; (7) Interpretation Test administered at the end of the spring quarter j (8) Misconception Test administered at the end of the spring quarter. (f) Spring Quarter Final E-jcniiilnation administered at the end of the spring quirter. 10 3\u00bb Limitations There will be no attempt in this study to measure changes in social behavior. There are studies, however, that have been designed to measure suoh changes, examples of vhich are reviewed in Chapter II, CHAPTER II REVIEW OF RELATED STIDIfcS A. The General Trend in Method Studies Research in college teaching relating to instructional procedures has been in process since 192 0, within which time productions of experimental studies and questionnaire investigations have been carried on. Many of the investigators have been teachers in the areas of psychology, education, and science, and generally the studies have developed directly from class\u00ad room problems. It is observed that these earlier studies primarily empha\u00ad sized subject-matter mas tery - A summary of the results of a survey ty Cole in 1937 based on ten selected studies states: In so far as mere mastery of elementary subject matter is concerned the lecture method is as good as any other. The re\u00ad sults are sometimss almost identical for lectures and discussion groups, sometimes slightly in favor of the discussion classes, and often appreciably in favor of the lecture classes# Studies completed more recently have differed considerably in proce\u00ad dure due to the utilization of non-directive technique and group dynamics. These recent studies show an appreciable trend in comparing personality changes attributed to the differences in teaching methods. The trend in method research tends in a direction awsy from subject-matter mastery and toward behavioral changes as a measure of educational outcomes. B. Method Studies Involving Psychology Classes xLuella Cole, The Background for College aid Rhine hart, 19U0, pp. 32U-325. Teaching, New York; Farrar 11 12 1 1. A Three -Method Study by McKeachie Three methods of teaching a general psychology class were studied in. which 66x students were included* The large lecture sections met once a week and the smaller (30 to 35) quiz sections, twice a week. The three methods used were discussion, study-tutorial, and recitation. In the dis\u00ad cussion method, the instructor served as chairman, summariser, stimulator, and informant. The study-tutorial msthod allowed the instructor 'to give individual help to those who requested it. In the recitation method, the instructor summarized the lecture and allowed a question-answer exchange between himself and the students. The performance of the students on the final examination was significantly better for the recitation sections when compared with the study-tutorial sections at the five percent level. There were no significant, differences between the performance of students in the recitation and discussion sections, or discussion and study\u2014tutorial sections. The students at the ena of the semester ranked the recitation method highest of the three methods according to preference; however, each stu\u00ad dent only experienced one of the three methods. The validity of their re\u00ad sponses could only be judged by asking how well an individual can be ex\u00ad pected to compare an experienced method with a described one. The three methods employed in this study were designed to reveal sig\u00ad nificant differences involving anxiety in the classroom, student preferences for various teaching methods, and. subject-matter mastery. 2 2. A Two-Method Study by Smith and Johnson J. McKeachie, \"Anxiety in the College Classroom,\" Journal 1951* Vol, 1*5 3 pp. 153-160. O H. C. Smith and D, M, Johnson, \"An Experimental Evaluation of Educa\u00ad tion of Democratic Leadership in the Classroom,\" Psychological Monographs, 1953. 3J The two uEthods of teaching a general psychology course used in this study were the democratic and the lecture-discussion. In the democratic method, the teacher included in the course only such content material as was necessary to meet the needs expressed by the group. The teacher could only give assistance in e^ressing and clarifying needs, and evaluating ideas. He was not in any way to limit the areas for discussion. The teacher was helpful in giving needed information related to the discussion, summarizing and adding to the discussion, and becoming more of a member and less of a leader. The lecture-discussion method provided control classes in which the teacher did most of the talking. The decisions as to the num\u00ad ber and kinds of tests as well as the order of topics were made tgr the democratic groups and imposed upon the lecture-discussion group. This group was allowed, according to its interest, to supplement prescribed material and to discuss any of it. Sixty-two students were used for the two methods, and the two groups were matched in accordance with their re\u00ad sults on a democratic attitude test and a pre-test of psychological infor\u00ad mation. The results of this stuc^r dii not show a difference between 'the two methods when tested by these four hypotheses* yet, there was a difference in the results between ,the two instructors: a\u00ab Students like democratic classes better than traditional classes. b. Students accept decisions that they have made more readily than those made and imposed upon them by an instructor. c. The development of democratic attitudes is greater in a democratic class than in a traditional class, d. Students learn mare in a democratic class. It was found that students who scored higher on the pre-test of course 31* content also showed greater gain in democratic attitudes,, Those students scoring lowor on pre-test of course content shewed greater gain in sub\u00ad ject matter mastery. No relationship was found between gain in subject- matter mastery and the amount of participation in class discussion, atti- tixie toward the class, and initial democratic-attitude scorc. 1 3. A Two-Method Study by Asch Four classes in general psychology; composed of male veterans with a ire an age of 21 who had completed one semester of general psychology, were tised in this study to test the effectiveness of non-directive teaching. The same textbooks were used for all fo\\ir classes. The 23 students composing the experimental class were assigned spe\u00ad cific chapters to read in the texts and to write a weekly paper relating their reactions to their reading in general for the course. They were informed that there would be no examination or grade given on this reading. No examination of any kind was given during the semester, cxcept the final examination which was necessary for research purposes and did not. affect their semester grade. In fact, the semester grade was determined prior to tlie final examination, and the students involved were so informed. The students asked about the necessity of studying for the final examination at which the instructor assured them that they were privileged to do as they wish. The 101 students in the three control classes were given the same assigned reading as the experimental class but were subjected to three examinations and a final on the reading, and were required to write a term paper. \"*\"M. J. Asch, \"Wondirective Teaching in Psychology; Vol, 65, No. ij. 'T-vhole No. 321). 15 The experimental class was told that the instructor would assign grades based on individual conferences which permitted each student to propose and defend his own grade* The students in the experimental class were free to discuss any subject that claimed their attention during the class period, and the instructor served merely to clarify, summarize, or objectify student remarks. The instructor assured them that at no time would he give opinionated information. The circular arrangement in the classroom included the students and. the instructor. The four classes were matched for aptitude and for scholastic achieve\u00ad ment. The American Council on Education Psychological Examination and the Ohio State Scholastic Aptitude Test were used to measure aptitude, and the grade-point average was used to indicate scholastic achievement. The final examination was composed of an objective section and an essay. The objective part included true-false and multiple-choice items, while the essay involved illustrative definitions of four concepts. The experimental group showed significant inferiority to the control groups on both the objective and on the esssy parts of the final exami\u00ad nation at the one-tenth percent and the five percent levels respectively. However, the proportion of experimental students reporting that the course was helpful in learning the subject matter was significantly greater at the one percent level. Evidently, the subject-matter masteiy referred to here does not include the content of the finaL examination.. The number of students reporting that the course helped them to know themselves better was significantly greater for the e:xperimental groups. The difference in motivation for the final examination between the experimental and control groups was not considered in the finding. The control students knew early in the semester that a final examination would 16 be required and that their performance on it would influence the course grade. The experimental students were not informed until one week before the time of the examination and were told that it would not be used in determining the course grade* It was observed that the individual evaluation of the course by the students suggests that non-directive teaching encourages greater outside reading, stimulates thinking about basic conceptual material, and makes for more independent decisions based on the knowledge of many individuals 1 rather than on authority only. The Minnesota Multiphasic Per s ona3.it y Inventory was administered at the beginning and again at the end of the semester to assess the emotional outcomes of the discussion procedures. It was found that seventy-three percent of the experimental students showed improved adjustment while only twenty-three percent of the control students showed similar improvement, significant at the one percent level of confidence. One is led to believe that the results may well be due largely to the relief of anxiety over grades by the experimental students. Changes in social attitudes were assessed by the use of an adaptation of the Bogardus Social Distance Scale with which an effort was made to measure tolerance at the beginning and. at the end of the semester. The increase in tolerance was not significantly different for the experimental and control groups. It was concluded, however, that the non-directive learning experience has definite potentialities for improving social atti\u00ad tudes, far exceeding a more formal and intellectualized classroom situation. The findings may be summarized thus: The discussion class proved inferior on the final examination *\"Ibd-d., p. 32 17 which they had not anticipated talcing and to which presumably they did not assign much importance. However, certain other intellectual values associated primarily with independent thinking were achieved try the non-directive method. Signifi\u00ad cant emotional values were achieved \"by the discussion method and possibly certain subtle social values as well. A related study reports that a non-directive class shewed a reduction in the students' feelings of self-consciousness and shyness and an increase 2 in their willingness to face up to their problems. They were relieved of their guilty feelings over se:-: and were stimulated to gain parental inde\u00ad pendence. Students who preferred the non-directive method read on their om forty-five percent more in the assigned text than those expressing a preference for a combination of non-directive and directive methods, and two hundred and twenty percent more than those preferring the directive method far the first three-week period. It was shown that haxf of those preferring the directive method had done no outside reading at the end of the three-week periodj none had read more than one book. Those students preferring the non-directive method were found to have read at least one item, and forty percent had read more than one. It was found that those students who preferred the directive method were poorly adjusted to the classroom situation and reported more adjust\u00ad ment problems than those students who preferred the non-directive method. HOTever, differences in age, sex, and degree of emotional and social maturi'ty were not considered in this study. %arry Ruja, \"Experimenting with Discussion in College Teaching: A Survey of Recent Research,\" Educational Administration and Supervision, Vol. 39, Oct., 19i>3j Num. 6, p0 327.

Two ins true tor-directed discussion sessions per week were provided for the students in group 2, in which the instructor posed the problems, asked the questions, answered his own questions if no answers were forthcoming from the class, and answered any questions any student felt called upon to ask. The two methods were alternated for the students in group 3. Two lectures per week were attended by all students of the three groups. Three objective examinations were administered during \"the semester. It was shown that the performance of students in the student-centered sec\u00ad tion was significantly better than that of the instructor-centered section at the five percent level of significance based on the results of the three examinations combined. A greater number of students said that they enjoyed the student-cen\u00ad tered discussion sessions, receiving from them greater social and emotional values. They also expressed a feeling of inferiority in subject-matter mastery which, however, was not substantiated ty objective results. 2 5. A Two-Method Study ty Husband A two-year period furnished an opportunity to study two teaching methods selected on the basis of class size in a regular psychology course. \"*\"V.

Husband, \"A Statistical Comparison of the Efficacy of Large Lecture Versus Smaller Recitation Sections upon Achievement in General Psychology,\" Journal of Psychology, 1951* Vol. 31, pp. 297-300. 19 The large classes had. a mean of about 200, and the smaller classes, a mean of about 50. The twelve classes, six of each, contained about 1700 stu\u00ad dents. All twelve classes were given the same assignments and examinations. The lecture method was used almost exclusively in the larger classes while the discussion method was primarily used in the smaller classes. The difference between the two methods was not significant; yet, the lecture classes performed at a slight higher level for five quarters and tied the sixth and final quarter. The difference, however, was accounted far by the careful preparation of the lectures and \"the inspiration gained ty lecturing to a large class. 6. A Two-Method Study by Bovard The performance of a group-centered class was compared with a leader- centered class in elementaiy psychology. Each class was composed of roughly twenty-five students who were matched in intelligence ty the Otis test, grade-point average, college status, proportion of veterans, and distribution of sexes. Both classes had the same instructor and were given the same assignments and examinations. The proportions of lectures, dis\u00ad cussions, and psychodrama were approximately equal for both classes. The variable was the amount of interaction taking place among the students in each class. Interaction was encouraged in the group-centered class. The instructor arranged the seats in a circular fashion which allowed students to answer questions easily and provided opportunities far class decisions involving administrative problems, such as the time of examination, the length of the lectures, and role of the teacher. The instructor was as\u00ad signed the role of instigator and resource person by the group, ^\"E. W. Bovard, Jr., \"The Psychology of Classroom Interaction,\" Journal Si. Educational Research, 1951, Vol, I45, pp. 215-22U. 20 Interaction was restricted in the leader-centered class to the tea\u00ad cher-student. The group was not given the opportunity to make final deci\u00ad sions. The teacher assigned himself the role of group leader. It was noted by an observer that the differentiation set up by the eroeriiTBnter was a practical realization. He found that the proportions of remarks directed to group members other than the teacher were .61 and ,10 respectively in the group-centered and leader-centered classes, a difference significant at better than the one percent level of confidence. The group-centered class showed social and emotional gains. Its mem\u00ad bers exhibited less restraint and more wholesome fellowship. They initi\u00ad ated the organization of a number of social functions, and manifested more favorable feelings toward one anothsr and toward the class. They showed a greater variation among them than was found among members of the leaaer- 1 centered class. A typescript of a transcribed class discussion was evaluated by two clinical psychologists for each class. Both classes viewed the Him, The Feeling of Rejection, and each member developed an answer to the question, \"What made the girl what she was?\" The psychologists made these statements This group (leader-centered) is insecure, aggressive, and formalistic, Little insight is shown by (most) members into the -underlying dynamics. This group (group-centered) is sensitive to expression of feelings, types of mechanism used to deal with conflicts and the varied and interrelated aspects of behavior of the 'heroine* . . the marked degree of interaction and spontaneity of the group . . . less frightened by the film and could take it more seri\u00ad ously and. less defensively than the other. \"Ss.

Bovard, Jr., \"Clinical Insight as a Function of Group Process,\" Journal of Abnormal, and.

The most distinguishing feature was enbodied in the extensive use of the 'buzz' session. The larger groups viere broken down into smaller ones for the purpose of ener\u00ad getic discussion of an issue during a short period, allowing greater par\u00ad ticipation in discussion than in the usual discussion method. No formal lectures on course content were given to the experimental sections, of approximately eighty students, during the school year. In\u00ad stead, the instructor, whose role was constantly diminishing in the acti\u00ad vities of the group, including the making of decisions, \"gave training in role playing, group goal setting, problem centering, distributive leader\u00ad ship, evolution of individual performance by intra-group ratings, process observing group selection, evaluation, and revision of class activities.\" The groups were kept informed of the results of ratings and class evalu\u00ad ation. The control class was composed of another section of the course matched roughly with the experimental section as to sex, age, college major, and expectation as to teaching method, and was selected at random from ten of the sections taught by the traditional lecture-discussion method. ^Lorraine M. Gibb, and J. R. Gibb, \"The Effects of the Use of 'Parti\u00ad cipative Action' Groups in a chologist, VoI\u00ab 7j p\u00bb 2U7 (Abstract). 22 It was found that the gains made by the experimental group \"were significant (P not given) in \"role flexibility, self-insight, leadership arxl likability ratings and group membership skill.\" It was also found that these gains caused no apparent loss of subject-matter mastery as measured by the traditional objective and essay examinations. C. Met!iod Study Involving Psychology and Philosophy Classes 8. A Two-Method Study by Ruja1 The tvo irethods, discussion and lecture, were studied \"with two classes in philosophy and two in general psychology for two semesters, alternating the method each semester in such way that both methods would be represented. The examinations and assignments were identical for both classes of each course. Comparability of the groups was established on scholastic apti\u00ad tude, reactions to the instructor, and emotional adjustment. The scho\u00ad lastic aptitude was kspt constant by an analysis of covariance. A stan\u00ad dardized rating scale with known reliability ana validity was used to determine the reactions of students to instructor, .The names-known tech\u00ad nique involved listing the names of fellow students each student knew at the end of the semester, indicating those known before entering this class. The Bell Adjustment Inventory was administered both at the beginning and at the end of each of the two semesters to measure the changes in emotional adjustment. It was found that the difference between the two methods was not sig\u00ad nificant. However, when the performance levels of the two groups were compared, it was shown that the scores made by the psychology-discussion students were slightly lower than the scores made by the psychology-lecture * 1 H\u00bb Ruja, Outcomes of Lecture and Discussion Procedures in College Teaching, Unpublished M.A. Thesis, San Diego State College, 1952. 23 students on subject-matter content. The Bell Adjustment Inventory showed that the difference between the two groups in adjustment gains was not significantj although, the gains made by the lecture sections were slightly higher than the gains made by the discussion sections in psychology. There was no significant difference between the two psychology groups in rating the instructor, but the philosophy-discussion sections rated the instructor slightly more favorable than the lecture sections. The dis\u00ad cus si.on groups showed a greater acquaintance with members of the class than the lecture groups by rating higher on the names-known technique. It was found that the psychology-lecture method was superior at the one percent level to the psychology-discussion method for teaching course content, but there was no difference between the philosophy-discussion methods. However, differences in age, sex, and subject-matter were not allowed for in this study. This finding was significant at the one percent level and was based on the performance of the students on the course exami\u00ad nations for a lecture class composed of students significantly older and longer in college at the one-tenth percent level and a greater proportion of men at the two percent level than the corresponding discussion class. D. Method Study Involving Social Relations 9. A Two-Method Study by Wispe1 Eight sections of approximately twenty students each of an elementary class in Social Relations served to demonstrate directive and permissive methods of teaching. All eight sections were taught by graduate students, using the directive method with four aid the permissive method with the remaining four. A three-week trial period was provided for the teachers \"hj. G. Wispe \"Evaluating Section Teaching Methods in the Introduc\u00ad tory Course, \" Journal of Educational Research, 1951* Vol. 1*5, pp. 161-186. 2U as a means of determining their natural preference prior to their assign\u00ad ment, during which time they received some specialised training. One meet\u00ad ing per week was scheduled for each class for a semester. The students in each section were matched with the students in each of the other sections on the basis of a pre-test of the subject matter to be taught in the course, scholastic aptitude (measure used not specified)} college status, the pro\u00ad portion of graduates of private preparatory schools, and. size. The directive method was defined as highly structured and subject- imtter centered. The permissive method was defined operationally: the instructor does not define the problem to be discussed, asks open-ended questions, is informal in his manner, commends students frequently, and invites them to report personal experiences; the students volunteer infor\u00ad mation, laugh a great deal, and participate extensively in the discussion. An observer for each of the types of classes described the activities as an instrument for scoring interaction by which the significance of differ\u00ad ences between the two methods can be determined. A projective test was administered to all eight sections at the end of the semester. A questionnaire was also administered designed to obtain from the students their attitudes toward college in general, teachers, students, ana the specific c\u00b1ass9 The final examination, partly objective, was the same for all students. The directive method was found to be favored as indicated by the re\u00ad actions of students. Twenty-five percent of the entire group equally distributed between the two methods expressed satisfaction with the method experienced. Twenty-five percent, of which two-thirds were exposed to the directive method, preferred to have experienced, more permissiveness. They expressed a feeling of tenseness, of not being free to recite, and. of 25 hostility toward the instructor. The one-third who -were in permissive sections expressed a feeling of relaxation and of being free to recite, directing their hostility toward non-personal objects, Blfty percent of entire group preferred more direction, of which two- thirds were in permissive sections who reported that they felt relaxed and free to recite, -while the remaining one-third did not, and expressed hos\u00ad tility toward the class, the instructor, and themselves, and showed per\u00ad ceptual rigidity. It was sho>m that the majority of the students preferred the directive sections significant at the five pcrcent level. Since these sections were well-structured, the class activities helped in preparing for the exami\u00ad nations, yet the permissive sections were enjoyed more. It was concluded that when a high degree of stress is placed on passing the final examination designed to measure subject-matter mastery, the permissive type of instruction is net likely to succeed. If, however, trie total development of the individual instead of the mere subject-matter mastery is the educational objective, then permissive teaching will achieve better results. 1 10. A One-Method Study by Berrien and his Associates The case-method of teaching, dealing with a new kind of course in human relations, has been studied. A series of true lengthy cases which, exhibited problems in human relations composed the textbook for this course. The cases were factually reported, allowing the students opportunities for making inferences. The description of each case may run to six or ten single-spaced pages. 4?1, K. Berrien, \"Attempts to Measure Attitudinal Change as a Conse\u00ad quence of Permissive Discussion,\" American Psychologist, 1950, Vol. pp\u00ab 2I46-2I4.7 (Abstract). 26 The procedure followed in the classroom permitted the student dis\u00ad cussion to be guided but not directed by the instructor. The instructor could reflect and restate student comments but could not judge their validity. Reading assignments and short lectures were given to acquaint students with basic principles underlying human relations involving spe\u00ad cific cases. Each student wrote a paper giving interpretations of cases on which the;, were graded. The evaluation of the papers involved the amount of factual support of their interpretations and the internal consistency of their reasoning. Cases that had been read but not previously discussed were analyzed for the final examination, which were evaluated the same as other cases interpreted. The control groups followed a pattern which did not permit student discussion of the cases but emphasized the instructor-centered procedure# The gains exhibited by the experimental groups over the control groups have not been consistent in critical thinking as measured by the T\\7atson-liia53r test, or in the aspects of personality adjustment as measured by the Rosensweig P - F Test (2). B. Summary The ten studies reviewed in this chapter demonstrate to a large extent the research in the area of college teaching. Some of these studies convey an impression of being more carefully controlled than others, and thus mani\u00ad fest the enthusiasm, zeal, and skill of the investigators. Represented also are those numbered among the diffused and undisciplined whose procedures were inadequately defined and comparisons ambiguously expressed. The ques\u00ad tionable research procedures were largely derived from the implied non- importance of differences in subject matter, instructors, students, and 27 social climate involving the method of study, Recognition of the many vaiiabies in this complex area is necessary in order to define, isolate, and control them. Generally, it is observed that most studies of methods are limited to short-term results of isolated patterns which could be extended to include long-run effects leading to continued studies of com\u00ad bination patterns. It is difficult to compare and pool the results of these studies due to the lack of consensus in procedures and in patterns being contrasted. There is indicated, however, the complexity of the research including the magnitude of the work necessary to identify the most effective procedures in college teaching. It can be generally concluded that the teaching methods allowing greater student participation in the classroom are usually shown to be equivalent or superior in effectiveness to those in which stu\u00ad dent participation is limited. CHAPTER III DESIGN OF THE STUDY A. Introduction This study, as stated in Chapter I, was designed to compare the re\u00ad sults of a classroom method which involves extensive participation of students in guiding their own learning with the results of alternative irethods which involve lesser degrees of participation of students in plan\u00ad ning and carrying on their own learning activities. The specific question to which an answer was sought may be stated as follows: What are the differences, if any, between the achievements on specified tests of se\u00ad lected groups of students in a given course where each group has been taught try a different method? B. General Plan 1. Introduction Since three methods were to be compared, three groups of freshman students were selected, one group for each of the three patterns of in\u00ad struction. The classroom procedures to be used were to represent three distinct patterns of instruction which might be described in terms of three points on a continuum: a largely prescriptive method toward one end, a largely flexible method toward the other end, and a third method holding a position toward the center where prescription and flexibility are more nearly equal. 2. Selecting Groups \u2014 Comparability All freshman students (15 sections) were grouped into classes of 28 29 30 - 35 \"based on their selections of majors or minors as previously indi\u00ad cated following a week of course orientation. The several biology instruc\u00ad tors were rotated among these groups during course orientation in order to equalize the opportunity for all the students (approximately 500) to have similar initial experience prior to selection of the three experi- irental groups. The procedure of rotating the instructors was designed to minimize the variability of experience in the course-orientation process. Since the students' selection of majors and/or minors determined their assignments to sections, it could not be assumed that the groups would be comparable in intelligence and other relevant factors. Thus, during the orientation week certain basic data were obtained on all freshmen by the use of standardized tests (Reading, English Usage, Intelligence, Perso\u00ad nality Adjustment). The results on the reading test were used to select as experimental groups those three sections whose mean score were equal or most neariy equal. 'Within the first three weeks of the fall quarter additional data were obtained on the experimental students by the use of other standard\u00ad ized tests, High School Essentials, Vocational Interest, Course Inventory Tests, and other devices such as the autobiography. Scores on all these initial tests were to be used to determine the degree of comparability of the three experimental groups. These scores were also to be used to determine the degree to which the three experimental groups taken together were representative of the entire freshman class. 3. Selecting and Constructing Instruments for Measuring Achievement The achievement of students in this course was to be determined by the manifestation of their increased knowledge and understanding of the course content as evidenced by the results on certain tests administered 30 periodically during the three quarters. Since achievement tests appro\u00ad priate for this course were not available commercially except in the sepa\u00ad rate subject-matter areas, it was necessary to construct some tests locally. These tests were designed primarily to measure the students' knowledge and understanding by recall and recognition of basic facts and principles in\u00ad cluded in the course content. 1 a. Course Examinations Academic achievement in this course was judged primarily on the basis of scores on the three objective final examinations. The first examination was given at the end of the fall quarter., the second at the end of the winter quarter, and the third at the end of the spring quarter. The fall and winter quarterly final examinations were also administered a second time at the ercl of the spring quarter. Coverage in these examinations was retroactive in that each of the three tests sampled all of the material covered up to that time in the course. All tests consisted of multiple- choice questions of the best-answer type. As will be explained in Chapter IV, the staff is composed of several members, each representing a specific area of contribution. The quarterly final examinations are compiled of test-items submitted by the individual staff members covering specific subject-matter content. The investigator alone was responsible for preparing the test-items for the fall and winter final examinations administered to the three experimental groups. For the spring final all staff members as usual submitted questions covering their respective areas of specialization. These questions were then revised by a staff committee. The test was administered to all sections of the \"*\"SG6 Appendix A. 31 freshman class, including the three experimental groups. 1 b. Test on Misconceptions One of the objectives of the course is to promote modification of the students' eveiyday thinking about matters related to the course material. Wten this is accomplished, a given misconception about human behavior should be corrected or eliminated in the student's thinking even if this specific misconception has not been discussed. Hence, a test was selected to measure the students ' knowledge and understanding of the scientific ap\u00ad proach and ability to use it in evaluating the validity of commonly ac\u00ad cepted statements. This test, composed of a list of fallacies, and desig\u00ad nated by a code name to conceal its nature, vras administered at the end of the spring quarter. 2 c. Test on Interpretation Freshman students in general-edu.cation science are not expected to bring to it a wide range of scientific knowledge. Most of them will not go into advanced work in scientilic fields and will therefore lose contact with science beyond their individual experiences involving science in (1) meeting certain situations in daily living, and (2) reading accounts of scientific developments in popular periodicals (newspapers and magazines). It seemed feasible, therefore, to determine to what extent the methods differed in developing the students' ability to read, interpret, and eval\u00ad uate popular accounts of scientific developments. This reasoning was based on a concept that the ability of students to make practical appli\u00ad cation of science knowledge and to understand the scientific approach and procedure can be evaluated tjy their measured reactions to science materials ^See Appendix A. p See Appendix A, 32 written in popular periodicals. A suitable excerpt was selected from which test items were prepared designed to compare the methods in develop\u00ad ing students' attitudes: (1) to apply scientific knowledge, skills and principles; (2) to read and evaluate scientific developments; and (3) to understand the scientific approach. 1 d. Biology Test Since this course gives nine quarter-hours of credit for biology, it seemed advisable to determine to what extent the methods varied in pre\u00ad paring students for advanced work in the field of biology. A standardized test (Cooperative Biology Test) was used for this purpose. This test is designed to measure knowledge, understanding, interpretation, and appli\u00ad cation of biological facts and principles contained in a general course in biology. It is to be emphasized that all freshmen at Alabama State College take this integrated course. Some of these students will later major in biology or related fields,, It is important that the course provide an adequate background of biological information for these students. The work should, therefore, include the equivalent of a year of general biology 2 e. Psychology Tesfc This course includes material designed to parallel the introductory psychology course generally offered to freshman students. Since the psy\u00ad chology included in this cotirse is basic information and is a prerequisite for further study in the field, it is fitting that the methods be compared in preparing students to do advanced study in psychology. The examination prepared for this purpose included certain facts and principles covering *\"See Appendix B. ^See Appendix A. 33 human behavior0 1 f. Inventory Tests (I and II) Course Inventory Tests, described in Chapter IV, were administered at the beginning of the school year and again near -the end of the spring quar\u00ad ter to determine variation among the three groups in knowledge gains. H. Planning Procedures for Statistical Analysis of Data Measures of central tendency and certain other statistics were to be used to compare the three groups, and the t-test was to be used to deter\u00ad mine significance of differences among the three groups on the criterion measures. C. Description of the Population As stated earlier, all freshman at Alabama State College were assigned to designated sections of the Bio-Social Development of the Individual, a three quarter course continuing through the entire school year of 19Sh~i?S* The sample of three sections of students used in this study was drawn from a population consisting of all beginning freshmen at Alabama State College in the fall quarter of 195k* The experimental groups were composed of the students in these three selected sections. Students remained members of the designated sections to which they were assigned throughout the three consecutive quarters and completed the course at the end of the spring quarter of 19$$. D. Description of the Three Methods It is to be emphasized that the degree of student participation in class constituted the main variable for this study. The methods were designed to hold reasonably constant among the three groups certain ^See Appendix A. 3U related, factors such as instructor, general subject-matter content, and evaluative procedures. The same instructor met each of the three sections on the same scheduled pattern and was equally available for office con\u00ad ferences. A conscious attempt was made by the instructor to manifest equal interest and enthusiasm for each of the three methods. The same textbooks were available and the same course-related films were viewed each week in a designated film period by all three groups. The same major projects were developed, and an individual folder was kept by the instruc\u00ad tor of work completed by each student in the three groups. The same final examinations were administered by the instructor to all students of the \"three groups at the same examination periods. No reliable methods were available for establishing comparability of students in the different groups with respect to such important factors as motivation, purpose, and interest in the field of study. Uncontrolled factors such as these were assumed to be distributed at random among the three experimental, groups. 1. Class-Recitation Method (Pattern A) This method prescribed a detailed outline of major and minor topics in sequence with references including all supplementary reading material which allowed minimum flexibility in content and procedure. The ba3ic subject matter composing the course material used in this method had been previously produced and presented fcy the individual consultation students and discussed by the group-discussion students. This course material included the minor topics in sequence, with references and supplementary- reading material. This method was instructor-centered. Each meeting the instructor presented a short lecture and \"then proceded with a recitation- drill period on the fundamentals. Quizzes were frequently given from a 35 list of questions prepared by students in other sections of the course and revised by the instructor. The instructor called upon students to answer these questions and graded them accordingly. In summary, the assignment-study-recitation-drill procedure was used. 2. Group-Discussion Method (Pattern B) This method prescribed an outline in sequence on major and minor topics and suggested the content for discussion including references and supplementary reading material. The group-discussion section was conducted on the basis of the assumption that merely telling the student or even having him read about a topic is not sufficient* This method emphasized the concept that students must formulate and discovef relationships them\u00ad selves. Instead of drilling on fundamentals, this method was designed to eicourage students to clear-up their misconceptions through group dis\u00ad cussions and to integrate the concepts of the course ty applying these concepts to problems of everyday living. The instructor continuously sought to create and to maintain an atmos\u00ad phere in which the students would feel free to expose their misconceptions and in turn correct them. The students were encouraged to report any diffi\u00ad culties developing from the assignments. They were also encouraged to use the basic concepts of the course in making interpretations of incidents occurring in their daily living. There was an attempt to establish a need to work together which provided an opportunity for the students to learn from one another as well as from the instructor. This method also provided an opportunity for students to develop a feeling that a working knowledge and understanding of the course content are experienced through the actual participation in group discussions, 3. Individual-Consultation Method (Pattern C) 36 This method prescribed an outline in sequence of major topics only, allowing flexibility in minor topics, content, procedure, and supplementary material. This method emphasized an individualized approach with the stu\u00ad dent, placing his own work within the framework of the course. The class work was relatively undirected as compared with the class-recitation method. The instructor did not conduct the class formally, but was available to the students for consultation throughout the class periods. The students, indi\u00ad vidually and occasionally in small groups, utilized the class periods for consultation. The instructor endeavored to help the student to find the answers to his questions rather than answering them himself. Collaboration between students during class periods was discouraged. According to the previous descriptions it is observed that the three types of teaching techniques employed represented different degrees of directed work versus non-directed work, and group work versus individual work. The three patterns representing the three points on a scale or continuum which extends from a highly structured course to a relatively unstructured course present the problem to identify the point that tends to allow maximum learning. CHAPTER IV OUTLINE OF CURRICULAR PROGRAM AMD DESCRIPTION OF TtRKHJ GROUPS OF STUDENTS INVOLVED IN STUD! A. General Education Program The first two years at Alabama State College emphasise a broad pat\u00ad tern of general education courses designed for students to learn more about themselves as individuals and the world-society in which they live. The freshman year centers attention upon problems in the development of the individual, while the sophomore year centers attention upon problems and resources of state, region, and nation. The general education program includes: (l) general education core courses; (2) service-skill courses; and (3) elective, special interest courses. The major effort is made to organize the instructional program around major areas of living. The student is glided in developing sound scholarship and a cultural back\u00ad ground necessary to meet the problems in the major areas ox living. Those areas which present problems of immediate concern to the student are to be emphasised in the first year. These are individual and social development, home and family life, recreational and creative development. While all phases of the first year's work are planned to help the student solve his problems on a sound basis, the two courses designed specifically for this purpose aret (1) Bio-Social Development and (2) the Arts. This integrated-core-general-education approach on the junior college level came about as a result of an intensive study conducted by the Alabama State Department of Education, beginning in 1939-UO* All of the state 37 38 teachers colleges participated in this study. It was at this time that a core-program for the elementary and secondary schools in Alabama was initiated. This college, then a teachers college, concurrently with the other teachers colleges of the state has developed a program extending the core-program into the college years. B. The Framework of Course This freshman course, The Bio-Social Development of the Individual (Science 131-2-3), as operated at Alabama State College is an integration of biology, sociology, psychology, and health, and extends through all three quarters of the school year. Each freshman student is assigned to a section according to his interest as manifested in his choice of a free elective in a desired area of concentration. Each regular section thus formed is composed of a group of students (30 - 35) who have initially cho\u00ad sen the same major area of study, thus giving an opportunity for all of its members to share similar experiences throughout the freshman year. A staff composed of a representative from each of the four subject- matter areas mentioned above and from the audio-visual field is assigned to work with designated sections, the biology representative serving as chairman. Each chairman has the guidance responsibility for each student in the sections assigned and is available to each of these sections four of the eight hours a week. The remaining four hours allow one hour each for the other staff members to be available to each section assigned per week, meeting in groups of two sections for one-hour periods. The sche\u00ad dule provides for eight hours a week including a two-hour laboratory, two one-hour conferences, two one-hour discussions, one one-hour integration period. This course, one of three integrated courses required of freshman 39 students, is designed to motivate through a study of the human organism, deriving and solving problems selected from actual life activities as experienced by the students. Each student is expected to acquire the usual amount of biology, sociology, psychology, and health generally re\u00ad quired in the freshman year by studying himself as a biological, socio\u00ad logical, and psychological being, and. the degree of efficiency involving the combined operation of these three factors determines his health# A major purpose of this course is to foster insight into the relationships of subject-matter areas and their combined importance in understanding more clearly the human being as an organism and his relations to all living organisms and to the universe of which he is a part. The student learns that the human organism operates as a whole. The subject-matter needed must be selected from a number of different disciplines to cover adequately the organization, maintenance, perpetuation, and behavior of the individual, all of \"which concurrently interact in producing and interpreting human life experiences. C. Admission and Placement Test Results The first week of the fall quarter is designated as Freshman Orienta\u00ad tion Week during which time the beginning freshmen are allowed an oppor\u00ad tunity to become acquainted with the campus facilities, staff, and with fellow-students. This period allots specific time to administer certain standardized tests, the results of which are used to some extent in making section assignments. These tests administered under the supervision of the college testing director include reading, English usage, intellectual aptitude, personality and social adjustment, and general achievement. 1. The Iowa Silent Reading Tests administered to beginning freshmen during tho opening week of school as a part of the admission and placement Uo processes. This battery of tests is designed to measure rate and speed of comprehension, directed reading, word meaning, paragraph comprehension, sentence meaning, location of information, including alphabetizing, and use of index. Table I shows the distribution of total scores on this test made by each of the three experimental groups, A, B, and C. This table also shows the scores made by a random sample of 281; students selected from the entire freshman class ( approximately 500 students). It will be observed that the mean scores for the three experimental groups are, respectively, 152.5, 165.3, and 165#5* The mean for the large sample (28)4 students) from the entire population is 163.3. The three experimental groups combined have a mean score of 161^.6 which is 1.3 points higher than the population sample. Median scores for each of the groups, as shown in Table I, are slightly lower than the means. The three experimental groups have medians of 160.8, 162.5, and 163.9, respectively. The median for the combined experimental groups is 162.5 as compared with 162.6 for the population sample. As would be expected the standard deviation of scores for the popu\u00ad lation cample (28U cases) is soirewhat larger than standard deviations of scores for the smaller experimental groups. For the larger sample this is 17.1 and for the experimental groups, 15.2, 1U.9, and 15o9 respectively. Table I thus shows that the three experimental groups do not differ markedly from each other or from the larger population sample with respect to per\u00ad formance on the reading test. 2.

Other Characteristics of Experimental Groups Data to be presented in the remainder of this chapter deal with (a) age and sex distributions, (b) accreditation status of high schooia from which the students were graduated, and (c) classification of students with respect to plc.ce of residence. 7. Table VII shows the age distribution by groups and by sex within each group. The median age for Group A was 18.5- with veterans included and 18,3 without veterans. The median age for Group 3 was 18.1 without veterans, since there were no veterans in Group B. The median age for Group C was 18.3 with veterans and 18,2 without veterans* The median age for the experimental groups combined was 18,3 with veterans included and 18.2 without veterans. Group A shows a male median age of 21.5 with veterans included and 18.1? without veterans, and a female median age of 18.1, Group B shows a male median age of 18.3 and a female median age of 18.1. Group C shows a male median age of 19.0 with veterans included and of l8.\u00a3 without veterans. 8. Table VIII presents information concerning the accreditation status of high schools from which members of each of the three experimental groups were graduated. The data show that a substantial majority of the students came from accredited high schools, and there were some members in each group from non-accredited schools. Group G had a somewhat smaller proportion of students from schools accredited by the Southern Association and by the State Department than did Group A and. Group B.

Table II summarizes certain information about the place of resi\u00ad dence of students in each of the three groups. It will be seen that during the academic year 31 out of the total of 71 students were \"day students\" residing in the city of Montgomery (about two-thirds of these lived at home and one-third roomed in the city). Thirty-five out of the 71 lived in the dormitory and five commuted daily from outside the city. The lower part of Table IX shows that UU students (about 62 percent) came from urban homes and 27 (about 38 per cent) from rural homes. A substantial majority of students in groups A and G were from urban homes while Group B had the same number from urban and rural homes respectively. F. Summary The general education program emphasizes the development of ability to apply knowledge in solving problems of daily living. This general education course is required for freshmen who are grouped by sections according to their indicated majors. Each section is met on a weekly scheduled pattern ty staff members responsible for the different subject matter areas of the course. Certain initial tests are administered during orientation week, the results of which may be used to modity section assignments. The three experimental groups composing the experimental sample were initially selected on the basis of results on the reading test. The experimental sample was shown to be closely comparable to the population sample with respect to performance on the reading test. The three experi\u00ad mental groups were shown to be comparable, in general, although Group C & TABLE DC CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS WITH liESPECT TO (a) PLACE OF RESIDENCE DURIMO- ACADEMIC YEAR AND (b) URBAN OH RURAL HOMHi BACKGROUND Residence Nuufcer of Students Group A Group B Group C Total City 9 m 8 31 Academic Year Dormi\u00ad tory 9 13 13 35 Com\u00ad mute 1 3 1 r* O Total 19 30 22 71 (71) Home Urban Rural 12 7 15 13 17 5 kh 27 19 30 22 71 showed a slight superiority over the othar two groups on the aptitude tests and on the high school content battery. CHARTER V FINDINGS A. Introduction As stated in Chapter III, the general plan of this study included the giving of certain tests to three experimental groups of students at the beginning of a designated period of instruction and at the end of the period of instruction. Certain other tests were administered only at the end of the period of instruction. This chapter presents results of these tests and aralyses of differences among the groups in average achievement. In the presentation of results the tests are divided into two groups. The lirst group is composed of tests administered twice\u2014once near the beginning and again near the end of designated periods. The second group is composed of tests administered near the end of the course orUy. The four tests administered twice were the Inventory Tests I and II, and the fall quarter and the winter quarter- final examinations. The five tests administered only once were the biology, psychology, interpretation, and misconception tests, and the spring quarter final examination. B. Summaries of Results of Tests Administered Twice Inventory Test I and Inventory Test II were administered near the beginning of the fall quarter in September, 195h and again near the end of the spring quarter in May, 1955. The two tests were administered a week apart both times. The fall quarter final examination was administered near the end of the fall quarter in November, 195h and again near the end of the 56 57 spring quarter. The winter quarter final examination was administered near ihe end of the winter quarter in February, 1955 and again near the end of the spring quarter. Tables X through XII and XIV show the differ- oices between initial test and final test means and the significance of diffsraices between mean gains for the three experimental groups on each of the four tests. Table XIII also shows an analysis of covariance of the initial and final scores on the fall quarter final examination for the three experimental groups. 1. Inventory Test I, Table X shows the mean scores for the first and second administration of this test for each of the three experomental groups. This table also gives the mean gains for each group.

Further application of the t-test was made to determine the significance of differences between each of the three pairs of mean gains (A and B, A and C, B and C). None of these differences was found to be significant at the five percent level. It is also noted in Table X that Group B showed the highest mean for both the initial and the final test and the lowest mean gain of the three groups. Group A shewed the lowest mean for both the initial and final test. Group C which was about midway between the other groups on both the initial and final tests had the highest mean gain. 2* Inventory Test II. Table XI shows the mean scores for the Urst and second administrations of this test for each of the three experimental groups? and the mean gains for each group.

None of the gains proved to be significant at the five percent level mean of 1)1.7 and a final test mean of UU\u00ab8, giving a mean gain of 3\u00ab1. Group B had an initial test mean of and a final test mean of 59 giving a mean gain of 1.9. Group C had an initial test mean of 1+J4.7 and a final test mean Hi>.3> giving a mean gain of 0.6. It is observed that the gain made try each of the groups was not significant at the five percent level. Group A showed the greatest gain. For this group the gain was significant at the 10 percent level but not at the five percent level. Groups B and C showed somewhat smaller gains and neither was significant at the ten percent level. The largest difference in gains was found be\u00ad tween groups A and C, while the differences between groiips A and B, and groups B and C were smaller. Application of the t-test to determine the significance of these differences among the three groups with respect to mean gains showed that none of the differences was significant at the five percent level. It may be stated that the three groups do not differ significantly in subject-matter mastery of course content as evidenced by the results on Inventory Tests I and II. However, there is shown a lower performance level held consistently by Group A, 3. Fall Quarter Final Examination. Table XII shows the mean scores far the first and second administrations of this test for each of the three experimental groups.

Group B had an initial test mean of 138.3 and a final test mean of llt6.3j giving a mean gain of 8.0. Group C had an initial test mean of 137.7 and a final test mean of 1^6.U, giving a mean gain of 8.7. It is observed that the gain made by Group A was significant at the five percent level. The gain made by Group B was significant at the one-tenth percent level, and the gain made by- Group C was significant at the one percent level. Application of the t- test to determine the significance of these differences among the three groups with respect to mean gains showed that none of the differences was significant at the five percent ijsvel. It will be seen that Group A which made the highest gain had lower scores on both the initial and final tests than either of the other two groups. A more rigorous analysis of scores on the first and second administra\u00ad tions of the fall quarter final examinations was made by performing an analy\u00ad sis of ccrvariance. This is a more precise method of testing for signifi\u00ad cance of differences between gains since the statistical procedures include \"correcting\" or \"adjusting\" for initial differences among the groups with respect to performance on the test. Results of the covariance analysis are shown in Table XIII. It will be seen here that the F ratio was not statistically significant. It is evident there that the three groups did not differ significantly in mean gains. On the basis of the evidence presented thus far showing performances of the three groups of students on three different tests, each of which was given twice, it would appear that merely increasing student participation in the classroom did not result in a corresponding increase in knowledge and in understanding of facts included in the course.

Table XIV also shows that in the case of each group the difference betvreen initial and final test means was statistically significant. No adequate explanation can be offered for this apparent inconsistency with the results on the two inventory tests and the fall quarter examination described earlier in this chapter. It may be that the nature of the subject matter included in the winter quarter final exami\u00ad nation was such that the \"rate of forgetting\" was disproportionately high. This is not offered, however, as a highly plausible explanation. In making inter-group comparisons with respect to differences between initial and final mean scores it was found that the difference in \"loss11 between Group A and Group C was significant at the five percent level. In summary, results on the four tests that were administered twice 63 show that for Group A the means on both initial and final tests were some\u00ad what lower than the means for the other two groups. Analyses of gains (or losses) showed that in general there were no significant differences among the three groups. The one exception to this was the cane of a statistically significant difference between losses shown for Groups A and C on the winter quarter final examination. C. Analyses of Results of Test3 Administered Once The biology test, psychology test, interpretation test, misconception test, and the spring quarter final examination were administered near the aid of the spring quarter only. Tables IV through XXI show the results of these tests. Table XXI the last of the tables of test results shows the means and the standard deviations of scores for each of the experimental groups, for the experimental groups combined, and for the larger popula\u00ad tion sample on the spring qua rter final examination. 5.

Since an analysis of variance was perfomed on the results for this test (see Table XX), the chief reason for presenting the data in Table XIX. is to make possible direct comparisons of mean scores for the three groups. Although the differences between pairs of groups range from 0.2 up to 9\u00ab6 score points, none was significant at the five percent level. This finding was, of course, confirmed \"try the analysis of variance results shown in TabJe XX. It will be observed in Table XX that although the \"between groups\" variance is somewhat larger than the \"within groups\" variance, the F ratio is not significant at the five percent level.

It will be seen that the test mean for the popu\u00ad lation sanple was 132.7, and for the experimental groups combined was lLtl.9. The difference between the group means for the combined experimental groups (11+L.9) and the large population sample (132.7) was 9.2. This difference was statistically significant at the one percent level. The mean for each of the three experimental groups was higher than the popu\u00ad lation sample mean. However, only in the case of Group P yas this differ\u00ad ence statistically significant (five percent level or beycrci)* As pointed out in connection with Tables XIX and XX, none of the dif\u00ad ferences between the respective pairs of means for the three experimental groups (A arxi B, B and C, C and A) was statistically significant. D. Summary Results of the nine tests as presented in this chapter show that 68 Group A (maximum student participation) achieved at a slightly higher level, in general, than the other too groups. The differences in achieve\u00ad ment were not statistically significant. It is possible that certain learnings, not measured \"by the tests, may have been achieved more effec\u00ad tively by one method than by another. As far as knowledge of subject matter is concerned no one of the three methods was found to be distinctly superior to the other two. CHAPTER VI SUlMAftl AND CONCLUSIONS A. Summary 1. Introduction and Purpose This investigation grew out of a continuing study of a general-edu\u00ad cation course in science for college freshmen that has been under way for several years. The central purpose of the investigation was to determine whether teaching methods i-iiich include a high degree of student partici\u00ad pation in planning and evaluating learning activities in this course pro\u00ad duce more or less mastery of subject matter than methods which include relatively little student participation in planning and evaluation* To state the question more precisely: do students who have a large share in planning and directing their own learning activities make higher or lower scores on subject matter tests than students who have relatively little share in planning for their own learning in the classroom? 2. Plan of the Study The general plan and design of the study consisted of (a) the develop ment of three different \"methods\" of instruction\u2014one representing a high degree of student participation, another representing a moderate degree of student participation, and the third representing relatively little stu\u00ad dent participation; (b) the selection of three groups of beginning fresh- :aan3 each to be taught by one of the three methods for a school year (three quarters); (c) the selection and construction of tests to be used 69 70 as measures of achievement of each of the three experimental groups of studentsj (d) the application of appropriate statistical procedures for evaluating observed differences among the three groups of students in their achievement on designated tests. The study was conducted during the three quarters of the school year 195b~b$* In September 195U, the three experimental groups were selected, the selection being based on performance on the Iowa Reading Test. Com\u00ad parability of the three groups was further established by additional data obtained from other tests. The three groups according to these measures were shown to be comparable to each other and were representative of the entire freshman class. The author of this report was assigned to teach all three experi\u00ad mental sections. The three groups were designated as class-recitation (Group A), group-discussion (Group B), and individual,-consultation (Group C). In teaching these three classes, a minimum amount of student parti\u00ad cipation was used with Group A and a maximum of student participation with Group G. Various tests designed to measure subject-matter mastery fcy recogni\u00ad tion ana recall were selected or constructed and administered at desig\u00ad nated intervals* Some of these tests were administered twice with a period of instruction intervening between the first and second testing. Other tests administered only at the end of the course including the Spring Quarter Final Examination. 3. Findings It seems appropriate to preface the summaiy of findings by a re\u00ad statement of certain limitations in purpose and design of the study. For example, the investigation did not include systematic evaluation of such 71 goals as ability to perceive and. to fomulate a problem, initiative and independence in using sources of information, growing curiosity about the field of study, etc. The evaluative measures used were confined, in the main, to recognition and recall of verbal statements of factual informa\u00ad tion and verbal statements of principles. Interpretations and conclusions based on the findings must therefore be confined to these limited aspects of purposes of the course in Bio-Social Development. All three experimental groups acquired a substantial amount of infor\u00ad mation in the respective fields of study represented in the course. The test results presented in Chapter V show that Group C (maximum student participation) achieved, in general, at a slightly higher level than the other two groups. The differences, however, were not statistically signi\u00ad ficant. The general pattern of test scores shows also that Group A (mini- ivium student participation) achieved at a somewhat lower level than Group B or Group C. This relatively lower level of performance for Group A (which was not statistically significant) might be accounted for by the fact that this group made somewhat lower scores ori the general aptitude tests than did the other groups. In any event, the evidence does not indicate that any one of the three groups learned significantly more than another as far as knowledge of subject matter in the course is concerned. A more detailed summary is presented below showing initially stated hypotheses and parallel findings. Hypothesis: Students who participate more in class will give evi\u00ad dence of more knowledge and understanding of the course content by scoring significantly higher on the: (1) Inventory Test I administered near -the beginning of the fall quar\u00ad ter and again near the end of the spring quarter. 72 (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant.) (2) Inventory Test II administered near the beginning of the fall quarter and again near the end of the spring quarter (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant,) (3) Fall Quarter Final Examination administered at the end of the fall quarter and again at the end of the spring quarter (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant.) (U) Winter Quarter Final Examination administered at the end of the winter quarter and again at the end of the spring quarter (Finding: One of the possible comparisons showed a statistically significant difference in favor of \"student participation.\") (5) Biology Test administered at the end of the spring quarter (Findii^: Differences were not statistically significant,) (6) Psychology Test administered at the end of the spring quarter (Findijqg: Differences were not statistically significant.) (7) Interpretation Test administered at the end of the spring quarter (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant.) (8) Misconception Test administered at the end of the spring quarter (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant.) (9) Spring quarter final examination administered at the end of the spring quarter (Finding: Differences were not statistically significant.) B. Conclusions The central hypothesis in this study was found to be false\u2014namely, the hypothesis that extensive student participation would be accompanied by distinctly superior achievement in \"subject matter,\" as compared with achievement of students who participated relatively little in planning and evaluating their own work. Had the hypothesis been stated the other way around\u2014for example, \"The lecture-assignment-recitation method will result 73 in more subject matter learning than the student participation method,\" this} too, was found to \"be false. Although the experimental group employing maximum student participa\u00ad tion made slightly higher scores than the other groups on most of the tests, these differences, in most instances, did not even approach the level of statistical significance* The three methods seemed to produce approximately equal results in: 1. developing a knowledge and understanding of course content over the period of the entire course, 2. developing a knowledge and understanding of course content over quarterly divisions of the course, 3. developing a knowledge and understanding of course content as a background of basic information for advanced study in related subject fields, il, developing ability to understand and interpret scientific infor\u00ad mation written in popular periodicals, f>. developing an ability to apply the scientific approach in judging statements commonly accepted as facts. It would appear, therefore, that when the goal of instruction is sharply limited to subject matter content, alone, there is no reason to choose any one of the three methods over the other two. The instructor (author of this report) who taught all three experi\u00ad mental classes gained certain impressions concerning other types of out\u00ad comes not evaluated in this investigation. Direct observation of the students over a period of one academic year led to these tentative con\u00ad clusions : 1. The consultation group (Group C) ranked highest of the three groups in developing self-reliance\u2014individual thinking and acting. The recitation group (Group A) ranked lowest in this quality, while the discussion group (Group B) ranked in be\u00ad tween the consultation group and the recitation group. 2. The discussion group ranked highest of the three groups in developing ability to work together in problem-solving. 7U 3. The recitation group showed more of a tendency than the other groups to accept as \"authoritative\" any information given them. These tentative conclusions would perhaps be more appropriately designated as \"reasonable hypothesis\" and should be subjected to more rigorous study. C. Recommendations Concerning Course in Bio-Social Development The results of this study have shown that provision for extensive student participation in the selection and development of areas of work undertaken in the course yields a level of \"subject matter\" achievement at least equal to the level achieved by the other methods used. Respon\u00ad sible student participation appears to encourage and to make possible important types of learning in addition to knowledge of the subject. With these reasons in mind certain recommendations are made here relating to future development of this course. The general plan of the course should provide for; 1. Maximum student participation including major responsibility for the topical selections, sequential development, group discussion, and class presentation of the basic course material 2. One instructor to teach all subject areas of the course for the sections assigned to him 3\u00ab An integrated text with work book containing material based on actual problems of daily living lu Students to survey the scope of course material early in the school year in order to develop individual plans for periodic evaluation based on accomplishment 5. Student-evaluation of class contributions by fellow-students 6. A browsing room in which samples of completed projects and other reference materials may be filed for observation 7. Initial data on each student to include a course inventory test and a general achievement test 8. Standardization of several forms of a course examination composed of three major parts corresponding to the three quarterly exami\u00ad nations 75 9. Common major projects to be completed quarterly by all sections 10, A defined procedure for evaluating student progress and for assigning final quarterly grades As these .recommendations are put into effect, they should, of course, be subjected to continuous appraisal by the staff responsible for teaching the course, and by the students who take it.

Ths year 19i\u00bb0 is the hundredth anniversary of the landing of English sparrows in the United States. Thoy are really neither sparrows nor English. They are weavers, originally from Africa, that have attached themselves, like the dog, bedbug, and rat, to the fortunes of man. They colonized Europe long ago, swarming in its cities paved with nutritious refuse. In 18^0, they reached Brooklyn. Brooklyn in those days was plagued with insects. The native birds did not like city life. As U. S. cities expanded, the birds retired to rural refuges, leaving the shade trees and flower gardens defenseless against in\u00ad sect pests.. Finally the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences sent to England for an urban bird\u2014the English sparrow. The birds found the ciiy a sparrow's paradise. The streets were strewn with refuse of the horse and buggy age, and under each bright street light there was a collection of dead insects. The sparrows soon overflowed Brook\u00ad lyn. Riding in empty grain cars along new-built railways, they pioneered the West. By 1886, they had occupied all of the U. S\u00ab Soon tliere were cries of anguish from bird lovers. The violent, aggres\u00ad sive English sparrows were too successful. Wherever the sparrow came, blue birds and wens got out, Audubon Society members reported native birds being m3 lUU Interpretation Test Sc. 133, S. Q. 19i?5 pursued, insulted and pecked by sparrows. Said Biologist Ned Dearborn of the U. S. Biological Survey, \"The English sparrow among birds, like the rat among mammals, is cunning, destructive, and filthy.\" But by the 1920's the sparrow hosts were declining. Their downfall was not the Audubon Society, but the automobile. As horses grew scarcer, spar\u00ad rows grew scarcer, too. Now they survive in cities mostly on the leavings of pigeons. In some smaller U. S. cities sparrows are still plentiful. There they have solved their food problem by a kind of inverse commuting. True to their urban traditions, they build their nests in town. In the mornings they fly out to the country to forage in the graiufields and barnyards. Then they come back, full fed, for the brawling social life in town. (Quoted from Time Magazine, Yol.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRESS 1 The policy of the government in a democracy is decided in the long run by public opinion. 2 The government some\u00ad times takes a position that is unpopular, but it must justify its course in order to hold the support of the majority of the people. 3 If the party in power fails to do this, it will eventually be voted out of office and a party more to the liking of the majority will be set up in its place. 4 The people are the masters, and the greatest problem that con\u00ad fronts the United States is that of making the people fit to exercise their sovereignty. 6 One of the most important instruments in the formation and expression of public opinion is the printing press. 0 The freedom of the press from interference by the government has been guaranteed in the provisions of the first ten Amendments. 7 It must be admitted, however, that the people, during both the Civil War and the World War, consented to governmental interference with the press in the form of an extensive censorship of the news. 8 At such' times the pressure of military necessity creates a situa\u00ad tion which would not be tolerated in times of peace. 9 The press itself recognizes that when the very existence of the nation is at stake, it must refrain from publishing informa\u00ad tion that will aid the enemy or weaken the people's morale. 10 Undoubtedly the most influential division of the press is the newspaper. 11 The large daily newspaper has cor\u00ad respondents in every part of the world, who telegraph daily accounts of events in their respective territories. 12 Local reporters are also assigned to keep in touch with the many activities of the city, and to write accounts of events that are of interest to the local readers of the paper. 13 In addi\u00ad tion to the daily news, many newspapers, especially in their elaborate Sunday editions, conduct departments intended to promote general culture by reviewing new books, scientific discoveries, plays at the local theaters, musical attractions, art exhibits, and many other similar features. H The public is entitled to an account of the events of the world, uncolored by editorial opinion. 16 Too often the news reports are tinged with propaganda either by the insertion of editorial comment in the text of the story or by mislead\u00ad ing headlines designed to guide the judgment of the reader. 10 Newspapers with the best of intentions find it impossible always to keep the reporter's natural bias out of his stories. 17 The editorial columns are the legitimate place for the expression of opinion about the news of the day. 18 To express opinion, to interpret the news by intelligent com\u00ad ment, is the business of the editor. 10 News columns are read to discover the facts and consequently should be unbiased. 20 Editorial columns should be read in much the same way that one might discuss the news with an intelli\u00ad gent neighbor, to test one's opinions and perhaps to modify them, if strong arguments for contrary views are presented. 21 The editorial page should be approached in a critical frame of mind, in which the reader expects to find, not bare facts, but the interpretation of these facts by an individual who is often biased in his judgment. 22 The business interests of large advertisers often influence the policy of the newspaper. 23 The largest part of the cost of publishing a newspaper is paid by businessmen and corporations using its advertising columns to display their wares. \"l The people who subscribe for the paper pay a very small percentage of the total cost. 25 It is not surprising, then, that some newspapers treat large business interests with more than benevolent neutrality. 20 It is, of course, contrary to public interest to have the organs of public opinion controlled by business interests; for business corporations, like individuals, are likely to take a biased view of questions which might concern their profits.

GLASS 1 Glass is made by melting sand with lime, potash, soda, or oxide of lead at a great heat. 2 Silica, which is the basis of sand, enters into all varieties of glass. 3 It has more to do with determining the quality than any of the other ingredients. 4 The purity of the ingredients and the pro\u00ad portion in which they are mixed also have much to do with the quality of the glass. 5 Sand may be said to form the basis of the glass. 0 Con\u00ad sequently the clearness of the glass depends largely upon the quality of this ingredient. 7 The proportion of silica varies in different kinds of glass. 8 In lead glass it is from 42 to GO per cent; plate contains about 79 per cent, and window glass about 70 per cent. 9 The amount of silica usually determines the degree of hardness, though other substances have some effect upon this quality. 10 Lead tends to make glass soft. 11 Sometimes lime is used to make it hard. 12 Nearly all the silica used in the glass factories within the last fifty years is in the form of sand. 13 Prior to that the best qualities of glass were produced by crushing and washing flint and quartz rock. \"This process was so expensive that it made the glass too costly for general use. 15 Bohemian and a few other varieties of European glass are still made from silica obtained in this way. 16 The expense of Bohemian glass in this country restricts it to the homes of wealthy people. 17 In the manufacture of glass of high grade, the quality and purity of sand are of the greatest importance. 18 The most searching examination and careful tests are made to determine the nature and extent of any impurities which the sand may contain. 13 These impurities are commonly oxide of iron (iron rust), alumina in the form of clay, loam, gravel, and decaying animal or vegetable matter. 20 Most of these impurities except iron can be removed by burning and washing. 21 Oxide of iron can be removed only by the use of chemicals. 22 Iron is the most troublesome of all because it discolors the glass and destroys its transparency. 23 For the best qualities of glass it must be entirely free from iron. 24 A proportion greater than one half of one per cent renders the sand worthless for even the poorest quality of glass.

Rubber is one of the important products of the world today. The annual supply is nearly 300,000 tons, two thirds of which is used in the United States, principally for automobile tires. Rubber is also used in making medical supplies, household articles, batteries, toys, and clothing; and recently a rubber bearing has been success\u00ad fully used on parts moving in water. 3. The Mayas were a race of Indians inhabiting the peninsula of Yucatan. They were much more civilized than other tribes of American Indians. When they were first found by the white men, they gave evidence of possess\u00ad ing many skills and abilities which were similar to those displayed by the whites. They constructed houses of faced concrete, four and five stories high. The Mayas were expert potters and have left many beautiful products of their skill. Their history, religion, rites, and magic were recorded in their books in hieroglyphic characters. 4. All animals sleep, but many of them do so in ways so curious that they seem to be awake. Ducks sleep on open water, and to keep from drifting ashore paddle with one foot continually, thus traveling in a circle. Bats sleep head downward, hanging by their hind claws. Many animals of the cat species sleep with wide-open staring eyes. Elephants sleep standing up, their heads slowly swinging as if they were awake. Stories that some animals do not sleep are the result of these and other curious examples. A.

In the more densely populated parts of Asia an unfavorable growing season has for centuries meant famine and death for thousands of persons. The fact that the population of the earth is increasing far more rapidly than the food supply should give us an increased interest in plants, the primary source of all foods. When we realize further that our resources of lumber, fuel, fibers, paper pulp, oils, resin, rubber, and numerous other products come from plants, our absolute dependence on plant life is apparent. 6 A. Choose the best title for the paragraph. A 1 Natural Resources 2 Decreasing Food Supply 3 Importance of Plant Life B. Why is the matter of an adequate food supply such an important economic problem ? 1 increase in popu- B lation exceeds growth in food supply 2 decrease in natural resources 3 wars and famines C.

[ 6 ] Essential High School Content Battery by DAVID P. HARRY, Graduate School, Western Reserve University and WALTER N. DUROST, School of Education, Boston University \u2014 fr DIRECTIONS: Do not open this booklet until you are told to do so. This booklet contains four tests: Test 1, Mathematics; Test 2, Science; Test 3, Social Studies; and Test 4, English. You will have one testing period (45 minutes) for each test except English, for which you will have two periods. You are not expected to be able to answer all the questions in any test. Do not worry if you find a question on something you have not covered in class. Do the best you can, but do not spend too much time on any one question. Work as rapidly and as accurately as you can. When you finish a page, go on to the next page unless the directions at the bottom of the page tell you to stop. Record your answers on the separate answer sheet. Make no marks of any kind on this test booklet. Use scratch paper when necessary for the Mathematics and Science tests. Most of the questions in the Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies tests have five possible answers. (Whenever a different type of question is used, special directions are given within the test.) Read each question and decide which of the possible answers is best. When you are not quite sure what the answer is, make the best choice you can; but do not make wild guesses. Study the sample questions below, and notice how the answers are to be marked on the separate answer sheet. Sample 1 The sum of 10 plus 10 is \u2014 a. 0 b. 15 c. 17 d. 20 e. 100 Sample 2 What is the title of the Chief Executive of the United States? 1. Vice-President 2. Chief Justice 3. Secretary of State 4. President 6. none of the above Sample 3 The electric light was discovered by f. Bell. g. Faraday. h. Marconi. i. Morse. j. none of the above. For Sample 1, the answer, of course, is \"20,\" which is answer d. Now look at your answer sheet. On the right-hand side of the cover page there is a box labeled \"Answer Spaces for Samples.\" In the five answer spaces after Sample 1, a heavy mark has been made filling the space (the pair of dotted lines) marked d. The correct answer for Sample 2 is \"President,\" which is answer 4; so for Sample 2 you would answer by putting a heavy black mark that fills the fourth space, under the number 4. Do this now. Sometimes the correct answer is not shown among the choices. Sample 3 shows you how to mark questions of this kind. For Sample 3, the correct answer is \"Edison.\" Since Edison is not given as one of the responses, you should make a mark in the fifth space, which is marked j, \"none of the above.\" Do this now. In the English test several different types of test questions are used for the different parts of the test. Special directions and samples for these are given at the beginning of each part. Study these directions and samples carefully before you start each part of the test. When you are told to open your booklet, turn to Test 1, Mathematics, and begin. Read each question carefully and decide which one of the answers is best. Notice what number or letter corresponds to your choice. Then, on your separate answer sheet, opposite the question number, make a heavy black mark in the space under that letter or number. Always be sure that the question number in the test booklet and on the answer sheet agree. Erase carefully any answer mark you wish to change. Be careful not to make stray marks of any kind on your answer sheet. Ask no questions after the examination begins.

The first page of this test consists of several paragraphs on an interesting subject which you are to read and study in the same way you would prepare a lesson. You will have 10 minutes in which to do this. Then you will be told to turn the page and answer 15 questions on what you have just read without referring back to the paragraphs. One cannot really imagine what the world is like with\u00ad out seeing it as a sphere. The customary flat maps of our geography books are very misleading in that they create false notions as to the outlines of the land masses of the earth. They also distort the relative positions of specified places with relation to eaeh other. The familiar global map, mounted on a pedestal and revolving freely on its axis, is a great help in correcting our impressions of distances and locations of places. The granddaddy of all such global maps is to be found in the lobby of the New York News Building on 42nd Street in New York City. Here is a globe twenty feet or more in diameter, mounted so that its axis parallels the axis of the earth. It revolves slowly, so that, as one stands at the rail\u00ad ing of the huge pit in which it is situated, one can take a \"trip around the world\" in a few minutes. The bound\u00ad aries of countries are shown and the location of all the principal cities can be seen easily. On the floor of the room, alongside the globe, are arrows pointing in the direc\u00ad tion of the principal cities of the world, with the distances from New York City indicated. However, even the global map does not fully create the correct impression of what the global sphere really is like. To get this impression one must go to Boston and visit the Mapparium in the Christian Science Publishing House just off Huntington Avenue. Nowhere else in the world is there such a room as this. Nearly three stories high, globular, fashioned in. colored glass and brilliantly illuminated from the rear by powerful lights, it is a veri\u00ad table magic world. The feeling of being poised at the very center of the earth is created when one stands inside this great globe on the bridge of glass which leads from side to side, and a mere turn of the head brings into view in its true perspective any place on the earth's surface. To make this globe, 608 separate sections of glass were cast in their proper contours, were painted and fired in pleasing colors, and then were fastened into a bronze web of 10- degree intervals to represent latitude and longitude. Clocks at the equator show the time simultaneously around the world. The name Mapparium comes from the Latin words \"mappa\" meaning map and the suffix \"arium\" meaning a place for. The room was first opened in 1935 and is considered to be one of the finest examples of the func\u00ad tional use of colored glass in the world. Each section of glass is removable, so that political boundary lines can be kept up to date. The Mapparium is not just a novelty. It has real edu\u00ad cational value in that it brings home in an unforgettable manner some of the everyday truths to be found in geography books. Perhaps most important of all is the fresh realization of the importance of air travel in a world made up of island continents. The true relation of these great land masses is vividly shown, as well as their relative size. For example, one cannot help but be impressed by the tremen\u00ad dous share of the earth's surface which comes within the framework of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Also, one is impressed with the nearness 'of some of our neighbors when viewed from the center of the earth, so that transpolar distance's take on their true significance. London and Boston appear much farther north than people expect and many are startled to find that New York City and Madrid are practically on the same parallel. Naples, Istanbul, and Jehol also fall on the same invisible line approximately 40 degrees north of the equator. Labra\u00ad dor, Great Britain, Kamchatka, and British Columbia are all equidistant from the equator. When this informa\u00ad tion is coupled with a knowledge of the substantial differ\u00ad ences in the climate of these places, a fresh realization is gained of the great importance of influences on climate other than just the position of a place with respect to the poles \u2014 such influences as the great ocean currents, for example. This is, indeed, \"one world\" in which we live, as the news of the day so often brings home to us most forcefully. What is more fitting than that these great globes should be made available to the public through the efforts of two outstanding newspapers? STOP! Do not turn the page until you are told to do so.

PART II (20 minutes) Directions: This part consists of diagrams and passages, followed by several items concerning the diagram or passage. For each item, decide on the basis of tlie diagram or passage which one of the choices given below the incomplete state\u00ad ment or question best completes the meaning of the statement or answers the question. Put the number of your choice in the parentheses at the right of eacli item. Items 1 through 6 refer to the passage below. Certain studies of the behavior of animals have shed light on the question of man's nervous reactions. Ex\u00ad periments oil reflex action have been valuable in this connection. When a newborn dog first tastes food, the saliva begins to How. This is a reflex action, caused by the taste of the food. The food is said to be the stimulus which produces the reaction. A reflex action such as this is said to be unconditioned. As the animal grows older, the mere sight or smell of food can cause the saliva of the dog to flow. This is because the animal connects the sight and smell of food with the actual taste of food. Such a flow of saliva when not really caused by food in the mouth of the dog is called a conditioned reflex. Now it has been found that if a bell is rung whenever food is about to be brought to a dog, the dog, after many days, comes to associate the ringing of the bell with the taste of food, and hence the saliva flows even if the bell is rung and food is not brought. This is a kind of artificial con\u00ad ditioned reflex. It is believed that man's actions may be largely a series of conditioned reflexes. However, most of these are so complex that it is difficult to recognize their true nature. 1. The flow of saliva in a newborn dog is brought about by 1-1 the smell of food. 1-2 a conditioned reflex action. 1-3 the sight of food. 1\u20144 the taste of food. 1-5 the ringing of a bell 1 ( ) 2. If a bell were rung in the presence of an un\u00ad trained dog, an observer would probably find that 2-1 a conditioned reflex was produced in the dog. 2-2 the dog's digestive reaction was not noticeably affected. 2-3 the dog's saliva flowed. 2-4 the dog's reflex action was changed. 2-5 the dog sniffed for food 2( ) 3. A conditioned reflex is evidently 3-1 a reflex action where the normal cause is replaced by a substitute. 3-2 the reaction of an animal to the taste of food. 3-3 the reaction of an animal to any noise. 3-4 a reflex action produced when an animal is eating. 3-5 a reflex action which can only be pro\u00ad duced in the laboratory 3( ) 4. The word \"stimulus\" means 4-1 food. 4-2 a digestive juice. 4-3 a reflex response. 4-4 the act of eating. 4-5 that which causes a nervous reaction. 4( ) 5. According to the author of this paragraph, the idea that man's behavior is a series of conditioned reflexes 5-1 is fairly sound. 5-2 is poorly conceived. 5-3 was well known long ago. 5-4 is definitely proved by this study. 5-5 is untenable 5( ) 6. The chief valje of this study is that it 6-1 proves that all animals can be easily trained if the right method is used. 6-2 shows that: dogs can be trained to re\u00ad spond in many ways. 6-3 points out a way of making a dog's saliva flow without giving it food. 6-4 shows that dogs can be trained to come for their food when a bell is rung. 6-5 enables scientists to get a better un\u00ad derstanding of the workings of the brain 6( ) Go on to the next page. - 8 - Items 7 through 11 refer to the passage below. Ever since Pasteur and his contemporaries discovered that certain diseases are caused by bacteria, attempts have been made to find substances which will bring about the destruction of bacteria in the body without harming the patient. Even today exceedingly few such sub\u00ad stances have been found, and among these few penicillin, derived from the fungus PeuicUiium nolalum, occupies a unique position. From the days of Lister, who first successfully used antiseptics in surgical infections, hun\u00ad dreds of different substances have been found capable of killing bacteria. While many of them are suitable for sterilizing surgical instruments and for similar purposes, and some may be applied to local infections, none of them (except the group of sulfonamide drugs) is suitable for dealing with bacterial infections affecting the body as a whole. This is because they are as deadly to the tissues of the patient as to the bacteria. Penicillin stops the growth of bacteria either by killing or by preventing multi\u00ad plication. Thus it checks the spread of the infection and permits the natural resources of the body to overcome it. The unique property of penicillin is that it combines this power to prevent the bacteria from multiplying wiLh almost total lack of toxicity toward most human beings. Its use rarely has to be limited by the fear of giving a dangerous overdose. It is this fact, together with its exceptionally high activity against bacteria, which makes it so valuable. 7. An ideal substance for use in the treatment of bacterial diseases of animals is best de\u00ad scribed as one which 7-1 weakens or destroys bacteria. 7-2 prevents the multiplication of bac\u00ad teria in the body. 7\u20143 destroys bacteria without injury to the patient. 7\u20144 acts as an antiseptic. 7-5 can be supplied in large quantities at low cost 7 ( ) 8. According to this paragraph, penicillin may help a human being to get well by 8-1 making it possible for the body to overcome an infection. 8-2 stimulating tissues. 8-3 causing rapid regeneration of dis\u00ad eased organs. 8-4 supplying substances necessaiy to combat toxins. 8-5 inhibiting the entry of bacteria. . . . 8( ) 10. Penicillin is different from most antiseptic drugs in that it 10-1 can be made very cheaply. 1.0-2 kills bacteria very quickly. 10-3 is not poisonous to the majority of human beings. 10-4 checks the spread of infection. 10-5 prevents the multiplication of bac\u00ad teria 10 ( ) 11. The name penicillin was applied to the drug because of 11-1 the name of the man who discovered it. 11-2 the name of the organism which produces it. 11-3 its chemical composition. 11-4 its action on bacteria. 11-5 the locality in which it was first used. 11( ) A B C The diagram above represents a cross section of the human eye. Items 12 through 14 refer to this diagram. 12. What is the function of the structures shown at A? 12-1 They support the iris. 12-2 They change the shape of the lens. 12-3 They change the size of the pupil. 12-4 They connect the lens with the nerve cell. 12-5 They change the length of the eye\u00ad ball 12 ( ) 13.

The lungs in man are two spongy, elastic structures lying one on each side of the chest, with the heart be\u00ad tween them. Each lung is enclosed in an elastic airtight sac (pleura). The walls of this sac are moistened with fluid, which lessens the friction caused by the lung movements. It is estimated that each lung contains about four hundred million tiny air sacs. Each air sac has many small blood capillaries in its walls. Through the thin Avails of the sacs, oxygen passes into the blood capillaries and carbon dioxide and water vapor pass from the capil\u00ad laries into the sacs. It is estimated that the entire ab\u00ad sorbing space of the lungs equals an area about fifty feet square. We may think of the lungs enclosed in their sacs (the pleurae) as being in a box (the thorax). The sides are formed by the backbone, the breastbone, and the ribs, with the attached muscles. The bottom is formed by the diaphragm. This is a dome-shaped sheet of tissue separating the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. 15. In this passage, the writer's main purpose is to 15-1 show how large the human lungs are. 15-2 explain how the lungs are protected. 15-3 describe the muscular action in\u00ad volved in breathing. 15-4 describe the human lungs. 15-5 explain how the lungs are related to the heart 15( ) 18. It is evident from the passage that the lungs 18-1 are fastened to the heart. 18-2 are particularly adapted for absorp\u00ad tion. 18-3 are filled with fluid to decrease loss of moisture. 18-4 open into the chest cavity. 18-5 have many openings into the other parts of the body 18( ) 16. The passage states that the 16-1 lungs are made up of millions of pleurae. 16-2 lungs contain blood capillaries. 16-3 lower part of the lungs is called the diaphragm. 16-4 lower part of the lungs extends into the abdominal cavity. 16-5 capillaries remove moisture from the lungs 16( ) 19.

The use of fertilizers to increase the productivity of the earth has been known and practiced for centuries. More recently it has been suggested that by applying similar methods to the sea a like increase in its food- producing capacity could be obtained. For the purpose of testing this, an area of about eighteen acres was sealed off from the open sea by a dam and sluice. During the first: year, a total of 600 pounds of sodium nitrate and 400 pounds of superphosphate was lidded to the area at approximately monthly intervals. During the second year, the quantities added Avere doubled. When the water in the enclosed area was compared with that in the adjoining one, which was open to the sea, it was found that the plankton in the enclosed area was considerably richer. Owing to the fertilizers added, it was probably one of the richest: plankton areas in exist\u00ad ence. Similar results were found in the next link in the food chain\u2014the bottom fauna. It was difficult to assess correctly this increase as the small fish population in the area had multiplied, and extensive stocking had taken place. Despite this, calculations made from observations showed that the quantity of fauna \"useful\" as food for fish had increased by over 200 per cent as compared with that of the previous summer. The figures for the increase in the growth rate of the fish were equally impressive. At one period after stock\u00ad ing (partly with marked fish), the fish population in the area was estimated to be 1,000 per acre; but even so the fish thrived. Two main results were obtained: (1) It was found that growth continued during the winter months, although under natural conditions no growth takes place during this period; from this it seems that the cessation of growth in winter is mainly due to the relative scarcity of food. (2) Under the conditions of the experiment the fish in the area completed five or six years' growth in two years. 23. A hormone is secreted by 23-1 B. 23-2 C. 23-3 D. 23-4 E. 23-5 G 23( ) 24.
