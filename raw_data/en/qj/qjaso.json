FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING Upon receipt of a student aid report from accepted student s, the Office of Financial Aid combines aid from available sources to form a financial aid package . Some students will be offered a combination of aid from different sources. Acceptance of the package, or any source of aid, constitutes a student's commitment to maintaining satisfactory academic progress and notifying the Office of Financial Aid and/or lender of any changes in housing, finances, status at the institution, etc. FINANCIAL AID - TRANSFER STUDENTS If the student has financial aid at another institution for the current academic year, the aid may transfer to Mercy College . Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at financialaid@mercycollege.edu for assistance . RETURN OF TITLE IV A ID (R2T4) POLICY How a withdrawal affects financial aid . Federal regulations requi re Title IV financial aid funds to be awarded under the assumption that a student will attend the institution for the entire period in which federal assistance was awarded . When a student withdraws from all courses for any reason, he/she may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that he/she was originally scheduled to receive . The return of funds is based upon the premise that students earn their financial aid in proportion to the amount of time in which they are enrolled . A pro -rated schedule is used to determine the amount of federal student aid funds he/she will have earned at the time of the withdrawal. Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not be requ ired to return any funds. Federal law requires schools to calculate how much federal financial aid a student has earned if that student: Completely withdraws, or Stops attending before completing the semester, or Does not complete all modules /sessions (courses that are not scheduled for the entire semester or payment period for which he/she has registered at the time those modules /sessions began) . Based on this calculation, Mercy College of Ohio students who Enrollment Management 69 receive federal financial aid and do not complet e their classes during a semester or term could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received . Students who enroll in courses and do not attend must repay all financial aid disbursed for the s emester. How a withdrawal affects academics . The following information will help students understand how a withdrawal potentially affects them academically as well as financially . The financial aid staff members encourage students to read all the information below prior to making a final decision. Mercy College of Ohio tuition refund policy is separate from the federal regulations to repay unearned aid . Whether or not a student receives a tuition refund has no bearing on the amount he/she must repay to the federal aid programs . How the e arned financial aid is calculated. Students who receive federal financial aid must \"earn\" the aid they receive by remaining enrolled in classes . The amount of federal financial aid assistance students earn is on a pro -rated basis . Students who withdraw or do not complete all classes for which they are enrolled during a semester may be required to return some of the financial aid awarded . Institutions are required to determine the percentage of Title IV aid \"earned\" by the student and to return the unearn ed portion to the appropriate aid programs . Regulations require schools to perform calculations within 30 days from the date the school determines a student's complete withdrawal . The school must return the funds within 45 days of the determination of a student's withdrawal . For example, if a student completes 30% of the payment period, they earn 30% of the aid they were originally scheduled to receive. This means 70% of the scheduled awards remain \"unearned\" and must be returned to the federal government . Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not be required to return any federal funds . The following formula is used to determine the percentage of unearned aid that has to be r eturned to the federal government: The percent earned is equal to the number of calendar days completed up to the withdrawal date, divided by the total number of calendar days in the payment period (less any scheduled breaks that are at least 5 days long). The payment period is the entire semester . The percent unearned is equal to 100% minus the percent earned. For students enrolled in modules (sessions) . A student is considered withdrawn if the student does not fulfill all the days in the payment period that the student was scheduled to complete . Mercy College of Ohio will track enrollment in each session to determine if a student began enrollment in all scheduled courses . If a student officially drops courses in a later module/ session while still attending a current module/s ession , the student is not considered as withdrawn based on not attending the later module/ session . However, a recalculation of aid based on a change in enrollment status may still be required. Enrollment Management 70 Steps in the Return of Title IV funds policy Mercy College of Ohio will determine: 1. The total amount of Title IV aid disbursed for the semester in which the student withdrew . A student's Title IV aid is counted as aid disbursed in the calculation if it has been applied to the student's a ccount on or before the date the student withdrew. 2. The total amount of Title IV aid disbursed plus the Title IV aid that could have been disbursed for the semester in which the student withdrew. 3. If the calculated percentage of Title IV aid was earned as fo llows: the number of calendar days completed divided by the total number of calendar days in the semester in which the student withdrew . The total number of calendar days in a semester shall exclude any scheduled breaks of more than 5 days . Days Attended \u00f7 Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed 4. If the calculated percentage completed exceeds 60%, then the student has \"earned\" all the Title IV aid for the enrollment period. 5. The calculated amount of Title IV aid is earned as follows: The percentag e of Title IV aid earned (Step 2) multiplied by the total amount of Title IV aid disbursed or that could have been disbursed for the semester in which the student withdrew . Total Aid Disbursed \u00d7 Percentage Completed = Earned Aid 6. The Amount of Title IV aid to be disbursed or returned a. If the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further action is required. b. If the aid already disbursed is greater that the earned aid, the difference must be returned to the appropriate Title IV aid program. c. Total Disbu rsed Aid - Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned d. If the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, then Mercy College of Ohio will calculate a post -withdrawal disbursement. Types of Withdrawals For financial aid purposes, there are two types of withdrawals: Official and Unofficial. Official - An official withdrawal from Mercy College of Ohio by the student . Unofficial - Federal financial aid regulations consider a student to be an unofficial withdrawal if the student receives all \"F\" (failure) grades or a combination of \"F\" and \"W\" (withdraw) grades for the term . Determination of the Withdrawal Date . The withdrawal da te used in the return calculation of a student's federal financial aid is the actual date indicated on the Withdrawal/Leave Form and/or the Drop/ Withdraw al/Leave Form in EMPOWER ME . If a student stops attending classes without notifying Mercy College of O hio, the withdrawal date will be the midpoint of the semester or the last date of academic activity determined by Mercy College of Ohio . Additional documentation supporting the last date of academic activity may be provided by the student if he/she verifies a later date of attendance than determined by Mercy College of Ohio. Withdrawing prior to completing 60% of a term. Unless a student completes 60% of the term in which federal aid was disbursed, the student will be required to return all or part of the financial aid disbursed in the term . This applies to students who have officially or unofficially withdrawn . Enrollment Management 71 When a student fails to begin attendance . If a student receives financial aid, but never attends classes, Mercy College of Ohio will return all disbursed funds to the respective federal aid programs . If the student owes money to Mercy College of Ohio resulting from the return of federal funds, the student will be billed by the Office of the Bursar . If the student does not pay the funds due to Me rcy College of Ohio, a business hold will be placed on the student's account . This means he/she will not be permitted to register for classes or receive transcripts until the balance is paid. Students who do not receive an earned grade in a term . Financi al aid is awarded under the assumption that the student will attend Mercy College of Ohio for the entire term for which federal assistance was disbursed .

Enrollment Management 73 SATISFACTORY ACADEMI C PROGRESS (SAP) POL ICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, June 2018 Mercy College of Ohio has established this policy to determine continued eligibility for student financial aid in accordance with Federal regulations, which require the College to establish and implement a policy to measure if a student is making Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward a degree or certificate. This policy applies to all eligible degree and certificate -seeking students. This policy indicates the standards used to measure SAP at the College for purposes of financial aid eligibility . Funds affected by this policy include all applicable federal, state, and college funds including but not limited to Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loans, Federal Work Study, State Scholarship and Grant programs, all scholarships administered and/or provided by the College. The College evaluates SAP at the end of each semester for all students and measures progress as follows: Qualitative Progress (GPA requirement) Quantitative Progress (Time -based progression requirement, including pace of completion and maximum timeframe) These criteria evaluate the quality and quantity of the academic work a student completes and progress toward completion of his/her academic program. The SAP requirem ents are minimum standards, and each are outlined in more detail below. Students are encouraged to exceed all the requirements whenever possible. REQUIREMENTS FOR SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS Qualitative Progress Requirement Students' cumulative Mercy C ollege of Ohio grade point average (GPA) will be evaluated each semester. For purposes of meeting SAP requirements, undergraduate and certificate students must maintain a GPA of 2.0; graduate students must maintain a GPA of 3.0. Please note individual pro grams may have stricter GPA requirements for the purpose of progression. Quantitative Progress Requirement Pace of completion . To be eligible for financial aid, a student is required to complete a minimum of 67% of cumulative attempted credits. The College calculates the pace at which a student is progressing by dividing the total number of hours the student has successfully comp leted (including transfer credits) by the total number of hours he/she has attempted. Maximum timeframe. Students must progress through their program to ensure graduation will occur within the specified maximum timeframe. The maximum timeframe for which an undergraduate or graduate student may receive financial assistance may not exceed 150% of the published length of the student's academic program measured in credit hours, Enrollment Management 74 whether or not federal aid was received by the student during this time. A student is ineligible for financial aid when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete the program of study within 150% of its published length. o For example, if the published length of an academic program is 120 credit hours, the maximum timeframe d uring which the student will be eligible to receive financial aid must not exceed 180* credit hours. Note: this calculation will include any accepted transfer credit hours and prior learning credits that apply toward the degree. *120 credit hours X 150% = 180 credit hours. Students not meeting one or both of the SAP requirements outlined above at the end of a semester will be notified of such in writing. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements are initially given a Warning period during which time they may continue being awarded aid (if otherwise eligible). This Warning period is for the next semester in which the student enrolls at the College. Students who do not meet the requirements by the end of the Warning period are denied future financial aid. A student may appeal the termination of financial aid due to exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances may include but are not limited to illness, death of an immediate family member, or traumatic events in the stu dent's life. INCOMPLETE (I) GRADE Incomplete grades will be monitored by the Office of Financial Aid, as the final assigned grade can affect GPA and SAP requirements. The Office of Financial Aid follows the guidelines for Incomplete Grades as determined by the Division of Academic Affairs. REPEATED COURSES - QUANTITATIVE Students may receive financial aid when repeating a failed course, and once for retaking a passed course. Any courses that are repeated will be used in determining if a student is meeting SAP requirements. Each repetition will count toward the attempted hours; however, only the first passing grade will be counted as completed hours for SAP purposes. Financial aid will not cover the third or any subsequent attempts of a course. PROGRESSION/REPEATING A COURSE - QUALITATIVE To pro gress successfully through the College, a student must obtain at least a \"C\" grade in all courses taken. A grade of \"D\" is considered unsatisfactory for progression in the College but is recorded on the transcript and calculated as 1.0 for GPA purposes. A student may retake for credit any course in which a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" has been earned. Only the second grade will be computed in the cumulative GPA; however, both grades will appear on the transcript. Although a student may be permitted to repeat a c ourse more than one time, this forgiveness policy does not apply beyond the first repeat attempt for any one course, such that unsatisfactory grades will be used in the calculation of a student's GPA when they occur on a second or subsequent attempt. WITHD RAWAL FROM A COURSE Courses from which a student withdraws are considered in \"hours attempted\" toward the maximum timeframe, including WP (withdraw passing) and WF (withdraw failing) grades, but not as completed hours. Enrollment Management 75 TRANSFER CREDITS Transfer credit hours that have been accepted by the College toward a current degree are subject to the SAP requirements described in this policy. CHANGES IN MAJOR OR DEGREE Students who change their major or degree must submit a plan of study completed by their academic advisor to the Office of Financial Aid. The student is eligible to receive aid for no more than 150% of the credit hours required to complete the new program of study. PURSUIT OF A SECOND DEGREE Students who pursue a second degree from the College must submit a plan of study completed by their academic advisor to the Office of Financial Aid. The student is eligible to receive aid for no more than 150% of the credit hours required to complete the second program of study. Credits earned for a degree already awarded by the College are not included in the 150% calculation for the second degree. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who is academically dismissed pursuant to the College's Academic Dismissal policy will be terminated from financial aid eligibility.

ACCESSIBILITY /ADA/504 POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, June 2019 To provide for equal access, Mercy College of Ohio is committed to making individuals with disabilities full participants in its programs, services and activities through compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. All College representatives, including faculty, staff, and students are responsible for the implementation of this policy and adherence to the principles of equal access. It is the policy of Mercy College of Ohio (the \"College\") that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in any program, service or activity offered by the College. Specifically, the College does not discriminate on the basis of disability in employ ment or in its admission, recruitment, academics, research, financial aid, counseling, employment assistance, and/or any other service, facility, or privilege available to students or potential students. Further, the College does not screen out, exclude, e xpel, limit, or otherwise discriminate against an individual seeking admission as a student, or an individual enrolled as a student, based on disability . As such, individuals with disabilities have a right to request reasonable accommodations. Definitions Disability : The United States' Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines \"disability\" as \"having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.\" In addition, the ADA protects individuals from discr imination if they have a record of such impairments or if they are regarded as having such impairments . Additional protections are provided through Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Reasonable Accommodations : Reasonable accommodations includ e modifications to policy, procedure, or practice and the provision of auxiliary aids and services that are designed to provide equal access to programs and services for qualified individuals with disabilities. Accommodations are reasonable when they do n ot pose a direct threat to health, safety, or quality of care; when they do not fundamentally alter the nature of a program or service; and when they do not represent an undue financial or administrative burden. Student Affairs 89 Requests for Reasonable Accommodation: Emplo yees: Requests for reasonable accommodation are governed by the Mercy Health Accommodations Policy (HRMH081). Employees must direct requests for reasonable accommodation to the Mercy Health Human Resources Department. Students: Requests for reasonable accommodation are handled by the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services pursuant to the Procedures set forth below. Academic Honesty & Integrity Reasonable accommodations provided to students may relate to the administration of testing, examinations, or other coursework . Students provided with such accommodations must continue to adhere to the College's academic honesty & integrity policy and to the College's Student Code of Conduct . Failure to adhere to the academic honesty & integrity policy and th e standards of conduct may result in corrective action. Section 504 Coordinator: The College has designated the following individual as its Section 504 Coordinator. The Section 504 Coordinator has responsibility for coordinating the College's efforts to c omply with the requirements of Section 504 and its implementing regulations. Christine Miller Director of Accessibility and Testing Services 2221 Madison Avenue Toledo, OH 43604 419 -251 -1784 Christine.Miller1@mercycollege.edu Grievance Procedure: Any person may file a grievance alleging discrimination or harassment on the basis of disability by filing a complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights/Nondiscrimination Policy. The grievance process applies to all individuals regardless of whether the individual has requested accommodations. Grievances may allege disability discrimination, including disability harassment, carried out by employees, students, or third parties. A copy of the Civil Rights/N ondiscrimination Policy and its related procedures is available online at https://mercycollege.edu/documents/civil -rights -nondiscrimination -policy . The following procedures govern the reasonable accommodation process for students. Students must provide appropriate documentation to the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services for the College to fully determine eligibility for services and evaluate requests for accommodations or auxiliary aids. Students should be aware that accommodations granted by the College in no way guarantee that the same accommodations will be granted at other institutions, testing centers, or licensing agencies. Students are solely responsible for pursuing accommodations at other institutions, testing centers, or licensing agencies . The Office of Accessibility and Testing Services may assist in the process at the student's request. Student Affairs 90 Initiating Consideration for Accommodation Students who are seeking assistance from the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services are responsible for: a) Contacting the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services. Students bear the responsibility for disclosure of a disability and the request for services. Such disclosure and request for services must be done by the student directly unless the nature of the student's disability precludes direct contact. b) Providing complete, adequate, and current documentation from an appropriately qualified profes sional regarding the disability and the need for accommodations (see Essential Elements of Disability Documentation below.) Students are responsible for costs associated with obtaining the appropriate documentation. c) Notifying the College of accommodation r equests prior to the beginning of the semester for which the accommodation is sought . While accommodation requests can be made and will be considered at any time, the documentation and approval process takes time. Please note that granted accommodations are not effective retroactively, and a student will not be able to retake exams or redo assignments that were completed before an accommodation was approved. Essential Elements of Disability Documentation 1. The credentials of the evaluator(s) . Documentation should be provided by a licensed or otherwise properly credentialed professional who has undergone appropriate and comprehensive training, has relevant experience, and has no personal relationship with the individual being evaluated . A goo d match between the credentials of the individual making the diagnosis and the condition being reported is expected (e.g., an orthopedic limitation might be documented by a physician, but not a licensed psychologist). 2. A diagnostic statement identifying the disability . Documentation should include a clear diagnostic statement that describes how the condition was diagnosed, provide information on the functional impact, and detail the typical progression or prognosis of the condition . When appropriate, docum entation should include diagnostic codes from the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). 3. A description of the diagnostic methodology used. As appropriate, document ation should include a description of the diagnostic criteria, evaluation methods, procedures, tests and dates of administration, as well as a clinical narrative, observation, and specific results . Where appropriate to the nature of the disability, having both summary data and specific test scores (with the norming population identified) within the report is recommended . Diagnostic methods that are congruent with the particular disability and current professional practices in the field are recommended. 4. A description of the current functional limitations . Information on how the disabling condition(s) currently impacts the individual provides useful information for both verifying a disability and identifying possible accommodations. Documentation should be thorough enough to demonstrate whether and how a major life activity is substantially limited by Student Affairs 91 providing a clear sense of the severity, frequency, and pervasiveness of the condition(s) . A combination of the results of formal evaluation procedures, clin ical narrative, and the individual's self -report will be reviewed . While recent documentation is recommended in most circumstances, discretion will be used in accepting older documentation of conditions that are permanent or non -varying . Likewise, changi ng conditions and/or changes in how the condition impacts the individual may warrant more frequent updates to provide an accurate picture. The need for recent documentation depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual's condition. 5. A descriptio n of the expected progression of stability of the disability . Information on the cyclical or episodic nature of the disability and known or suspected environmental triggers to episodes provides opportunities to anticipate and plan for varying functional impacts. If the condition is not stable, information on interventions for exacerbations and recommended timelines for re -evaluation are most helpful. 6. A description of current and past accommodations, services and/or medications . Documentation should include a description of both current and past medications, auxiliary aids, assistive devices, support services, and accommodations, including their effectiveness (and side effects) in ameliorating functional impacts of the disability. 7. Recommendations for accommodations, adaptive devices, assistive services, compensatory strategies, and/or collateral support services . Recommended accommodations and strategies should be logically related to functional limitations; if connections are not obvious, a clear explanation of their relationship can be useful in decision making . Mercy College has no obligation to provide or adopt recommendations made by outside entities. High school special education evaluations, Summary of Performance (SOP) or I ndividual Educational Program (IEP) documentation, while helpful, may not provide adequate information to document a disability . In addition, references to academic weaknesses/learning differences/test anxiety alone may not substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. Specific Disability Documentation Learning Disabilities: Psycho -educational assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional specializing in learning disabilities. Psycho -educational Testing: The comprehensive psycho -educational test battery should include intelligence/ability testing and educational/achievement testing . A full diagnostic report, including all standard test scores as well as subtest scores and the ev aluator's narrative is recommended . Assessments should be normed for adults, i.e. WAIS -III rather than WISC- III. Attention Deficit Disorder: Psychological/Psycho -educational assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or ot her appropriately credentialed professional. Psychological Disabilities: Psychological assessment conducted by the diagnosing licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Student Affairs 92 Speech and Hearing: Full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed speech/hearing specialist, audiologist, or other appropriately credentialed professional. Visual: Full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed ophthalmologist, optometrist, or other approp riately credentialed professional. Mobility: Evidence of substantial limitation in upper and/or lower extremity mobility . As appropriate, this may or may not include full report of assessments conducted by the diagnosing licensed medical doctor/physician or other appropriately credentialed professional. Review of Documentation and the Determination of Accommodation 1. All documentation will be reviewed on an individual, case -by-case basis . This calls for an individualized inquiry, examining the impact of a d isability on the individual and within the specific context of the request for accommodations . There is no list of covered disabilities or accepted diagnostic criteria. 2. Determination of accommodations is an interactive process . The Director of Accessibil ity and Testing Services may contact the evaluator, as necessary and with the student's permission, for clarification of any information (tests results, conclusions, recommendations, etc.) contained in the documentation . An interview with the student will be conducted to inquire about the disability, understand its impacts and identify appropriate accommodations . At the conclusion of the interactive process, the institution will determine accommodations as appropriate. 3. Documentation of a specific disability does not translate directly into specific accommodations . Reasonable accommodations are individually determined and based on the functional impact of the condition and its likely interaction with the environment . As such, accommodations may vary from individual to individual with the \"same\" disability diagnosis and from environment to environment for the same individual. Process of Approved Accommodations Once an accommodation has been granted, students are provided with a letter of accommodation from the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services each semester to notify their instructors as they deem appropriate . Students with accommodations are responsible to speak with each of their instructors about their accommodation needs. Students with accomm odations can submit their testing schedule to the Testing Center at the beginning of each semester if their tests will be proctored in the Testing Center . Students who have received accommodations may request modifications to those accommodations at any t ime. Appeal Procedure A student who has been denied a requested accommodation or otherwise disagrees with an accommodation decision may file an appeal. The student is encouraged, but not required, to first discuss his or her concern with the Vice Presiden t of Student Affairs/Dean of Students. A conversation may resolve a disagreement quickly. Student Affairs 93 The student should complete the Student Appeal and Grievance Form available on the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services website. Individuals needing assista nce may fill out the form in the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services with staff assistance. Appeals should be filed promptly and no later than 10 business days after receiving an accommodation decision. Appeals submitted after this deadline will not be accepted absent a showing of good cause . Time -sensitive requests should be made as far in advance as possible . Although the College tries to expedite urgent matters, requests made fewer than 10 business days in advance of a deadline typically do n ot allow for adequate time for review. Informal Review: Upon receipt of an appeal, the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students will try to resolve the disagreement informally with the student and the Office of Accessibility and Testing Services. If informal resolution is not possible or the student requests to proceed through the formal appeals process, the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students will refer the matter to the Office of Compliance and Risk Management. Formal Appeals Process: The Director of Compliance and Risk Management will review the formal appeal request and determine whether an investigation is necessary. If any material facts are in dispute, an investigation will be initiated within 5 business days of receipt of the appeal request from the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students. The investigation will involve meeting with the student and may also involve meeting with Office of Accessibility and Testing Services staff, faculty members, or other staff m embers with relevant information. During the investigation, all parties to the appeal will be permitted to present witnesses and other relevant evidence. The Director of Compliance and Risk Management will present written findings of fact from the inves tigation to the President, who will decide whether any changes to the original decision are warranted. The President will issue a written determination regarding the appeal to the student and Office of Accessibility and Testing Services. Unless an extension is necessary for good cause, this determination will be provided within 5 business days of receiving the findings from the Director of Compliance and Risk Management. If the President decides that additional or different accommodation(s) should be app roved, an updated accommodation letter will be issued to the student. If the President upholds the initial accommodation determination, the matter will be closed. The President's decision is final and not subject to appeal. Every effort will be made to complete the appeal process within 30 days of the initial request for appeal. The College does not tolerate retaliation against any individual who participates in the appeal process. Allegations of retaliation should be referred to the Director of Complia nce and Risk Management.

Clery Act reporting of offenses for statistical purposes occurs whether victims are minors or adults. Mercy College will notify parents/guardians of minor students/guests/participants of any possible child abuse or neglect, as well as any possible violation of this policy, whether the minor is the Complainant or Respondent. Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator Title IX Coordinator The Title IX C oordinator is responsible for the prompt response to reports of Sexual Harassment, as well as training, education, communication, and administration of grievance procedures for handling formal complaints alleging violations of this policy. In the absence o f the Title IX Coordinator, the Deputy Title IX Coordinator will assume all responsibility for compliance relative to Title IX. Deputy Title IX Coordinator The Deputy Title IX Coordinator is responsible for implementing and monitoring policy compliance at Youngstown.

The Deputy Coordinator is responsibl e for informing the Title IX Coordinator of alleged violations and procedures to address these violations at Youngstown. In the absence of the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at Youngstown, the Title IX Coordinator will assume all responsibility for compliance relative to Title IX. Definitions Complainant An individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment. Consent Consent must be informed, voluntary, and mutual, and can be withdrawn at any time. There is no consent where there is force, expressed or implied, or when coercion, intimidation, threats or duress is used. Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over another person may be a factor in determining consent. Silence or absence of resista nce does not imply ongoing future consent with that person or consent to that same sexual activity with another person. Past consent does not imply future consent. If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent; this includes Student Affairs 96 impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption th at meets this standard or being asleep or unconscious. Dating Violence Dating violence is defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim, and where the existence of suc h a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: The length of the relationship, The type of relationship, and The frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. Domestic Violence Domestic violence is defined as felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Ohio, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts und er the domestic or family violence laws of Ohio. Education Programs and Activities Education Programs and Activities refers to all the operations of the College, including, but not limited to, in -person and online educational instruction, employment, research activities, extracurricular activities, dining services, and community engagement and outreach programs. The term applies to all activity that occurs on campus or on other property owned or occupied by the College. It also includes off -campus locatio ns, events, or circumstances over which the College exercises substantial control over the Respondent and the context in which the Sexual Harassment occurs, including Sexual Harassment occurring in any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the College. Formal Complaint A document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging Sexual Harassment against a Respondent and requesting that the College investigate the allegation of Sexual Har assment in accordance with this policy. At the time of filing a Formal Complaint, a Complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the College's education programs and activities. A \"document filed by a Complainant\" means a document or electronic submission (such as an email) that contains the Complainant's physical or electronic signature or otherwise indicates that the Complainant is the person filing the Complaint. Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment \"Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment\" is unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the College's education programs and activities. This may include conduct of a nonsexual nature that is based on an individual's actual or perceived sex, including conduct based on gender identity, gender expression, and nonconformity with gender stereotypes. Student Affairs 97 Incapacitation Incapacitation is defined as the lack of physical or mental ability t o make informed, rational judgments. Examples of incapacitation include unconsciousness, sleep, and blackouts. Intimidation Unlawful act of intentionally coercing or frightening someone to do (or to not do) something against his or her will. Preponderance of the Evidence To find an individual in violation of sexual misconduct only a preponderance of evidence standard needs to exist. This means it is \"more likely than not\" that the violation occurred and is less strict than \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" . The evidence does not have to be \"clear and convincing\". Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment \"Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment\" occurs when an employee of the College conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the College on an individual's part icipation in unwelcome sexual contact. Respondent An individual who has been alleged to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment. Retaliation Retaliation is intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination against any individ ual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX and its implementing regulations or because an individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this policy. Sexual Assault \"Sexual Assault\" includes the sex offenses of Rape, Sodomy, Sexual Assault with an Object, Fondling, Incest, and Statutory Rape.1 \"Rape\" is the carnal knowledge of a person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. There is \"carnal knowledge\" if there is the slightest penetration of the vagina or penis by the sexual organ of the other person. Attempted Rape is included. 1 The College's definition of \"Sexual Assault\" is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Those regulations require the College to adopt a definition of \"Sexual Assault\" that incorporates various forcible and non -forcibl e sex crimes as defined by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting System. See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.30(a). Student Affairs 98 Sodomy\" is oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable o f giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. \"Sexual Assault with an Object\" is using an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of t he body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.

Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is conduct on the basis of sex that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking. Stalking Stalking is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to: fear for their safety or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress. Supportive Measures Non -disciplinary, non- punitive individualized services offered, as appropriate, and reasonably available, and without fee or charge, that are designed to restore or preserve equal ac cess to the College's Education Programs and Activities without unreasonably burdening another party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties implicated by a report or the College's education environment, or to deter Sexual Harassm ent. Examples of Supportive measures include: counseling, extensions of academic or other deadlines, course -related adjustments, modifications to work or class schedules, campus escort services, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, inc reased security and monitoring of certain areas of campus, and other similar measures. Supportive Measures may also include mutual restrictions on contact between the parties implicated by a report. Remedies Administrators, faculty members, staff, student s, contractors, guests, and other members of the College community who commit Sexual Harassment are subject to the full range of College discipline including verbal warning; written warning; temporary suspension, suspension, dismissal; expulsion for stude nts; written warning; final written warning; termination; performance improvement plan (PIP); or administrative leave for employees; mandatory training, coaching, or Student Affairs 99 counseling; mandatory monitoring; physical restriction from College property; cancellation of contracts; and any combination of the same. The College will provide persons who have experienced Sexual Harassment ongoing remedies as reasonably necessary to restore or preserve access to the College's education programs and activities. Reporting Procedures and Protocol The College's primary concern is the safety of its campus community and members. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for Sexual Harassment. Moreover, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of Sexual Harassment. Although there is no specific time limit for reporting a suspected violation of this policy, a student or employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to conduct that violates this policy is encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator as promptly as possible. Any person may report Sexual Harassment to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Reports may be made in person, by regular mail, telephone, electronic mail, or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person's verbal or written report. In-person reports must be made during normal business hours, but reports can be made by regular mail, telephone, or electronic mail at any time, incl uding outside normal business hours. The names and contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and Deputy Title IX Coordinator are: Title IX Coordinator - Toledo Leslie Erwin Director of Compliance and Risk Management Title IX Coordinator 2221 Madison Avenue Toledo, Ohio 43604 419 -251 -1710 titleIX@mercycollege.edu Deputy Title IX Coordinator Avenue Youngstown, Ohio -2170 Elizabeth.Cardwell@mercycollege.edu See below for detailed informati on on these processes. Employee Reporting Obligations All Mercy College employees are required to report knowledge of Sexual Harassment to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, except employees bound by confidentiality (professional coun selors and clergy). This should occur within twenty -four hours. Student Affairs 100 Ohio law requires all employees with knowledge of a felony to report it to law enforcement. All college personnel shall report conduct prohibited by the College's Civil Rights/Nondiscriminatio n Policy (109) and this Sexual Harassment grievance procedure to the Title IX Coordinator. Preliminary Assessment Upon receipt of a report of Sexual Harassment, the Title IX Coordinator will conduct a preliminary assessment to determine: Whether the conduc t, as reported, falls or could fall within the scope of the policy; and Whether the conduct, as reported, constitutes or could constitute Sexual Harassment. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the conduct reported could not fall within the scope of the policy, and/or could not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if investigated, the Title Coordinator will close the matter and may notify the reporting party if doing so is consistent with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). The Title IX Coordinator may refer the report to other College offices, as appropriate. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the conduct reported could fall within the scope of the policy, and/or could constitute Sexual Harassment, if investigated, the Ti tle IX Coordinator will proceed to contact the Complainant. As part of the preliminary assessment, the Title IX Coordinator may take investigative steps to determine the identity of the Complainant, if such identity is not apparent from the report. Contact ing the Complainant If a report is not closed as a result of the preliminary assessment and the Complainant's identity is known, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures; to discuss and consider the Complainant's wishes with respect to such Supportive Measures; to inform the Complainant of the availability of such Supportive Measures with or without filing a Formal Complaint; and to explain the process for filing and pursuing a Formal Complaint. All victims of sexual assault will also be provided with information and options regarding: Hospital, medical, nurse forensic examiner availability; Seeking personal counseling and advocacy; Preserving evidence; Making a complaint to lo cal law enforcement and/or Public Safety; Calling 911 as needed; and Victim's rights and College responsibilities regarding judicial non -contact, restraining, protective orders, changing living arrangements, and federal student aid options. Supportive Meas ures If a report is not closed as a result of the preliminary assessment, the College will offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Complainant regardless of whether the Complainant elects to file a Formal Complaint. Contemporaneously with the R espondent being notified of a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the Respondent of the availability of Supportive Measures for the Respondent, and the College will offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Respondent Student Affairs 101 in the sa me manner in which it offers and makes them available to the Complainant. The College will also offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Respondent prior to the Respondent being notified of a Formal Complaint, if the Respondent requests such me asures. The College will maintain the confidentiality of Supportive Measures provided to either a Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality does not impair the College's ability to provide the Supportive Measures in que stion. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will communicate with each party throughout the investigation to ensure supportive measures remain necessary and effective. Failure to comply with the terms of any supportive measures that have been implemented may constitute a separate violation of this policy. Supportive Measures may be available whether or not the Complainant chooses to report the sexual violence or assault to Public Safety/Protective Services or local law enforcement. T he Title IX Coordinator and/or Deputy Title IX Coordinator remain available to assist individuals and provide reasonable remedies throughout the reporting, investigative and adjudicatory processes, and thereafter. Emergency Removal and Administrative Leave At any time after receiving a report of Sexual Harassment, the Title IX Coordinator may, after consultation with appropriate College officials, remove a student Respondent from the College's education programs and activities on an temporary basis if an in dividualized safety and risk analysis determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of Sexual Harassment justifies removal. In the event the Title IX Coordinator imposes an interim removal, the Title IX Coordinator must offer to meet with the Respondent within twenty -four hours and provide the Respondent an opportunity to challenge the emergency removal. Such meeting may, at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, include other College officials. In the case of a Respondent who is a non -student employee (administrator, faculty, or staff), and in its discretion, the College may place the Respondent on administrative leave at any time after receiving a report of Se xual Harassment, including during the pendency of the investigation and adjudication process specified below. For all other Respondents, including independent contractors and guests, the College retains broad discretion to prohibit such persons from entering onto its campus and other properties at any time, and for any reason, whether after receiving a report of Sexual Harassment or otherwise. Formal Complaint A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator requesting that the Colleg e investigate and adjudicate a report of Sexual Harassment in accordance with these procedures. Provided, however, that at the time the Complainant submits a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in, or attempting to participate in, one or more of the College's education programs or activities. Student Affairs 102 A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by regular mail, or by email using the contact information specified above. No person may submit a Formal Complain t on the Complainant's behalf. A Formal Complaint should contain the dates and times of the alleged misconduct. The names of persons involved, including potential witnesses, should also be included. The Formal Complaint should outline what occurred in as m uch detail as possible and the redress that is being sought. Finally, the contact information for the Complainant should be included. In any case, including a case where a Complainant elects not to file a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator may file a Formal Complaint on behalf of the College if doing so is not clearly unreasonable. Such action will normally be taken in limited circumstances involving serious or repeated conduct or where the alleged perpetrator may pose a continuing threat to the Co llege Community. If the Complainant or the Title IX Coordinator files a Formal Complaint, then the College will commence an investigation and proceed to adjudicate the matter as specified below. In all cases where a Formal Complaint is filed, the Complainant will be treat ed as a party, irrespective of the party's level of participation. In a case where the Title IX Coordinator files a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will not act as a Complainant or otherwise as a party for purposes of the investigation and adjud ication processes. Consolidation of Formal Complaints The College may consolidate Formal Complaints where the allegations of Sexual Harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances. Where the investigation and adjudication process involve more than one Complainant or more than one Respondent, references in this policy to the singular \"party,\" \"Complainant,\" or \"Respondent\" include the plural, as applicable. A Formal Complaint of Retaliation may be consolidated with a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment. Dismissal Prior to Commencement of Investigation In a case where the Complainant files a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will evaluate the Formal Complaint and must dismiss it if the Title IX Coordinator determines: The conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if proved; or The conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint falls outside the scope of the policy (i.e., because the alleged conduct did not occur in the College's Education Program s and Activities and/or the alleged conduct occurred outside the geographic boundaries of the United States). In the event the Title IX Coordinator determines the Formal Complaint should be dismissed, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal. The dismissal is a final determination unless modified or overturned on appeal. The Title IX Coordinator may refer the subject matter of the Formal Complaint to other College offices or procedures, as appropriate. Student Affairs 103 Notice of Formal Complaint Within five (5) business days of the Title IX Coordinator receiving a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will transmit a written notice to the Complainant and Respondent that includes: A physic al copy of this policy or a hyperlink to this policy; Sufficient details known at the time so that the parties may prepare for an initial interview with the investigator, to include the identities of the parties involved in the incident (if known), the conduct allegedly constituting Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident (if known); A statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged Sexual Harassment and that a determination of responsibility will not be made until the conclusion of the adjudication and any appeal; Notifying the Complainant and Respondent of their right to be accompanied by an advisor of their choice; Notifying the Complainant and Respondent of their right to inspect and review evidence; Notifying the Complainant and Respondent of the College's prohibitions on retaliation and false statements; and Information about resources that are available on campus and in the community. Should the College elect, at any point, to investigate allegatio ns that are materially beyond the scope of the initial written notice, the College will provide a supplemental written notice describing the additional allegations to be investigated. Criminal Reporting Procedures Reporting to Public Safety and/or the loca l police is an option at any time following a sexual violence or assault incident. If the victim chooses not to report to the police immediately, he/she can still make the report at a later time. However, with the passage of time, the ability to gather evidence to assist with criminal prosecution may be limited. Depending on the circumstances, the police may be able to obtain a criminal restraining order on the victim's behalf. Amnesty for Reporting To encourage reporting on the part of students, victims o f Sexual Harassment will not be charged with alcohol, drug and most other policy violations related to their efforts to seek assistance. Prohibition against Retaliation No individual involved in a report or formal complaint alleging a violation of this pol icy or participating in the investigation or adjudication of such a complaint shall be subject to Retaliation. Any report or Formal Complaint of Retaliation will be processed under this policy in the same manner as a report or Formal Complaint of Sexual Ha rassment, as the case may be. The College retains discretion to consolidate a Formal Complaint of Retaliation with a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment for investigation and/or adjudication purposes if the two Formal Complaints share a common nexus. Any acts of retaliation, as defined in this policy, shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal for students and termination for faculty and staff. Student Affairs 104 Health/Counseling/Clergy The individual may choose to seek advice and assistance from physicians, psychotherapists, professional counselors, clergy, sexual assault and domestic violence counselors and advocates, including individuals who work or volunteer for them. Civil Lawsuits The Complainant may choose to file a civil lawsuit against the Respondent, whether or not criminal charges have been filed. A civil lawsuit provides the Complainant the opportunity to recover actual damages, which may include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and emotional distress. Protective Orders The Complainant may choose to obtain a protective or restraining order. Restraining orders must be obtained from a court in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred. Restraining orders can protect victims who have experienced or are reasonably in fear of sexual violence or assault, including domestic violence, dating violence or stalking. The Title IX Coordinator/ Deputy Title IX Coordinator can offer assistance with obtaining a protective or restraining order. Clery Act The College is obligated to report any incidents of sexual violence or assault on its annual crime statistics under the Clery Act. The College, under this Act, is also obligated to issue a timely warning when an incident of sexual violence or assault has occurred. Non -Reporting The individual is strongly encouraged to report any incident of sexual violence or assault to the police and/or the College's Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator so that steps may be taken to protect the College co mmunity. However, non- reporting is also an option. Investigation Procedures and Protocol Commencement and Timing After the written notice of Formal Complaint is transmitted to the parties, the Title IX Coordinator or an investigator selected by the Title IX Coordinator (\"investigating officer\") will undertake an investigation to gather evidence relevant to the alleged misconduct, including inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. The investigating officer will conduct interviews with the Complainant, Respond ent, and witnesses. The investigating officer will also collect any non - testimonial evidence including, physical and electronic and will preserve evidence in a manner that protects the quality of the evidence. The burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination in the adjudication lies with the College and not with the parties. The investigation will culminate in a written investigation report that will be submitted to the adjudicator during the hearing process. Although the length of each investigation may vary depending on the totality of the circumstances, the College strives to complete each investigation within sixty (60) calendar days of the transmittal of the written notice of Formal Complaint. During an investigation, the investig ating officer may receive counsel from College administrators or other parties as needed. Student Affairs 105 Equal Opportunity The College will conduct a prompt, fair, and thorough investigation of all Formal Complaints. During the investigation and any related adjudication, the Complainant and Respondent shall have equal rights, including: Respect, dignity, and sensitivity throughout the process. An equal opportunity for the parties to be interviewed, to present witnesses (including fact and expert witnesses), and to present other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. Similar and timely access to all information considered by the investigating officer. Equal opportunity to review any statements or evidence provided by the other party. Equal access to review and comment upon any other information independently developed by the investigating officer. This includes the right to review the investigation report and provide comments on it, if desired, before a hearing. The right to receive written notice in advance of any meetings o r hearings so that they have sufficient time to prepare for meaningful participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the investigator retains discretion to limit the number of witness interviews the investigator conducts if the investigator finds that test imony would be unreasonably cumulative, if the witnesses are offered solely as character references and do not have information relevant to the allegations at issue, or if the witnesses are offered to render testimony that is categorically inadmissible, su ch as testimony concerning sexual history of the Complainant. The investigator will not restrict the ability of the parties to gather and present relevant evidence on their own. The investigation is a party's opportunity to present testimonial and other e vidence that the party believes is relevant to resolution of the allegations in the Formal Complaint. The investigating office may require the production of information by the parties by a certain date in order to facilitate a timely resolution. A party that is aware of and has a reasonable opportunity to present particular evidence and/or identify particular witnesses during the investigation, and elects not to, will be prohibited from introducing any such evidence during the adjudication absent a showin g of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Documentation of Investigation The investigator will take reasonable steps to ensure the investigation is documented. Interviews of the parties and witnesses may be documented by the investigator 's notes, audio recorded, video recorded, or transcribed. The particular method utilized to record the interviews of parties and witnesses will determined by the investigator in the investigator's sole discretion, although whatever method is chosen shall be used consistently throughout a particular investigation. Access to the Evidence At the conclusion of the evidence -gathering phase of the investigation, but prior to the completion of the investigation report, the Investigating Officer will transmit to each party and their advisor, in either electronic or hard copy form, all evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint, including evidence the College may choose not to rely on at any hearing and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or some other source. Thereafter, the parties will have ten (10) business days in Student Affairs 106 which to submit to the investigator a written response, which the investigator will conside r prior to completing the investigation report. The parties and their advisors are permitted to review the evidence solely for the purposes of this grievance process and may not photograph or disseminate the evidence to the public. Investigation Report After the period for the parties to provide any written response to the evidence, the investigator will complete a written investigation report that fairly summarizes the various steps taken during the investigation, summarizes the rel evant evidence collected, lists material facts on which the parties agree, and lists material facts on which the parties do not agree. When the investigation report is complete, the investigator will transmit a copy to the Title IX Coordinator. The inves tigator will also transmit the investigation report to each party and their advisor, in either electronic or hard copy form. Pending Criminal Investigation Mercy College of Ohio will comply with law enforcement requests for cooperation when appropriate. Su ch cooperation may require the College to temporarily suspend the fact -finding aspect of the Title IX investigation while the law enforcement agency is in the process of gathering evidence. The criminal investigation, however, does not relieve the College of its responsibilities under Title IX. The College will promptly resume its investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence gathering process of its investigation. The parameters of what information may o r may not be shared with law enforcement are outlined in Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with local law enforcement. Advisor of Choice Both the Complainant and Respondent may ask a support person/advisor to accompany him or her at all stages of the proces s. The advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. Except for the questioning of witnesses during the hearing, the advisor will play a passive role and is not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the advisor, or communicate with the College about the matter without the party being included in the communication. The support person/advisor must agree to maintain the confidentiality of the process. In the event a party's advisor of choice engages in material violation of the parameters specified in these procedures, the College may preclude the advisor from further participation, in which case the party may select a new advisor of their choice. In the event a party is not able to secure an advisor to attend the hearing and requests the College to provide an advisor, the College will provide the party an advisor, without fee or charge, who will conduct questioning on behalf of the party at the hearing. The College will have sole discretion to select t he advisor it provides. The advisor the College provides may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. Student Affairs 107 The College is not required to provide a party with an advisor in any circumstance except where the party does not have an advisor present at the hear ing specified in these procedures and requests that the College provide an advisor. Grievance/Adjudication Procedures Hearing Officer Upon receipt of the investigation report, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly appoint a hearing officer who will overse e the hearing process and render a determination of responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint, at the conclusion of the hearing process. The Title IX Coordinator will see that the hearing officer is provided a copy of the investigation report and a copy of all evidence transmitted to the parties by the investigator. Hearing Notice and Response to Investigation Report After the hearing officer is appointed by the Title IX Coordinator, the hearing officer will promptly transmit written notic e to the parties notifying the parties of the hearing officer's appointment; setting a deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; setting a date for the pre- hearing conference; setting a date and time for the heari ng; and providing a copy of the College's Hearing Procedures. Neither the pre- hearing conference, nor the hearing itself, may be held any earlier than ten (10) business days from the date of transmittal of the written hearing notice. A party's written re sponse to the investigation report must include: To the extent the party disagrees with the investigation report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement; Any argument that evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration at the hearing based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history, or for any other reason; A list of any witnesses that the party contends should be requested to attend the hearing pursuant to an attendance notice issued by the hearing o fficer; A list of any witnesses that the party intends to bring to the hearing without an attendance notice issued by the hearing officer; Any objection that the party has to the College's Hearing Procedures; Any request that the parties be separated physi cally during the pre -hearing conference and/or hearing; Any other accommodations that the party seeks with respect to the pre -hearing conference and/or hearing; The name and contact information of the advisor who will accompany the party at the pre - hearing conference and hearing; If the party does not have an advisor who will accompany the party at the hearing, a request that the College provide an advisor for purposes of conducting questioning as specified in these procedures. A party's written response to the investigation report may also include: Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint constitute Sexual Harassment. Student Affairs 108 Pre-Hearing Conference Prior to the hearing, the hearing officer will conduct a pre- hearing conference with the parties and their advisors. The pre -hearing conference will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporane ous participation by the parties and their advisors. By default, the pre- hearing conference will be conducted with the hearing officer, the parties, the advisors, and other necessary College personnel together in the same physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties to participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio. In the hearing officer's discretion, the pre- hearing conference may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology. During the pre- hearing conference, the hearing officer will discuss the hearing procedures with t he parties; address matters raised in the parties' written responses to the investigation report, as the hearing officer deems appropriate; discuss whether any stipulations may be made to expedite the hearing; discuss the witnesses the parties have request ed be served with notices of attendance and/or witnesses the parties plan to bring to the hearing without a notice of attendance; and resolve any other matters that the hearing officer determines, in the hearing officer's discretion, should be resolved bef ore the hearing. Issuance of Notices of Attendance After the pre -hearing conference, the hearing officer will transmit notices of attendance to any College employee (including administrator, faculty, or staff) or student whose attendance is requested at th e hearing as a witness. The notice will advise the subject of the specified date and time of the hearing and advise the subject to contact the hearing officer immediately if there is a material and unavoidable conflict. The subject of an attendance notice should notify any manager, faculty member, or other supervisor, as necessary, if attendance at the hearing will conflict with job duties, classes, or other obligations. All such managers, faculty members, coaches, and other supervisors are required to excuse the subject of the obligation, or provide some other accommodation, so that the subject may attend the hearing as specified in the notice. The College will not issue a notice of attendance to any witness who is not an employee or a student. Hearing After the pre -hearing conference, the hearing officer will convene and conduct a hearing pursuant to the College's Hearing Procedures. The hearing will be audio recorded. The audio recording will be made available to the parties for inspection and review o n reasonable notice, including for use in preparing any subsequent appeal. The hearing will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their advisors. By default, the hearing will be conducted with the hearin g officer, the parties, the advisors, witnesses, and other necessary College personnel together in the same Student Affairs 109 physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties t o participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio. In the hearing officer's discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology. While the Hearing Procedures and rulings from the hearing officer will govern the particulars of the hearing, each hearing will include, at a minimum: Opportunity for each party to address the hearing officer directly and to re spond to questions posed by the hearing officer; Opportunity for each party's advisor to ask directly, orally, and in real time, relevant questions, and follow up questions, of the other party and any witnesses, including questions that support or challeng e credibility; Opportunity for each party to raise contemporaneous objections to testimonial or non - testimonial evidence and to have such objections ruled on by the hearing officer and a reason for the ruling provided; Opportunity for each party to submit evidence that the party did not present during the investigation due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; Opportunity for each party to make a brief closing argument. Except as otherwise permitted by the hearing officer, the hearing wi ll be closed to all persons except the parties, their advisors, the investigator, the hearing officer, the Title IX Coordinator, and other necessary College personnel. Except for the investigator and the parties, witnesses will be sequestered until such t ime as their testimony is complete. During the hearing, the parties and their advisors will have access to the investigation report and evidence that was transmitted to them earlier. While a party has the right to attend and participate in the hearing with an advisor, a party and/or advisor who materially and repeatedly violates the rules of the hearing in such a way as to be materially disruptive, may be barred from further participation and/or have their participation limited, as the case may be, in the d iscretion of the hearing officer. Subject to the minimum requirements specified here, the hearing officer will have sole discretion to determine the manner and particulars of any given hearing, including with respect to the length of the hearing, the order of the hearing, and questions of admissibility. The hearing officer will independently and contemporaneously screen questions for relevance in addition to resolving any contemporaneous objections raised by the parties and will explain the rational for an y evidentiary rulings. The hearing is not a formal judicial proceeding and strict rules of evidence do not apply. The hearing officer will have discretion to modify the Hearing Procedures, when good cause exists to do so, and provided the minimal requireme nts specified in this section are met. Student Affairs 110 Subjection to Questioning In the event that any party or witness refuses to attend the hearing, or attends but refuses to submit to questioning by the parties' advisors, the statements of that party or witness, as the case may be, whether given during the investigation or during the hearing, will not be considered by the hearing officer in reaching a determination of responsibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the hearing officer may consider the testimony of any party or witness, whether given during the investigation or during the hearing, if the parties jointly stipulate that the testimony may be considered or in the case where neither party requested attendance of the witness at the hearing. The hearing officer will not draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party or a witness's absence from the live hearing and/or refusal to submit to questioning by the parties' advisors. Deliberation and Determination After the hea ring is complete, the hearing officer will objectively evaluate all relevant evidence collected during the investigation, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, together with testimony and non- testimony evidence received at the hearing, and ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a person's status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The hearing officer will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that was ruled inadmissible at the pre- hearing confer ence, during the hearing, or by operation of the prohibition against considering the sexual history of the Complainant. The hearing officer will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., \"more likely than not\") standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence constitute one or more violations of the policy as alleged in the Formal Complaint. Discipline and Remedies In the event the hearing officer determines that the Respondent is responsible for violating this policy, the hearing officer will, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with an appropriate College official with disciplinary authority over the Respondent and such official will dete rmine any discipline to be imposed. The hearing officer will also, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the Title IX Coordinator who will determine whether and to what extent ongoing support measures or other remedies will be provided to the Complainant. Written Decision After reaching a determination and consulting with the appropriate College official and Title IX Coordinator, the hearing officer will prepare a written decision that will include: Identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Harassment made in the Formal Complaint; A description of the procedural steps taken by the College upon receipt of the Formal Complaint, through issuance of the written decision, including notification to the parties, interviews with the parties and witnesses, methods used to gather non -testimonial Student Affairs 111 evidence, and the date, location, and people who were present at or presented testimony at the hearing. Articulate findings of fact, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that support the determination; A statement of, and rationale for, each allegation that constitutes a separate potential incident of Sexual Harassment, including a determination regarding responsibility for each separate potential incident; The discipline dete rmined by the appropriate College official; Whether the Complainant will receive any ongoing support measures or other remedies as determined by the Title IX Coordinator; and A description of the College's process and grounds for appeal. The hearing officer's written determination will be transmitted to the parties. Transmittal of the written determination to the parties concludes the hearing process, subject to any right of appeal. Although the length of each adjudication by hearing will vary depending on the totality of the circumstances, the College strives to issue the hearing officer's written determination within fifteen (15) business days of the conclusion of the hearing. Dismissal During Investigation or Adjudication The College shall dismiss a For mal Complaint at any point during the investigation or adjudication process if the Title IX Coordinator determines that one or more of the following is true: The conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if proved ; or The conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint falls outside the scope of the policy. The College may dismiss a Formal Complaint at any point during the investigation or adjudication process if the Title IX Coordinator determines that any one or more of the following is true: The Complainant provides the Title IX Coordinator written notice that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed); The Respon dent is no longer enrolled or employed by the College, as the case may be; or Specific circumstances prevent the College from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint, or any discrete allegations therein (in which c ase those discrete allegations may be dismissed). In the event the Title IX Coordinator determines that a Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this provision, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal. The Title IX Coordinator may refer the subject matter of the Formal Complaint to other College offices, as appropriate. A dismissal pursuant to this provision is presumptively a final determination as it pertains to this policy, unless otherwise specified in writing by the Title IX Coordinator in the written notice of dismissal. Appeal Either party may appeal the determination of an adjudication, or a dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on one or more of the following grounds: A procedural irregularity affected the outcome; Student Affairs 112 There is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination or dismissal was made, that could have affected the outcome; The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or hearing officer had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or against the individual Complainant or Respondent, that affected the outcome; No other grounds for appeal are permitted. Appeals must be filed in wr iting with the President of the College within seven (7) business days of receipt of the notice of dismissal or written determination. The appeal must specifically: Name of the Complainant; Name of the Respondent; A detailed statement of the basis for the appeal including the specific facts, circumstances, and argument in support of it; and, Requested action, if any. Promptly upon receipt of an appeal, the President will conduct an initial evaluation to confirm that the appeal is timely filed and that it i nvokes at least one of the permitted grounds for appeal. If the President determines that the appeal is not timely, or that it fails to invoke a permitted ground for appeal, the President will dismiss the appeal and provide written notice of the same to t he parties. If the President confirms that the appeal is timely and invokes at least one permitted ground for appeal, the President will provide written notice to the other party that an appeal has been filed and that the other party may submit a written o pposition to the appeal within seven (7) business days. The President will also promptly obtain from the Title IX Coordinator any records from the investigation and adjudication necessary to resolve the grounds raised in the appeal. The President will res olve the appeal within fifteen (15) business days of receiving the appeal and any written opposition to it and may take any and all actions that he/she determines to be in the interest of a fair and just decision. The decision of the President is final. The President shall issue a short and plain, written statement of the resolution of the appeal that explains the outcome of the appeal and the rationale. The written statement shall be provided to the Complainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinato r/Deputy Title IX Coordinator within three (3) business days of the resolution. The determination of a Formal Complaint, including any discipline, becomes final when the time for appeal has passed with no party filing an appeal or, if any appeal is filed, at the point when the President has resolved all appeals, either by dismissal or by transmittal of a written decision. No further review beyond the appeal is permitted. Treatment Records and Other Privileged Information During the investigation and adjudi cation processes, the investigator and adjudicator are not permitted to access, consider, disclose, permit questioning concerning, or otherwise use: A party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recogniz ed professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party; or Student Affairs 113 Information or records protected from disclosure by any other legally recognized privilege, such as the attorney client privilege; unless the College has obtained the party's voluntary, written consent to do so for the purposes of the investigation and adjudication process. Notwithstandin g the foregoing, the investigator and/or adjudicator may consider any such records or information otherwise covered by this section if the party holding the privilege affirmatively discloses the records or information to support their allegation or defense . Sexual History During the investigation and adjudication processes, questioning regarding a Complainant's sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant's prior sexual behavior ar e offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant's prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Complainant who affirmatively uses information otherwise considered irrelevant by this section for the purpose of supporting the Complainant's allegations, may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section. Informal Resolution At any time after the parties are provided written notice of the Formal Complaint, and before the completion of any appeal, the parties may voluntarily consent, with the Title IX Coordinator's approval, to engage in mediation, facilitat ed resolution, or other form of dispute resolution the goal of which is to enter into a final resolution resolving the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint by agreement of the parties. The specific manner of any informal resolution process will be de termined by the parties and the Title IX Coordinator, in consultation together. Prior to commencing the informal resolution process agreed upon, the Title IX Coordinator will transmit a written notice to the parties that: Describes the parameters and requ irements of the informal resolution process to be utilized; Identifies the individual responsible for facilitating the informal resolution (who may be the Title IX Coordinator, another College official, or a suitable third -party); Explains the effect of participating in informal resolution and/or reaching a final resolution will have on a party's ability to resume the investigation and adjudication of the allegations at issue in the Formal Complaint; and Explains any other consequence resulting from participation in the informal resolution process, including a description of records that will be generated, maintained, and/or shared. After receiving the written notice specified in this paragraph, each party must voluntarily provide written consent to the Titl e IX Coordinator, before the informal resolution may commence. During the pendency of the informal resolution process, the investigation and adjudication processes that would otherwise occur are stayed and all related deadlines are suspended. Student Affairs 114 If the partie s reach a resolution through the informal resolution process, and the Title IX Coordinator agrees that the resolution is not clearly unreasonable, the Title IX Coordinator will reduce the terms of the agreed resolution to writing and present the resolution to the parties for their written signature. Once both parties and the Title IX Coordinator sign the resolution, the resolution is final, and the allegations addressed by the resolution are considered resolved and will not be subject to further investigat ion, adjudication, remediation, or discipline by the College, except as otherwise provided in the resolution itself, absent a showing that a party induced the resolution by fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct or where required to avoid a manifest injustice to either party or to the College. Informal resolution pursuant to this section is not subject to appeal. A party may withdraw their consent to participate in informal resolution at any time before a resolution has been finalized.

Such a leave may be extended if deemed medically necessary by the student's doctor. (3) Due to the structure of the College's health sciences programs, the timing and/or length of a student's leave of absence may result in the student being required to re- take or finish course(s) in a future term. (4) If taking a leave of absence due to a pregnancy, an Education Plan will be discussed and signed by the student and the Title IX Coordinator/Deputy Title IX Coordinator. c. Withdraw from the College (1) The student may, in their sole discretion, determine that they must withdraw from the College for an indefinite period of time or permanently due to pregnancy.

CAMPUS ASSESSMENT RE SPONSE AND EVALUATIO N (CARE) TEAM POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, March 2019 The Campus Assessment Response and Evaluation (CARE) Team at Mercy College of Ohio (\"Co llege\") reinforces the College's efforts to provide the students, faculty, staff, and visitors (\"Community\") with a safe and secure environment to work, study, and live. As a subset of the Campus Violence Prevention Committee (CVPC), the CARE Team assists with prevention and intervention in incidents where members of the College community are experiencing distress or engaging in harmful or disruptive behaviors, as well as supports individuals impacted by such incidents. The goal and mission of the CARE Tea m, is to: gather information about students of concern; assess information about each case brought before the CARE Team; define and coordinate plan/response; implement a response to a perceived or real threat; and monitor the disposition of the case (Deriv ed from the Higher Educational Mental Health Alliance (HEMHA) Project, Balancing Safety and Support on Camp us: A Guide for Campus Teams - -safety - support -campus- jed-guide.pdf . The CARE Team acts as a mechanism for improved coordination and communication across the campus and/or system and makes recommendations in accordance with existing college policies. *Note: None of the information in this policy replaces faculty classroom manageme nt, disciplinary processes (either student conduct or Human Resources), campus emergency response protocols, or Campus Security responses to incidents. The CARE Team at Mercy College promotes the success, health, and safety of individuals within the community through identifying and responding to individuals whose behaviors may be troubling with the intention to provide assistance and intervention to prevent incidents from occurring. The role of the CARE Team is to: understand threats/concerns; evalu ate legitimacy of concerns; identify motivations for violence; assess likelihood of physical harm to self and/or others; develop strategies for risk reduction; guide implementation of strategies, re -evaluate threat; and evaluate the needs of the community (as outlined by Deisinger & Randazzo, 2010; Best Practices in Campus Threat Assessment & Management). Student Affairs 130 Definition of Threat: Threat is the expression of intent to cause physical or mental harm to self and/or others. An expression constitutes a threat with out regard to whether the party communicating the threat has the present ability to carry it out, and without regard to whether the expression is contingent, conditional, or future. Members of the CARE Team: Assistant Dean of Student Life (Co -Chair) Assist ant Dean of Student Success (Co -Chair) Director of Accessibility and Testing Services Campus Safety representative Faculty representative Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Youngstown location) *Other individuals may be included as needed, such as, but not limit ed to: academic advisors, legal counsel, Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Director of Career, Professional Development, and Retention, Human Resources, etc. All members of the CARE Team will participate in training upon initial participation and at reg ular intervals thereafter in areas such as best practices for assessment teams, legal issues (including disability law protections), risk management, documentation, and any other topics to ensure that the team functions effectively. Members of the campus c ommunity should report any behavior that is questionable, suspicious, or inappropriate, which may be presented through an individual's appearance, spoken or written words, or specific actions. Examples of such \"red flag\" behaviors include: - Behaviors that regularly interfere with classroom environment or management - Notable change in academic performance, including repeated absences - Notable change in behavior or appearance - Impairment of thoughts, verbally or in writing - Extreme disorganization or erratic perf ormance - Overly aggressive behaviors toward others - Poor decision making and coping skills - Continuing to pursue options that do not reasonably exist after being instructed to cease - Inappropriate or strange behavior that is significantly outside the boundarie s of socially acceptable behavior - Low frustration tolerance - Overreaction to circumstances - Lack of resiliency - Writing and comments endorsing violence; unusual interest in violence - Indirect or direct threats in writings or verbalizations - Lack of empathy and concern for others; inability to care - Anger management problems - Threats to others - Appearance of being overly nervous, tense, or tearful - Expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings of hopelessness. It is the responsibility of the CARE Team to pr ovide education to the campus community about its role and responsibility to report \"red flag\" behaviors, what to report, where to report, how reports will be handled, and regular reminders of the process. Student Affairs 131 Receiving Information All members of the campus co mmunity are encouraged to report behaviors or incidents that are concerning to the CARE Team by using the Concern and Complaint form, available online (https://mercycollege.edu/student -affairs/concern -complaint ). Upon receiving a report, the CARE Team will follow up to assess and intervene, if needed. However, in the event of an emergency that requires immediate intervention, call 911. Non -emergency law enforcement reports can be made to Mercy Protective Services in Toledo (419- 251 -4444) or Mercy Health Police - Youngstown (330 - 480 -3288). Assessment and Intervention Upon receiving a report, the Co -Chairs of the CARE Team will ensure that all members of the CARE Team receive the inf ormation. The CARE Team will meet to assess the incident through gathering information, evaluating the risk to the community, identifying and implementing the appropriate intervention(s), and determining follow -up as appropriate. Gathering Information The CARE Team may gather information from several sources, such as: - Review of student's academic and disciplinary history - Review of available medical information, including diagnoses and treatment history - Local law enforcement or legal/criminal background che ck - Previous colleges, if student has transferred - Interviews with all parties involved, including targets of inappropriate/concerning behaviors - Interview with the person alleged to have displayed inappropriate/concerning behavior - Assessment by counselor/men tal health professional - Online search of the student's name, and the name(s) of anyone the student may have threatened, harassed, pursued, or scared Level of Risk Based on the information gathered, the CARE Team will utilize the following scale to determin e the level of the risk that the incident/behavior poses to the campus community. Levels of Risk are based on the National Behavioral Intervention Team Association's (NaBITA) Threat Assessment -Tool.pdf Mild Risk: Includes some disruptive or concerning behaviors, the individual may or may not show signs of distress, depressed, withdrawn, lack of trust, argumentative, or not interested in the perspective of others. At this risk level, there is no serious threat to the student of concern or the campus community. Any concerns can generally be resolved through consultation with the CARE Team and addressed between the parties involved. Moderate/Elevated Risk: Behaviors that may indicate a moderate risk include repeated disruptive behavior, behaviors involving more than one -person, challenging authority, destructive or vandalizing behaviors, alcohol or drug misuse/abuse, eating disorders, self - injurious behavior, vague threats, inconsistent threats, or suicidal thoughts. Student Affairs 132 Severe/Extreme Risk: May include seriously disruptive incident(s), repeated derogatory statements to others, erratic behavior, suicidal thoughts with plans or intent, aggression, or threatening others. Possible Interventions Referral to college and/or community resources Voluntary withdrawal from classes - based on discussions w ith a counselor or member of CARE Team, the student may choose to temporarily take time away from the College, according to applicable College leave policies and procedures. Referral to disciplinary process Removal from campus housing Mandatory direct thre at/safety assessment - the student may be required to participate in an individualized direct threat assessment to determine if the student may safely continue as a member of the College community and for assistance in gaining access to treatment, if needed. The assessment may result in an interim suspension and/or involuntary withdrawal. Conditions may be imposed as part of a suspension or withdrawal that the student must fulfill prior to readmission. Criminal charges Direct Threat / Safety Assessment In cases in which the College receives a report of concerning behavior that poses a risk to the health and safety of the College community and its members, the CARE Team will engage to determine the nature of the risk and any measures that can be taken to manage the risk. The CARE Team will make these determinations as the result of an individualized assessment. The purpose of the assessment is to determine the level of risk the student poses to the health and safety of the College community and to inform de cisions about the student's future participation in the College's programs. The CARE Team will not take or recommend adverse action against a student whose conduct is considered to pose a significant risk to the College community before conducting an individualized assessment. The CARE Team will make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; th e probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices or procedures or, where applicable, the provision of auxiliary aids and services, will mitigate the risk. The CARE Team undertakes thi s assessment to ensure compliance with the direct threat regulatory provisions and to ensure that students with disabilities are not subjected to adverse action on the basis of unfounded fear, prejudice and stereotypes. The CARE Team may recommend to the V ice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students or other appropriate administrator that the College impose interim restrictions upon students up to and including an interim suspension. Interim restrictions may be imposed if the CARE Team believes that s uch interim restrictions are advisable to protect the College community or to ensure safety and maintenance of order of the College pending further assessment of the student. Student Affairs 133 Assessment The CARE Team will notify the student of the direct threat inquiry in writing and will invite the student to provide documents or other information related to the team's assessment. If the student does not provide documents or other information, the CARE Team will proceed with the documents or information the CARE Team has available. The CARE Team will convene and will consider what health and safety concerns the student's behavior raises and whether the risks associated with those concerns can be managed by modifications, support measures, or accommodations. The team may consider the imposition of a behavioral contact, if appropriate, that may include, among other things, consultations with health care professionals or restrictions on participation in College operations. As part of the team's review, the student may be requ ired to undergo an assessment with a health professional designated by the College within a specified period of time. The purpose of the assessment is to ascertain whether the student poses an immediate and direct threat to health and safety. At this ass essment, the student will be asked to sign a release of information to allow the health professional conducting the assessment to communicate with the student's treating physician or mental health professional (if applicable) to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of whether the student poses such a direct threat. If the student chooses not to sign the release, the health professional will proceed with the assessment based on the information available to him/her. The student's parents/guardians may also be notified of the decision to require a health assessment. If the team determines the student poses health or safety risk to the College community and that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable modifications of policies, practices or procedures or t he provision of auxiliary aids and services, the CARE Team will make the necessary referrals for action regarding the student. Appeal A student may appeal a decision made by the CARE Team to the Vice President of Student Affairs /Dean of Students within thr ee business days of the decision. The Vice President will review the student's written appeal, review all available documents and information from the CARE Team, and render a decision in a timely manner. The CARE Team will not participate in the deliberation or decision regarding the student's appeal. Return requirements Following a determination that an individual poses a risk to the health and safety of the College community necessitating a voluntary or involuntary leave or withdrawal, the College may require as a precondition to a student's return that the student provide documentation that the student has taken steps to mitigate the previous behavior. The College may request records from the student and request permission to speak to a tr eating professional. The records and information that will be requested and required are determined on a case by case basis depending on what information is necessary to determine whether the student is able to return and fulfill the fundamental requirem ents of the College's programs. Student Affairs 134 Follow -up Upon implementation of interventions, the CARE Team will determine a plan for follow -up monitoring of the student. This may include checking with faculty and staff regarding behaviors. Additionally, the student may be required to have periodic meetings with a counselor or a member of CARE Team. Documentation and Recordkeeping The CARE Team will track cases and document discussions and action. The documentation generated from the CARE Team will be kept in a secure electronic database system or kept in paper form in a locked file cabinet in the Vice President of Student Affairs /Dean of Students' office. HAZING POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, June 2018 Mercy College of Ohio (\"the College\") is committed to providing an environment of well -being, learning, and accountability for its members. \"Hazing\" is the act or coercing of another, including the person being hazed, to do any act of initiation into any student or other organization that causes or creates a substantial risk of causing mental or physical harm to any person. The College Hazing Policy is grounded in three standards and applies to both individuals and groups: (1) Compliance with governing law and College policies; (2) Respect for the College community, through the prevention/zero tolerance of hazing; (3) Accountability for reporting hazing. This policy informs students of their individual and community responsibilities regarding hazing, and the College's response to Hazing Policy violations.

MINORS ON CAMPUS POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, March 2018 Minors visit Mercy College of Ohio (the \"College\") for a variety of reasons. They may visit as prospective students, as participants on field trips, to attend camps, and for other occasions. Whatever the reason for their presence, all College employees are to be particularly vigilant regarding their safety and security. With that in mind, the College has created policies aimed at protecting children who are involved with the community. This policy applies to all minors, as defined below, who are on College property or are otherwise participating in College -sponsored programs and activities. Faculty, staff and students are also subject to the Mercy Health Abuse and Neglect: Child, Elder, Domestic and Sexual Policy (Number: MHP -ADM -1004). I. Definitions 1. \"Child abuse or neglect\" is when a child has suffered or faces a substantial threat of suffering any physical or mental injury that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect, including that of a sexual nature. 2. \"Minors\" are persons under the age of eighteen (18) who are not enrolled or accepted for enrollment at Mercy College of Ohio as a student. The term \"minor\" and \"child\" are used interchangeably in this policy . II. Reporting Suspected Abuse or Neglect 1. Consistent with Ohio law, it is the College's policy that any employee who knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that a minor has been subjected to abuse or neglect, may be subjected to abuse or neglect, or faces a threat of abuse or neglect shall immediately make a report as described in Procedure 176, Section I. For purposes of this paragraph, \"reasonable cause\" does not require that the individual making the observation conduct an investigation prior to making t he report of his or her \"reasonable\" suspicion that a minor has been abused or neglected or is at risk of it. 2. The College will make every reasonable effort to conduct its investigation of reported child abuse or neglect in a manner that protects the confid entiality of the person making the report. However, it may be necessary to disclose details in the course of an investigation or when required by law. 3. Nothing in this policy is intended to prevent non- employees, such as students and visitors, from making a report if they have reasonable cause to suspect that child abuse or neglect has occurred or may occur. III. Supervision of Minors on Campus 1. No minors are to be left alone or unsupervised on college property: this includes, but is not limited to classrooms, of fices, skills labs, science labs, student lounges, waiting areas, etc. It is the responsibility of anyone who brings minors to campus to ensure supervision of that Student Affairs 141 minor. If a minor has been left unattended, this should be reported as described in Proced ure 176, Section II. IV. Minors in the Workplace or Classroom 1. As discussed in this section, in certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for faculty, staff, and students to bring their minor children to the workplace or classroom . In such situations, the g oal should be to foster respect for the needs of all parties impacted by the presence of the minor children. Employees and supervisors must consider issues of safety, confidentiality, disruption of operations, disruption of services, disruption to other employees, appropriateness and liability posed by the presence of the minor children in the workplace. Faculty, staff, and students: a. May occasionally bring minors to the workplace for brief visits, specific campus events, situational convenience, or family emergencies.

STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, June 2018 Mercy College has established a policy and procedure for addressing the concerns and complaints of students fairly and promptly, when there is no other more specific policy or procedure that governs the matter at hand. This policy applies only to concerns and complaints of students at the College, and the procedure will only be utilized when the subject matter of the concern or complaint is not covered by another policy or procedure. The College is committed to providing an educational climate that is conducive to the personal and professional devel opment of each individual. The Student Complaint Policy and Procedure can be used when students believe they have been treated unfairly or inequitably by another member of the College community or if they have other complaints about their experience at th e College, and the subject matter of the concern or complaint is not covered by existing policies and procedures, such as the College's Title IX, Violence Against Women and Campus SaVE Policy and Procedures, the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Acad emic Appeal Process. Before filing a complaint under this policy, a student is encouraged to seek an informal resolution of the matter by discussing it directly with the individual(s) involved. However, seeking informa l resolution is not required. Also, note that the College prohibits retaliation against any individual for bringing a complaint under this policy or participating in an investigation. Additionally, students Student Affairs 143 are advised that the Student Complaint Policy and Procedure will not be used as an additional appeal when another set of procedures has already been applied. External complaints: In addition to filing an internal complaint with the College using the procedure below, students also have the right to file a complaint with any of the following: Complaints to the Ohio Department of Higher Education (formerly the Ohio Board of Regents) The Ohio Department of Higher Education is responsible for responding to formal complaints against public, independent non- profit and proprietary institutions of higher education in Ohio. While the Ohio Department of Higher Education has limited authority over colleges and universities and cannot offer legal advice or initiate civil court cases, their staff will review submitted complaints and work with student complainants and institutions.

Where a complaint does raise issues regarding the institution's ongoing ability to meet the Criteria of Accreditation, the Commission forwards the complaint to the institution and requests a formal response. HLC Contact information: The Higher Learning Commission 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7 -500 Chicago, Illinois 60604 -1411 Phone: (312) Resources/complaints.html Students having concerns or complaints for which they are unsure of the applicable process or reporting mechanism may file such concern with the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students by utilizing Form 511/519 -A Concern and Complaint Electronic Form . The Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students will communicate with the student to gain an understanding of Student Affairs 144 the situation. If the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students determi nes that another College policy or procedure governs the situation (e.g., grade appeal, sexual misconduct, etc.), the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students will act as a facilitator to ensure the information is directed to the appropriate Coll ege official. If the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students determines that no other College procedures govern, the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students will work informally with the student, and others as necessary, to reach a resolution of the situation. If the student and Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students are unable to resolve the situation, the student may file a formal written complaint with the President of the College. The President of the College will con duct an investigation into the matter, taking all steps deemed necessary based on the circumstances, and will issue a written decision to the student. The President's decision is final and not subject to further appeal. Documentation Formal complaints ma de under this policy or other any other College policy, and their respective resolutions, are appropriately tracked and documented. Electronic copies of complaints are kept with the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students; however, resolutions may also be kept with the appropriate Vice President and/or member of Mercy College Administration. If applicable, hard copies of each complaint and any related documentation are kept with the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students' office in a locked file.

The summary will be brought to Executive Staff for review prior to May 1 of each year, and the summary will be shared with the Board of Trustees at the annual meeting in June. SERVICE/EMOTIONAL SU PPORT ANIMAL/PET POL ICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, March 2019 In accordance of Section 504 of the Rehabilit ation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 supports the use of service animals and emotional support animals on campus by individuals with disabilities. This policy provides guidelines for the presence of service animals, emotional sup port animals, and pets on Mercy College (\"College\") property. It is designed to fulfill the College's mission statement and meet the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). This policy applies to all College -controlled properties. The College categorizes animals into three classifications: service animals, emotional support animals, and pets. Guidelines regarding each of these classifications are outlined below. Service Animals A service animal is any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not considered service animals. Student Affairs 145 Service animals are working animals, not pets . The work or tasks performed must be directly related to the individual's disability. The crime deterrent effects of an animal's pr esence and the provision of emotional support, well -being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition. The College may permit the use of a miniature horse on the same basis as a service animal in some sit uations; such requests are considered on a case -by-case basis. Individuals with disabilities can bring their service animal into all College facilities where members of the public, program participants, clients, customers, patrons, or invitees are allowed. No prior approval is necessary. A service animal can be excluded from certain areas of College facilities if its presence would fundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity, be disruptive, or interfere with legitimate safety requirements (e.g . a surgery or burn unit in a hospital in which a sterile field is required). Emotional Support Animals Emotional support animals (ESAs) are companion animals that provide therapeutic benefit, such as alleviating or mitigating the symptoms of a person's disability. Unlike service animals, ESAs are not trained to perform work or tasks and they can include animals other than dogs and miniature horses. Students who wish to bring an ESA to campus as an exception to the \"no pet\" provisions of this p olicy must request an accommodation through the Office of Accessibility Services pursuant to the Procedures outlined below . While accommodation requests will be accepted and considered at any time, requests should be filed at least 90 days before the stud ent intends to bring the animal to campus in order to ensure timely consideration. An ESA will not be allowed until formal approval has been received. Handler/Owner Definitions A \"handler\" is a person with a disability that a service animal assists or a p ersonal care attendant who handles the animal for a person with a disability. An \"owner\" is a student or employee who has an approved ESA on campus. Inquiries Regarding Service Animals In general, members of the College community should not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability . However, as permitted by the ADA, if it is not obvious that the animal is required because of a disability, the handler may be asked: 1. Is the animal required because of a disability? 2. What work or task ha s the animal been trained to perform? Faculty, staff or students cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical or training documentation, or ask that the service animal demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task . Community members sho uld not make inquiries about a service animal when it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability (e.g., if the dog is observed guiding an individual who is blind or has low vision, pulling a person's wheelchair, or providing assistance with stability or balance to an individual with an observable mobility disability). Student Affairs 146 Employee Requests Employees with a disability who wish to (1) utilize a service animal as a reasonable accommodation in an of fice or other areas of campus buildings not open to the general public, or (2) utilize an ESA on campus must submit the request to Human Resources at least 30 days before the animal is needed. Please refer to Mercy Health Regional Policy Accommodation of Service Animals. Requirements for the College Community Members of the College community are required to abide by the following practices: 1. Do not touch or pet a service or emotional support animal unless invited to do so. 2. Do not feed a service or emotional support animal. 3. Do not deliberately startle a service or emotional support animal. 4. Do not separate or attempt to separate a handler/owner from his or her service or emotional support animal. Pets For reasons of sanitation, noise, and potential health pro blems, pets (including hamsters, aquatic frogs, fish, turtles, etc.) are strictly prohibited in all campus facilities. All prohibited pets must be removed from campus property immediately or the owner may face a fine and/or disciplinary action. All pets brought onto campus outdoor spaces must be leashed, not left unattended, and all waste must be picked up. Removal of Service Animals or Disapproval/Removal of ESAs The College may remove a service animal or disapprove/remove an ESA in certain situations. Such decisions are made on a case -by-case basis in accordance with applicable laws. The following general standards reflect reasons why an animal may be removed or disapproved: 1. The animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. For example, the animal displays vicious behavior towards others or has a serious illness. 2. The animal causes or would cause substantial physical damage to the property of others. 3. The animal poses an undue financial and/or administrative burden. 4. The animal woul d fundamentally alter the nature of the College's educational operations. 5. The animal is out of control and the handler/owner does not take effective action to control it. If the out of control behavior happens repeatedly, the handler/owner may be prohibit ed from bringing the animal into College facilities until the handler/owner can demonstrate that he/she has taken significant steps to mitigate the behavior. 6. The animal is not housebroken. 7. The handler/owner does not abide by his/her responsibilities under this policy. When an animal has been properly removed pursuant to this policy, the College will work with the handler/owner to determine reasonable alternative opportunities to participate in the College's services, programs, and activities without having the animal on the premises. Responsibilities of Handlers/Owners Laws, Ordinances, and Policies: Handlers/owners are responsible for complying with all state laws and local animal ordinances . The cities of Toledo and Youngstown require all dogs to be licensed and registered . Dogs must wear license tags at all times . The City of Toledo also mandates Student Affairs 147 that every female dog in heat shall be confined in a building or secured enclosure in such a manner that such female dog cannot come into contact with another animal, except for planned breeding. Proper Identification: All animals are subject to local licensing and registration requirements. Health and Vaccination: Animals must be immunized against diseases common to that type of animal. All vaccinations must be current. These animals must wear a rabies vaccination tag, and in the case of ESAs, vaccination documentation must be provided to the Office of Accessibility Services Caring for the Animal: The cost of care, arrangements and responsibilities for the well -being of the animal are the sole responsibility of the handler/owner at all times. The College will accept no responsibility for the care of any animal covered by this policy. A. Animals must be kept clean and well groomed. College facilities such as sinks, bathrooms, and the like may not be used for this purpose. B. Animals cannot be left unattended. Animals cannot be confined to a vehicle, tethered or abandoned at any time. C. Animals must be well cared for at all times. Any evidence of mistreatment, abuse, or neglect may result in immediate removal of the animal and/or disciplinary action. If animal abuse is suspected, it will be directly reported to Mercy Protective Services , the Director of Student Life, and/or Lucas County Animal Services. Any costs incurred during the removal of the animal will be billed to its handler/owner. D. Owners of an ESA must provide the Office of Accessibility Services and the Off ice of Student Life with contact information for an alternate caregiver . This information will be used in case of an emergency, or if the person is unable or unwilling to provide adequate care for the animal. Keeping the Animal Under Control: The animal should be fully controlled by the handler/owner, including responding to voice and/or hand commands (if this can reasonably be expected of the type of animal at issue) . If an animal is found loose or unattended, the animal is subject to immediate removal. Being Responsible for Damage Caused by the Animal: Handlers/owners are personally responsible for any damage caused by their animals and must take appropriate precautions to prevent property damage. The handler/owner will be required to pay for any da mages caused by the animal. Being Responsible for Waste: Cleaning up after the animal is the sole responsibility of the handler/owner and it must be done immediately . Waste must be bagged and discarded in designated outdoor receptacles. No waste may be flushed down toilets or discarded in interior waste bins. In the event that the handler/owner is not physically able to clean up after the animal, it is then the responsibility of the handler/owner to hire someone capable of cleaning up after the animal. Leash Requirements: Service animals should be on a leash at all times, unless the handler is unable to use a leash due to a disability or the use of the leash would interfere with the animal's Student Affairs 148 ability to perform its duties. In that case, the handler must be able to control t he service animal by other effective means such as voice controls or signals. ESAs must be on a leash or in a crate or carrier at all times. Observing Good Animal Etiquette: To the greatest extent possible, the handler/owner should ensure that the animal does not display behaviors or make noises that are disruptive or frightening to others, unless it is part of the service being provided to the handler (e.g., barking to alert the handler of danger). The animal must possess friendly and sociable characte ristics. Limitations on Liability: The College is not responsible for the loss, damage to, or death of a service or emotional support animal. Other Conditions and Restrictions: In response to a particular situation, the College reserves the right to im pose other reasonable conditions or restrictions on the use of service animals and ESAs as necessary to ensure the health, safety, and reasonable enjoyment of College programs and activities by others. Conflicting Disabilities Mercy College is aware that persons at the College may have a condition or disability that may precipitate an allergic reaction to the service animal or ESA. Persons who have asthma/allergy/medical issues because of the animal should take their concerns to the Office of Accessibilit y Services. Action will be taken to consider the needs of both persons to resolve the problem as efficiently and effectively as possible. Grievance Procedures If the decision is made to deny a request for or remove an animal covered by this policy, the affected individual may file a formal written grievance with the Office of Accessibility Services. Reasonable Modifications to this Policy Individuals wishing to request a modification or exception to this policy as a reasonable accommodation should contact the Office of Accessibility Services. Policy Questions Questions or concerns related to this policy should be addressed to the following: Office of Accessibility Services 2221 Madison Fax: 419 -251 -1746 Requesting Accommodation for an Emotional Support Animal A student requesting the assistance of an emotional support animal must first provide verification to the Office of Accessibility Services that she or he has a qualifying disability and that the animal is needed to fully participate in the College's educat ional programs and activities. The student's health care provider, who is familiar with the professional literature concerning the assistive Student Affairs 149 and/or therapeutic benefits of assistance animals for people with disabilities, must submit a signed letter on pro fessional letterhead, expressing the following: 1. A current diagnostic statement that identifies the student's disability, including date of initial and most current diagnosis, any evaluations/testing that support the diagnosis, and a description of the func tional limitation of the disability; 2. The provider's opinion that the condition qualifies as a disability under federal law, including the major life activities which are substantially limited by the disability; 3. Any additional rationale or statement the College may reasonably need to understand the basis for the professional opinion; 4. The provider must give her/his professional opinion of how the student's documented disability relates to the necessity of the animal's presence on campus; and 5. The provider's d escription of the relationship between the disability and the relief the animal provides. Examples of a \"healthcare provider\" may be a therapist/counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, primary care doctor, or nurse . However, other healthcare providers may be qualified to provide documentation for the student's disability and need for an emotional support animal. In addition to the above documentation from a healthcare provider, the student must provide the following documentation before approval will be granted to utilize an ESA on campus: 1. Record of License & Registration in Toledo, OH or Youngstown, OH (for canines only) 2. Record of up -to-date Vaccinations 3. Record of current Veterinarian Clean Bill of Health 4. Signed Form 505A - Statement of Ackn owledgement of the Emotional Support/Service Animal/Pet Policy 5. Completed form of Identification of Emotional Support and Service Animal and Emergency Contact/Alternate Caregiver of Animal 6.

Contact information is as follows: Attention: Director of Accessibility Services 2221 Madison Phone: The Office of Accessibility Services will review documentation and, if determined that a qualifying disability exists, the Director of Accessibility Services shall meet with the student requesting approval for the ESA . This policy will be carefully reviewed with the student at that time and an interactive dialogue will take place to determine whether or not the animal is a reasonable accommodation, considering alternative accommodations and the impact of the animal on campus. Student Affairs 150 The Director of Accessibility Services reserves the right to request additional clinical information from the professio nal who provided the initial letter of recommendation for the emotional support animal. If the accommodation of an emotional support animal cannot be granted, the College will make every reasonable effort to find ways to assist the student in her/his acad emic progress. All questions and inquiries should be directed to the Mercy College Office of Accessib ility Services at 419 -251 -1784.

COMMUNICABLE DISEASE /PANDEMIC POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, June 2020 In order to promote a safe and healthy learning environment, Mercy College (the \"College\") administration has adopted this policy to mitigate the spread or outbreak of communicable diseases. This policy will be interpre ted and administered in order to protect the health and well - being of the College community. Student Affairs 154 This policy applies to Mercy College administration, faculty, staff, students, visitors and other parties such as vendors and affiliates. This policy applies to all communicable diseases as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and local county health departments. According to the CDC, communicable diseases are diseases that can be transm itted and make people ill, caused by infective agents (such as, bacteria and viruses), which invade the body and multiply or release toxins to cause damage to normal body cells and their functions. These infective agents can spread from a source of infecti on (e.g. patients, sick animals) to a person through various routes of transmission such as air, object, or through casual contact . As of the date of this policy, the CDC has identified the following common communicable diseases: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Diphtheria Meningococcal infections Mumps Rubella Cytomegalovirus infections Tuberculosis Viral such as COVID -19 Varicella Pertussis (whooping cough) Streptococcal infection Zoster Enteroviral infect ions Other communicable diseases are applicable to this policy as periodically identified by the CDC, the ODH and local county health departments. Possible actions during a communicable disease outbreak: It is the intent of the College to comply with all a pplicable federal and state laws in connection with an individual who contracts a communicable disease. Students, employees and visitors are encouraged to immediately report information related to the potential occurrence of a communicable disease within t he College community. In the event of a known or potential communicable disease in the College community, the College will review and monitor the situation on a case -by-case basis and work with local, state and federal authorities, as necessary, to determi ne the appropriate course of action.

CLINICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS CLINICAL COMPLIANCE POLICY Policy approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, March 2020 Mercy College of Ohio (\"the College\") is committed to the health, safety, and well- being of all patients cared for by its students, as well as the health, safety, and well -being of the students who participate in its programs and represent the College in clinical agencies. On January 1, 2004, the Joint Commission updated regulations for hospitals, home health agencies, clinics, and other healthcare providers to gain or maintain accreditation status. One of the regulations requires all persons working at the facility - including employees, volunteers, and students - to have a criminal background check. Other requirements such as drug screens, verification of immunization s/titers/testing/health history and Basic Life Support (BLS) certification may be necessary pursuant to agreements with a clinical agency. Guidelines for required immunizations/titers and tuberculosis (TB) screenings, as recommended by the Centers for Dise ase Control (CDC), are for the safety of patients, students, faculty, staff, and the public. This policy applies to all College students who participate in clinical/practicum/field experiences with an affiliated clinical agency (\"Clinical Agency\"). To meet Joint Commission or other Clinical Agency requirements, the College requires all students entering a College program which includes a clinical component, practicum, or field experience (hereinafter referred to as \"College Health Program\") to undergo a cri minal background check and drug screen. Students in College Health Programs must also provide verification of required immunizations/titers/testing/health history and BLS certification as outlined in Appendix A. The results of a background check and drug screen, as well as the ability to provide documentation of immunizations/titers/testing/health history and/or BLS certification, can impact a student's ability to participate in a College Health Program, and/or become licensed, credentialed or employed in a particular state. It is the responsibility of all students to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with College requirements for maintaining an environment free from threat to person, property, efficiency or Academic Affairs 177 reputation because of illegal use, sale, transfer, or possess ion of alcohol or dangerous drugs as defined by Section 2925.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and United States Code 21, Section 811 and 844. Students must also abide by the College's Drug and Alcohol Abuse/Prevention Policy. Affiliation agreements between a C linical Agency and the College outline legal/contractual requirements, including criminal background check, drug screen, and verification of Health History and/or BLS certification. I. Required Background Check, Drug Screen, Immunizations/Titers/Testing/He alth History and Basic Life Support (BLS) Verification All students who have been accepted into a designated College Health Program are required to successfully complete a criminal background check (including fingerprint screen) and drug screen through the vendor designated by the Office of Compliance and Risk Management (\"Vendor\") and submit satisfactory immunizations/titers/testing/health history verification from a medical provider (collectively, the \"Health Program Assessments\"). Previously conducted cr iminal background checks, drug screens, and/or immunizations/titers/testing/health history verifications unrelated to the College Health Program are not acceptable for purposes of this policy. The College Health Programs also abide by the requirements of each specific Clinical Agency, which periodically may require updated Health Program Assessments. Students may not be permitted to participate in their designated program if: a) the criminal background check includes findings of the following: any felony or misdemeanor criminal convictions, arrests, charges, pending charges or probation/diversion (not including minor traffic violations), b) confirmed positive drug screen results, c) the immunizations/titers/testing/health history and/or BLS requirements a re not satisfactorily met. New Students Students are responsible for the costs and activities associated with meeting all clinical requirements and completing the Health Program Assessment process. Students retain access to their account information after graduating from the College Health Program. Students Who Have Failed a Course Students who have failed a course will not be required to order a new Vendor account if : They have been continuously enrolled at the College (an official Leave of Absence is not considered continuous enrollment). However , Students may be required by the Clinical Agency to complete updated Health Program Assessments. Students Who Have Been Absent from the Health Program but Return Within Three Semesters Students re -entering a health program within three semesters will not be required to order a new Vendor account but must ensure compliance prior to returning to classes and clinical participation. Students whose vendor accounts have been archived should contact the vendor or Clinica l Compliance Coordinator to have the account unarchived. Any incomplete or overdue requirements must be completed. Academic Affairs 178 Students may be required to complete updated Health Program Assessments (communicated by program administrator). Students Returning After an Absence of Less than Three Semesters Students re -entering a College Health Program after an absence of less than three semesters will not be required to order a new Vendor account if : They have been continuously enrolled at the College (an official Leave o f Absence is not considered continuous enrollment); Original Health Program Assessments were all completed less than one year earlier; Students Returning After Three Semesters Students who return to a College Health Program after three semesters are requir ed to order a new Vendor account to meet all current requirements, including completion of new Health Program Assessments. Students Who Withdraw and/or Change Programs Students who begin a College Health Program and subsequently withdraw may be allowed to transfer their Vendor account upon acceptance into the new College Health Program if : Original Health Program Assessments were all completed less than one year earlier; II. Drug Screens It is the policy of the College to prohibit the purchase, possession, use or abuse, sale, distribution, or manufacture of any controlled substance on campus, on any College property, or on the premises of student's clinical assignment. Students are responsible for complying with the College's Drug and Alcohol Abuse/Prevention Policy ; failure to comply with the policy may result in immediate dismissal. The College recognizes chemical dependency as a major health problem and as a health, safety, and security concern. As part of a prevention program, all incoming students are required to participate in substance abuse training during orientation and again annually in an online training module. Readmission after Dismissal due to a Positive Drug Screen If a stude nt is dismissed from the College after a positive drug screen, the student may apply for readmission to the College according to the readmission guidelines outlined in the College Catalog. If readmitted, the student must agree to random drug testing. Stu dents who wish to be readmitted to the College must comply with all program changes and catalog revisions at the time readmission is requested. An additional positive drug screen will result in dismissal from the College with no opportunity for readmission. III. Additional Health Program Assessments In most circumstances, Health Program Assessments are only performed after a student has been accepted into a College Health Program (or is ready to begin the clinical/practicum/field experience portion of thei r program). However, some Clinical Agencies require current results from the student prior to clinical placement at that site. Academic Affairs 179 The cost of any additional testing, updated criminal background checks or medical visits is the responsibility of the student. Criminal background check and drug screen must be coordinated through the contracted Vendor. Reasonable Suspicion Drug Screening Students who are performing in a clinical setting in an unsafe manner, and/or whose behaviors are suspect, may be subject to an assessment by a healthcare provider and may be asked to submit to an immediate drug screening. For purposes of this policy an assessment may include, but is not limited to, a drug/alcohol screen, medical or mental assessment, and/or rehabilitation. Actio n and/or pattern of behaviors that may warrant an assessment include, but are not limited to, the following: Sudden changes in work performance; Violation of safety policies; Repeatedly not Incoherent communication or inexplicable behavior; Possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia; Observation of drug use; A report of drug use provided by a reliable and credible source; or A self -report of a drug -related arrest, charge, or conviction. IV. Student Duty to Self -Report Students are asked on their application for admission to indicate whether they have been convicted of child or dependent adult abuse; whether they have been convicted of a crime in this state or any other; whether they are currently incarcerated; or if they have been excluded from or served with notice of exclusion from any governmental programs, i.e. Medicare, Med icaid, financial aid, student loan default. Students are then asked to explain any \"yes\" answers. Students are informed during the admission process that a past felony or misdemeanor may disqualify them from entering a Clinical Agency setting, testing for licensure, or being hired by potential employers in a healthcare profession. It is the responsibility of the student to check with the program administrator, the licensing/credentialing organization and/or state prior to application into the College Health Program. Failure to disclose or providing material misrepresentation of information to any application question, including questions about any criminal conviction, arrest, charge, pending charge or probation/diversion, may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the College. Academic Affairs 180 Students currently enrolled in a College Health Program have an ongoing duty to report any arrests, charges, or convictions that occur after they are enrolled in the College Health Program. The student must n otify the program administrator of the College Health Program in which he/she is enrolled as soon as is reasonably possible - and no later than five (5) calendar days (in accordance with the Drug and Alcohol Abuse/Prevention Policy ) - after the incident oc curs. V. Immunizations/Titers/Testing/Health History and/or BLS Certification Students must complete all required immunizations/titers, including TB testing, as outlined in program clinical requirements found in Appendix A, and complete and submit a satisf actory Health Screening form from a qualified medical provider. Students must provide documentation of immunizations/titers/TB testing/health history, and/or BLS certification in their accounts with the College's designated third -party Vendor. VI. Requests fo r waiver/exemption/extension Student may request a waiver/exemption or extension for immunization requirements with the Clinical Compliance Coordinator. Even if a waiver/exemption or extension request is received by the Clinical Compliance Coordinator, cli nical placement is not guaranteed. Approval of such requests is subject to each clinical site's policies and/or guidelines established in the Clinical Agency Agreement. VII. Placement at Clinical Agencies Acceptance into a College Health Program despite negative information on a background check or drug screen, or submission of a waiver/exemption from a required immunization does not guarantee placement at a Clinical Agency. For a student already placed at a Clinical Agency site, subsequent criminal histor y may result in the Clinical Agency prohibiting the student from continuing in the clinical experience. If a student is unable to participate in a clinical experience as required for a program of study, student will not be able to progress and will be dis missed from the College Health Program in which student is enrolled. When a student who has negative information on a criminal background check self -reports subsequent criminal history and attempts to be placed at a specific Clinical Agency site or wishes to continue at student's current site, the appropriate personnel at the Clinical Agency site evaluate the information and surrounding circumstances. Clinical Agency site personnel have sole discretion to determine whether the student can participate in a c linical experience at the Clinical Agency site or continue with the current placement. The College makes no final decisions regarding student acceptability for a Clinical Agency site or the ability of the student to continue with a current placement based on the results of a criminal background check or in a self- report of new criminal activity as required above. College faculty and staff will not provide advice on a student's ability to obtain licensure, credentialing or employment notwithstanding an adve rse criminal background check, and students should not rely on any general information provided by College personnel in that regard. It is the responsibility of students to check with the licensing/credentialing board and/or state in which they want to practice to determine if they are able to sit for exams; however, some states may not advise about the inability of students to sit for exams until the students are prepared to do so. Academic Affairs 181 Failure to provide documentation of required immunizations/titers, testing , health history and/or BLS certification may prevent Clinical Agency site placement, which may prevent College Health Program progression or completion. VIII. Sharing Information Concerning Health Program Assessments Information concerning Health Program Assessments is initially shared with the student and appropriate College personnel. College Health Program administrators or designees are responsible for monitoring students' accounts. Findings may require further action, and students will be notified o f such by the program administrator and/or the Vendor. Students are responsible for monitoring their account for such notifications. In order to share information concerning Health Program Assessments with Clinical Agencies, students must sign 530 -A Stude nt Consent . Without confirmation all Health Program Assessments and clinical requirements were obtained, and results are acceptable to the assigned Clinical Agency, placement in a clinical setting is unlikely. Non -placement will result in dismissal from the College Health Program. Confidentiality Results of a student's Health Program Assessments are not kept as part of the student's educational file. The results are protected on the Vendor's website and are accessible only by the student, the Vendor, and authorized College personnel as long as the College is contracted with the Vendor. Students have access to their online records with the Vendor while they are enrolled and post - graduation, even if the College is no longer contracted with t he Vendor. All ancillary materials collected from the students regarding review of criminal background checks or drug screen investigations will be maintained as confidential and stored in a secure fashion by the Office of the Clinical Compliance Coordinat or. The procedures associated with the Clinical Compliance policy are as follows. Required Background Checks, Drug Screens, and Health History 1. The Clinical Compliance Coordinator establishes instructions for ordering Vendor accounts and communicates the du e date for each College Health Program. Instructions for completing the background check and drug screen are provided by the Vendor. Students are responsible for ordering an online account, scheduling, and completing the Health Program Assessments in a t imely fashion, so results can be returned to the Vendor or College prior to the due date established by the College Health Program. Students will not be permitted to participate in their designated College Health Program if they have not cleared the backg round check and drug screen and satisfactorily completed the Health History verification by the College Health Program's due date, unless an extension is granted by the program administrator, i.e., in the instance of late admittance to the College Health P rogram. 2. Background check and drug screen results are returned directly to the student's account, where they are available to both the student and authorized College personnel. Health History verifications are uploaded by the student into their online accou nt. Additional documents related to background check findings, positive drug screens, reasonable suspicion drug test results, etc. will be uploaded by the clinical coordinator or program administrator to the administrator portal of the student account. Academic Affairs 182 3. Students aware of findings which may show up on the background check or drug screen should be prepared to discuss with his/her program administrator whether findings may impact participation in clinical rotation, licensing or credentialing. Findings on Criminal Background Checks 1. Students disputing background check results must contact the Vendor to initiate an investigation. Status of the dispute will be communicated to the program administrator. 2. Findings on a student's background check require the followi ng actions: a. If student has findings on the BCI&I (Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation) or the Background Check Summary Report: i. Student may be asked to request additional official documents. ii. Student may be asked to provide detailed, leg ibly written (or typed) explanation of the recorded information. iii. Student must schedule a face -to-face meeting with the program administrator (a student enrolled only in distance education classes can participate in a conference call with the program admini strator). b.

Student must prepare a detailed, legibly written (or typed) explanation of the recorded information. ii. Student must schedule a face -to-face meeting with the program administrator (a student enrolled only in distance education classes can participate in a conference call with the program administrator) 3. At the face -to-face meetin g or conference call, the program administrator reviews the information to assess whether the findings will potentially affect clinical placement or licensure/credentialing. The information will be reviewed, and a final decision rendered based on the foll owing: Seriousness, circumstances, and frequency of the offense(s); The relationship between the duties to be performed as part of the College Health Program and the offense(s); The length of time that has passed since the offense(s); Evidence of successfu l rehabilitation; The accuracy of the information provided by the student; and The guidelines established by the clinical affiliation agreement. The program administrator: 1. Reviews RAP sheet with the student, student's written explanation of the events, and any other documentation provided by the student, such as police reports, certified court records, and other information that is pertinent to the case. 2. Program administrator and student complete and sign 530 -D Criminal Background Findings . i. If there are no issues that will affect the student's Clinical Agency placement, as determined by the program administrator and/or Dean: 1. Student signs 530 -F Student Waiver - Criminal Background/Drug Screen to continue the clinical experience. 2. Program administra tor uploads the signed 530 -F Student Waiver - Criminal Background/Drug Screen , completed 530 -D Criminal Background Findings , and student's detailed written explanation to the student's Vendor account. Academic Affairs 183 ii. If the issue(s) would affect the student's Clinical Age ncy placement and/or constitute an automatic bar from licensure or credentialing, according to the Ohio Board of Nursing: 1. Based on an assessment of all information available, program administrator and/or Dean advises the student that he/she WILL NOT be allowed to continue with the clinical experience. 2. Program administrator and student complete and sign 530 -D Criminal Background Findings . 3. Program administrator uploads the completed 530 -D Criminal Background Findings , student's detailed written explanation an d any other documentation provided by the student to the student's Vendor account. 4.

A written decision will be provided to the student within five (5) days of the appeal submission. The decision of the VPAA is final and not subject to appeal. 5. If a student has signed a waiver to continue in the College Health Program but a finding is found from a subsequent report received after the waiver was signed: a. Program administrator determines whether there is new information that affects the student's clinical placement. b. If the new finding appears on the FBI/BCI results, the student must provide additional documentation if requested. c. If new findings are the same as that which was previously discussed with the student: i. Program administrator communicates this with the student. ii. Program administrator provides an electronic notation in student's Vendor account stating that the findings are the same and that no further action is required. iii. Program administrator uploads any new documentation to student's Vendor account. d. If the findings are different from the previously reviewed charges: i. The process outlined previously in Findings on Criminal Background Checks should be repeated. IX. Drug Screens 1. The Vendor conducts a 10 -panel drug screen checking for are returned as \"dilute negative\" or \"dilute positive,\" the student will be told that he/she must order a new drug screen and provide another sample. Results of the second test are considered final. If student declines to take a required retest because of a dilute specimen, the action will be considered a \"refusal to be tested\" and treated the same as a confirmed and positive result. 3. The program administrator monitors student accounts for drug screen finding alerts. 4. All positive test results are automatically sent to the Medical Review Officer (MRO) contracted by the Vendor. a. If the student tests positive for a drug for which there could be a legitimate prescription, the MRO contacts the student for that prescription and validates the information. If prescription information is validated, the MRO will update the test results to show a negative drug screen. Academic Affairs 184 b. If prescription information cannot be validated, the drug test results will show a positive drug screen. c. If the MRO is unable to reach the student, a notation will be made on the student's drug screen and notification will be sent to the program administrator. i. The program administrator emails the student and advises that the MRO must be provided with any additional prescription information immediately. If the drug screen results remain unchanged after seven days, the drug screen test results will be considered positive. ii. If the results are changed to a negative drug screen, no additional action is required. iii. If results are changed to a verified positive drug screen, the program administrator: 1. Notifies the student of the positive drug screen and sets up a face- to- face meeting (or conference call for online students). a. The drug screen results and the rules set forth by the specific College Health Program's accrediting or credentialing agency determine whether there are immediate consequen ces. b. The student is informed he/she has the right to initiate a formal dispute of the findings (as outlined in the following section Disputing Drug Screen Finding). c. Student signs 530 -E Drug Screen Findings . d. Program administrator consults with the Dean, VPA A, and Vice President Student Affairs/Dean of Students (\"VPSA\") to determine additional steps for student. e. If allowed to continue, 530 -F Student Waiver - Criminal Background/Drug Screen must be signed. i. Permission to continue in the College Health Program does not guarantee participation in required clinical experiences or licensure in certain states. ii. If the student is currently attending classes: 1. Student will be suspended from participating in the clinical experience until the drug screen is fully reviewed by the program administrator, VPAA, and VPSA. 2. Student may be allowed to continue attending class instruction until the drug screen issue is resolved. f. Disciplinary action according to the College's Drug and Alcohol Abuse/Prevention Policy and Progr am will be determined by the VPSA/Dean of Students. 2.

Program administrator uploads all documentation and completed forms to student's Vendor account. Disputing Drug Screen Findings Students wishing to dispute the drug screen results must initiate a formal dispute within five (5) business days of notification by the program administrator. Student must contact program administrator to initiate a re -test of the original specimen. The drug screen re- test package code will be provided to the student by the program administrator or by the Vendor. Cost of the new Academic Affairs 185 drug screen package is paid by the stu dent. Vendor will coordinate testing of the same specimen sample at a different lab. If the result is overturned, the Vendor will refund the cost of the new drug screen package to the student. X. Additional Required Background Checks and Drug Screens Rea sonable Suspicion If a faculty or staff member at the College feels that a \"reasonable suspicion\" drug/alcohol screen is required consistent with College policy, the faculty or staff member should: a. Contact the program administrator, Program Director, Dean and/or (in the event of occurrence at a clinical site) another medical healthcare professional to observe the student. b.

FAMILY EDUCATION RIG HTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) Approved by Mercy College Board of Trustees, March 2018, Technical Revision, April 2018 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is a federal p rivacy law affording students certain rights related to the release of and access to their education records . The Office of Student Records ensures compliance with FERPA at Mercy College of Ohio (\"the College\"), and this office should be contacted with an y questions or concerns about this policy, including any questions about FERPA rights or to request clarification or further information: Office of Student Records, 419 -251 -8989, registrar@mercycollege.edu The purpose of this policy is t o ensure the privacy and protection of student files. FERPA applies to enrolled students, not students who have applied but never enrolled . All College employees are responsible for knowing and abiding by this policy. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records . The definition of \"education records\" is any record maintained by the College that is directly related to a student and includes, but is not limited to, grades, transcripts, an d disciplinary files. Education records can exist Academic Affairs 190 in any medium, including hardcopy, typed, or electronic. However, there are some exclusions from the definition of education records, including: 1. Records kept in the sole possession of the maker, that are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record; 2. Records of the College's law enforcement unit that are created by it for law enforcement purposes and maintained by it; 3. Records relating to an individual who is employed by the College (except if the individual is a student employed as a result of his or her status as a student) that are made and maintained in the normal course of business, relate exclusiv ely to the individual in that individual's capacity as an employee and are not available for any other purpose; 4. Records on a student 18 years of age or older made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in his or her professional capacity or assisting in a paraprofessional capacity so long as the records are made, maintained or used only in connection with treatment of the student and are disclosed only to individuals providing tre atment; 5. Records created or received by the College after the student is no longer in attendance and are not directly related to the individual's attendance as a student. Beginning with the first day of the student's first term at the College, students have the following rights under FERPA: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the date the College receives a request for access . A student should submit to the Office of Student Records, a written request that ident ifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect . The College's Office of Student Records will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The College reserves the right to have a school o fficial present during a student's review of his/her education records . The right of inspection and review includes the right to access and an explanation of the record. It does not include the right to a copy of the education record except in limited circumstances when failure to provide a copy would effectively prevent the student from inspecting and reviewing the record (e.g., the student lives outside of a reasonable commuting distance from the College) . Students have the right to inspect their educa tion records regardless of their financial status with the College. However, the College is not required to release an official transcript if the student has a past due account . If the College official to whom the request was submitted does not maintain the records, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed . At the postsecondary level, parents have no inherent rights to inspect or review their son or daughter's education records . This right is limited solely to the student . A student's education records may be released to parents only if they have been given a written release by the student or if an exception to FERPA's general rule against nonconsensual disclosure applies (such as in the case of a health and safety emergency or in order to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena) . This right of inspection and access does not extend to the financial records of a student's parents . Also, certain restrictions apply to Academic Affairs 191 a student's access to confi dential letters and confidential statements of recommendation placed in a student's education records. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of t he student's privacy rights under FERPA . A student who wishes to ask the College to amend a record should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should b e changed . If the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment . Students are permitted to include explanatory comments with the record(s) they believe should have been amended, but the College decided not to modify . Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing . Requesting an amen dment to an education record is not the proper avenue for challenging course grades . Students challenging a grade must complete Form 510 -C Application for Academic Appeal located in the College's Office of Student Records. 3. The right to provide written con sent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent . The College discloses education records without a student's prior written co nsent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosures without consent . See 34 CFR \u00a7 99.31. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in pe rforming his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the College. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA . The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S W Washington, DC 20202 -5901 Public Notification of Directory Information At its discretion, the College may provide \"directory information\" in accordance with FERPA .

Designated directory information at the College includes the following: student's name address telephone listing electronic mail address photographs date and place of birth field(s) of study dates of attendance class enrollment status (e.g. undergraduate or graduate, full- time or part -time) degrees, honors, and awards received participation in officially recognized activities and sports the most recent educational agency or institution attended. Students may block public disclosure of directory information (all or in part) by notifying the Office of Student Records in writing by using Form 510 -B Request to Opt Out of Directory Information. Students should carefully consider the consequences of a decision to withhold directory information . For example, the names of students who have restricted their directory information will not appear in the commencement program or other College publications. Also, employers, potential employers, credit card companies, loan agencies, scholarship committees, and the like will be informed that the College has no information available about the student's attendance at the College if these entities were to request directory information that has been restricted. A non - disclosure block will prevent the College from releasing any or all \"directory information;\" thus, any further requests for such information from non -institution al persons or organizations will be refused. The College will honor requests to withhold directory information but cannot assume responsibility to contact students for subsequent permission to release this information . Regardless of the effects, the Colle ge assumes no liability as a result of honoring students' instructions that such information be withheld. Although the initial request may be filed at any time, requests for non -disclosure will be honored by the College until removed, in writing, by the st udent . Please note: a student cannot opt out of the disclosure of his/her name or email address in the classroom environment. As a private institution, the College is not governed by the Ohio statutes that allow release of additional types of information to employees, employers , and applicants.
