During my time there, I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Roman, whose teachings were nothing short of extraordinary. Not only was he a profound and knowledgeable guide, but he also exhibited an unwavering commitment to our growth and understanding. Each day spent with Roman was an enriching journey into the depths of plant medicine and its historical significance. He captivated us with his profound insights and expertise, leaving us in awe of the wisdom that he generously shared. It was evident that Roman poured his heart and soul into each interaction, as he dedicated himself to providing us with a comprehensive understanding of the purpose behind everything we did. The way Roman approached our time together went beyond conventional teaching methods; he infused every moment with a sense of passion and authenticity. His dedication and consistency created a safe and nurturing space for all of us to explore, question, and absorb the knowledge he shared. Whether we were delving into the intricate healing properties of various plant medicines or unraveling the spiritual significance of our practices, Roman's patient guidance and willingness to address our inquiries were invaluable. His teachings transcended the boundaries of traditional learning, touching our hearts and minds in ways that brought about profound personal growth and transformation. This indescribable experience has left an enduring mark on my journey of self-discovery and conscious living. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to learn from such a remarkable teacher and to be part of a community dedicated to the exploration of ancient wisdom and holistic well-being.

I have hoped for many years that West Marin could offer affordable wellness classes to our local community. I'm a wellness professional and on my salary having a wellness class can be challenging to fit into my budget. Trishna is a wonderful, kind instructor and has a depth of knowledge that many younger instructors have not acquired yet. \" \"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Doron Yoga! We did the personal stay for 6 nights. Morning yoga was such a beautiful ritual and Mahadevi is a wonderful teacher. We stayed in a private room with a private bathroom which was clean and comfortable, with a lovely little hammock out front. Meals were shared amongst the other guests and staff which created a communal atmosphere. Tzununa is a peaceful little town which made for a perfect home base, and it was easy to explore the more \"happening\" nearby lake towns by public boat. Great people, absolutely stunning location, overall peaceful and restful and overall wonderful!\" \"Janel was wonderful throughout the whole experience. Not only can she make the most amazing vegan food, she was also a great spiritual leader she was very loving and kind. She helped me get through some deep emotional things that I needed to release through breath-work. She had a bright sunny attitude that was fun to wake up to as she handed us our morning smoothie she had just whipped up for 18 people. She also made the cacao for the cacao ceremony before our breath-work each day. She was a joy!\" \"I was able to take part in the online Primordial Breathwork workshop in March, I believe. I loved the first session that was dedicated to the history of the Indigenous people of the Amazon and the origin story from which this breathing practice originated from. The rest of the days I got to experience parts of myself I hadn't realized before, both physically and energetically. I recommend people try this breathing technique because it helped me unblock a lot of stagnant energy that had built up in my heart center due to a breakup and amplified anxiety. I felt lighter. Although there were days I didn't want to do it either because I was tired or something that day had irritated me, I was still appreciative of the group for motivating me to continue. I believe when we practice wellness techniques on a daily, especially when we do not feel like doing so, we get that much closer to the best version of ourself. \" \"Love the programs at the Paititi Institute. They are a great and all encompassing when it comes to a physical, mental and spiritual approach to understandig self-treatment. The are interesting and very important practices for keeping a sustainable connection to our lives and breath.\" \"Roman is always open to speaking to me about everything I need to go through. No matter how deep in the shadows I find myself, he is always willing to light up that lamp. Sometimes he prefers to do some of the more intense dark situations in private, away from an open public form. I feel that books should be open for anybody to read. But the lessons of where to keep things to myself are still appreciated. It helps me develop myself and find appropriate times to open up a trauma I noticed is a part of all of society, but is deeply hidden. It's easier for me to see the trauma than it is for me to see that a group of people may not be ready to face that trauma. But Roman helps fill that missing part for me.\" \"I have been working with the paititi institute for a long time. They have always been extremely supportive. Even with some of the extreme situations and expansions I find myself into. And these classes at the paititi institute help me get through these challenges with grace. The breath work helps prime my body mind and spirit to be able to handle the roughest parts of my job as a therapist. To accept all treatments necessary. All because the paititi institute accepts all the treatment I would need to do to handle myself in such situations. They lead by great example.\" \"I just finished a 10 day Embodying True Nature retreat in the Sacred Valley feeling refresh, the experience was more than I expected, Roman is a living library of indigenous wisdom, he combines teachings from the Amazon to the Himalayas, this in combination with the Qigong, Breath-work and Plant medicine, its an intensive work in a short period of time, I recommend this retreat to everyone looking for authentic teachers, profound healing and deep breakthroughs, I will definitely come back!\" \"The 10 Day Intensive with Paititi is an amazing experience to dive deep into the Amazonian and Andean Cosmology traditions and how they apply now and how to work with them in your daily life to bring more awareness and consciousness to all situations. A very good framework for powerful personal transformation. \" \"I have been working with Paititi Institute for almost 10 years now and went through a distance healing program, that included 1,5 years of dream work and diet program, quite a few short transformational retreats in the US and 2 2-weeks long retreats in Peru. I can say that my experience with the Paititi Institute has been both healing and transformational. I originally came to Roman and Cynthia with the agenda to heal my rheumatoid arthritis and after my distance healing program and a few retreats I was symptoms free for 4-5 years. 2 years ago I came to Peru for a 2 week retreat because my symptoms came back and that helped a lot. Once again I came this year for another healing and during this retreat I felt so much better. The high frequency of being that is cultivated and continually kept during the retreat among all participants, the diet, the medicine plants, dream work, breath work, sharing circles and discussions - all that changes the state of being, allows participants to work through the traumas and conditioning that sometimes are carried from childhood and even earlier and cause disease, behavioral patterns and coping mechanisms that prevent us from living to the fullest potential, in loving kindness with compassion to others. All that is being worked on in a safe and supportive environment, created by the team and retreat participants. Roman takes individual approach to each participant, including attention to their health or phycological issues, spiritual search, diet, and plant medicine offerings choices. During this retreat, in addition to all the group activities and ceremonies, I was offered a Chric Sanango plant dieta, acupuncture, special diet and deep dream work to find causing issues and help heal my health condition. I have to say that Chiric Sanango dieta has been an amazing experience, which, in addition to targeting my arthritis, brought me to a profound state of the open heart. It has been a week after retreat now and integration has started, where higher state of being, cultivated during the retreat, starts to wear off, but I can still get the the same profound state of the love and open heart that I felt during the dieta and the remaining of the retreat after the dieta. This is something I have never experienced before and extremely grateful to Roman for this gift of love. After the end of the retreat I continue the restrictive diet required by Chric Sanango initiation and continue to work on my healing path. Thank you, Paititi Institute, for the work that you do. It is saving the traditions of living wisdom and healing bodies and hearts of everyone who comes in contact with you and those, who comes with contact with us! \" \"Roman, I appreciate so much the work you do, the time and effort put into collecting all the information and ancestral wisdom you have been sharing with us. Thank you for your patience, kindness, your compassion and healings. We will be coming back to your retreats many times more. The way we feel after sitting with you for 16 days is so inspiring, so open hearted. We totally love it - thank you! \" \"I am so grateful to Roman and the Paititi Institute for offering this amazing training. I could feel the release and clearing of the energy centers in my body. This is a very unique training that encompasses a blending of the elemental aspects of Qi- in Chinese and Daoist traditions. Very powerful and informative and healing instruction!\" \"I don't know Cynthia yet, but it will happen soon. I think that this is a very brave and fearless girl with a huge loving heart, which she gave to Roman, gave birth to two sons !!!! I just admire such women !!!! I think they were lucky with each other\" \"...... When I met Roman the first time I \"saw\": ..... We live in such a happy time when the world and humanity are open to all knowledge .... \"- and after a few seconds - Roman said this phrase out loud now I heard it ... then it continued the same way: I saw what he wants to say before he uttered ... And I thought: - why is he moving his lips, because I already understand everything, what does he want to say .... telepathy .... this happened to me for the first time, but it hasn't happened again yet ..... this is the story. And then he was not only a reliable guide, but also a good, honest man and friend. I trust Roman. And I want to go to a meeting with Mother Nature and spirits and to the sacred ayahuazka only under the supervision of Roman.\" \"What do I know about the Paititi Institute? I knew it was Roman's creation. I always put when scrolling through the FB. I didn't always read everything, because my English is not very good. But I was always happy for Roman that his brainchild lives and works for people. So I'm going to Peru. Tickets are bought, I got vaccinated. And I'm a little scared? How will it be there? What if something dangerous happens? and there were many questions that became nightmares.......and I began to carefully read all the recommendations from the Paititi Institute. And I found the answers to all my questions. And even phone numbers who to call if that. And even the phone number of taxi drivers ... All recommendations are made very professionally and competently as with legal, medical and human factors. This is a good job for Cynthia and Roman. Bravo guys! That's all I can say about Patiti Institute for now. To be continued....\" \"The QiGong series led by Roman allows Energy movement, and relation to all beings through Roman's Gentle Wisdom. Paititi is a Blessing to the Earth\" \"Roman and his team are the real deal. There's a lot of \"spiritual\" retreats out there, but those seeking to learn true wisdom will find Paititi to be refreshing nectar for their thirsty soul. These methods, crafted over thousands of years, just work. But don't take my word for it - come and see for yourself.\" \"The synthesis of buddhism, plant medicine (ayahuasca & Wachuma/San Pedro), breathwork, and dream work is a very powerful, balanced and insightful combination. That, combined with the honest, loving and grounded guidance of Roman Hanis makes for a very rich and beneficial experience. The way he holds and serves ayahuasca feels honoring and correct, especially in these commercialized times where people may not know how to tell a shaman with integrity, wisdom and compassion from a shaman using Black magic and wanting to make a quick buck off their ignorance. Roman is the real deal. He's all about mind training, love and compassion, and living the teachings. He is more concerned about your long term benefit, and what is in the highest for all beings. Paititi is a humble and powerful place to connect with your self and nature. If you are serious about growth and moving gently and steadily on your path to enlightenment, this is the retreat for you. It rocked my world and I feel more loving, compassionate and patient with myself, my son and my partner. And that's what spiritual growth is really all about! I will be digesting and integrating my experience from this recent 33 day retreat for years to come. I feel very cleansed, purified and strengthened by my experience. It was an essential rite of passage for me and my life. So grateful. I pray that Paititi continues to thrive and serve the people of this world. It is such beautiful and supportive ancient wisdom so needed in these times. Blessings, Theo\" \"I have been doing retreats with Paititi Institute since 2012 and the teachings have been a profound process of healing old childhood traumas. This is the place I will continue to go to when I need a reminder that my mind is only in good service to me and my actions as long as I am listening to the heart first. It has taken me a long time to hear this lesson and it has also taken me a long time to feel the heart and listen to what it is saying. My mind likes to trick me with stories that cause me to grasp onto an idea and sometimes those ideas make me react towards a situation in a childish way. I would recommend this to anyone who has already been doing a deeper level of inner work, has the courage to face themselves and their shadows and is ready to become more vulnerable then ever before. This is a retreat that will help a person become acutely aware of their true nature and offer great teachings and practices for the inner journey that will continue laying itself out for the future.\" \"I'm 65 and this is the best thing I've ever done for myself. Ojaya Deep Meditation has had a profound impact on my life. I shudder to think where I would be without it, especially in these times. Setting aside those Ojaya moments during the day has become such a special treat; I cannot help but feel refreshed and restored. No less important though is Sukaishi David's message of love, peace, and healing. What a game changer it has all been for me and I cherish this wonderful gift. I plan to continue on with any course offerings he will have in the future.\" \"I attended my second retreat at Paititi in December, 2019-Jan, 2020. Once again I found it to be an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience. Roman and Cynthia and the core team did a wonderful job of providing an environment that was supporting and allowed me to embrace vulnerability and open to the process of growth. I truly believe that the wisdom, knowledge and support provided by the Paititi Institute retreats can benefit anyone looking to embody their true nature. If you're intrigued and interested by the offerings of the Institute, then I urge you to apply!\" \"I participated in the Embodying true nature retreat for 16 days (plus an additional week of voluntary service after the retreat) in December 2019. It was truly a sensational retreat, principally facilitated by the very talented, wise and knowledgeable Roman Hannis. Roman is an incredible teacher, who is truly passionate about sharing the knowledge he has accumulated through many years of hard work, research and questioning. He's also a phenomenally talented healer and all round genius. The core team running the retreat, and the volunteers are truly magical, wild and amazing humans. They all made an effort to help, support and care for every participant on the retreat and ensure their process was as supported as it could be. The team is first class! Important note: this is not an 'easy' or 'cruisey' retreat. The easiest thing we did all week was the 4+ hour hike at ~2,500m in the rain, up and down hills. However, it is probably the most transformative experience of my life. If you feel like doing the deep work, changing your life to one more based in love and heart centered presence, and realising your highest self, then I recommend the Paititi Institute whole heartedly. It was truly a magical experience run by beautiful, wise souls. Special note, Elton, who is part of the core team and runs the kitchen like a Michelin star restaurant is a true legend. His humour, kindness, support and nourishing food helped me (an many others) through some of my most challenging moments with a smile and open heart. I would love to go back and do a 33 day retreat in the future, especially during June/July when you can swim in the river and the weather is a little warmer! If you have the chance to work with the paititi insititute, and the timing is right for you, I recommend them extremely highly.\" \"As a long time student of Paititi, and a woman in her 50's with decades of retreat experiences, this workshop is one of the most powerful i have ever attended. The food, cooked by a M starred chef was clean, simple, and beautiful. The support staff were deeply kind, mindful, caring, a carried the program off in a way that felt flawless . the beautiful retreat center where it is held, with cascading waterfall, is lush with flowering jasmine, and trumpet flowers- each evening there began with the trumpet releasing her narcotic perfume. For many years I ran a department a one of this Country's largest Yoga and Alt Health Centers, and I can tell you from first hand experience that to find a retreat of this caliber you have to search far and wide. Rather than mining an experience you'll be making offering of gratitude, and forming a relationship with the land, her stories, and her medicine.The retreat participants were a conscious group of dedicated practioners and healers who were a delight to travel with. Roman and Cynthia have a level of knowledge, of the land, her history, sacred geometry, Chinese medicine and herbs, that uplevel the retreat, making it more of a sacred passage, the just a workshop. Most importantly you will leave with practices you can SUSTAIN after the retreat, and offers onlien groups to support your practices AFTER the retreat\" \"I have been doing spiritual work for 22 years and I feel that Paititi Institute is the best in integration with a vast list of integral healing modalities. They create a very safe container for deep work to happen!!! I have referred my family, friends and communities to their work.\" \"I found the 10 day retreat to be wonderfully intensive and I felt very well looked after and safe. We used many tools from breath work and Chi Gong to plant medicine, and the teaching was invaluable - everything fitted together beautifully to change my outlook on life and to tackle my life's crisis that I was going through. Now I am greatfull for that.\" \"My time at the 16 day nature retreat healed me in surprising ways. The retreat is located on a stretch of land just outside the Manu National Park, where the last of the un-contacted tribes still live. It is at the edge of known civilization. The center itself is dedicated to preserving the land from illegal miners and poachers, preserving indigenous culture and knowledge, and engaging our awareness to heal from mental and physical suffering. It's hard to describe these things. I will say this is not meant to be a comfortable retreat, but the difficulties shone light on my shadows. Everyone there went with the intention of seeing themselves clearly, and try to relate to each other without our masks. The facilitator there grew up in New York and searched all his life for healing from an incurable disease. He is a bridge of Eastern, Western, and Amazonian healing practices, and simply speaks to his experience, and sees himself as just another human being, a participant in our healing circle. I have done many retreats and feel this one helped me understand myself in profound ways. I intent to be back each year to continue my journey with friends on the path.\" \"I attended the Embodying True Nature retreat. My experience at Paititi was transformative, inspirational, life-changing, and definitely challenging. I learned and experienced an immense amount that is no doubt causing a shift in my moment-to-moment experience of everyday life. I have a new outlook on how to BE. I've read plenty of books and attended other workshops where I learned about similar teachings but nothing else compares to the level of understanding and insight I gained at Paititi with Roman. Much of my experience escapes my ability to express in words, so that's all I'll say. If your spirit moves you and you feel called to attend, it's probably meant to be. Just don't expect to sit in a classroom as an idle student...you will engage in the teachings and be in an environment where everyone shares at a deeply personal level.\" \"I enjoyed my retreat at Paititi very much. I came away with wonderful tools that I can use in my daily life such as breathwork and chi gong to keep my vibe high and my body strong. I also really liked the different plant medicines that were used. All were held in a very sacred way. I also appreciated how buddhist teachings and amazonian and andean wisdom were interwoven so beautifully throughout the retreat to support our growth and awareness. I now have a greater understanding and appreciation of the plant medicine path as well as its sacredness. The maestro is very sincere and passionate about plant medicine and well versed in the teachings and wisdom of nature. Lastly, we were introduced to dreamwork and shamanic symptomatic dance to help us gain more awareness of our path and release stuck energy. Wow! This retreat was one of a kind! I highly recommend it.\" \"I can easily say that this is one of the most the most significant experiences of my life and it provided several tools that can be used in daily life and which I was already using while still on the retreat. The team was extremely professional and knowledgeable and every step in the process was guided with love and care. I will certainly continue working with the Paititi crew "}
