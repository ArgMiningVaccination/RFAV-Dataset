This plan conveys our shared agenda which allows us to collectively agree on important health outcomes, focus on necessary cross-sector contributions, and frame our conversations around best practices, social determinants of health, and health equity. The plan is a first in sharing a comprehensive range of health-related objectives and aligns our work to achieve collective and measurable targets for the years 2018 - 2022. The priorities are clear, but the methods to achieve our goals may shift as partnerships develop and our understanding of these complex health issues grows. I encourage you to use this plan in conjunction with other stakeholders to make informed decisions and collaborate on evidence-based strategies. I urge you to pursue interventions that make truly meaningful change by focusing on improving the health outcomes of our population and by implementing policies that incorporate health considerations and make healthy behaviours easier for us all. Our Plan doesn't stop here. It is an ongoing process that strives to engage all sectors in health improvement. I encourage you to join the movement to tackle the underlying social and other determinants of health, eliminate inequities, and allow all our population to achieve our highest potential of health. We envision a CHO where every individual and family lives in a community that supports their lifelong health. Through collaboration and coordination, we will achieve our vision of lifelong health for the people of Dublin North City & County.I am pleased to present this CHO DNCC Healthy Ireland Plan which aims to improve the health of service users and staff in the area. It refocuses health services from the need for acute care and looks at opportunities to keep the citizens of our society living well within their own communities. This move towards healthy living for all runs through the life cycle of our citizens from pre-maternity supports to early interventions to ensure lifelong wellness. It includes support from childhood to adulthood to inspire people to be active and eat well. It offers supports for healthy and positive ageing. Staff are supported and encouraged to live and work in healthy environments and take care of themselves which will in turn achieve better outcomes for their clients. We need to embrace the plan and by doing so will, with our partners in the voluntary and community sector and our local councils, change the health outcomes of the population in Dublin North City and County. I wish to thank all of those who assisted with this plan, including staff who took part in the consultation days, public health and environmental health colleagues, the Health Promotion & Improvement team members and colleagues in the National Health & Wellbeing service and my senior management colleagues in CHO DNCC. I wish to acknowledge all the staff in CHO DNCC who are already so positive in their approach to health and wellbeing and who will be the key people in ensuring this plan is achievable. Mary Walshe Chief OfficerCommunity Healthcare Organisation Dublin North City & County (CHO DNCC) Denise Curran Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Community Healthcare Organisation Dublin North City & County (CHO DNCC) The health and wellbeing of everyone living in Ireland, is the most valuable asset that we possess as a nation. Healthy Ireland is bringing together people and organisations from across the country into a national movement to address the social, economic and environmental factors that contribute to poor physical and mental health and to address health inequalities. This approach reflects a shared commitment in Government and throughout communities to support people to be as healthy and well as they can. To help achieve this commitment within the HSE the Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015 - 2017 was published in 2015. The Plan identified three strategic priorities - Systems Reform, Reducing the Burden of Chronic Disease and Staff Health and Wellbeing. We are delighted that this HSE Dublin North City and County Community Healthcare (CHO DNCC) Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan has translated these priority areas into actions for delivery at local level building on the national actions of each of the National Policy Priority Programmes (NPPPs). While we are focused day-to-day on the challenge of providing high quality safe services to the people in our care, we must also be focused on the future and the challenge we face in terms of unsustainable healthcare costs driven by rising levels of chronic illness. An increased emphasis on prevention, early detection and self-management to improve the health and wellbeing of all our citizens is therefore as important for a modern health service as our priorities of quality, access, value, standards of care and patient outcomes. We welcome this five year HSE Dublin North City and County Community Healthcare (CHO DNCC) Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan. This plan builds on the commitment of the hospitals in the RCSI and the Ireland East Hospital Groups who are already implementing their Healthy Ireland Implementation plans. Working hand in hand with these partner Hospital Groups and their Academic Partners, CHO DNCC are an agent for profound change to make major systemic and cultural shifts in how healthcare providers do their business. With its focus on prevention, on providing care closer to home, supporting people to better self-manage their illnesses, the CHO DNCC is on the road to improving population health outcomes for the population of over 620,000 living in this area. We sincerely commend the Healthy Ireland Steering Group, the CHO Management Team, in particular Mary Walshe, Chief Officer, and Denise Curran, Head of Health and Wellbeing, and all their staff, on the work done to develop this Plan and the leadership that they have shown. We would also like to acknowledge the work of staff in the former Health and Wellbeing Division, particularly Ms Sarah McCormack, HSE National HI Lead, in supporting the planning process and in forging positive working relationships at national and local level thereby strengthening our capability for implementation and for sustaining the long term impact of this work. There is no doubt of the challenges that implementation brings and we assure community colleagues of our support in its implementation. It takes energy, vision and commitment to turn action into demonstrable change and we believe we can make this a reality by working together across Hospital Groups, CHOs with the support of Academic Partners. We wish the HSE CHO DNCC every success with the implementation of this plan.

The publication of this framework lays the foundations to improve the health and wellbeing of our nation over the coming generation. Based on international evidence, it outlines a new commitment to public health with a considerable emphasis on prevention, while at the same time advocating for stronger health systems. It aims to create an Irish society where everyone can enjoy positive physical and mental health, and where wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society. The Framework has created the conditions and a governance structure at the highest level of government to facilitate cross-sectoral and cross-governmental actions to improve health and wellbeing status. In addition, one of the key recommendations of the Slaintecare Report 2017 is to expand health and wellbeing by doubling the health and wellbeing budget over the next ten years. In response to the publication of the Healthy Ireland Framework the HSE developed the Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015-2017. This plan acknowledges that health and wellbeing is shaped by many things such as our family, our home, education and work, our community in addition to biological, social, environmental and economic factors. Healthy Ireland has come about because of concerns that the current health status of people living in Ireland - including lifestyle trends and health inequalities - is leading us towards a future that is dangerously unhealthy, and very likely unaffordable. The many risks to the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland include some which are obvious; issues such as obesity, smoking and alcohol. Healthy Ireland seeks to provide people and communities with accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and seeks to empower and motivate them by making the healthy choice the easier choice. A partnership approach between service users and their families and service providers is crucial to the success of this initiative. The aim of our CHO Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation plan is to support and empower our service users, our communities and our staff to achieve their fullest health potential. This plan will build on existing health and wellbeing practices across the CHO such as service user education and staff health and wellbeing events. Improvements in health and wellbeing will lead to better outcomes, healthier communities and staff with the added benefit of utilising resources to enhance health promotion.Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025 Our Healthy Ireland Vision 6 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022A healthy population is a major asset for society and improving the health and wellbeing of the nation is a priority for Government.

K67 D8H0Figure 1.0 Healthy Ireland Plan Evolution 7 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022As healthcare providers, we are constantly focused on improving people's Health and Wellbeing. However, through the lever of the healthcare system we can only address a small portion of the factors that actually determine overall health outcomes. Improving and sustaining health and wellbeing across the life course will require consideration of the wider determinants and action on many levels. Factors such as living conditions, education, lifestyle, environment and transport all influence an individual's health. Health outcomes are determined by the complex interaction between our lifestyle, local environment, broader social and economic factors, access to healthcare and other services, as well as our genes, age and sex. Building relationships and strengthening partnerships is a key focus of Healthy Ireland. Good working relationships are already established with both Dublin City and Fingal County Councils, particularly through the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs). Similar relationships with Children and Young People's Services Committees (CYPSCs), TUSLA and local community and voluntary organisations have also been established.Healthy Ireland Framework Goals Goal 1 Increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of lifeGoal 2 Reduce health inequalitiesGoal 3 Protect the public from threats to health and wellbeingGoal 4 Create an environment where every individual and sector can play their part in achieving a Healthy Ireland Figure 2.0 Determinants of Health Adapted from Dalghren and Whitehead 1991 and Grant and Barton 2006 Clim ate Change Land Biodiversity Natural Environment Natural Habitats Air WaterMacroeconomic Policies Public Administration and Governance Culture and Societal Values Gender Public and Social Policies Epidemiological Conditions Places Buildings Built Environment Transport Streets Parks/Play Areas Roads IncomeWater and SanitationSocial Capital n and AvailabilityOccupationEducation Levels AttainedEthnicit yCrime, Security and Personal Safety Age, Sex & HeredityPeopleSocial Class Chronic Health Problems Health Sy stem s Social Support & Neighbourhood Health Related Behav iours Social Cohesion Home Socio-economic Position Socio-economic/Political Context 1 Department of Health: Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health & Wellbeing, 2013 - 2025, 2013 Partners 8 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022Following on from the \"Community Healthcare Organisations - Report and Recommendations of the Integrated Service Area Review Group\" (October 2014), CHO Dublin North City and County (CHO DNCC) was established, bringing together two former Integrated Service Areas; Dublin North City and North Dublin. Community Healthcare is the term used to describe the range of health and social care services provided by the HSE outside of the acute hospital system. The objective of the CHO is to provide care at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient, and is delivered as close to home as possible. Community Healthcare Organisation Dublin North City and County (CHO DNCC) is one of nine CHOs across the country and is responsible for providing care services to a population of 621,405 2 in Dublin North City and County. CHO DNCC has a number of unique characteristics including a mixed urban/rural geographic divide with all the advantages of a capital city, but within a short commute to our rural hinterlands with strong agricultural traditions. Geographically this CHO extends from north of the River Liffey, joining Meath & Louth at the northern boundaries. An abundance of accessible natural resources including the largest urban park in Europe, Phoenix Park, an extended natural coastline, numerous local authority parks and Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte walking trails can play a role in reaching our Healthy Ireland Goals.Our Organisation 2 Health Atlas Ireland CSO Census 2016 Ireland East Hospitals Group Mater Misericordiae University Hospital Cappagh National Orthopaedic HospitalChildren's Hospitals Group Temple Street Children's University HospitalRCSI Hospitals Beaumont Hospital Connolly Hospital Rotunda Hospital Academic Partners Dublin Institute of Technology Dublin City University Blanchardstown Institute of Technology National C ollege of Ireland CHO AREA 1 CHO AREA 6 CHO AREA 9 CHO AREA 3 CHO AREA 7 CHO AREA 4 CHO AREA 5 CHO AREA 8 CHO AREA 2 CHO AREA 1: Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan CHO AREA 2: CHO AREA 3: Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary CHO AREA 4: Cork, Kerry CHO AREA 5: Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, South Tipperary CHO AREA 6: South East Dublin, East Wicklow CHO AREA 7: Kildare, West Wicklow, West Dublin, Dublin South City, Dublin South West CHO AREA 8: Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, North, Dublin North CityFigure 3.0 CHO Areas & Regions 10 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Community Healthcare Organisation Dublin North City & County has a defined governance structure led by the Chief Officer and held accountable via the HSE's Performance and Accountability Framework to the National Director for Community Operations. Health & Wellbeing services are embedded in this governance structure and are delivered across the Primary Care, Social Care and Mental Health services. The Head of Health & Wellbeing is the assigned lead for the Implementation of the Healthy Ireland Strategy. Health Service performance is captured in a National Scorecard which represents performance through four 'lenses' or domains. The four domains used by the health service are Access to services, the Quality and Safety of those services, doing this within the Financial resources available and by effectively harnessing the efforts of the Workforce. This is to ensure that no one domain dominates when measuring the performance of a service. Management structure: All CHOs have a Chief Officer, Head of Finance, Head of Human Resources (HR) and four Heads of Service for Social Care, Primary Care, Health & Wellbeing and Mental Health. This management team are responsible and accountable for the provision of fair, equitable and timely access to high quality and safe health care services in the area. The mission of staff in CHO DNCC is to support the population in this area through the provision of excellent health and social care services to achieve their full potential. Staff in CHO DNCC are constantly striving to provide the best health outcomes within a culture that is honest, compassionate and transparent.Governance Head of Primary CareHead of Health & WellbeingHead of Social CareHead of Mental HealthBusiness Management Head of Finance Head of Human Resources General Manager Communications Business ManagerChief Officer CHO Dublin North City & County Figure 4.0 CHO Organisation Structure CHO GOVERNANCE The new management structures of the CHOs, the development of 90 Primary Care Networks, the reform of health services to better meet the needs of local communities and the consolidation of the new Hospital Groups present significant opportunities to embed and sustain a longer-term focus on prevention, early detection and self-care supports for people living with chronic conditions. To support this national approach within CHO DNCC, a Healthy Ireland Steering Group was convened with representatives from each of the services areas; Health & Wellbeing, Mental Health, Primary Care & Social Care as well as representatives from hospital services, environmental health, public health and health promotion. Collaboration, participation, commitment and buy-in from all our stakeholders are central to the success of this approach.Section 2 Our PopulationAccording to the 2016 Census, there are just over 4.7m people living in Ireland, an increase of approximately 4% (170,000 people) since 2011. The population in CHO DNCC has increased from 586,486 in 2011 to 621,405 in 2016. This represents an increase of approximately 6.9% (34,919 people) in this CHO and indicates that 23.5% of the total national population increase occurred in this area. The change to the size and diversity of the CHO DNCC population is exhibited across a number of profiles and the consequent impact across all service areas (including Residential, Home Care, Chronic Disease, Palliative Care, GP services), other profiles such as socio-economic (education, unemployment, homelessness), addiction and non-Irish national population, bring considerable challenges in providing the required level of service to our population. In CHO DNCC 20.2% of the population (125,496 people) were born overseas. The Census 2016 data demonstrates that 25.8% of our population (160,446 people) are aged 19 years or under, with a higher proportion of the population in the 20-44 age group compared with the national average. Promoting health and wellbeing for these age groups, including prenatal supports and healthy choices for families, should lead to an increase in the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life in the future. In line with national trends, our population is experiencing a growth in people 60 years and over which equates to 97,433 (16%). This will have an impact across all service areas particularly residential, home care, chronic disease, palliative care and GP services. The increase in our older persons' population is welcome and is an acknowledgement of improved health, supported by health services which are continuingly developing in tandem with other societal changes. Increased longevity offers opportunities and also requires a response to ensure that health and social care services are delivered at adequate levels, in an integrated way, to meet the needs of our older population. Within this plan we have specific actions aimed at promoting the health and wellbeing of older people within our community. The paper Planning for Health Trends and Priorities to inform Health Service Planning (2017) reports that by 2022, CHO DNCC will experience one of the greatest short and medium term growth in children (0-17 years of age); the greatest increase in adult population (18-64 years) in the medium term (along with CHO's 6, 7 and 8); and the greatest growth in older adults (65 years and older) in the medium term in Ireland. 2Our Population 12 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.3 Age Group 0-4 5-1920-6465-7475+Number of people 43,668116,778389,19840,61331,148Change since Census 2011 -1,40611,20119,4635,5165,145 Table 1.0 CHO DNCC Population profile by age group ascending as per Census 2016 data 3 Frederick Douglass, African-American social reformer, orator, writer, and statesman 2 Health Atlas Ireland CSO Census 201613 CHO DNCC NATIONALITIES CENSUS 2016 Irish 80% 1% Polish 3% Lithuanian 1% Elsewhere in EU 6% Elsewhere in World 5% Visitors / Not stated 4% In CHO DNCC, 20.2% of the population (125,496 people) were born overseas. This compares to 14% in the national population. Almost 70,000 of this cohort are from the EU, 29,449 from the rest of the world and 26,766 were visitors/not stated. This demographic provides opportunities and challenges for healthcare provision in our area. We must communicate with service users in a range of different ways including supports for different languages and cultures, ensuring better engagement to promote healthy lifestyles within our diverse population.

In CHO DNCC there are known pockets of deprivation with long term social issues including high long term unemployment rates. Based on 2014 national figures, approximately 17, 649 (11 %) children within CHO DNCC experienced consistent poverty (Survey in Income and Living Conditions (SILC) 2014, Central Statistics Office (CSO). There is a strong link between poverty, socio-economic status and health. Lower socio-economic status is associated with higher mortality rates, higher prevalence of chronic disease, psychological distress and lower rates of healthy behaviour such as physical activity. 4 Department of Housing, Planning & Local Government, Homelessness Report February 2018 DEPRIVATION PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION CHO DNCC Above average 373,855 (60%) Below average 247,549 (40%) TRAVELLERS The 2010 All-Ireland Traveller Health Study (AITHS) was a large-scale study focusing on key aspects of Traveller health, social status and service utilisation. The most striking findings from the AITHS, relate to the substantially higher levels of mortality and morbidity among Travellers compared with the general population. Life expectancy for male Travellers was found to be 15 years lower than for the general population and 11 years lower for females. In addition, infant mortality rates were calculated at more than three times the national average. Census 2016 recorded 30,987 Travellers living in the Republic of Ireland, including a total of 2,801 Travellers living in CHO DNCC. This represents an increase of 5.3% in this area's population in contrast to Census 2011 figures. Given these findings, this population is key in terms of engagement to ensure that these health inequalities are addressed. HOMELESS POPULATION The numbers of people experiencing homelessness is increasing year-on-year in Ireland. Currently 9,8074 people are homeless, with more than a third of these being children. Homelessness is a significant issue for the Dublin area and particularly for CHO DNCC. 66.82% of single homeless adults are situated in Dublin. This is of particular concern, as homelessness in this cohort is a marker for complex tri-morbidity e.g. a combination of physical ill-health with dual diagnosis of mental health and substance misuse. In addition 77.65% of homeless families are situated in Dublin, with many of this population placed in temporary accommodation in Dublin North Inner City. This presents additional challenges to ensure health supports are available at the right place at the right time.SUBSTANCE MISUSE Additional challenges are presented in respect of providing one of the largest addiction services in the country (2,933 services users). We will work in partnership with our addiction services to improve the health and wellbeing of this cohort of our population. POPULATION WITH A DISABILITY The National Population Census in 2016 showed that 81,299 people in Dublin North City & County classified themselves as disabled with 23,457 people describing themselves as carers. This is in line with the national average. We are committed to ensure that this cohort of our population is encompassed in the implementation of our Healthy Ireland plan. VULNERABLE MIGRANTS Vulnerable migrants include asylum seekers and refugees, low paid migrants, undocumented migrants, unaccompanied children, people who have been trafficked and members of the Roma community. Many of Ireland's main transport hubs such as Dublin Airport, Bus\u00e1ras and Dublin Port along with Balseskin Reception Centre are located within our area. These factors combine to create a high number of vulnerable migrants resident in our CHO. We recognise the severe disadvantage and poverty which can be experienced by vulnerable migrants and the challenges they face when accessing local health and social services. We will seek to include these service users in our Healthy Ireland plan. STUDENT POPULATION A significant student population brings advantages in terms of amenities and transport links which benefit the wider population. This cohort of the population will be key in terms of engagement for targeted health promotion and anticipated future health gains. CHALLENGES The demographic changes outlined above are generating increased demand on our health services. This emergent demand is particularly influenced by the changing population and lifestyle behaviours, as well as the predicted population growth of children (0-17 years). CHO DNCC HEALTHY IRELAND PLAN It is important that the Healthy Ireland strategies to promote health and wellbeing are targeted appropriately to our diverse population. We will work proactively with our colleagues in the community / voluntary sector and local councils to ensure we reach those most in need, whilst at the same time using programmes which have a universal evidence based approach to health. We also recognise that our large population of 25-44 year olds are more likely to have children in their care and Healthy Ireland activities need to recognise this. Any gains in this age group would be expected to lead to improved health into the future for all of our population. 15KEY RISK FACTORS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KNOWN RISK FACTORS WHICH OVERLAP TO CONTRIBUTE TO A HIGH PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASE: One in five children are overweight Almost one in five of the population smoke Alcohol consumption in Ireland is the 5th highest in Europe AS A RESULT OF LIFESTYLE FACTORS: Half of all people over 50 have at least one chronic disease One in ten people over 50 has diabetes There are 36,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed each year in IrelandSection 3 Our StaffThe health sector's workforce is at the core of the delivery of healthcare services working within and across all care settings in communities, hospitals and healthcare offices. The overall HSE Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan (Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015-2017)includes Improving Staff Health & Wellbeing as one of its three key priority areas. Our employees have a direct impact on the health outcomes and the experience of our service users. We are clear that when our employees are feeling well and satisfied with their work, the experience of our service users improves. Recruiting and retaining motivated and skilled staff remains paramount for the delivery of health services to an increasing and changing demographic population. The People Strategy 2015-2018 was developed in recognition of the vital role our workforce plays in delivering safer better healthcare. This strategy extends to the entire health sector workforce and is underpinned by a commitment to engage, develop, value and support our workforce. Part of the strategy is to enable our employees to become healthier in their workplaces through improved staff engagement and improving our staff support services. Research from Michael West, The King's Fund suggests that good health and wellbeing produces a wide range of benefits for those who enjoy them, but as employers we can also benefit - happy, healthy employees are more likely to be present, motivated and productive. They are also more likely to be flexible and be prepared to commit to change - a vital requirement for organisations with a reform programme. Workplace health programmes have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the 'best buy' options for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and for mental health and wellbeing. A healthy workplace policy which includes providing facilities conducive to healthy lifestyles while at work or getting to/from work actively promotes a culture of valuing staff health and wellbeing. In 2017, CHO DNCC ran a staff health and wellbeing week with activities in a number of locations including guided meditation, a short physical activity, mini health check and a lunch time speaker with a healthy lunch provided. This week was delivered in partnership between HR and Health & Wellbeing. Feedback in general was very positive and follow-up on this will be included in similar initiatives which are planned for 2018 and beyond. CHO DNCC is committed to working with our partners in the voluntary sector to improve staff health & wellbeing of our entire workforce. Between the Directors of HR there is a commitment to sharing learning experiences, initiatives etc. and where practical engage in joint projects.Our Staff 18 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022The Health and Wellbeing of everyone living in Ireland and everyone working in our health system is the most valuable asset that we possess as a nation.5 5 Health Service Executive: Healthy Ireland in the Health Services - National Implementation Plan 2015-2017, 2015Dec 2017 Dec 2016 change since Nov '17 Section 4 Reducing Chronic Disease20 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022 The overall HSE Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan (Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015-2017) has Reducing the Burden of Chronic Disease as one of its three key priority areas. Chronic or non-communicable diseases are illnesses that affect people over a long period of time and cause a burden of illness, pain, disability and premature death to those who experience them and to their families. Chronic diseases include diabetes, cancer, heart and lung diseases. Chronic diseases are predicted to increase by up to 40% by 2020. To address these issues Integrated Care Programmes (ICPs) are being developed through the HSE's Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division. The ICPs have provided a framework for the management and delivery of health services to ensure that service users receive a continuum of preventative, diagnostic, care and support services, according to their needs over time and across different levels of the health system. From a health and wellbeing perspective, these programmes will provide the framework for how chronic disease should be prevented and managed. Aligned to this priority, the HSE has established an Integrated Care Programme for Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease. CHO DNCC now has both Diabetes and Respiratory (Asthma and COPD - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) integrated care programmes in situ. These programmes are delivered in partnership with the Mater, Connolly & Beaumont Hospitals to ensure integrated pathways of care. This will lead to improved access and intervention and improve the quality of service to the public. A Local Implementation Governance Group has been established to drive and support the roll out of these programmes.Reducing Chronic Disease An overwhelming body of evidence has established that almost 35% of cancer deaths and cases of cancer, and almost 65% of cardiovascular disease deaths and cases, areattributable to a number of known and preventable risk factors - smoking, high bloodpressure, obesity, high cholesterol, alcohol, physical inactivity and poor diet. 121 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022 DIABETES INTEGRATED CARE SERVICES The National Clinical Care Programme for Diabetes introduced four new posts to CHO DNCC in 2017 including 1 Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS), a Senior Podiatrist and 2 Senior Dietitian posts. These posts have enhanced the Integrated Care services that were already being rolled out by the three longer standing CNS posts for Diabetes in place since 2012/2013. The CNS supports and assists GP's and their Practice Nurses in setting up and establishing diabetes clinics under the 'cycle of care' for people with Type 2 diabetes and in reviewing those with complicated Type 2 diabetes. As their role is 80% community and 20% hospital they maintain strong links with the diabetes day centre in the hospital. They also support and educate public health nursing staff and other health care professionals in primary care. The CNS, in conjunction with the dietitians, are now in the process of rolling out X-PERT and DESMOND Structured Patient Education programmes, in community settings, for those newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and those with an existing diagnosis. They also provide a one to one consultation service in local Primary Care Centres for people with Type 2 diabetes. The senior podiatrist is the first HSE/Primary Care community podiatrist in this area and is currently setting up services in the community, for people living with diabetes in the Beaumont Hospital catchment area. The service is based on the National Model of Care for the Diabetic Foot. This will allow access to a senior podiatrist to help prevent foot ulceration, aiming to further prevent the risk of life altering lower limb amputation. RESPIRATORY INTEGRATED CARE SERVICES The Respiratory Integrated Care service is a joint initiative developed through the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma National Clinical Care Programmes with oversight from the HSE Primary Care and Integrated Care Programmes for the Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease. Two Clinical Nurses Specialists and a Physiotherapist have been introduced to support these services through the HSE Primary Care Service to support and enhance management of service users with asthma and/or COPD. The target population are those service users with COPD/asthma who demonstrate poorly controlled disease as defined within the National Clinical Care Programme, and those suspected of having undiagnosed COPD or asthma. Key objectives include diagnosis and care at the lowest level of complexity, enabling people to self-manage their asthma or COPD and reduce emergency attendance at GP out of hours and ED and hospital admissions. In CHO DNCC we now have a CNS working in the Connolly Hospital catchment area of Dublin 15 and a CNS and Physiotherapist working in the Mater Hospital catchment area. In the Mater catchment area, the physiotherapist delivers three Pulmonary Rehabilitation programmes in the community - Navan Road, Ballybough and Finglas areas. The CNS works with the physiotherapist in delivering one of the pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and also delivers one to one clinics including spirometry, in both primary care and GP settings. Both maintain links with the Respiratory Team in the Mater Hospital and the supporting consultant. The Respiratory Care CNS who works in the Dublin 15/Connolly Hospital catchment area is running clinics from several GP Practices in Dublin 15, and maintains links with the Respiratory Team and supporting Consultant in Connolly Hospital. She is also in the process of setting up clinics in primary care settings to accommodate referrals from additional GP Practices. Both the CNS and the physiotherapist work four days per week in the community and one day per week in the hospital. They also share expert knowledge and skills with both GP and primary care staff. 1 Department of Health: Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health & Wellbeing, 2013 - 2025, 2013 SELF MANAGEMENT SUPPORT (SMS) & MAKING EVERY CONTACT COUNT (MECC) Prevention, early detection and self-care support will be core elements of the models of care across the full spectrum of health and social care services, from primary care services provided by nurses, GPs, other allied healthcare professionals through to hospital and specialist services. Self Management Support (SMS) - A National Self Management Support Framework has been developed for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The increasing numbers of people living with chronic conditions in Ireland has prompted the need to develop a framework which supports our service users to self manage their conditions to the extent that they are able to live with the best possible quality of life. This approach is crucial to both patient centred care and sustainability of health services. To facilitate the rollout of this an SMS co-ordinator has been appointed in each CHO to support the implementation of this framework. Making Every Contact Count (MECC) is an approach to behaviour change that utilises day-to-day interactions by health professionals using their routine consultation to empower and support people to make healthier choices to achieve positive long-term behaviour change. This approach will allow us to move to a position where discussion of lifestyle behaviour is routine, non-judgemental and central to everyone's journey through the health service. It will link people to the self management supports available in their own community to facilitate them to live healthy lives with appropriate supports. The principles of Self Management Support and Making Every Contact Count will underpin the development of the chronic disease management projects. 22 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022 Section 5 Healthy Ireland Initiatives within CHO DNCC24 25 Section 6 Implementing Our Healthy Ireland PlanThis Healthy Ireland Plan for CHO Dublin North City & County is building on the actions contained in the Healthy Ireland Framework 2013-2025 relevant to the specific needs of the population of Dublin North City & County. It also acknowledges the initiatives that pre-date this plan and builds on all the good practice to date. This Healthy Ireland Plan will be delivered over a 5 year period from 2018 to 2022. The 11 action areas outlined in this plan, aligned to the national plan, aim to bring about improvements to the health and wellbeing of service users and staff.Implementation 28 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022At its simplest, implementation can be described as the carrying out of a plan for doing something. It focuses on operationalising the plan - the How, rather than the What.6 6 Centre for Effective Studies, An Introductory Guide to Implementation (2012)Tobacco Free Ireland Alcohol & HealthHealthy Eating and Activ e Living Wellbeing and Mental HealthHealthy Childhood Positive AgeingSelf Management SupportStaff Health and Wellbeing Strengthening PartnershipsSexual Health Making Every Contact Coun t1 Healthy Childhood 2 Healthy Eating and Active Living 3 Tobacco Free Ireland 4 Alcohol & Health 5 Wellbeing and Mental Health 6 Sexual Health 7 Positive Ageing 8 Making Every Contact Count 9 Self-Management Support 10 Strengthening Partnerships 11 Staff Health and Wellbeing29 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022 An overall CHO DNCC Healthy Ireland Steering Committee was convened, chaired by the Head of Service Health & Wellbeing. The steering group included representatives from across all services in the CHO, colleagues from Public Health, Health Promotion and Improvement, Environmental Health Services, and the National Health and Wellbeing Division. Its Terms of Reference were: * To develop an Implementation Plan for Healthy Ireland based on the National Healthy Ireland in the Health Services Implementation Plan 20 15 - 2017 for Dublin North City & County CHO. * Oversee the consultation and communication process associated with the development and implementation of the plan. * Oversee and provide direction to ensure the successful Implementation of Plan. * Set priorities based on the plan for each year of implementa tion. * Ensure that detailed plans are in place for each year of implementation. * Ensure on-going monitoring and progress reporting processes are in place. * Support the sites in organising and s tructuring their resources for the delivery of the plan. * Agree and establish sub groups to enable the implementation, with the chair of each sub group reporting to the chair of the S teering Group. * Identify and monitor risks to the implementa tion and develop mitigation plans where necessary The formulation of this plan commenced with facilitated staff discussions on the requirements of a Healthy Ireland Plan to improve the health and wellbeing of service users and staff in our area. This consultation took place over a number of locations during the summer of 2017 and over 175 staff from all disciplines engaged in the process. Consultation also took place with service area management teams to determine existing good practice that could be implemented throughout CHO Dublin North City & County. The CHO Healthy Ireland Steering Group was enhanced with the appointment of a project manager to establish a specific Action Plan to implement Healthy Ireland initiatives. The actions contained in this plan reflect the recommendations from this consultation relevant to the population needs of our service users and staff. In order to ensure implementation of the Healthy Ireland plan in Dublin North City and County we will utilise all available resources, evidence-based methodologies and best practice models of project management and service delivery within the parameters of the HSE's performance and accountability framework. The limited funding for this initiative, while challenging, provides an opportunity for the CHO to work creatively to ensure the plan is implemented in a positive and effective way. The success of the implementation of the Healthy Ireland Plan will be delivered through the established governance structures of the CHO DNCC Management Team and requires ownership and engagement from staff at all levels of the organisation and the public whom we serve. MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN A CHO DNCC Healthy Ireland Steering Group will remain in place as an overarching support for the plan. Each service in CHO DNCC will establish a Healthy Ireland Implementation sub group, reporting to their area management team, and supported by the Health & Wellbeing Team to deliver the actions relating to their areas. These service area sub groups will ensure the action plan is implemented. The CHO DNCC Management Team will monitor the plan on a quarterly basis and will offer appropriate support as required to facilitate the implementation within the timeframe. The Healthy Ireland Plan has been prioritised by the CHO Management Team as one of the main projects for completion from 2018 to 2022. They are fully supportive of the aims of the plan and the importance of all the elements involved in supporting the lifestyle choices and wellbeing of the population and staff in CHO DNCC.Governance, Leadership and Structures for Implementation of the Healthy Ireland Plan 30 Community Health Organisation Dublin North City & County Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2022Action Assign a Healthy Ireland (HI) Project Coordinator to oversee the implementation of the HI Plan Maintain the existing overarching CHO DNCC HI Steering Committee structure to oversee the CHO DNCC HI Implementation Plan Establish HI Implementation Groups across the service areas in CHO DNCC to implement HI implementation plans Undertake staff engagement sessions to communicate the HI Plan at local level Establish baseline activity, monitor progress and demonstrate delivery of actions for CHO DNCC HI Implementation Plan Promote and actively seek out health and wellbeing opportunities within CHO DNCC and other stakeholders i.e. LCDC, CYPSC, Partnerships, local community/voluntary partners Continuous promotion of the Healthy Ireland Plan for CHO Dublin North City & County Measure HI Project Coordinator in place Steering Committee established Establish Implementation Groups in each service in CHO DNCC and commence work on the plan Staff engagement sessions held bi-annually Using existing KPI data, establish monitoring mechanism for services and overarching HI Plan Increased engagement within CHO DNCC and other stakeholders i.e. LCDC, CYPSC, Partnerships, local community/voluntary partners in relation to Healthy Ireland Implement Communications Strategy throughout the lifetime of the planTimeframe Lead 2018-2022 2018-2022 2018-2022 2018-2022 2018-2022 2018-2022 2018-2022 Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Section 7 Our Healthy Ireland Action Plan 2018 - 2022321.

Tobacco Free Ireland Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland with almost 6,000 smokers dying each year from tobacco related diseases. Smoking related deaths are mainly due to cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causing many different illnesses and diseases. If you are a long-term smoker, on average, your life expectancy is 10 years less than a non-smoker. On a positive note, there are now more quitters than smokers in Ireland. The Healthy Ireland Framework ensures commitment to working towards a Tobacco Free Ireland. Assign a nominated Tobacco Lead from Senior Management in CHO DNCC to support implementation and on-going monitoring of local Tobacco Free Campus Policies across all sites and services CHO DNCC will commit to HSE Tobacco Free Sites and Campuses and will develop an action plan to progress the implementation and on-going monitoring of the HSE Tobacco Free Campus Policies across all sites and services All services in CHO DNCC will implement the Global Network for Tobacco Free Healthcare Services Quality Standards and complete online self-audit CHO DNCC will engage in a coordinated and timely process whereby Tobacco Free Campus implementation monitoring data is supplied to the Tobacco Free Ireland Programme Office3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 Nominated Senior Management Lead appointed and oversees implementation of tobacco actions in CHO DNCC Tobacco lead to be identified in all services within CHO DNCC Implementation Plan for CHO DNCC produced Online self-audit completed annually by primary care and residential services 5 services participate in validation audit per annum Implementation data supplied to Tobacco Free Ireland Programme Office on a quarterly basis 2018-2022 2018 2019 2018-2022 2018-2022 Head of Service Health & Wellbeing CHO DNCC Management Team Nominated Tobacco Lead in each service Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Action # Measure Lead Timeframe 37Smoking cessation service information and QUIT support resources will be displayed in all appropriate CHO DNCC sites CHO DNCC will establish cessation services to serve the needs of its population in line with National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) best practices recommendations Ensure compliance with the HSE Protection from Second-hand Smoke in Domestic Settings Policy in CHO DNCC Services in CHO DNCC will routinely record the smoking status of service users, deliver brief interventions and refer to intensive services where appropriate CHO DNCC will offer reduced cost cessation pharmacotherapy, group sessions and referral to intensive cessation services for staff if required CHO DNCC will support the implementation of the Health Behaviour Patient Management System (e-referral to quit services)3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.10 Cessation information will be placed in all appropriate CHO DNCC sites HSE smoking cessation services will work with local voluntary and community sector groups to provide smoking cessation \"train the trainer\" training to support target groups particularly in those areas of high need Support staff and managers in CHO DNCC to implement this policy Clinical Staff in CHO DNCC to record smoking status of service users and deliver brief intervention or refer to cessation services were appropriate 10% of staff who smoke accessing intensive cessation services/pharmacotherapy per annum Clinical Staff in CHO DNCC to implement the quit e-referral Health Behaviour Management as required 2018-2022 2019-2022 2018-2022 2019-2022 2019-2022 2018-2022 Head of Service Health & Wellbeing Health Promotion & Improvement Lead Head of Service Health & Wellbeing CHO DNCC Management Team Head of Service Health & Wellbeing CHO DNCC Management Team Action # Measure Lead Timeframe 38 4.

Wellbeing and Mental Health The World Health Organisation defines mental health as a state of wellbeing in which an individual realises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community 7. Mental health promotion is concerned with promoting wellbeing among all age groups of the general population and addressing the needs of those at risk from, or experiencing, mental health difficulties. Mental health promotion also has a role in preventing a number of mental health problems, notably depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders.

Sexual HealthIreland's first National Sexual Health Strategy was launched in 2015. It established clear leadership within the health sector in the area of sexual health and wellbeing. The World Health Organisation defines sexual health as \"a state of physical, emotional, mental and social wellbeing in relation to sexuality. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships free of coercion, discrimination and violence\". The strategy envisions that everyone in Ireland experiences positive sexual health and wellbeing through the provision of sexual health promotion, education and prevention. CHO DNCC will work in conjunction with our partners in Local Hospital Groups, TUSLA, CYPSC and community/voluntary sector agencies to ensure information and evidence-based sexual health programmes are available to those who require them.

Staff Health & WellbeingCHO DNCC acknowledges that the work and the health & wellbeing of our employees are interlinked. We aim to demonstrate a commitment to promoting a culture where wellbeing is embraced by all our employees. Through our Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan, the People Strategy and our feedback reports from the national staff surveys, we will provide a framework to promote a proactive and engaging approach to enhancing the health and wellbeing of our staff. This will be achieved through wellbeing initiatives, employee support mechanisms and joint working with employees and their representatives, and local partners to identify and address areas for improvement. We will ensure that through the implementation of this action plan we provide information and support to our employees to increase their awareness of the importance of ensuring their own health and wellbeing and in particular the correlation between positive emotional and mental health wellbeing and exercise.
