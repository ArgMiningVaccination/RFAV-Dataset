The first COVID-19 confirmed case in Brazil was on February of 2020. A 61yrs old man tested positive after returning from a trip to Italy. Few other very first cases were also imported from Europe by returning travelers. The first locally transmitted case was registered on March of 2020, when a total of 8 cases have already been confirmed. At the time the WHO declares the outbreak as a pandemic (March 11) Brazil had 52 confirmed cases being 6 of those locally transmitted. Healthcare professionals are now more important than ever. Given the intrinsic nature of the hands-on treatment of the Chiropractic profession, it is extremely important to understand what strategies chiropractors have put in place to address patient care, safety, and self report COVID contamination of those professionals. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment| Being Affected and What Strategies They Have Developed for Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic| |Estimated Study Start Date :||August 26, 2020| |Estimated Primary Date :||September Brazilian chiropractors | A cross-sectional survey will be performed with this population (Brazilian chiropractors) to assess outcomes regarding what is the current impact and what measures they have implemented while facing the COVID-19 pandemic. | Other: Electronic survey | Brazilian chiropractors will be invited by email and social media to answer an electronic survey. - What measures have been implemented to avoid SARS-COV2 transmission when taking care of patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
