This course is designed to introduce students to host-associated microbial communities (specifically human and animal hosts) and their roles in host health and disease. This course is currently offered as VETPREV 7719, so this proposal is to have an existing course cross listed in Microbiology (see Letter of Support from Chair Thomas Whittum). In the broader Microbiology Graduate program, the course serves as an elective, likely to be taken during the second year of graduate studies, and forms part of an emerging cluster of Microbiome-focused electives in our program (along with the computational-focused M8161). We thank you for your consideration. Regards, Jesse J.

We will focus heavily on the gut microbiome and will explore the interactions between host and microbes. We will also examine methodologies used to examine, predict, evaluate, or manipulate microbiota within the context of host health. Course Objectives Design a microbiome study and identify the strengths and limitations of varying study types Describe and identify strengths and weaknesses of in vivo, in vitro, in silico, and analysis techniques used for studying the microbiome Critically interpret microbiome data and communicate your critique constructively Apply, as relevant, key ecological concepts to microbiome study design and interpretation. Identify and explain the potential and risks of microbiome-associated diagnostics and therapeutics. Text: This course will be based on primary literature for which links and PDFs will be provided weekly. No other texts are required for this course.

Late Assignments: Late assignments will only be accepted with an approved excuse. If you are submitting an assignment that is or will be late, please inform us immediately to request approval for your submission. Academic Misconduct: It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term \"academic misconduct\" includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct http://studentlife.osu.edu/csc/. Mental Health: As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student Life's Counseling and Consultation Service (CCS) by visiting ccs.osu.edu or calling 614-292-5766. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS is closed at 614-292-5766 and 24 hour emergency help is also available through the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK or at suicidepreventionlifeline.org. Diversity: The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body. Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them. We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status, which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited. Harrassment and Assault: Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at http://titleix.osu.edu or by contacting the Ohio State Title IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at titleix@osu.edu . Accessibility: The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion.

VETPREV 7719 (Microbiome in Health and Disease, 2.0 credit hours) is a course currently listed through the Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine with Dr. Vanessa Hale as the course lead. Dr. Hale and Dr. Patrick Bradley in Microbiology have discussed co- teaching this course with equal contribution and launching the course in Fall 2021. They will bring complementary expertise and perspectives to the course, which will critically examine the role of the host -associated microbiomes in animal and human health and disease. Th is course will become part of the growing Microbiome Science Training Track , which is recognized not only by the OSU Center of Microbiome Science but also nationally by the Microbiome Centers Cons ortium as a unique, cutting-edge curriculum that is unparalleled at other institutions. Drs. Bradley and Hale are both Discovery Theme hires within the Infectious Diseases Institute, and this co-taught course embraces both the interdisciplinary and One H ealth aspects of microbiome science. This course would further offer opportunities for collaboration and interdisciplinary endeavors between trainees from different colleges, which is a value core to the Infectious Disease Institute. The cross-listing and co-teaching of Microbiome in Health and Disease (VETPREV 7719 / M7719) would be a strength for both departments and for the student learning experience. Sincerely, Thomas E. Wittum, PhD Professor and Chair Veterinary Preventive Medicine Co-Director, Antimicrobial Resistance Program OSU Infectious Diseases Institute Mapping Microbiology 7719 Learning Goals to Ph.D. Degree Program Learning Goals Microbiology Ph.D. Degree Program Learning Goals PhD graduates of Microbiology should be able to: 1. Demonstrate a broad base of knowledge in several areas, including microbial physiology, genetics, biochemistry, and pathogenesis. 2. Demonstrate in-depth knowledge in an area of interest. 3. Make an original and substantial contribution to the field, as indicated by at least one first-author publication. 4. Effectively communicate science through oral and written presentations to both scientific and general audiences.
