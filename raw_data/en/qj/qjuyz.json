Bronstein et al. Abstract Background :The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC; http://www.aapcc. org ) maintains the National Poison Data System (NPDS). Today, 60 of the nation's 61 USpoison centers upload case data automatically. Most upload every 1- 60 minutes (median 11 minutes) to NPDS creating a real-time national exposure database and surveillance system. Methodology : We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from NPDS. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences areidentified. Fatalities were review ed by a team of 27 medical and clinical toxicologists and assigned to 1 of 6 categories according to Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF). Results : Over 4 million calls were captured by NPDS in 2006: 2,403,539 human exposure calls, 1,488,993 information requests, and 128,353 nonhuman exposure calls Substances involved mostfrequently in all human exposures were analgesics. The most common exposures in children less than age 6 were cosmetics/ personal care products. NPDS documented 1,229 human fatalities. Conclusions : Poisoning continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. NPDS represents a valuable national resource to collect and monitor US poisoning exposure cases. It offersone of the few real-time surveillance systems in existence, provides useful data and is a model for public health surveillance. Participating poison centers The collection of data and compil ation of this report is made possible by the individuals who staff the US Poison Centers(PCs) through their meticulous documentation of each caseusing standardized definitions and compatible computer sys-tems. The 61 participating poison centers in 2006 were: Mid-America Poison Center Alabama Poison CenterArizona Poison & Drug CenterArkansas Poison & Drug Information CenterBanner Samaritan Poison Control CenterBlue Ridge Poison CenterCalifornia Poison Control System - Fresno/Madera DivisionCalifornia Poison Control System - Sacramento DivisionCalifornia Poison Control System - San Diego DivisionCalifornia Poison Control System - San Francisco Carolinas Poison CenterCentral Ohio Poison CenterCentral Texas Poison CenterChildren's Hospital of MI Regional Poison CenterCincinnati Drug and Poison Information CenterConnecticut Poison Control Center DeVos Children's Hospital Regional Poison CenterFlorida Poison Information Center - MiamiFlorida Poison Information Center - TampaFlorida/USVI Poison Information Center - JacksonvilleGeorgia Poison CenterGreater Cleveland Poison CenterHennepin Regional Poison CenterIllinois Poison CenterIndiana Poison CenterIowa Statewide Poison Control CenterKentucky Regional Poison CenterLong Island Poison CenterLouisiana Poison CenterMaryland Poison CenterMississippi Regional Poison Center Missouri Poison CenterNational Capital Poison CenterNebraska Regional Poison CenterNew Jersey Poison Inform ation and Education System New Mexico Poison CenterNew York City Pois on Control Center North Texas Poison CenterNorthern New England Poison CenterOklahoma Poison Control CenterOregon Poison CenterPalmetto Poison CenterPittsburgh Poison CenterPuerto Rico Poison CenterRegional Center for Poison Control and Prevention Serving Massachusetts and Rhode Island Regional Poison Control Center - AlabamaRocky Mountain Poison & Drug CenterRuth A.

WARNING: Comparison of exposure or outcome data from pre- vious AAPCC Annual Reports is problematic. In particular, theidentification of fatalities (attribution of a death to the exposure)differed from pre-2006 Annual Reports (see Fatality Case Review- Methods). Likewise, Table 22 (Exposure Cases by Generic Cate-gory) this year restricts the breakdown including deaths to single-substance cases to improve precision and avoid misinterpretation.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 819 Surveillance was carried out by a team of 4 medical and clinical toxicologists workin g across the country who pro- vided daily monitoring of surveillance anomalies. The 2006 AAPCC fatality re view was carried out by 27 managing and medical directors who verified abstracts ofclinical case data for all exposure related deaths. These individuals are listed in Appendix A and are acknowledged for their commitment and contribution to theAAPCC and the public health. Introduction American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC)compiles real-time information reported from the 61 regional Poison Centers (PCs) into its National Poison Database Sys-tem (NPDS). Since the inception of the data base in 1983, the number of exposures reported by the country's poison centers has growndramatically. This increase has been due in large part to the AAPCC's regionalization initiative that has resulted in mem-ber poison centers serving th e entire population of the 50 United States, American Samoa, District of Columbia, Feder-ated States of Micronesia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Addi tionally, the number of exposure and information calls continue s to rise [Table 1A]. Historical perspective In 1953, the first US poison center opened in Chicago, Illi- nois.(1) This event marked the culmination of many pediatricpoison prevention initiatives dating back to the 1930's. AAPCC was chartered as a non-profit, nongovernmentalassociation in 1958.(2) Although poison centers proliferatedwith a peak number of 661 by 1978, research-based poisonexposure management and data on commercial and house-hold products was limited. Over the ensuing years, manyworked to develop product information databases for phar-maceutical and non-pharmaceutical products and create evi-dence based management guidelines. During the same periodAAPCC began to meet the need to create standards for cen-ters in tandem with the develo pment of the specialized fields of clinical and medical toxicology. While center maturation continued with regionalization, in the beginning bounded by state lines, there was no standard-ized data set used to docume nt poison center calls and no centralized, codified national data system. To address this issue, in 1983, AAPCC launched a nascent data system, now known as the National Poison Data System (NPDS). Today,60 of the nation's 61 US poison centers upload case data auto-matically. Most upload every 1- 60 minutes (median 11 min-utes) to NPDS creating a real-time national exposuredatabase and surv eillance system. While the initial impetus for the development of our national poison center system was a response to childhood exposures to pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical prod- ucts, today it is clear that po ison centers have an expanded responsibility. The infrastructure of poison centers, especiallytheir data collection skills and clinical management guidance,represent a true public health response network. AAPCC member centers repres ent an independent infra- structure that works closely with local and state health depart- ments and a variety of local and state governmental and non-governmental groups, federal agencies including the Health Resources and Services Administration/Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau (HRSA/MCHB), Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) and Environmenta l Protection Agency (EPA). AAPCC has a strong and vibrant partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC). NPDS has been a collaborative development between AAPCC and CDC to meet the challenge of forging a true national poison center system. This repo rt summarizes NPDS data for 2006. Poisoning in the US - the context The magnitude of the poisoning problem in the US was addressed in the 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report.(1).Poison centers (highly skilled medical contact centers) pro-vide telephone information to the public and health profes-sionals. In a large percentage of cases (72.9% for 2006) theexposed patients are managed over the telephone and nottreated directly by a health ca re professional. When appropri- ate, the poison center refers the patient to a health care facil-ity and follows the course of th e exposure until resolution. In some cases, a patient is taken to an emergency department or admitted to a hospital and th e medical personnel involved Table 1.

Bronstein et al. may not always contact a poison center. Since poison cases in general, are not required to be reported, the PC may not be called. The IOM committee, in preparing its report publishedin 2004, examined data from a nu mber of source s such as the National Hospital Discharge Su rvey for 1997 - 2001 which reported 11,533 cases of poisoning, the National Health Inter-view Survey for 2000 - 2001 which reported 269 cases, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emer- gency Department File for 1997 - 2001 which reported 1,810 cases and several others including Mortality Vital Statistics.The committee concluded that a conservative estimate of theannual incidence of poisoning ep isodes in the United States is 4 million cases per year. These episodes are primarily expo-sures and 25% do not appear to lead to any direct treatment with only 7.5% hospitalized. AAPCC data for 2001 reported2,267,979 exposures or 56% of the estimate made by theIOM. Applying this 56% to the 2,403,539 exposures for 2006extrapolates to 4,292,034 exposures for the US for 2006. The IOM 2004 report estimated fatalities from poisoning to be 24,173 from the National Center for Health Statisticsand 30,800 when cases involv ing ethanol were included. AAPCC data for 2004 reported 1,190 fatalities. This 1,190was not added to the NCHS total since it was assumed thatthey were already included. Using the 30,800 estimate,AAPCC data represented about 3.5% of the fatalities frompoisoning in the US. Limitations and plans As outlined above, the expo sure reports which comprise NPDS are spontaneous, self-r eported calls and reflect the limitations of this type of reporting system (see DIS-CLAIMER). Nonetheless scope and immediacy of these data have much to offer. The 24 year history offers a uniqueopportunity to assess the long term (secular) trends in poisonings. There are a number of plans to improve the data system and reporting. Among the specific plans for 2007 andbeyond: Improved data transmission architecture between the PCsand NPDS Improved validation process for data integrity duringupload to NPDS Real-time geographic informat ion system (GIS) options for appropriate data analyses and displays Use of a structured collection of the tissue, blood, plasma, serum, and vitreous concentration data along with units ofmeasure and sampling times Implementation of a web-based infrastructure to supportthe ongoing fatality review A revised annual report format to maintain integrity of tem-poral data and improve the utility and accessibility of theinformation in the tables and text Presentation of tabular results for all data discussed in the annual reportDynamics of the database NPDS classifies all calls as either EXPOSURE (concern about an exposure to a subs tance) or INFORMATION (no exposed human or animal). A call may provide information about one or more exposed persons or animals (receptors).The information reported in this article reflects only those cases classified as CLOSED, th at is, the PC has determined that no further follow-up/reco mmendations are required or no further information is available. Cases are followed to as pre- cise an outcome as possible. Most calls are \"closed\" withinthe first hours; some calls rega rding hospitalized patients or fatalities may remain open fo r weeks or months depending on the case. Follow-up calls provide a proven mechanismfor monitoring the appropriat eness of management recom- mendations, augmenting patie nt guidelines, enabling con- tinual updates of case information, and obtaining final medical outcome status to make the data collected as accu-rate as possible. Information in the NPDS data base is dynamic. Each year the database is locked prior to extraction of data to preventinadvertent changes and insure consistent, reproduciblereports. The 2006 database was locked 8 October 2007. Database record count summary In 2006, the 61 participating PCs logged 4,033,279 total cases including 2,403,539 closed human exposure cases(Table 1A), animal 1,488,993information calls (Table 3,956 duplicate reports(reported by more than one PC), 7,476 human confirmednonexposures, 366 animal confirmed nonexposures, and 596human exposure calls still open at the time of preparation ofthis report. The cumulative AAPCC databa se now contains over 43 million human exposure case re cords (Table 1A). A total of 8,026,812 information calls (a s described below) have been logged by NPDS since year 2000. The total of 3,892,532 human exposure cases and informa- tion calls reported to PCs in 2006 does not reflect the full extent of poison center effo rts which also include activities such as poison prevention and education and poison centerawareness.

Bronstein et al. PCs made 4,028,727 follow-up calls in 2006. Follow-up calls were done in 44.4% of human exposure cases. One fol- low-up call was made in 22.4 % of human exposure cases, and multiple follow-up calls (range 2-158) were placed in22.0% of cases. Information calls to poison centers Data from 1,488,993 information calls to PCs in 2006 (Table 1C) was transmitted to NPDS, including calls in optional report-ing categories such (33,685) and imme diate referral (68,048). Over- all, the volume of information calls handled by US PCsincreased by 6.3% over the 1,400,904 calls handled in 2005.(3) The most frequent information call was for drug identifica- tion, comprising 948,055 calls to PCs during the year. Ofthese, 144,337 (9.7%) could not be identified over the tele-phone. The majority of the drug identification calls werereceived from the public, foll owed by law enforcement and health professionals. Most of the drug identification requests involved drugs sometimes involv ed in abuse; however, these cases were categorized based on the abuse potential withoutknowledge of whether abuse was actually intended. Drug information calls (176,746 calls) comprised 11.9% of all information calls. Of these, the most common questionswere regarding drug-drug intera ctions, followed by therapeu- tic use and indications, and qu estions about adverse effects. Environmental inquiries comprised 1.9% of all informationcalls. Of these environmental inquiries, questions related tocleanup of mercury thermome ters were most common fol- lowed by questions involving pesticides. Of all the information calls, poison information comprised 6.2% of information calls, with calls involving food poison- ing or food preparation practices the most common followedby questions involv ing plant toxicity. Trends in reported poisonings/exposures The data do not directly identify a trend in the overall incidence of poisonings in the US because the percentage of actual expo- sures and poisonings reported to PCs is unknown (Fig. 1). TheNPDS may be best considered \"numerator data\" since the\"denominator\" cannot be determined. An attempt has been madeto better define the incidence of poisoning. For example, usingthe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the estimatednumber of poisoning episodes in the US for the year 2000 wasestimated to be 1,575,000.(1). On the other hand NHIS data(1)underestimates the total number of poisoning exposures treated by health care providers at 1.2 million cases versus the 2.2 mil-lion reported during the same time period by AAPCC. AAPCC surveillance system As previously noted, 60 of the 61 US PCs upload case data automatically. Most upload every 1-60 minutes (median11 minutes) to NPDS creating a real-time national expo- sure database and surveillance system. This unique real-time upload is the foundati on of AAPCC's surveillance system permitting both case volume and syndromic sur- veillance. NPDS software allows creation of volume andsyndromic definitions at will. Definitions can be thenapplied to national, regional, state, or zip code coverageareas. For the first time this functionality is available notonly to the AAPCC surveillance team, but to everyregional poison center. Centers also have the ability toshare NPDS real-time surveillance technology with theirstate and local health departments or other regulatoryagencies. Another unique NPDS feature is the ability togenerate system alerts on adverse drug events and otherproducts of public health interest such as contaminatedFig. 1.

NPDS can thus provide real-time adverse event monitoring. Surveillance definitions can be created to monitor a variety of volume parameters, any de sired substance or commercial product, or syndromic case definitions using a variety ofmathematical options and historical baseline periods. NPDSsurveillance tools include: 1. Volume alerts a. Total Call Volume b. Human Exposure Call Volumec. Clinical Effects (signs and symptom symptoms, or laboratory abno rmalities) Volume 2. Syndromic Surveillance Definitions a. Substance b. Clinical Effectsc. Various NPDS data fieldsd. Combinations Incoming data is monitore d continuously around the clock and any anomalous signal detected generates an auto- mated alert to the AAPCC's surveillance team or publichealth agency. These anomaly alerts are reviewed by theAAPCC surveillance team and/or the regional poison centerthat created them. When reports of potential public healthimportance are detected, additional information is obtainedvia e-mail or phone from reporti ng PCs. Public health issues are brought to the attention of the National Center for Envi-ronmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC). Affected state or local health depart-ments may also be alerted. In 2006, real-time monitoring of cases submitted to the AAPCC's national database was expanded to include new sur- veillance case definitions, and enhanced surveillance at the regional PC level. Surveillance Anomaly 1 was generated at 2:00 pm EDT on 17 September 2006. This event marked thetransition of AAPCC surveillan ce to NPDS. Since then more than 78,000 anomalies have been detected. At the time of thisreport, 220 surveillance definitions run continuously, monitor-ing case and clinical effects vol ume and a variety of syndromic case definitions from food poisoning to nerve agents. Individual PCs have develo ped surveillance case defini- tions. Surveillance processes and anomaly definitions con- tinue to be developed, refined, and evaluated. On 13 September 2006, CDC learned about exposures to fresh spinach later found to be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. Case clusters were reported from 26 states.(4) Thefirst confirmed case occurred on 19 August 2006. During thisperiod NPDS tracked 476 spin ach exposure calls with the highest number of calls occurring on 15 September 2006.Although NPDS did not detect the index case, our case dataclearly showed the pattern of exposures and provided situa- tional awareness abou t the event (Fig. 3).Database enhancements Launched in April of 2006, NPDS is in its second year of full use. NPDS is a complex project with enormousimpact on AAPCC and the regional poison centers' pub-lic health mission. We have successfully transferred tothe web-based NPDS. The syst em is used every day by the AAPCC member centers and a variety of public health agencies. Of note is the fact that the NPDS report generator provided all tables in this report except for the case listing (Table 21). The new web-based software for querying, reporting and surveillance application allows AAPCC, its member centers and public health agencies to utilize US poisoning exposuredata. Users are able to access local and regional data fortheir own areas and view nati onal aggregate data. The new application allows for increase d \"drill-down\" capability and mapping via a geographic info rmation system (GIS). Custom surveillance definitions are available along with ad hoc reporting tools. The new system is designed to serve AAPCC well into the 21st century. Characterization of participating poison centers All 61 participating centers submitted data to AAPCC for2006. Fifty-eight centers (95%) were certified by AAPCC atthe end of 2006. The entire popula tion of the 50 states, Amer- ican Samoa, the District of Columbia, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Pu erto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands was served by PCs in 2006.(5)Fig. 3.

Bronstein et al. The average number of human exposure cases handled per day by all US poison centers was 6,937. Similar to other years,higher volumes were observed in the warmer months, with a mean of 7,246 cases per day in June compared with 6,524 perday in January. On average, ignoring the time of day and sea-sonal fluctuations, US PCs re ceived one call concerning a sus- pected or actual human exposure every 13 seconds. Management of calls - specialized poison emergency providers Calls received at US PCs are managed by healthcare profes- sionals who have received additional training in managingexposure emergencies. Poison center operation as well as clinical education and instruc tion are directed by Managing Directors (most are PharmDs an d RNs with American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) board certification). Medical direction is provided by Me dical Directors who are board- certified physician medical toxicologists. At some poisoncenters, the Managing and Medical Director positions areheld by the same person. Specialists in Poison Informa tion (SPIs) are primarily phar- macists and registered nurses. They work under the supervi-sion of a Certified Specialist in Poison Information (CSPI).SPIs must log a minimum of 2,000 calls over a 12 monthperiod at a poison control center to become eligible to take thecertifying examination for specia lists in poison information. Poison Information Providers (PIPs) are allied healthcare professionals. They manage in formation-type and non-medi- cal (non-hospital) calls and wo rk under the supervision of at least one CSPI. US PCs employ the full-time equivalent of123 PIPs, 250 SPIs, and 615 CSPIs.(6) These dedicated indi-viduals make NPDS possible. Review of human exposure data No changes to the data collection format were implementedin 2006. Prior revisions had occurred in 1984, 1985, 1993,2000, 2001, and 2002. Data reported after January 1, 2000,allow an unlimited number of substances for each case, a change that should be considered when comparing substancedata with prior years. Exposure site As shown in Table 2, of the 2,403,539 human exposures reported, 92.6% occurred at a residence (Own or Other). Exposures occurred in the workplace in 2.1% of cases,schools (1.5%), health care facilities (0.29%), and restaurantsor food services (0.37%). Poison center peak call volumeswere from 4 to 11 pm, althou gh call frequency remained con- sistently high between 8 am and midnight, with the majorityof calls logged during this 16-hour period.Age and gender distribution The age and gender distribution of human poison exposure victims is outlined in Table 3. Children younger than 3 years were involved in 38.0% of exposures and 50.9% occurred inchildren younger than 6 years. A male predominance is foundamong recorded cases involving children younger than 13years, but this gender distributi on is reversed in teenagers and adults, with women comprising the majority of reported poi-son exposure victims. Exposures in pregnancy Exposure during pregnancy occurred in 8,919 (0.37% of all human exposures) women. Of those with known pregnancyduration (N = 8,160), 31.7% occurred in the first trimester,37.4% in the second trimester, and 29.8% in the third trimester.Most (74.4%) were unintentional and 19.6% were intentional. Multiple patients In 2006, 10.3% (248,444) of human exposure cases involved multiple patients. Examples of these calls involve siblingssharing found medication, multiple victims of carbon monox-ide exposure such as a family, or multiple patients inhaling vapors at a hazardous material spill. Deaths and fatalities Definitions of fatality and death This 2006 report distinguishes between the terms death and fatality. Death is a reported outcome. Fatality is a death thatwas judged by the Fatality Review Team to be related to theexposure. Of the 1,515 cases re ferred to the Fatality Review Team where death was the reported outcome, 213 cases didnot contain the pertinent clini cal information needed to com- plete an assessment of causal ity (Relative Contribution to Fatality category = 6-Unknown), 31 were judged to be defi-nitely unrelated to the exposures (category = 5-Clearly notresponsible), 26 were not coded and 16 were miscoded (not ahuman death) leaving 1,229 verified fatalities.Table 2.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 825 Summary of fatalities Table 4 presents the age and ge nder distribution for these 1,229 fatalities. Although children younger than 6 years wereinvolved in the majority of exposures, they comprised just2.4% of the verified fatalities. Most (80%) of the poisoningfatalities occurred in 20-to 59- year-old individuals. Table 21A and B lists each of the 1,229 human fatalities along withall of the substances involved. Please note: the Substancelisted in column 3 of Table 21 was chosen to be the most spe- cific based the exact substances entered for that case and maynot agree exactly with the categories used in the summarytables (including Table 22).Enhancements in the Table 21 information in 2006 com- pared to previous years includ e: identification of cases for which an autopsy report was reviewed, inclusion of the rela-tive contribution of fatality, and inclusion of all (rather thanonly 3) of the substances identified in each case. A single substance was implic ated in 91.1% of reported human exposures, and 5.9% of patients were exposed to 2 or more drugs or products (Table 5). In contrast, 673 (54.8%) of fatal case reports involved exposure to 2 or more substances. Although there is us eful information in the fatality experi- ence, one should interpret tota l numbers with caution. Please see the section Poisoning in the US - the Context in theINTRODUCTION provides a perspect ive on the numbers. Chronicity The overwhelming majority of human exposures, 2,192,297 (91.2%) were acute cases (sin gle, repeated or continuous exposure occurring over 8 hours) compared to 652 acute cases of 1,229 fatalities (53.1%). Chronic exposures (con-tinuous or repeated exposures occurring over > 8 hours)comprised 1.9% (45,662) of all human exposures. Acute- on-chronic exposures (single exposure that was preceded byTable 3.

Bronstein et al. a continuous, repeated, or inte rmittent exposure occurring over a period greater than eight hours) numbered 142,954 (6.0%). Reason for exposure Specialists in Poison Informat ion (SPIs) coded the reasons for exposure reported by callers to PCs according to the fol- lowing definitions: Unintentional below:. Environmental: Any passive, nonoccupational exposure that results from contamination of air, water, or soil. Environmen- tal exposures are usually caused by manmade contaminants. Occupational: An exposure that occurs as a direct result of the person being on the job or in the workplace. Therapeutic error: An unintentional deviation from a proper therapeutic regimen that results in the wrong dose, incor-rect route of administration, administration to the wrongperson, or administration of the wrong substance. Onlyexposures to medications or products used as medicationsare included. Drug interactio ns resulting from uninten- tional administration of drugs or foods which are known tointeract are also included. Unintentional misuse: Uninten tional improper use of a nonpharmaceutical s ubstance. Unintentional mis- use differs from intentional misuse in that the exposure was unplanned or not foreseen by the patient. Bite/sting: All animal bites and stings, with or without envenomation, are included. Food poisoning: Suspected or c onfirmed food poisoning; inges- tion of food contaminated with microorganisms is included. Unintentional unknown: An expo sure determined to be unin- tentional, but the exact reason is unknown. Suspected suicidal: An exposu re resulting from the inappro- priate use of a substance for reasons that are suspected to be self-destructive or manipulative. Intentional misuse: An exposu re resulting from the inten- tional improper or incorrect us e of a substance for reasons other than the pursuit of a psyc hotropic or euphoric effect. Intentional abuse: An exposure resulting from the intentional improper or incorrect use of a substance where the victim waslikely attempting to achieve a euphoric or psychotropic effect. All recreational use of substanc es for any effect is included. Intentional unknown: An exposu re that is determined to be intentional, but the specific motive is unknown. Contaminant/tampering: The pati ent is an unintentional vic- tim of a substance that has been adulterated (either mali-ciously or unintentionally) by the introduction of an undesirable substance. Malicious: This category is used to capture patients who are victims of another person's intent to harm them. Withdrawal: Effect related to decline in blood concentration of a pharmaceutical or other substance after discontinuingtherapeutic use or abuse of that substance.Adverse reaction: An adverse event occurring with normal, prescribed, labeled, or recomme nded use of the product, as opposed to overdose, misuse, or abuse. Included are caseswith an unwanted effect because of an allergic, hypersen-sitive, or idiosyncratic response to the active ingredients,inactive ingredients, or exci pients. Concomitant use of a contraindicated medication or food is excluded and coded instead as a therapeutic error. The term \"accidental\" has been used widely in the past pri- marily to define children under the age of 6 who may beexposed to a toxic agent. It is not currently utilized in this context. The term \"intentional\" and \"uni ntentional\" are utilized in this context in the judgment of the poison center specialist.Virtually none of th e cases are subject to a psychological review in this regard and th erefore the use of these terms should be considered on a relative basis without furtherweight to the term. Most (83.4%) of poison exposures were unintentional; sui- cidal intent was suspected in 8. 3% of cases (Table 6A). Ther- apeutic errors accounted for 10.2% of exposures (244,511 cases), with unintentional no npharmaceutical product misuse comprising 4.3% of exposure s. The types of therapeutic errors observed in each age group are summarized in Table 6B.Of the 244,510 therapeutic errors, scenarios included: double-dosing in 76,506 (31.3%), other incorrect dose (14.3%), more than 1 product with the same ingredient(2.7%), dispensing cup errors (2.4%), iatrogenic or errors Table 6A.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 827 (2.2%), incorrect formulation or concentratio n (0.7%), and 10-fold dosing (0.6%). Most (83.4%) were and uninten- tional exposures outnumbered intentional poisonings in allage groups (Table 7). In contrast, of the 1,229 human poison-ing fatalities reported, all of the fatalities in < 13 y-olds wereunintentional while most fatalit ies in adults (older than 19 years) were intentional (Table 8). Route of exposure Ingestion was the route of exposur e in 77.1% of cases (Table 9), followed in frequency by dermal, inhalati on/nasal, and ocular routes. For the 1,229 ingestion, inhalation/nasal, and parenteral were the pr edominant exposure routes. Clinical effects The AAPCC database allows for the coding of up to 131 dif- ferent clinical effects (signs, symptoms, or la boratory abnor- malities) for each case. Each clinical effect can be furtherdefined as related, not related, or unknown if related. Clinicaleffects were coded in 718,828 (29.9%) cases. (16.0% had 1 effect, 7.7% had 2 effects, 3. 9% had 3 effects, 1.4% had 4effects, 0.5% had 5 effects, and 0.4% had >5 effects coded). Of clinical effects coded, 80 % were deemed related to the exposure(s) 9.0% were considered not related, and 11.0%were coded as unknown if related. Case management site The majority of cases repor ted to poison centers (PCs) were managed in a non-health care facility (72.9%), usu-ally at the site of exposure, primarily the patient's own residence (Table 10). This includes the 1.9% of cases thatwere referred to a health care facility but refused to go.Treatment in a health care facility was rendered in 23.5%of cases. Of the 564,159 cases managed in a health care facility, 284,983 (50.5%) were treated and released without admis-sion, 83,563 (14.8%) were admi tted for critical care, and 8.4% were admitted for noncritical care. The percentage of patients tr eated in a health care facility varied considerably with age. Only 11.5% of childrenyounger than 6 years and only 14.3% of children between 6and 12 years were managed in a health care facility compared with 53.3% of teenagers (13-19 years) and 43.6% of adults (age>19 years).Table 6B.

Bronstein et al. Table 11 displays the medical outcome of the human poi- son exposure cases distributed by age, showing a greater inci- dence of severe outcomes in the older age groups. Table 12 compares medical outcome an d reason for exposure and shows a greater frequency of se rious outcomes in intentional exposures. Table 13 demonstrates an increasing duration ofthe clinical effects observed with more severe outcomes. Medical outcome definitions NPDS Medical Outcome categories are as follows: No effect: The patient did not develop any signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure.Minor effect: The patient developed some signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure, but they were minimally both- ersome and generally resolved rapidly with no residual disability or disfigurement. A minor effect is often limitedto the skin or mucus membra nes symptoms, first-degree dermal burn, sinus tachycardia without hypoten-sion, and transient cough). Moderate effect: The patient exhibited signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure that were more pronounced,more prolonged, or more systemic in nature than minorsymptoms. Usually, some form of treatment is indi-cated. Symptoms were not life-threatening, and thepatient had no residual disability or disfigurement (e.g.,corneal abrasion, acid-base di sturbance, high fever, dis- orientation, hypotension that is rapidly responsive to treatment, and isolated brief seizures that respondreadily to treatment). Major effect: The patient exhibited signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure that were life-threatening orresulted in significant residual disability or disfigure-ment (e.g., repeated seizures or status epilepticus, respi- ratory compromise intubation, ventriculartachycardia intravas- cular coagulation). Death: The patient died as a re sult of the exposure or as a direct complication of the exposure. Not followed, judged as nontoxic exposure: No follow-up calls were made to determine the outcome of the exposurebecause the substance implicated was nontoxic, theamount implicated was insignificant, or the route of expo-sure was unlikely to result in a clinical effect. Not followed, minimal clinical effects possible: No follow-up calls were made to determine the patient's outcomebecause the exposure was likely to result in only minimaltoxicity of a trivial nature. (The patient was expected to experience no more than a minor effect.). Unable to follow, judged as a potentially toxic exposure: The patient was lost to follow-up, refused follow-up, or was not followed, but the exposure was significant and mayTable 8.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 829 have resulted in a moderate , major, or fatal outcome. Unrelated effect: The exposure was probably not responsi- ble for the effect. Confirmed nonexposure: This outcome option was coded to designate cases where there was reliable and objective evi-dence that an exposure initia lly believed to have occurred actually never occurred (e.g., all missing pills are laterlocated). All cases coded as confirmed nonexposure areexcluded from this report. Death, indirect report Areported death is coded as \"indirect\" if no inquiry was placed to the poison center. For example, if the case was obtained from a medical examiner who queries the PCabout interpretation of post mortem reports.Tables 14 and 15 outline the use of decontamination proce- dures, specific antidotes, and measures to enhance elimina- tion in the treatment of patien ts reported in this database. These must be interpreted as minimum frequencies because of the limitations of telephone data gathering. Table 16 demonstrates the continuing decline in the use of ipecac-induced emesis in the tr eatment of poisoning. Ipecac was administered in only 1,337 (0.1%) human poison expo-sures in 2006. The continued decrease in ipecac syrup use in2006 compared was observed, like ly as a result of ipecac use guidelines issued in 1997 by the American Academy of Clin- ical Toxicology; European A ssociation of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists and updated in 2004 .(7, 8). In aseparate report, the American Academy of Pediatricsconcluded not only that ipeca c should no longer be usedTable 11.

Although seda- tive/hypnotics/antipsychotics ranks 4 th and cardiovascular 8th among the most frequent exposures (Table 17A), there is oth-erwise little correlation betwee n the frequency of exposures to a substance and the number of fatalities. Note that this Table accounts for all substances to which a patient wasexposed (i.e., a patient exposed to an opioid may have alsobeen exposed to 1 or more other product). Table 19 shows the modest variation over the past 2 decades in the percentage of cases reported to the NPDS's national database that are fata l poisonings and in the percent- age of reported fatalities as a result of suicide. Table 20 provides a summary of plant exposures for those species and categories most commonly involved. Fatality case review - methods Each fatality case was abstract ed by the reporting poison cen- ter and verified for accuracy. These cases were systematicallyreviewed by a project Case Re view Teams (CRT). Each CRT consisted of the following members: Author - the PPC medical director or their designee responsi- ble for the case data entered, the abstract, and the initialchoices of Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) andSUBSTANCES; Lead Reviewer - Medical Dire ctor or Managing Director (assigned from a PC other than the center from which theindividual case originated using pseudorandom numbers)to provide the primary review of the case; Peer Reviewer - Managing Direct or (if the lead reviewer was a Medical Director) or Medical Director (if the lead reviewer was a Managing Director) assigned (using pseu-dorandom numbers) to provide the second (complemen-tary) review of the case; Manager - Louis Cantilena (east coast) or Daniel A. Spyker (west coast) assigned by PC zip code. The fundamental classification for the NPDS fatalities report- ing is whether the toxic exposure caused the death. The reviewteams assessed the following parameters for each fatality case: 1. Relative contribution of the toxic exposure to the death, RCF (see grading system below); 2. Abstract scoring (see scoring system below); 3. Degree of agreement between the Abstract and the NPDS database entries for that case; 4. Degree of agreement and if resolution was required between determinations made by members of the CaseReview TeamTable 15.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 831 Similar to past AAPCC annual reports, a listing of cases (Table 21 A and B) and summary of cases (Tables 4, 18 and 19) is provided for fatal cases for which there exists reason- able confidence that the death was a result of that exposure.Therefore, these listings do no t include cases in which the RCF was determined to be definitely unrelated to the expo-sures (31 cases) or cases wher e the clinical information did not permit an assessment ( RCF unknown, 212 cases). The primary basis of the case classification and abstract evaluations were the: Clinical Case Evidence - includ ed all information surround- ing the case. It included, but was not limited to, the dataentered into the AAPCC case da ta and, when available, the medical examiner's report. Medical Examiner's Report -t he postmortem examination results, autopsy report or th e coroner's report, was always sought, and, when available, became an important part of fatality case review. Relative contribution to fatality (RCF) The definitions used for the Rela tive Contribution to Fatality (RCF) classification were as follows:Table 16.

Undoubtedly responsible (and Proximate Cause of Death) - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt thatthe SUBSTANCES actually caused the death. 2. Probably responsible - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evid ence suggests that the SUB- STANCES caused the death, bu t some reasonable doubt remained. 3. Contributory - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evidence establishes that the SUB- STANCES contributed to the death, but did not solelycause the death. That is, the SUBSTANCES alone would not have caused the death, bu t combined with other fac- tors, were partially re sponsible for the death. 4. Probably not responsible - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evidence, established to areasonable probability, but no t conclusively, that the SUB- STANCES associated with the death did not cause thedeath 5. Clearly not responsible (and Not Contributory) - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evi- dence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the SUB-STANCES did not cause this death. 6. Unknown - In the opinion of the Case Review Team the Clinical Case Evidence was insufficient to impute or refute a causative relationship for the SUBSTANCES inthis death.Table 17C.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 871 Review team procedure A total of 26 review teams (28 individuals) volunteered to participate in the review. Ha lf (13 teams) were Managing Directors and 13 teams were Medical Directors. Names andaffiliations of the reviewers are listed in Appendix A. Train-ing and communication included weekly teleconferences,written guidance documents, spreadsheets (for assignmentand reporting), the NPDS-Fat ality Module (NPDS-FM) and individual telephone contacts. The initial 1514 fatalities wererandomly assigned such that each of the 26 review teams served as Lead Reviewer on 58 or 59 cases and peer reviewedanother similar number of cases for the other (Lead) review-ers. For each fatality assigned, the Lead Reviewer: 1. Recorded their independen t assessment of the Relative Contribution to Fatality; 2. Recorded their assessment of the author's listing and ranking of the SUBSTANCE(S):edited the case abstract(removed all referenc es to names, dates, locations, spe- cific health care facilities or other information whichwould allow identification of the case; use genericproduct names; assure all lab data was associated withcorrect units and times where available and that theabstract and all conclusions were supported by the clin-ical evidence).3. Scored the 6 elements of the abstract using a project scoring scale (hospital records' contribution to thisfatality case assessment (0-2); postmortem / medical examiner's report's to this fatality caseassessment (0-2); the contribution of blood levels to fatal- ity case assessment; quality / completeness, e.g., a mea-sure of the overall quality and completeness of the caseinformation (0-3); novelty value, e.g., a measure of howunusual/interesting the cas e was and outcome of this case (0-3); educational value, e.g., a measure of theteaching value (diagnosis, treatment, and response) to ourcolleagues (0-3). 4. Evaluated the degree of ag reement between the abstract and the NPDS database entries for that case; 5. Led the resolution of any questions with the Case Review team and Manager as required. For each fatality assigned, the Peer Reviewer: 1. Recorded the agreement be tween the abstract and the NPDS database as described above for the Lead reviewer ; 2. Reviewed the decisions of the Lead Reviewer (steps 1-4) and recorded their agreemen t with the Lead Reviewer. Final decisions as to the fatality category and involved substances involved and sequence were derived from theTable 21B.

In mo st cases, the three members of the Case Review Team were able to reach consensus. Deci-sions, which could not be resolved within the Case ReviewTeam, were queried to the re sponsible Manager for review and discussion. Cases judged Unknown (Categor y 6) required an abstract and included a clear statement of the basis for judging themas Unknown: \"The available data do not permit determination of cause of death in this case. No conclusion regarding causality isimplied or inferred by the pu blication of this abstract.\" All but 1 (25 of 26) teams completed their assigned reviews - the unfinish ed assigned cases were reviewed by the other 25 teams or the Managers. Selection of abstra cts for publication The 88 abstracts included in Appendix B were selected for publication in a 3-stage process consisting of qualifying,ranking and reading. Qualifying was based on the RelativeContribution to Fatality (RCF). Project reviewers recom-mended qualifying only RCF = 1, 2 or 3 (Undoubtedly, Prob-ably or Contributory) as eligib le for publication. Qualifying cases thus numbered 1151. Ranking was based on the numberof substances (33%) and weighted abstract scores (67%). Theweightings were the averages chosen by the review teams (step 4 described above). Each was multiplied by the respec- tive factors to obtain a weight ed publication score: Hospital records * 4.43 + Postmortem * 7.6 + Blood levels * 6.9 + Quality /Completeness * 6.4 + Novelty * 5.4 + Educationalvalue * 6.0. The top ranked 150 abstracts were each read by 5 of the individual reviewers (Alsop, Beuhler, Bottei, Geller andScharman) and the 2 managers (Cantilena and Spyker). Each reader judged each abstract as \"publish\" or \"omit\" and all abstracts receiving 4 or more publish votes were selected, further edited and cross-re viewed by the 2 managers. Fatality listing and abstracts Of 1,514 fatalities reported to U.S. Poison Centers in 2006, for 212 cases the clinical information did not permit anassessment of causality, 31 were judged to be definitely unre-lated to the exposures, 26 were not coded and 16 were mis-coded. Tables 21A (Nonpharmaceuticals) and 21B(Pharmaceuticals) provide a case listing of these 1,229 fatal human exposures. Deaths are sort ed in this listing according to the category, substance (deem ed most likely responsible for the death), and patient age. Please note: the Substancelisted in column 3 of Table 21 was chosen to be the most spe- cific based the exact substances entered for that case and maynot agree exactly with the categories used in the summarytables (including Table 22). Ad ditional agents implicated are listed below the primary agent. The fatality cases involved a single substance in 556 cases (45.2%), 2 substances in 272cases (22.1%), 3 in 170 cases (1 3.8%), and 4 or more in the balance of the cases. The cross- references at the end of each major category section list all cases that iden tify this sub- stance in other than the primary substance. The Case number is bold to indicate that the abstract for that case (N=88) is included in Appendix B. The letters following the Case number include: i=reported to poison center indirectly (b y coroner, medical examiner, or other) after the fatality occurr ed in 69 cases (5.6%), p=pre- hospital cardiac and/or respiratory arrest in 482 (39.2%),h=hospital records reviewed in 178 cases (14.5%), a=autopsy report reviewed in 341 cases (27.7%). RCF (39.0%), 3=Contributory in not responsible (6.3%). Chronicity: A=acute exposure in 120(9.8%) and U=unknown in 224 (18.2%). Route of exposure was: Ingestion alone in 930 cases (75.7%), Inhalation/nasal in 80 cases (6.5%), Parenteral in 39cases (3.2%) and multiple routes or unknown in the balance. Reason was: Suspected suic ide in 611 cases (49.7%), cases (7.6%), Intentional-Misusein tal in 32 cases (2.6%), Thera- peutic error in 32 cases (2.6%), Occupational in 24 cases(2.0%), and Malicious in 11 cases (0.89%). Tissue Concentrations for 1 or more related analytes were reported in 627 cases (50.6%). Pediatric fatalities - age less than 6 years There were 29 fatalities reported in children younger than 6 years, similar to numbers re ported over the last decade (Table 19). These pediatric cases represented 2.4% of totalreported fatalities, similar to percentages reported over most of the last 8 years. The perc entage of pediatric fatalities related to total pediatric exposures was 29/1,223,184=0.0024%. By comparison, 1,129/851,932=0.13% of all adult exposures involved a fatality. Of thereported deaths in children younger than 6 years of age, 21were reported as unintentional (Table 8). Four deaths inchildren younger than 6 years of age were coded as result-ing from malicious intent. Of the 21 pharmaceutical-associ- ated fatalities, 6 involved opi oids, 3 involved heparin and 3 antihistamines. The 8 nonpharm aceuticals included 2 car- bon monoxide, 2 hydrocarbon s and 1 each lead, mineral spirits, disc battery and other foreign body. Pediatric fatalities - ages 6-12 years In the age range 6 to 12 years, there were 6 reported fatalities (Table 8) involving 6 differen t substances including acebu- tolol, antihistamine, carbon monoxide, fentanyl, mushrooms-cyclopeptides and pine oil.

AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 891 Adolescent fatalities - ages 13-19 years In the age range 13 to 19 years, there were 62 reported fatali- ties (Table 8) including 47 pharmaceuticals and 15 nonphar-maceuticals, similar to the numb ers reported in this age group reported annually since 1999. The reasons for the adolescent fatalities, 26 were presumed suicides, and 16 were attributed to intentional abuse (Table 8).These numbers are similar to those in most recent years except for 2003 when abuse was the most common reason. As in the past years, only a small number (11 of 62) of ado-lescent fatalities were coded as being unintentional including 6 cases attributed to carbon monoxide. All fatalities - all ages The age distribution of reported fatalities is similar to that in past years with 91.9% (1,130 of 1,229) of fatal cases occur-ring in adults (age > 19 ye ars) including 6 patients of unknown age (Table 4). The most common classes of substances involved across all fatalities were sedative/hypnotics/antipsychotics followedby opioids, cardiovascular and stimul ants/street drugs (Table 18). Of these top 6 classes most frequently involved in fatalities inTable 18 only 4 appear in Table 17A: sedative/hypnotics/antipsychotics ranked 4 th, antidepressants, 9th and cardiovas- cular drugs 11th among exposure frequency. Thus there was little correlation between fre quency of expo sure and fre- quency of fatality. Demographic summary of exposure data Tables 22A (Nonpharmaceutics) and 22B (Pharmaceutics) provide summary demographic data on patient age, reasonfor exposure, medical outcome, and use of a health care facil-ity for all 2,403,539 exposure cases, presented by substancecategories. This table differs from the version of previousyears. The first column counts all exposures to that substance (as in previous years) but the second column (and the break-downs by Age, Treatment Site, Reason, and Outcome) reportsingle substance exposures on ly. Single substance cases reflect most (91.1%) of all expo sures (Table 5). This table for 2006 restricts the breakdown columns to single-substancecases to improve precision (avo id misrepresentation). In past years when multi-sub stance exposures were included, a rela- tively innocuous substance was mentioned in a death columnwhen, for example, the death was attributed to an antidepres- sant, opioid, or cyanide. This subtlety was not always appre- ciated by the casual user of th e information. The restriction of the breakdowns to single -substance exposures should increase precision and reduce mi srepresentation of the results in this unique by-substance table. Tables + In 16.8% of exposures that involved pharmaceutical substances the reason for e xposure was intentional, com- pared to only 3.0% when the exposure involved a nonphar-maceutical substance. Correspondingly, treatment in ahealth care facility was provided in a higher percentage ofexposures that involved pharmaceutical substances(26.3%) compared with nonpharmaceutical substances(14.5%). Exposures to pharmaceuticals also had moresevere outcomes. Of single- substance implicated fatal cases, 506 were pharmaceuticals compared with 218 nonp-harmaceuticals. Fatalities associated with single substance exposures tabu- lated 22B included: and 1 meperidine), 57 acetaminophen, 46 carbon mon- oxide, 25 cocaine, 22 cardiac glycoside, 17 cyclicantidepressants (6 amitriptyline, 2 doxepin, 1 combined witha phenothiazine, 1 desipramine and 7 unspecified cyclic anti-depressants), 17 ethylene gl ycol, aspirin, 13 calcium antagonist, 12 diphenhydramine, 11 atypical antipsychoticand 10 beverage ethanol.

Case records in this database arefrom self-reported calls: they reflect only information pro- vided when the public or heal thcare professionals report an actual or potential exposure to a substance (e.g., an ingestion,inhalation, or topical exposure, etc.), or request information/educational materials. Exposure s do not necessarily represent a poisoning or overdose. The AAPCC is not able to com- pletely verify the accuracy of every report made to member centers. Additional exposures may go unreported to PCs anddata referenced from the AAPCC should not be construed torepresent the complete incidence of national exposures to any substance(s). Rev.

Appendix B - Abstracts of selected cases Abstracts of the 88 cases selected (see Selection of Abstractsfor Publication) from 1,229 huma n fatalities judged related to a poisoning exposure as reported to U.S. Poison Centers in2006. A structured format for abstracts was optional in the preparation of the abstracts and was used in the abstracts pre-sented. Abbreviations, units and normal ranges omitted fromthe abstracts are given at the end of this appendix Abstracts Case 2. Acute formic acid ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 48 y/o male ingested about 1 cup of an unknown pesticide obtained where he worked as abeekeeper. At 15 min the patient was awake and alertwithout nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or sweating, but was\"breathing fast\". EMS found the patient barely responsiveand very hypotensive despite maximal IV fluids, dopam-ine and norepinephrine. The liquid in the unlabeled bottletested acidic with pH paper. EMS believed the patient hadingested formic acid. The patient arrived in the ED andwas intubated.Past Medical History: Not provided. Physical Exam: BP 161/79, HR 105, R 28, T 39\u00b0C. On a vent, PEEP 10, O 2 sat 95% on 100% FI O2. O2 sat decreasedinto the 70s when th e patient was laying flat. The patient had burns on the face, entire mouth and vocal cords.Laboratory Data: ABG-pH 6.84 / pCO 2 58 / p O2 159 / HCO3 10, O2 sat 97% on 100% Clinical Course: The patient received 1 ampule sodium bicarbonate IV push and star ted on an IV infusion. The patient had aspirated the formic acid, had noisy soundinglungs and they suctioned bloody frothy fluid from the lungs.Bronchoscopy showed burns to the upper airway and all theway down which were consistent with acid aspiration. Endos-copy was deferred due to the pa tient's instability. At 6 h, the patient had a cardiac arrest, and could not be resuscitated.Autopsy Findings: Cause of death: severe metabolic acidosis due to intentional ingestion of formic acid. Other findings:third degree chemical burns around mouth and involving oral,esophageal, gastric mucosa, and proximal small bowelmucosa, second degree chemical burn on left thumb, second-ary superficial chemical fixation of heart, left lung, diaphragm,spleen, left kidney, pancreas, liver, colon, aorta, and serosalsurfaces of the abdominal, pericardial, and left pleural cavities,cardiac hypertrophy, and mild obesity. Only lidocaine (used inCPR) was detected in a post mortem femoral blood sample. Case 31. Acute ingestion, methanol: probably responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 29 y/o male was arrested and taken to local jail where he ingested mo onshine containing methanol. Past Medical History: Alcoholism, bipolar disorder. Physical Exam: Obtunded, HR 87, BP 139/83 mm Hg, T 37\u00b0C, and RR 22.Laboratory Data: pH 7.1, serum osmolarity 430, methanol concentrations of 348, 346, 333 and 38 mg/dL were recorded during CVVHD.Clinical Course: The patient was intubated, given IV fluids with sodium bicarbonate and a dose of IV ethanol prior to transfer to a tertiary care fac ility. At the facility, the patient was hypothermic (34\u00b0C), acidotic (pH 6.9 / pCO 2 25, HCO3 4.8), tachycardic (114 /min), and displayed dilated and unre-sponsive Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis wasperformed for two days and fomepizole was given IV, twicedaily for 3 days until the osmolar gap was zero. The patientexpired on Day 4, when support was withdrawn per the fam-ily's request after the patient remained unresponsive and a brain MRI and EEG showed \"extensive damage\".Autopsy Findings: Cerebral edema, herniation, and petechial Case 36. Acute methanol ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 44 y/o male presented to the ED with delirium, muscle spasti city and diaphoresis. The ED staff suspected meth anol or ethylene glycol ingestion. Past Medical History: Unknown. Physical Exam: Altered mental statusNa 136 Cl 106 Glu 173 K 4.6 HCO3 6 Cr 1.4 Clinical Toxicology Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 65.246.27.162 on 07/11/14 For personal use only. 896 Bronstein et al. Laboratory Data: ABG-pH <6.80 Serum osmolality was with calculated gap of 150 mOsm/L. Methanolserum concentration on admissi on was 288 mg/dL. After 5 h of dialysis the methanol was 18 mg/dL. Urine was negativefor acetone or calcium oxalate crystals. Salicylic acid, ace-taminophen and ethanol and et hylene glycol concentrations were negative. ECG showed transient ST segment elevations.Clinical Course: The patient was intubated on arrival, received a loading dose of fomepizole and dialysis was instituted. Initialhead CT was normal. Fomepizole therapy was continued duringdialysis. The patient was given 50 grams of mannitol prior to asecond dialysis. Approximately 12 h after presentation thepatient developed a significant left-sided intracranial hemor-rhage and expired. No autopsy was performed. Case 42. Acute brake fluid ingestion: undoubtedly responsible. Scenario/Substances: A 47 y/o man was found down in his room under his dresser. Used brake fluid had been discardedin a 2 liter cola bottle and buri ed in the trash in the garage. The patient, who was profoundly mentally disabled, likedcola and may have retrieved it from the trash. The patient'smother recalled seeing a styrofoam cup in the kitchen con-taining an oily substance.Past Medical History: Mental retardation, seizure disorder, hypertension. Medications in hydrochlorothiazide, lithium, quetiapine, phenytoin, thiothixene and haloperidol. Physical the ED with sei- zures and coma.Laboratory Data: Day 1 lactate 2.8, lithium, 1.5, urine drug screen negative, salicylates-none detect ed, Day 3 calcium 7.3, propylene glycol 7.0, diethylene glycol 38 mg/dL, methanol, eisopranol) neg- ative, Day 6 BUN 65, Cr 4.6, Day 8 BUN 73, Cr 5.0, Day 9:BUN 106, Cr 6.3, Day 12 BUN 70, Cr 5.2.Clinical Course: Renal failure progre ssed and hemodialysis initiated on Day 3 of hospitalization. The patient remainedencephalopathic, with no purposeful movements and expiredon Day 13. Cause of death was toxic encephalopathy.Autopsy Findings: (external examination) found cause of death was inadvertent drinking of brake fluid and its compli-cations, mental retardation was contributory. Case 60. Acute ethylene glycol ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 53 y/o male was found with altered mental status after reportedly dr inking up to 16 ounces of eth- ylene glycol antifreeze.Physical Exam: On presentation in the ED the patient was unresponsive, HR 88, BP 140/60, RR 32.Laboratory Data included Ca 8.7, ABG-pH 7.26 / pCO 2 37 / HCO3 16, ethanol none detected. Measured osmolality was 502 mOsm/L, osmolargap 210 mOsm/L (from osmolality the electro-lytes of 301 mOsm/L). Ethylen e glycol concentration on Day was 1,540 mg/dL.Clinical Course: Progressive renal fa ilure ensued despite therapy with fomepizole and 8 hemodialysis runs over thenext 6 days. Altered mental status persisted and death occurred on Day 7. No autopsy was performed. Case 75. Acute cyanide ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 27 y/o male left a suicide note at home and presented to the ED for unknown reasons where hewent into a bathroom, and shortly after walking out, had acardiopulmonary arrest.Past Medical History: Testicular cancer. Physical Exam: Vital signs cardiac arrest BP 100/ 42, HR 140.Laboratory was with atro- pine, bicarbonate, calcium, ep inephrine and a cyanide kit (amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, sodium thiosulfate). White powder was noted in his underwear. The addition of thereagent testing for heroin (m ost likely Marquis reagent or sulfuric acid) resulted in the vial exploding, suggesting thepresence of hydrogen cyanide generated from sodium cya-nide. The patient required intubation and pressors afterresuscitation. A singl e dose of activated charcoal was given. In the ICU additional IV sodium thiosulfate (total of 3 dosesgiven) was given. 3 h after th e arrest: pH 7.34, lactate 2. The patient became hypotensive and tachycardic and exhib- ited evidence of brain death. He expired 48 h after presenta- tion and his organs (liver, kidne ys and heart) harvested for donation.Autopsy Findings: Cerebral edema and herniation. Antemortem toxicology of gastric contents revealed 7.3 g/ml of cyanide. Antemortem blood thiocyanate was 60 g/ml, drawn approximately 8 h after the patient. ingested the cyanide. Case 76. Acute cyanide ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 32 y/o male ingested cyanide in a suicide attempt, vomited and co llapsed. EMS arrived 15 min after collapse and found the pati ent to have pulseless electri- cal activity. Resuscitation efforts were initiated and thepatient was transported to the ED; atropine and epinephrine administered en route.Past Medical History included depression with prior suicide attempts.Na 143 Cl 110 BUN 19 Glu 149 K 3.8 HCO3 19 Cr 0.7 Na 149 Cl 116 BUN 45 K 3.3 HCO3 8 Cr 2.8Na 145 Cl 105 BUN 14 Glu 106 K 3.3 HCO3 16 Cr 1.1 Clinical Toxicology Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 65.246.27.162 on 07/11/14 For personal use only. AAPCC 2006 Annual Report of the NPDS 897 Laboratory Data: ABG-pH 7.2% after sodium nitrite.Clinical Course: In the ED, the Glasgow Coma Score was 3, CPR was continued and cyanide antidote (Na Nitrite300 mg IV and thiosulfate 12.5 g IV) was administered.The patient had return of BP to 150 systolic, after 80 minof CPR with HR 80, T 32.7\u00b0 C. Pupils dilated and nonreac-tive to light. The patient was pronounced brain dead 36 hafter admission. Death was attributed to brain anoxia dueto cardiac arrest from cyanide overdose. No autopsy find-ings were available. Case 77. Acute cyanide ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 44 y/o male from Southeast Asian obtained a white and gray colo red rock from a Hmong herb- alist. The patient became obtunded soon after biting into it.EMS intubated and transported him to the ED.Clinical Course: The patient arrived at the hospital nearly apneic with ABG-pH 7.18 / pCO 2 14.9 and shortly thereafter had a cardiac arrest. Respiratory support wascontinued for 48 h. An EEG was compatible with brain death, and the patient was taken off the ventilator andexpired on Day 3.Autopsy Findings: Analysis of the rock showed inorganic cyanide, and death was ascr ibed to cyan ide toxicity. Case 78. Acute cyanide ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 44 y/o male shot someone, got into a car and drove a short distance, got out and ran a short dis-tance and then collapsed. The patient was found apneic and pulseless.Past Medical History: The patient had previously made threats \"to shoot individuals an d then take cyanide\" in 1993 and was found to possess cyanide at that time. Laboratory Data included pH 6.9, lactate 25, CK 183, ace- taminophen and salicylates no ne detected, urine toxicology screen negative.Clinical Course: The patient was initially intubated and resuscitated with return of spontaneous circulation. The patient remained hypotensive, unconscious and unresponsive. Cyanide exposure was not in itially appreciated and the patient was managed symptomati cally and supportively post- resuscitation, including norepi nephrine for support. When lactate remained elevated despite adequate oxygenation and perfusion (~4 h post-arriva l) the patient nitrite and sodi um thiosulfate, with improvement and was w eaned from the pressors. The patient remained unconscious and unresponsive, with dilatedand fixed pupils. Support was withdrawn and the patientexpired on Day 3.Autopsy Findings included pre-mortem blood cyanide 7.2 mg/L. Death was ruled secondary to cyanide toxicity and anoxic brain injury.Case 87. Acute ethylene glycol ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A male in his 50's was found unre- sponsive outside on a cold dayPast Medical History: None available.

Urinedrug screen negative and se rum acetaminophen, salicylates, and ethanol were all undetected. ECG showed sinus rhythmat 67, QRS 92 msec, QTc 420 msec T waves tall and peaked, no Osborne waves noted.Clinical Course: The patient was intubated and ventilated, received sodium bicarbonate lo ading and was put on a bicar- bonate infusion in addition to boluses of calcium gluconate,insulin, D50 and ceftriaxone. Head CT was unremarkable.The patient was treated for diabe tic ketoacidosis with an insu- lin infusion until serum Glu normalized. The patient devel-oped generalized tonic-clonic seizures treated with IVlorazepam followed by phenobarbital and he was placed on apropofol infusion. The acidosis worsened and ABG 5 hshowed pH 6.73 / pCO 2 22.4 which improved slightly to pH, 6.86 / pCO2 20. A toxic alcohol screen was sent and the patient was started on fomepizo le, thiamine, pyridoxine, and folinic acid. initiated. post-dialysis ethylene glycol was 15 and acidosisresolved. On Day 2 the patien t became hypotensive requiring pressor and inotropic support. Ethylene glycol was 7. On Day 3 the patient was unresponsive, calcium 6.1, Cr 6.2, pupilswere fixed and dilated and was not assisting the ventilator. The patient expired on Day 3. No autopsy was performed. Case 94. Acute ingestion, ethylene glycol: probably responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 75 y/o male admitted the night before the PC inquiry with presumed CVA.

Acute cleaning liquid ingestion (pine oil): contributory . Scenario/Substances: An 8 y/o male was brought to the ED in cardiopulmonary arrest afte r reportedly ingesting a pineoil-containing cleaner. Aggr essive CPR was not successful and the patient ex pired in the ED. Past Medical History: There were previous reports of sexual and physical abuse. According to the coroner's investigative report, the child had vomited in the bedroom and bathroom.A blender was found with some sort of bleach and pine oil-containing cleaner mixture. Th ere were numerous bottles of the cleaner found lying ar ound the home. The mother explained that the child urinat ed all over the house and that she used the cleaner to clean up the mess and reduce the odor of urine.Autopsy Findings: Multiple contusions and scars consistent with cord or strap injuries. Co nfluent injuries of the buttocks and hips, and subcutaneous hemorrhage of the left arm. Cir-cumferential scars of wrists and ankles consistent with oldligature marks. Superficial cutaneous ulceration of the penisconsistent with chemical injury , a thin subcutaneous fat layer was consistent with starvation. Postmortem la boratory analy- sis: isopropyl alcohol (4) and acetone (23), stomach contents positive for ethanol (78) judged to be due to postmortem pro-duction. Official cause of d eath reported as \"Generalized acute and chronic cutaneous trauma due to battered child syn-drome, and ketoacidosis\" Case 108. Acute caustic ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 52 y/o male ingested drain cleaner (active ingredient was concentrat ed sulfuric acid) in an appar- ent suicide attempt.Past Medical History: History of prior suicide attempt. Physical Exam: BP 153/116, HR 122, RR 28, T 36.7\u00b0C, O 2 sat by pulse oximetry was 99%.

The patient was rigid, lungs were clear to auscultation with assisted breaths. There were no detectable vital signs in the ED.Laboratory Data: Carboxyhemaglobin concentration 60%. Per the fire department, just outside the home the carbon monoxide concentration was 250 parts per million.Clinical Course: The patient was asystolic with CPR in progress. The patient was endotracheally intubated and epi-nephrine and atropi ne were administered via the ET tube. Epinephrine and atropine were repeated IV without return of spontaneous circulation. Th e patient was re-warmed but remained asystolic. A bedside ultrasound revealed cardiacstandstill. No autopsy was performed. Case 160. Acute inhalation of caustic fumes: contributory . Scenario/Substances: A 78 y/o female lost consciousness while using a drain cleaner cont aining chlorine and bleach to clean her bathroom. The patient was found down and trans-ported to the ED.Past Medical History: included asthma and heart disease. Clinical Course: In the ED the patient was unresponsive, pupils were fixed and dilated. The patient was intubated andstarted on norepinephrine for hypotension. The patient wasresuscitated from a cardiac ar rest shortly after arrival but expired a few h later. Death was judged due to an acuteasthma attack following inhalation of caustic fumes.Autopsy Findings documented microscopic changes consis- tent with acute and chronic asthma, and emphysematouschanges of the lungs, hyperten sive and atherosclerotic cardio- vascular disease. Toxicological testing did not detect alcoholor drugs of abuse. Case 166. Acute butane inhalation: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: An18 y/o male wa s huffing butane at a public park with friends when he suddenly collapsed.Friends initiated CPR and called EMS.Past Medical History: substance abuse. Physical Exam: EMS found the patient unresponsive with no pulse, apneic, and cyanotic. There were no visible signs oftrauma and continued resuscitative measures.Clinical Course: The patient and bicarbona te, defibrillation, and CPRduring the 35 min transport to the ED. On arrival to the ED the patient's pupils were fixed and dilated and he was withoutrespiratory effort. Physical exam showed diffuse purpuric discoloration to the head, face and neck, and dependent livid-ity. ECG showed fine ventricula r fibrillation versus asystole. CPR was continued and the patien t received additional bicar- bonate, naloxone 1.6 mg and additional defibrillations. After45 min of unsuccessful ACLS measures, the patient was pro- nounced dead. The death was attributed to cardiopulmonaryarrest secondary to suspected substance abuse.Autopsy Findings included blood analyses positive for butane and ruled the manner of death as a probable accidentdue to acute butane intoxication. Case 168. Acute aluminum phosphide pellet ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 27 y/o male noted by coworkers in the grain elevator to exhibit a decreasing concentration of consciousness vomiting and then collapsed. The patient wasconfused on awakening, but was able to talk.

Urine was positive forcannabinoids.Clinical Course: On arrival at the ED the patient was unre- sponsive, skin was mottled, pupils were fixed and dilated andECG showed tachyarrhythmia. Th e patient was intubated and beta blockers were initiated. The patient remained unrespon-sive with fixed and dilated pupils. Chest film showed a left-lower lobe infiltrate and the pa tient was treated with antibiot- ics. Shortly after admission the patient developed refractoryhyperthermia despite treatment with a cooling protocol. Ahead CT on hospital Day 2 showed subarachnoid blood, dif-fuse edema and changes consistent with anoxic injury to the basal ganglia. The patient ha d absent brainstem reflexes, fixed and dilated pupils and no spontaneous respiratoryeffort. Brain death was declared on Day 2, comfort measureswere instituted and the patient expired. Death was attributed to anoxic brain injury and mu ltiorgan system failure due to cardiac arrest and prolonged asystole from abuse of a productcontaining difluoroethane.Autopsy Findings included: History of \"huffing\" with col- lapse (clinical), facial abrasi ons, history of anoxic brain injury (clinical) with moderate to severe cerebral edema and history of diffuse subarachnoi d hemorrhage on admission CT (clinical) with no subarachnoid hemorrhage noted onautopsy. Analytical results responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 31 y/o female presented to the ED after drinking about 6 ounces of 25% diazinon.Past Medical History included a suicide attempt the weekprior by drinking pyrethrins.Clinical Course: The patient was asymptomatic on presenta- tion and was admitted to the IC U for observation and support. 17.5 h after the ingestion, th e patient developed respiratory distress and coughing which progressed to cyanosis. Thepatient was intubated and CPR was initiated but could not beresuscitated.Autopsy Findings: Cause of death was the toxic effects of diazinon based on: a strong odor of the body and viscera, ahistory of ingesting the contents of a bottle labeled \"diazi- non\", diazinon recovered from the aces and plasma cholinesterase concen- trations and multifocal neur of the Case 202. Acute pesticide inhalation: probably responsible . Scenario/Substances: The roommate of a 28 y/o male set off 2 roach foggers containing te tramethrin and permethrins in their apartment. They left the house for several h after thefogging. When they returned, they opened a ll the windows and left again for another h. Up on returning, the patient had some respiratory dist ress, but symptoms resolved on their own. The next day they both went to work. Upon returningfrom work, the patient began to \"feel bad\". At midnight, thepatient's condition deteriorated and he agreed to be taken to the ED.Past Medical History: The patient was reluctant to seek help, probably because he was not a US citizen. The patient had run out of \"heart medicine s\" and hadn't taken any for 2m o n t h s .Laboratory Data: Urine and blood toxicology screening were negative.Clinical Course: The patient arrived at the ED with dyspnea and flash pulmonary edema. The patient had a seizure, pul-monary and then cardiopulmonary arrest and could not beresuscitated. Clinical Toxicology Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 65.246.27.162 on 07/11/14 For personal use only. 902 A.C. Bronstein et al. Autopsy Findings: Cause of death was acute respiratory fail- ure (h) due to aerosol inhalation in an enclosed space (h).Anatomic findings included ma rked cardiomega ly with left ventricular hypertrophy and subs equent changes of long term heart failure including pleural effusions and congestion of the liver and spleen. The medications with the patient consistedof two BP control agents, 1 a calcium channel blocker. Based on the kidney changes observed, hypertension was likelydriven by primary renal disease. Had such natural disease not been present, the aerosol exposu re would likely have resulted in no illness. This individual however was at risk due to hisdisease. Case 204. Anaphylaxis to honey bee envenomation: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 29 y/o male farm worker collapsed in a field shortly after being stung by a bee. The patient wasdriven by co-workers to a clinic where resuscitation wasattempted with epinephrine, lidocaine, intubation and cardio-version. The patient was stabilized and transported to the ED.Clinical Course: In the ED, prolonged resuscitation restored BP. Pupils were fixed and dilated following resuscitation, andpressors were required to main tain blood. Ventilatory and BP support were continued for about 32 h when the patientexpired.Autopsy Findings: Post mortem toxico logy testing showed honeybee venom IgE detected in serum at a concentration of0.77 kU/L, consistent with a \"moderate concentration\".Cause of death was \"anoxic encephalopathy, anaphylacticshock and allergy bee venom.\" Case laundry dete rgent ingestion: undoubtedly responsible . Scenario/Substances: A 89 y/o aspirated while drinking a of liquid laundry detergent.Past Medical History: Alzheimer's dementia, CHF. Physical Exam: Coarse breath sounds with rhonchi.
