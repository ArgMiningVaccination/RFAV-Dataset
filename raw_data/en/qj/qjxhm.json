Neither one is better nor worse, but understanding what to expect may help make the transition easier . Pediatrics Adult Parent/guardian is in charge of most of your care needs Care is self -directed (as an adult, you are in charge) Parent/guardian usually tells the docto r about how you have been doing You give the doctor your medical history since your last visit Parent/guardian help s to schedule your appointments You schedule your own appointments Support services are offered for financial and emotional issues You can ask for financial or emotional support services based on your needs Transportation to your appointments is usually provided or arranged by an adult You must provide or arrange your own transportation Your parent/guardian has insurance or health benef its By age 26, you must have your own insurance or health benefits The above chart provides a very simple overview of some differences between pediatric and adult care . Every body comes with different experiences with their own healthcare. We value you and are here to help you with the transition process. For some of you , that may mean assuming new roles and responsibilities , for others it may not. Regardless of where you are coming from, an important part of becoming an independent adult is working towards assuming responsibility of your health care. 7 Navigating BMC and the Health Care System Keeping track of medical appointments When you make a medical appointment make sure you get a card with the date, time and location on it. Write your appointment down in your calendar or put it in your phone right away. You should get a reminder call and receive a reminder letter ahead of time. However, do not depend on this! Make sure you are keeping track of your own appointments. If you ar e not going to be able to keep your appointment, call as soon as possible to reschedule - this way your canceled appointment can be filled by other patients who need to see their provider. Getting prescriptions filled/refilled Do not wait until you run o ut of medicine to call and ask for a refill. If there are refills left on your prescription, call the pharmacy phone number on the bottle and you can directly refill it yourself. Take ownership, when you have an appointment check your medication first. At the appointment, ask for any prescription refills you need. **Prescriptions for opioid pain medication must be given to you in person ; always make sure you have some pain medication at home in case you need it. When you are starting to get low, call for a refill, or ask at your next visit. Utilizing the Emergency Department If you are having pain at home first follow you r sickle cell pain plan; if you need advice see the table on page 3 and call your doctor to discuss what you should do. Even if you think you need to come to the ED, paging the doctor ahead of time can sometimes help speed things along. If you ever need to be seen at an outside ED it is particularly important to page your hematologist; otherwise we will not know you are there and canno t help them take the best possible care of you. Primary Care Your hematologist is a specialist in Sickle Cell Disease; however, there is a lot more to maintaining your health than just following up with your hematologist! It is extremely important to have a primary care doctor who can help with routine medical needs and coordinating care with different specialists . You should see your primary care doctor for a regular check -up once or twice a year. 8 Facts about Sickle Cell Disease How did I get Sickle Cell Disease? You cannot \"catch\" Sickle Cell Disease ; it is inherited. That means that to have Sickle Cell Disease you have received one gene for the disease from each of your parents. One gene means you are a carrier , two genes mean you have the disease. Everyone has two genes for hemoglobin (the protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen), one from each parent. \"A\" is normal hemoglobin, and \"S\" is sickle hemoglobin. If both parents have one normal gene and one sickle gene, they have AS, also known as Sickle Cell Trait . Each of their children has a one in four chance of inheriting Sickle Cell Disease (SS). Each child has a 25% chance (1/4) of inheriting two normal genes (AA), a 50% chance (2/4) of inheriting one normal gene and one abnormal gene (AS or Sickle Cell Trait), and a 25% chance (1/4) of inheriting two abnormal genes (SS). Inheriting two abnormal sickle genes gives a child \"SS\" or Sickle Cell Anemia. The picture below illustrates how someone can get Sickle Cell Disease (SS) from his/her parents. From NH LBI http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health -topics/topics/sca/causes.html Some people have a \"C\" gene which is another variation of hemoglobin. If you have \"SC\" then you have a different type of Sickle Cell Disease. 9 The image below shows how someone can get Sickle Cell \"SC\" Disease from his/her parents. From CDC http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/traits.html Some people inherit a combination of Sickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia. Beta Thalassemia is a condition, which occurs when not enough (beta) hemoglobin is made. If one parent has \"AS\" (Sickle Cell Trait) and one parent has \u00df\u00b0 (Beta) Thalassemia trait, there is a 25% chance for each child to have Si ckle- \u00df\u00b0 Thalassemia. Can I pass on Sickle Cell Disease to my children? Yes! If you have \"SS\" and you have children with someone who has Sickle Cell Trait \"AS\" then each child has a 50% chance (1/2) of having Sickle Cell Disease \"SS\" as illustrated in the table below. If your partner has only normal hemoglobin all your children will be carriers of the disease and no one will have the disease. You can prevent this from being a surprise by making sure your partner know s their sickle status. Your partner's parents may be able to tell them their sickle status . To be sure, your partner can ask their doctor for a hemoglobin electrophoresis test. If you or your partner were born after the early 1990's in the United States, it is likely that you were screened with newborn screening tests for Sickle Cell Disease and other abnormal hemoglobi n. If you were born outside the United States it is possible you were not tested as a baby. 10 Sickle Cell Inheritance If I have... If my partner has... Our children may have...

No, your genes do not change. The symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease may change when you get older, but if you are born with \"SS\" you will always have \"SS.\" Is there a cure? The on e cure for Sickle Cell Disease is a stem cell transplant, usually from a brother or sister with the same mom and dad. Talk with your doctor to find out if this is an option for you. 11 What are the complications of Sickle Cell Disease? Sickle Cell Disease affects many organs/systems in the body. Complications are caused by the abnormal ' sickle' shape of the red blood cells as well as inflammation and hemolysis (breakdown of red cells). These can often be prevented or reduced if you are well -monitored by your doctor and follow the preventative recommendations in your sickle cell care plan. We recommend always keeping regular clinic appointments and following up with specialists. Some common complications other than pain include: Acute Chest Syndrome: Acute chest syndrome is caused by sickled hemoglobin trapped in the small blood vessels of the lungs. This causes shortness of brea th, fever and chest pain. It can be triggered by a chest infection such as pneumonia. Acute chest syndrome can also develop before, during, or after an episode of sickle cell pain. This is why it is so important to use your incentive spirometer if you are admitted for a pain episode. o Acute chest syndrome is a medical emergency and requires hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics and may require a blood transfusion. If you think you are experiencing acute chest syndrome or any problems with your chest come to the ER immediately , calling ahead to let the staff know you are coming in sick. Eye problems: Sickle Cell Disease can lead to obstruction of blood vessels in the retina, part of the back of the eye. This ca n, over time, lead to problems with vision. If this sickle retinopathy is detected early it can be treated. For this reason, we recommend that everyone with Sickle Cell Disease have a dilated eye exam by an eye doctor every year. Gallstones: When the hem oglobin in red blood cells breaks down in the body, it releases bilirubin. In an individual with Sickle Cell Disease, the red blood cells are constantly being broken down and bilirubin forms rapidly. Excessive bilirubin in the body can form hard substances in the gallbladder called gallstones. o People with gallstones usually have pain at the upper right side of the abdomen, under the right shoulder, or between the shoulder blades. They may also have nausea, vomiting, fever, sweating, chills, pale colored st ool, dark urine or yellowish discoloration of the eyes. If you have repeated episodes of pain from your gallbladder, the hematologist or the surgeon may recommend its surgical removal. Infection: In people with Sickle Cell Disease, the spleen stops wor king well in childhood, increasing the risk of frequent infection. You should receive a flu shot every year and get all available vaccines against infections. Always call your doctor or report to the hospital if you have a fever (greater than 101.3 ), which might be a sign of serious infection. Leg Ulcers: People with Sickle Cell Disease may have one or more sores on the leg called ulcers. This is often found in the lower third of the legs. Ulcers can sometimes persist for 12 years or re -occur after h ealing. If you have any ulcers show your doctor as the doctor does not always look at your legs and may not know that you have this. Priapism: This is a painful erection that occurs in males with Sickle Cell Disease. It is caused by a blockage of blood f low out of an erect penis. If you experience priapism treat it like you would a pain episode \u2014drink lots of fluids, take a warm shower, use your pain medication, and attempt to urinate. If the erection lasts for more than 1 hour go to the emergency room si nce prolonged priapism can lead to impotence. Call ahead to let staff know that you are coming in with this problem. Pulmonary Hypertension: The blood vessels in the lungs can be damaged by the sickled cells making it difficult for the heart to pump bloo d through the lungs. This eventually leads to an increased blood pressure in the lungs. This is one reason we may recommend that you see a pulmonary (lung) specialist in your late teen or early twenties, so that this can be detected early. Splenic Seques tration: The spleen is an organ in the body found in the upper left part of the abdomen, under the rib cage. It helps to separate abnormal red blood cells from the normal ones, and also fights infections. In people with Sickle Cell Disease, the spleen may trap both abnormal and normal red cells. The abnormal cells may block the normal flow of blood out of the spleen. This makes the spleen become big and sometimes painful. When the spleen traps many cells and anemia follows this is known as splenic sequestr ation. Splenic sequestration is more common in young children, but if you have sudden pain in your left upper abdomen call your doctor right away. Stroke: The blood vessels in the brain can also be blocked by sickled cells. This may reduce the blood suppl y with oxygen t o the brain causing a condition called stroke. Common symptoms of stroke include weakness in the arms, feet or legs, slurred speech, changes in vision, severe headache and vomiting. In patients with Sickle Cell Disease a stroke can also be caused by bleeding in the brain. Stroke is common in young children with Sickle Cell (SS and S beta zero Thalassemia) Disease and older people with these forms of the disease. When you were younger if you have SS disease or S beta zero thalassemia , your d octor will have ordered Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound studies. If you have not had an abnormal TCD study by your teenage years it is less likely that you will have a stroke. Ask your doctors if want to know more about strokes and your risk of havin g one. 13 Pain What causes pain? People with Sickle Cell Disease have red blood cells that form ' sickle' or half -moon shapes (see next page). These sickle shaped cells can stick in the blood vessels, block blood flow, and cause pain (which is called vaso -occlusive pain). When the individual with Sickle Cell Disease is well, most of his or her red cells are shaped like those of people without the disease. It is when the individual with Sickle Cell Disease is stressed or sick that the cells become sickle shaped. Vaso -occlusive pain can be triggered by factors such as cold weather, having an infection, being dehydrated, or stress. You can help prevent some pain episodes by avoiding these kinds of triggers. Some women with Sickle Cell Disease notice they have more sickle pain around the time of their period. If this happens to you, please discuss it with your doctor. Sometimes hormone therapy may help reduce the frequency or severity of the pain . The two pictures below show the difference between normal red blood cells in the blood vessel and sickled red blood cells , and how the sickled red cells can block blood flow to organs which often results in painful episodes. From NHLBI: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health -topics/topics/sca/ 14 How can I prevent pain? Always dress appropriately for the weather; make sure you have warm clothes with you in case the t emperature drops. Limit your time outside when it is very cold. If you go swimming, always swim in a heated pool. Keep yourself well hydrated (drink between 2 -3 liters of water a day) ; Sickle Cell Disease causes your kidneys not to hold water well so you will need to drink extra fluids, especially if it is warm outside or when you are exercising. How do I treat my pain? You should have an individual pain treatment plan that you have discussed with your doctor. This should include: Drinking extra fluids. Using warm packs or taking a warm shower or bath. Using your anti -inflammatory medicine (ibuprofen /motrin/advil/naprosyn ) and a short - acting opioid medicine (such as oxycodone ) when pain starts. It is OK to take a short acting opioid with an anti -inflammatory medication together, and the sooner you sta rt treating your pain the better. Using deep breathing, guided imagery, meditation (Please refer to pages 19 -20 for more information). If your pain is not controlled or you have any questions, call your hematologist. Sometimes we can give you advice over the phone to treat your pain and keep you out of the emergency room. Always make sure to have pain medication with you at home, at school, or in your bag if you might be spending time away from home. If you are traveling, call your doctor to let her know, keep your prescriptions in their original bottles, and stay hydrated. Refills (paper copies of scripts) for opioids (Oxycodone, Percocet, Tylenol with Codeine, Dilaudid or Long Acting Morphine) must be given to you in person. These drugs cannot be called in, sent in electronically, or faxed to the pharmacy. Therefore always make sure to contact your doctor for a refill BEFORE you run out of your medicine . 15 Should I Be Worried About Taking Too Much Medicine or Developing an Addiction to Medications? No! If y ou use your pain medications appropriately as prescribed by your doctor, it will not lead to addiction. Just remember: NEVER SHARE MEDICATIONS . Your doctor prescribes you medication based on your needs so it is dosed for you! Make sure you follow the instructions as to when and how to take pain medicines given by your provider(s) and take the required doses to control your pain. If your pain persists despite all medications given to you, please call your doctor or go to the eme rgency department. **Never use your pain medications to relieve stress or anxiety. If you are experiencing stress or anxiety, contact your primary care provider, hematologist and/or social worker for assistance .** Pain Medication Education Ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil), pain relief anti-inflammatory Oxycodone : fast acting/short lasting opioid pain medication (starts working in 20 minutes, lasts 4 -6 hours) MS Contin (\"Long Acting Morphine\": extended release morphine): slow acting/long lasting opi oid pain medication (starts working in 1 \u00bd hours, lasts 8 -12 hours) It is OK to take these medications together according to your sickle cell pain plan. *Serum Concentration = blood level Remember 1. Never run out of medicine. 2. Call your doctor for help before having to go to the ED 16 Pain Pyramid What if my pain is interfering with my life? There is a medication named Hydroxyurea. This medication has been shown to reduce the number of painful episodes for many people with Sickle Cell Disease. Studies also show that Hydroxyurea may help you live longer and lead a healthier life with the disease. If you have frequent pain and it is interfering with work, school, etc. talk to your doctor about Hydroxyurea. Mild Pain: Use over the counter pain relievers, warm packs and drink plenty of fluids. Massage and acupuncture may also help Moderate Pain: Use stronger pain medicines prescribed by your doctor Continue with any medications from level #1 that have been helping Severe Pain: Use strongest pain medicines that your doctor has prescribed Continue with any medications from Level #1 or Level #2 that have been helping Level #3 Medicines -- Morphine -- Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) Level #2 (Motrin or Advil) -- Acetaminophen (Tylenol) SICKLE CELL PAIN (WITHOUT FEVER) 17 Hydroxyurea for Individuals with Sickle Cell Disease What is Hydroxyurea? Hydroxyurea is a medicine that has been shown to help adults and children with Sickle Cell Disease. Studies have shown that Hydroxyurea can decrease the number of pain events, acute chest syndrome (pneumonia), blood transfusions and admissions to the hospital. Patie nts take it by mouth once a day . It must be prescribed by a doctor and is available at most drug stores. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration approved it in 1998 for treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia in adults, although it has been used since the 1960s for ot her diseases. Hydroxyurea has been used in children with Sickle Cell Disease for close to 20 years. How does Hydroxyurea work? Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen. In patients with Sickle Cell Disease , abnormal sickle hemoglobin caus es the red blood cells to become long, rigid \" sickle shaped\" and sticky. Sickling causes blockage of blood flow to vital organs, muscles and tissues. With Hydroxyurea , red cells have more fetal hemoglobin, become larger, less sticky, and travel more easily through blood vessels. Hydroxyurea also decreases the number of white blood cells which causes less inflammation and sickling. Who should take Hydroxyurea? People with S ickle Cell Disease may be eligible for Hydroxyurea treatment. Only those who can make regular Hematology Clinic visits for required blood counts and physical exams would be given Hydroxyurea. People with severe complications of Sickle Cell Disease (frequen t pain, pneumonia, very low hemoglobin, etc.) are especially suited for Hydroxyurea. Even those with milder disease may benefit since the treatment may prevent sickle complications. What are the proven benefits of Hydroxyurea? Fewer pain events Fewer episodes of pneumonia and acute chest syndrome Fewer hospital admissions Fewer blood transfusions Improved appetite 18 Increase in height and weight More energy Fewer missed school days Longer life Are there side effects? Hydroxyurea is extremely well toler ated. It can cause a decrease in blood counts and must be carefully monitored for this side effect. Blood tests every 1 -3 months are usually required. Is it safe? Yes. There have been no severe side effects seen in small groups of children, ranging in age from 6 months to 15 years. Some pediatric patients have been treated with Hydroxyurea for more than twenty years, and they have no reported irreversible complications. How do you take it? Hydroxyurea comes as a capsule or a liquid and is taken by mouth just once a day. Treatment will begin on a low dose daily based on weight and increases every few weeks depending on its effect. What is the cost of Hydroxyurea? Hydroxyurea is fully covered by most private drug insurance policies and by MassHealth. How do I get more information? Contact your Hematologist for more information about whether Hydroxyurea is right for you. 19 Alternative Methods of Treating Pain Aside from medication to help ease your pain there are many other pain management strategies . Sickle Cell Disease is a chronic disease, it is lifelong so finding successful ways to manage pain can help improve your overall quality of life. For more information about these pain management strategies, please contact the Program for Integrative Medicine and Health Disparities at Boston Medical Center, at 617-414-6795 . Acupuncture/Acupressure is based on the belief that life forces move through the body in specific paths. These paths are called meridians. With acupuncture, a needle is put into the meridian that runs to the area where you are having pain. This needle blocks the meridian, to stop or decrease the pain. You can get acupuncture right here at BM C and it may even be covered by your insurance. Acupressure uses the same pressure points and meridians as Acupuncture, but a gentle to firm finger pressure is applied instead of needle. Aromatherapy is a way of using good smells to help you relax and decrease pain. Candles, massage oil, scented bubble baths, and even baking cookies are all ways that smells are used. Scientists are learning that good smells may change your mood and helps you relax. It may also help your brain make special chemicals like endorphins, which can help decrease pain. Breathing exercises are another way to help your body relax. Teaching the body to relax helps lessen pain. You can teach yourself to breathe in and out very slowly. A fun way to practice breathing slowly is to b low bubbles. Some Additional Breathing Exercise Examples: Breathe in slowly through your nose, count to 5 and then breathe out slowly through your mouth counting to 5 again Breathe in deeply through your nose and imagine your breathe bringing calm, comf ort, and relaxation to the painful area(s) in your body and then breathe out through your mouth imagining the pain, tension, and discomfort leaving your body with your breath Breathe in through your nose and imagine a place that is comforting to you and t hen breathe out through your mouth, slowly, still picturing that comfortable setting Distraction teaches you to focus your attention on something other than pain. Watching TV, reading a book, spending time with friends/family, playing board games or video games may help you relax. This can help keep you from thinking about the pain. These tools can be helpful to you during medical appointments, procedures, or blood draws, too. Guided imagery teaches you to put pictures in your mind to help make the pain less intense. With guided imagery, you learn how to change the way your body senses and responds to pain. 20 You can imagine floating in the clouds, remember a favorite place, or imagine doing a favorite activity. Think about the things you see while you are doing this. An example of this is to imagine that you are on a beach. Start by picturing the sand and the water. Then focus in on the water. Imagine you can hear the sound of the waves crashing into the sand, laughter of people splashing in the water. Imagine you can feel the cool comforting temperature on your toes. Then think of the warm sun shining down on you. Try to imagine the smell of the beach, other people enjoying the day, what you would be doing while you were there, etc. Heat can help de crease pain. Some types of pain ease by using heat. A warm bath can be calming and can help your muscles relax. A heating pad held against the area of pain may help to reduce the pain. Music increases blood flow to the brain and helps you take in more air. It does not matter whether you listen, sing, hum, or play an instrument. Scientists are learning that music increases energy and helps change your mood. Music also may cause your brain to make special chemicals like endorphins. Relaxation and biofee dback teach your body to respond in a different way to the stress of being in pain. Normally, when pain starts, the body responds with tense muscles, a faster heartbeat, and higher blood pressure. Your breathing also becomes faster and shallower. These responses can make the pain worse. Relaxation helps lessen the pain by changing these responses. Massage is often used to help someone become more relaxed. You can ask friends or family members to gently massage your back, shoulders, and neck. Massage may work even better if you use guided imagery, breathing exercises, or music. Being in a quiet place may make it easier for you to deal with the pain. Avoiding bright lights or loud noisy places may help you control your pain. Self-hypnosis is a way for you to change your level of awareness. This means that by focusing your attention, you can move away from your pain by making yourself open to suggestions like ignoring the pain or seeing the pain in a positive way. Hypnosis can give long -lasting relief of pain without affecting your normal activities. Self -hypnosis gives you better control of your body. You may feel less hopeless and helpless because YOU are doing something to decrease the pain. 21 What is a Fever and What Should I do if I Develop a Fever? Fever is a temperature of greater than normal (98.6 oF). In order to ensure adequate care, any individual with Sickle Cell Disease who has a temperature of 101. 3oF (38.5oC) or greater needs to seek immediate medical attention . Fever is a normal response of the body to infection . Remember: although taking Tylenol or Motrin may bring your temperature down, these medicines do not treat infections . Always call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have a fever of 101.3 oF or greater. Keep a thermometer at home so you can take your temperature. If you have a low grade fever but feel sick at the same time, this is also a reason to call your doctor. People with Sickle Cell Disease are at higher risk of infections because their spleen does not work properly to remove bacteria from the blood. To prevent an infection, ma ke sure you are up to date on all your vaccines, especially pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. The pneumococcal vaccines may protect you from developing pneumonia; an infection of the lungs, and the meningococcal vaccines may protect you from getting meningitis, an infection around the brain. If you have had a splenectomy you may also need to be on long term antibiotics. Make sure you have a thermometer with you that you know how to use so that you can check your temperature if you think you have a fever. Ask your doctor to write a prescription for a thermometer if you do not have one. If you have a fever, call your doctor and come to the emergency department right away. At the ED, they will take a sample of blood and test it for any bacteria. Si nce bacteria can take 1 -2 days to grow they will give you a dose of antibiotics while waiting for results. In many cases you will be able to go home from the ED. 22 Dental Care Always schedule and keep appointments with your dentist in order to prevent mouth or teeth infections that may lead to complications of Sickle Cell Disease. A dental evaluation should be carried out every 6 months. You can go to http://www.masshealth - dental. net/MemberServices/ for a complete listing of local dentists. Cleanings and dental fillings do not require special care, but operative procedures such as extractions and root canals may require antibiotic prophylaxis in order to reduce the risk of bacteri al infection. Dental procedures under anesthesia may require a transfusion ahead of time. If you need dental work done, make sure your dentist and hematologist discuss your case before anything is done. 23 Diet and Sickle Cell Disease How do I Meet My Daily F luid Needs? Individuals with Sickle Cell Disease have a higher risk of developing dehydration than other people because their kidneys cannot hold water. It is important therefore to drink plenty of fluids to meet your dail y fluid needs and prevent dehydration. Dehydration may cause your red blood cells to sickle more than normal and this can lead to painful episodes. We advise you to: carry a water bottle with you at all times. start your day by drinking a glass of water a nd then have something to drink approximately every 2 hours. drink extra fluid when you have pain and with exercise. choose fluids such as water (spring/tap/flavored), milk, and 100% fruit juice over others (soda, coffee, tea or fruit drinks). drink at least 2-3 liters of water per day. Eating Healt hy Diet - Do I have to go on a S pecial Diet? There is no special diet for anyone with Sickle Cell Disease. However, it is important to eat a healthy, balanced diet including fru its, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat and fish. If you drink milk, cho ose low fat or fat free dairy products. Studies have revealed that individuals with Sickle Cell Disease need about 20 percent more calories than others to fuel their production of red blood cells . Not getting enough calories may lead to delays in growth and maturation. It is advisable to eat less saturated fats, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. 24 Food Groups Examples of foods and what they give our bodies. Grains Whole grain breads, rice, pastas, cereals and crackers - aim to make at least half of the grains that you eat \"whole\" grains Fiber - helps to reduce blood cholesterol and keeps your bowels moving Folate (in fortified grains) - helps our body to make new red blood Cells B-vitamins - helps our body to use the energy from foods that we eat Magnesium - important for healthy bones Selenium - important for healthy immune system Vegetables Spinach, carrots, broccoli, tomato, green beans, salad - aim for orange and dark green leafy vegetables Fiber - Tip: keep the skin on veggies and fruits for extra fiber Folate - Tip: choose leafy greens Vitamins A - keep eyes and skin healthy, helps protect against infections Vitamin C - helps heal wounds, keeps teeth and gums healthy Potassium - may help maintain healthy blood pressure Fruits Orange, bananas, apples, grapes, melon, berries, kiwi, peach, plums Provide similar vitamins, minerals and fiber as vegeta bles Note: individual fruits and vegetables provide different amounts of vitamins, minerals and fiber so it is important to eat a variety of different fruits and vegetables daily to maximize your benefits. Milk Low fat milk, yogurt and cheese Calcium and Vitamin D - for strong, healthy bones Potassium - especially in milk and yogurt Meats and Beans Lean chicken, pork, fish and beef, nuts, seeds, peas and beans Protein and zinc - for energy and growth Iron - helps to carry oxygen in our blood Omega 3 fatty acids - in certain fish, nuts and seeds - help to reduce inflammation and decrease risk of chronic diseases, like heart disease Oils Liquid vegetables oils like olive, canola, corn oil; nuts Vitamin E - works as an antioxidant to help to prevent disease Omega 3 fatty acids - in flax, canola, soybean and walnut oils, and walnut flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds 25 Does Sickle Cell Disease Affect Pregnancy in Any Way? Most commonly, Sickle Cell Disease does not affect fertility and many young women go on to have successful pregnanc ies. Women who may become pregnant or men who may father a child should talk to their hematologist if they are on Hydroxyurea, since they may need to stop the medication while pregnant. Sickle Cell Disease can also worsen during pregnancy. There is an increased chance of having complications such as pregnancy induced hypertension , pre -term birth and/or low birth weight babies. Therefore women with Sickle Cell Disease should get special prenatal care and frequent checkups to ensure a healthy pregnancy. It can be beneficial for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease to speak to a genetic counselor or maternal - fetal medicine specialist BEFORE becoming pregnant. If you are thinking about becoming pregnant, contact your primary care provider, or hematologist for advice.

Cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ in the body. As someone living with Sickle Cell Disease, the chemicals in the tobacco smoke are harmful to your blood cells. Tobacco can also damage the structure and function of your blood vessels, as well as the function of your heart and lungs. This damage will increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis (a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the arteries). The plaques harden overtime and destroy the blood vessels. These plaques, in addition to blockage caused by sickled hemoglobin, may lead to frequent pain crises and organ damage. If you are smoking, we advise that you quit. If you are ready to quit, please contact your primary care provider or a community program for assistance accessing resources for smoking cessation. Also try to avoid second hand smoke. Ask friends and family members who smoke to quit or not to smoke in the house and car. Alcohol will cause dehydration which can predispose you to pain crises. If you do choose to drink alcohol, please do so in moderation and never drink so much that you lose control of your own wellbeing. Ecstasy and marijuana (cannabis) have been associat ed with frequent incidences of p riapism in patients with Sickle Cell Disease. We advise you to avoid these drugs. If you are currently using them and wish to quit please contact your health care provider for recommendations. 31 Tattoos and Body Piercings Getting tattoos or body piercings may increase your risk of getting an infection if the tools are not sterilized. Make sure you are going to a reputable and licensed place with sterile equipment. Can I P articipate in Sports? Your doctors wil l make every effort to support you in any physical activity you would like to undertake. There are sports that may be safer and others that may be less safe for someone with Sickle Cell Disease . As a general rule, any sport that would require overexertion, causes overheating, chilling or dehydration may trigger pain crises. In addition to this, any form of activity in a high altitude could also be harmful to you. If you have an enlarged spleen, it is advisable you avoid contact sports which m ay predispose the spleen to rupture. Can I still do the things I enjoy? Absolutely, just use good judgment. For instance, take frequent water breaks while you are playing sports. Do not become dehydrated being outside in the heat/humidity. Make sure you have warm clothes if you like to spend time outside in cooler months. What else should I think about? Alcohol and caffeine can both lead to dehydration. It is advisable to drink in moderation. If you are consuming alcohol or caffeine, increase the amo unt of water you are drinking. 32 Coping with Sickle Cell Disease Living with Sickle Cell Disease can be stressful and challenging at times, so it is critical to develop healthy coping skills to help you manage both Sickle Cell Disease related stressors as well as general life stressors. There are many ways to cope with the stress of Sickle Cell Disease. Seek advice from and ask questions of your providers during visits to the hospital/clinic, talk with family, friends and others who are facing similar challenges. Some Examples of Healthy Coping Skills Talking to tr usted friends and family Connecting with your church or other religious institution Reading Listening to music Drawing/painting Writing/ keeping a journal Exercising Cooking Tips for Supporting Y ourself When You are Ill or Hospitalized: Remain as active in social and school activities as you are able. Be actively involved in your treatment plan by talking to the team and providers. Ask to have the details of your care written down so you can look at it later. Do things that make you feel good about yourself. Let those around you know what you are capable of doing on your own and what things you may need some help with. Let your family and friends visit or call you in the hospital or home. Ask for help to plan for the future. Keep doing normal things like school and work. Find ways to express your feelings such as physical activity, talking, or writing. Know that all of your feelings are normal, such as guilt, fear, or sadness. However, if these occur all the time, please call your doctor. Stay connected with friends/family through email, social media ( Facebook , Twitter, Instagram etc.) 33 Sickle Cell and Your Education/Career Thinking of Going to College? Create a list of schools that you are interested in going to/finding more information on. Talk to your high school guidance counselor to see if there are any programs going on to help you apply to college. Track deadlines (when are applications due? e.g. for FAFSA - Free Application for Federal Student Aid), and keep on to p of teachers/mentors who are completing letters of recommendation. Apply for other loans, grants, etc. Fill out college applications. Complete FAFSA applications for financial aid. Talk with your Social Worker at Transition Clinic. Ask your providers at Boston Medical Center about STRIVE and if this program might be of help to you. o Strive is an afterschool program that helps with intensive one on one academic tutoring, mentoring, peer support, disease management education and medical self-advocacy training programs. Teens are paired with college students who provide individualized support and guidance through weekly group sessions and hospital visits. For more information please take a look at the following web page. http:// www.nextstepnet.org Special Education Individuals with S ickle Cell Disease often face many challenges during school . In order to ensure a successful education experience, the state and federal government have legal, written documents that focus on your specific needs in school. Children with disabilities or special needs between the ages 3 -21 years are eligible to receive accommodations and benefit s from the state. Sometimes people with Sickle Cell Disease qualify for these accommodations and benefits. Laws have been created and put in place such as the Individualized Education Program (IEP) and the 504 Plan to ensure that children are receiving the help that is necessary for their educational success . Individualized Education Program (IEP) The Individualized Education Program (IEP) describes special educational services and accommodations. This document is put in place to help students that have a disability that affects their ability to learn and can be helped by special education accommodations or services. When a student is \"placed\" on an IEP, it is a document that must be reviewed and agreed upon annually. 34 A list of your strengths and areas to improve. A vision statement of your hopes and goals. Measurable educational goals and a plan for achieving them. Specially designed teaching and/or services (such as speech, occupational, and p hysical therapies, assistive technology) you need to reach those goals. Beginning at age 14, a description of special instruction that will help you transition from school to adult life activities when ready. If you had an IEP in school it may be that you can take it with you to college. Talk to your high school guidance counselor and the College's Office of Disabilities to find out if this applies to you. 504 Plan A 504 plan is designed to help students whose disabilities affect their daily living and p rovides accommodations so they can access programs and educational offerings provided by public funding (public schools, not private). It includes: Extra sets of textbooks. Access to tutors when hospitalized. Classroom liaison to communicate missed or catch -up work. Hall passes to visit the restroom. Ability to wear coats when necessary. Elevator access. Modified or limited participation in gym. Plans to make a school wheelchair accessible. Use of assistive technology as needed. Permission to type assig nments instead of writing them by hand. Permission to hand in assignments late due to illness or a hospital stay. Talk to your high school guidance counselor and the College's Office of Disabilities to find out if this applies to you. 35 Individualized Health Care Plan (IHCP) An IHCP helps to make sure you receive the health services you need during the school day. Although there is no law that says you have a right to an IHCP, you can ask for an IHCP if you need one. Contact your school nurse and your primary care provider. The IHCP should include: The health services you receive at school. When, where, and how the health services will be provided. Who will provide the health services. Information about your transportation needs ; includ ing special needs for field trips. An Emergency Response plan that lists possible emergencies and what to do. A copy of the Emergency Information Form for individuals with special health needs. The above plans are not mutually exclusive and a student can be on more than one. Commonly school systems will try to incorporate them together to make it easier and less cumbersome for the family and student. Medication and School If you need to take medication while in high school it is important that it be kept with the school nurse . In the beginning of the year, you should fill out a form authorizing the school to give you medicine. 36 College Support Services How D oes Chronic Pain Interfere with Learning? A student experiencing pain may find it difficult to perform physical skills, such as sitting or holding and using a pen. Concentrating during class or a test may be difficult. Medication may interfere with focusing or even active classroom participation. By working with your school's available support service coordinators, you can create a plan that works for your educational success! You can go to the Office of Disability at your college to discuss Sickle Cell Disease and the accommodations you may need. For instance, you can discuss making arrangements with your teachers to allow you to be excused from classes, and to receive extended time for written assignments or exams when appropriate. Ask you r health care provider or social worker if you need help doing this. The following is a list of contact information for some of the higher education disability offices.

It may also be asked as what comes really easy to you and what do you need to work more on? Are there Job accommodations for people with Sickle Cell Disease? Yes! It is important for you to inform your employer of your medical condition before accepting a job. The following guidelines on job accommodations have been put together by the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), and the U.S. Department of Labor's Office o f Disability Employment Policy. Because individuals with Sickle Cell Disease may have a recurrent need for medical intervention or transfusions, your employer should: allow time off for medical appointments. allow you to work from home full or part time . permit a family member or friend to call out for you when in \"crisis\". provide additional unpaid leave if you exhaust accrued time off. allow telephone calls during work hours to doctors and others for support. provide information on counseling and emp loyee assistance programs. Secondly, to avoid fatigue or weakness while at work, your employer can allow you: to schedule periodic rest breaks away from the workstation to reduce physical exertion and workplace stress. design a workstation that best suits your body (Ergonomics). Thirdly, to prevent respiratory difficulties / reduced immunity, your employer can: provide adjustable ventilation and air cleaner. keep work environment free from dirt, dust, smoke, odors, and fumes. provide anti -bacterial wipes to clean workstations. implement an illness policy, requiring employees to stay home if contagious to avoid exposing co -workers to colds, flu or other air -borne infections. your employer can modify work -site temperature or provide you an office with separate temperature control **For further information on job accommodation, please visit www.askjan.org . 40 Health Insurance As a young person with a chronic illness, it is very important that you have health care coverage for your doctor's visits, medications, and hospitalizations. As a Massachusetts resident, it is the law that you must have insurance (this is called an individual mandate ). There are several kinds of health insurances to choose from and the process for getting and staying on insurance can get complicated. Here is some basic information to guide you. Public Programs Public programs are health insurance programs paid for in part by the state and federal governments. MassHealth is insurance for Massachusetts residents. The level of MassHealth coverage that you are eligible for is based on income and disability. MassH ealth services may be limited for people who are NOT disabled, and depending on immigration status. For more information, go to: www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/masshealth Commonwealth Care is an individual insurance plan offered by the state. Individuals who cannot get MassHealth or coverage through their school, work, or parents can purchase a plan through the Massachusetts Conn ector Board. The state will sometimes subsidize (help pay for) the cost of this insurance depending on your income. For more information, go to: www.mahealthconnector.org Medicare is a federal health insura nce program for people age 65 and older OR who have a permanent disability and have been on SSI/SSDI for at least two years. For more information, go to: www.medicare.gov Private Insurance Programs These are health insurance policies paid for by individuals and/or employers: Through your legal guardians : If your legal guardian(s) have a health insurance plan through their employer, th eir child can stay on the plan for up to two years after you lose dependent status, up to th e age of 26 years. Through Work : If your employer offers a plan, you usually can sign up when you are hired (you may have to wait for 30 days for coverage to kick in). If you do not elect a plan at the time of hire, you might have to wai t until an open enrollment period to get coverage. Through School : Many colleges require students to have a health insurance plan. This can be your family plan, MassHealth, Commonwealth Care, or a plan offered through the school. 41 Dental Coverage As with regular health insurance, there are different dental insurance programs that you may be eligible for. MassHealth Dental Coverage : If you are on MassHealth, they will cover emergency and preventative (check -ups) treatment for adults over the age of 21. Adults over 21 do NOT have coverage for \"restorative\" services, like fillings, root canals, crowns, dentures, etc.). Emergency, preventative, and restorative treatment is available if you are under 21 and on MassHealth. Other Dental Health Care Plans : You may be offered dental insurance through your school, work, or parent's insurance plan. Dental insurance is not mandatory in Massachusetts. There are several clinics offering reduced -cost dental care. Find more info at: http://www.massdental.org/content.aspx?id=792 . Your Responsibilities It is important to have continuous health care coverage so that you can access your doctors, use emergency services, and kee p your prescriptions filled. As mentioned earlier , in Massachusetts if you do not have health insurance you can be fined when you do your tax returns. Here are some things to remember when it comes to maintaining your insurance: Keep your insurance comp any updated if your address or phone number changes. Read and answer any mail sent to you by your health insurance company . MassHealth sends a yearly \"eligibility review\" form that must be completed and returned, otherwise your MassHealth coverage will end . If you have Commonwealth Care or a private insurance plan, you must pay your premiums and deductibles in order not to lose coverage. Your insurance company will send you a statement (by mail or email) every year stating that you have \" minimum creditable coverage \". A copy of this statement needs to be sent in with your tax returns so you can show the state that you have complied with the mandatory health insurance law. It is VERY important that you open and read any form you get from your insurance compan y. If you do not understand something bring it with you to your next visit.

SSI is not Social Security, but is administered via the Social Security Administration. To find out eligibility requirements and apply, visit www.ssa.gov/ssi . Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) SSDI provides a monthly stipend to help cover costs if you are disabled and unable to work. SSDI is a part of Social Security and requires that applicants have contributed to social security while employed. SSDI is given for as long as the individual is disabled and unable to work due to a medical condition. Generally, Social Security determines that someone is disabled if they cannot work f or one year or longer. Visit www.ssa.org/disability/ Help Me Make Important Decisions about my Health, Financial, and Personal A ffairs ? Guardian - If due to a medical condition, such as a stroke, an adult is not able to make effective decisions about their own care, daily needs, and safety , a guardian can be appointed by the Massachusetts' Court to help make those decisions on behalf of the adult i n question, called the Incapacitated Person. The Guardian can also be a person previously selected by the Incapacitated Person (like a parent or family member 44 designated as a Health Care Proxy), or an organization designated by the Court. As a Guardian, th at person or organization makes key decisions about the Incapacitated Person's well -being, care, and daily needs while respecting their autonomy and personal rights. A Guardian can be temporary or have limited authority depending on a person's needs. For m ore information visit www.massguardianshipassociation.org . Representative Payee - This is a service through the Social Security Program that provides financial management for Social Security and S SI payments. This program is for beneficiaries who are incapable of managing their Social Security or SSI payments. If a person cannot be appointed, the Social Security Agency can designate in individual of their choosing. This is different from a Guardian, Conservator and Health Care Proxy. For more information, visit www.socialsecurity.gov/payee/ Health Care Proxy - This is a legal document signed by the patient. In this document, the patient designates an individual of his/her choice as an agent to make health care decisions for him/herself. The only time an agent is able to make decisions is if the patient is unable to do so for him/herself. A patie nt may also choose an alternate agent. An alternate agent would step in if the agent is unable to fulfill his/her duties. The document is completed prior to any emergency, and can only be \"enacted\" (or activated) by a doctor if the patient is unable to m ake healthcare decisions. Visit www.massmed.org and click on \"Patient\" in the toolbar at the top of the screen to learn more and see a copy of the Massachusetts form. Conservator of an Adult - This is NOT a Guardia n. A Conservator is a person appointed (by patient or Massachusetts Probate and Family Court) to provide protection in managing money, property or business for a patient (called the Protected Person) who is unable to do so due to a disability. Visit www.massguardianshipassociation.org for information.

A lease is an agreement or contract between a landlord and a tenant. It is a legal document that protects the rights of both you and the landlord. Before signing a lease, always read carefully to make sure you are willing to abide by everything written in it. Take note of the length of time (months/years) the lease covers, how much the security deposit is, who pays the utility bills, the day rent is due, and other Dos and Don'ts while living in the apartment. Some landlords require a security deposit befo re moving in. This, in most cases, amounts to a month's rent and is often used to cover any damage you may cause while living in the apartment. You must also keep the apartment clean and in good order . What are my Responsibilities as a T enant? Once you sign a lease , it forms a legal agreement between you and the landlord. By signing the lease both you and the landlord are responsible for keeping the terms and conditions on the lease. You should pay your rent on time. You should also obey laws related t o health and safety such as garbage disposal and fire safety. Where is the Best Place to L ive?

Managing Money Once you have a steady income, the next thing to do is to learn how to spend it wisely. Managing money is one of the most importan t skills to have as a young adult living independently. Always keep track of your money, plan for purchases ahead of time, and ensure you have the funds for the things you need (rent, water, heat, electricity, gas, food, cell phone bills, medications, pe rsonal care items, and emergency money). Be careful with credit cards; you should only spend with your credit card what you are able to pay off each month! Develop good saving s habits!! 47 In addition, set up a budget for yourself (daily, weekly, or monthly) and know the difference between your \"wants\" and \"needs\" when it comes to purchases. How do I use Bank Checks/ATM Cards? First you need to open an account with a bank of your choice. A check is often used for a checking account. It cannot be used for a savings account. A savings account is used to store money and earn interest, while a checking account provides you with an alternative to cash through the use of checks or debit cards. You can write a check or use your debit card to pay your bi lls or settle other expenses. How do I W rite a Check? The figure above is an example of a filled bank check. Always take care to fill out a check properly. Write a check with pen not pencil. Do not pre or post date a check. Write the current date on the check. Write the amount you want to pay in numbers close to the dollar sign in order to avoid someone inserting a number before the amount you have written. Write the amount in words starting from the far left and draw a line to fill unused space. Sign your check with the same signature you registered with in the bank. NEVER sign a blank check at any point.
