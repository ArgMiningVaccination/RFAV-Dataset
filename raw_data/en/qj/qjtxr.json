We use only the highest-quality ingredients in order to achieve maximum effectiveness. First, the herbs or mushrooms are ground into a very fine powder, using a special machine. Then, they're macerated in 50% alcohol for up to one month. The macerated extract is dynamised every day. Tinctures aren't diluted further once finished. That's very important. Compared to herbal brews or hot-water extracts, the mechanism of releasing active substances by means of maceration in 50% alcohol is much more intense. When tinctures are used, active substances are released as early as in the oral cavity, increasing effectiveness. Individual YaoMedica tincture formulas are based on the experience and time-tested traditional Chinese medicine methods which has existed for more than 4,000 years. Its view of humans is holistic, i.e. it has a comprehensive perception of the human body, as a whole, and at the same time as a part of the environment.
