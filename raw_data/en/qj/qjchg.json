For the study, 1,037 children in New Zealand born between 1972 and 1973 were given allergy tests at age 13 and then again at age 32. After controlling for other allergy risks such as pets, genetics, breast-feeding, and socioeconomic status, researchers found that children who continued with thumb sucking or nail biting between the ages of 5 and 11 were less likely to have a positive reaction to the test. Children with both oral habits had even a lower incidence. Robert J. Hancox, one of the authors of the study and a professor in the department of preventive and social medicine at the Dunedin School of Medicine in New Zealand, told [The New York Times](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/do-dirty-habits-help-the-immune-system/?_r=4) that the \"hygiene hypothesis\"\u2014that is, our germophobic and cleanliness-obsessed modern lives are increasing our susceptibility to allergic diseases by preventing the natural development of the immune system\u2014could be a possible explanation for the findings. Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, tells Allure, \"Germs are a part of our normal environment, and exposure to germs actually helps keep our bodies healthy. They help us build immunity to prevent future infections, and early exposure to germs may help build a tolerance and prevent allergies later in life.\" Zeichner says that not only do germs help our bodies stay healthy but overzealous cleansing and hand-washing can be harmful for our skin, potentially \"causing skin irritation, dryness, redness, and itching.\" While the news from New Zealand demonstrates some important reminders about \"good dirt,\" Zeichner says nail biting and thumb sucking shouldn't exactly be prescribed. Though the study shows the habits might help boost immunity, they still are practices that aren't so great for our skin and nails. \"Nail biting can cause damage to nails and skin and expose the fingers to infections,\" he says. \"Cuts and breaks in the skin from biting can increase your risk of infections from both bacteria and fungus because it gives them a portal "}
