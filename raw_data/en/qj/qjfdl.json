A Healing and Energy Balancing Session is a specific healing process done at a distance. It starts with clearing and releasing energetic blocks and congestion in your energy field or of a loved one. Often clients experience an emotional release that leads to an immediate shift and change in themselves, relationships or business. It regularly provides new understanding, feelings of well being and freedom from scrambled or confused thinking. You might be struggling with lack of energy or enthusiasm about yourself, others or your life, no matter what you do. There may be serious disruptions with your children, your business or your relationships and no clear path. You may have tried everything you can think of and still your situation hasn't improved. You want a shift, a change and you need tools that could make a difference in feeling confident, clarity and grounded direction. We will work on your subtle energy centers called the Chakras, the energy pathways called the Meridians and your Aura (the energy field surrounding your body). You may or may not feel the sensations as the session is in progress, but you are sure to feel the impact of this cleansing and harmonizing process. Information will come to help assist you in your own healing process and those of your family, pets or business.
