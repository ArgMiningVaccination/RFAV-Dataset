What are previous attendees saying? \"The idea of a wellness retreat can be intimidating - you may imagine lots of rules, too much uncomfortable silence, intense health regimes and spartan food - well, Weleda is the antidote to all that nonsense. The Weleda women - the experts who support you while you rest, relax, laugh, feast, learn and immerse yourself in Nature - are so refreshingly down-to-earth - both wise and wonderfully friendly, that there's a real feeling of community and camaraderie throughout. Whether huddled around the fire pit, sharing stories, enjoying a restorative yoga class or learning how to take better care of your skin, everything feels generous, inclusive and warm. Whether you're in need of deep rest, hearty nourishment, a good laugh or wonderful company, you'll find it all here.\" Emine Kali Rushton, Wellness author & practitioner, [eminekalirushton.com](https://eminekalirushton.com/) \"Weleda Wellness Retreats aim to reconnect you with yourself and with the seasonality of nature, helping you to feel more rooted. It truly scooped me up, revived me and reminded me what was important. The three-night break is great value, guided by Weleda's experts in nutrition, pharmacy and skincare and includes a mindful nature walk with their head gardener as well as gentle yoga.\" Victoria Woodhall, Editorial Director, [Get The Gloss](https://www.getthegloss.com/article/glossy-picks-best-eco-friendly-sustainable-beauty-wellness-buys) \"The atmosphere was so calm and relaxed, and the Weleda team were always on hand for any questions or connections...The food is incredible (I could happily become vegan permanently if I could bring those chef's home!) Lapwing Barns is such a lovely home from home space, it feels very nurturing...what a relaxed, and truly inspirational retreat!\" Janey Lee Grace, [Imperfectly Natural](https://imperfectlynatural.com/weleda-wellness-retreat/) \"Billed as an all veggie, mainly vegan weekend, the array of beautiful, healthy and delicious meals coming from the kitchen were a revelation. Smoothies, soups, salads, wraps, porridge, shakshuka - the food not only reflected the season but mains cleverly combined leaf, root and flower or fruit, the principles of biodynamic growing and at the basis of Rudolf Steiner's philosophy when he co-founded Weleda.\" Lisa Sykes, Editor, The Simple Things \"One thing that stood out most about the Weleda Wellness Retreat was the sense of community between hosts, experts and guests. On the final evening, a log fire was lit outside. We were told to wrap up warm and grab our blankets as we were all going to sit around the fire - we thought they must be crazy, it's March and it's freezing! Once we were out there though, the sense of community and togetherness put a stop to all thoughts of the chilly temperature. Guests and hosts alike shared our experiences and gratitude for life - there was a sense of how lucky we all were to be in that moment in nature with one another.\" Olivia Hartland-Robbins, Editor-in-Chief, [Healthista](https://www.healthista.com/4-guaranteed-ways-these-wellness-retreats-say-you-can-de-stress/) \"If you're looking for a weekend of pure bliss in the beautiful Peak District then this is the one for you. It's not really heavy on one specific thing (yoga, skincare etc.) but is a good balance of everything, with plenty of 'me time' peppered throughout to reflect and restore calm. So, if you're looking to further understand your skin, your body, and nature cycles throughout the year at a slow pace, then you'll love the Weleda retreat\".
