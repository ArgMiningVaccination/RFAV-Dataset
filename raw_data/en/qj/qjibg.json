Everyone has a unique relationship with Spirit, and each one of us interacts with it in a different way. No two people will describe what Spirit means to them in the same way, and there are definitely no wrong answers. For some people connecting with Spirit is the communication that they share with their ancestors, a Spirit guide, or maybe a deity or angel. For others, Spirit may take on the shape of a high vibrational energy guiding them on their journey. There are many different ways to interact with Spirit, and so many different practices that can be used to form a connection or channel it. Choose a practice that you feel comfortable with or try something new and see what unfolds!
