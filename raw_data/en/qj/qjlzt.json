Jondhle College of Pharmacy, Maharashtra, India Introduction Neuraceuticals are the biologically active materials of known medicinal uses generally accepted to supply substantially to the therapeutic activity of the drug [1]. Nutraceutical was the term first defined by Dr. Stephen L. Later on, the meaning of nutraceutical term has been modified by Health Canada as a substance extracted, separated and or purified from foods, and sold in the form of drug and claimed to have a therapeutic activity [2]. Long ago Hippocrates, father of modern medicine emphasized as food must be medicine and medicine must be our food. Hence, the food we consume is suffering with lack of nutricinals and it necessitates us to provide the essential nutrients. As the nutraceuticals are recognized to play an important role in the public health promotion increased the worldwide awareness on these products. Nutraceuticals are considered as food or part of food gives therapeutic benefits and claimed to prevention and treatment of disease. These products include isolated nutrients, dietary supplements, herbal products and processed foods. Presently over 500 such products are available with renowned health benefits [3]. In future also there is a lot of scope in India for further growth of nutraceutical market. The scientific validation of nutraceutical products is also the area where are lacking behind. Different terminologies Nutraceuticals are recognized with different terms such as functional foods, dietary supplements, genetically engineered designer foods, medical foods, pharmaceutical foods, phytochemicals, etc. The pharmaceuticals are the products used to mitigate, cure or treat the diseases; on the other hand nutraceuticals are those products which are intended to prevent diseases. Nutaceuticals can also be defined as a medicine used for the prevention, treatment or cure the disease or be administered with an intention to restore, correct or modify the physiological functions in human beings. Both pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals can cure and prevent disease/s but only pharmaceuticals have regulatory sanction and nutraceuticals have not gone through the regulatory approval process [4]. The product approval process for nuraceuticals are yet to take position in India. Current Indian market trend The market of nutraceuticals in India is expected to grow approximately up to $ 3000 million in 2016. The report of business research and consulting firm revealed that functional food will be best ever growing class followed dietary supplements. However, dietary supplements pertaining to diabetes supplements shown furthermost opening areas for nutraceutical producers accounting for 64% of nutraceuticals market [5]. The nutraceutical market of India is motivated chiefly by pharmaceuticals in the form of vitamins and mineral as food supplements. Due to lack of clarity and precise policy of nutraceuticals and approved additives, producers are facing problems in launching nutraceutical products in India. It also requires having exact policy for product approval, claims, approved additives, amount of vitamins for nutraceuticals. In 2012, nutrceutical market in India was estimated at US $ 2 Billion, roughly 1.5 percent of the global nutritional industry [6]. In present day scenario, Indian market is attempting to incorporate herbal ingredients into the nutraceutical products. The strong belief on Indian medicine and the provision of alternative medicine may help to capitalize on the nutraceutical market. Conclusion Nutraceuticals are considered being much promising in the promotion of public health, our health professionals should strategically work to bring appropriate regulation to provide the ultimate health and therapeutic benefit to mankind. It is also essential to conduct long-term clinical studies in order to scientifically validate the nutraceuticals. The food-drug-nutraceutical interaction is another area, which should be addressed properly. The nutraceutical industry and market is expanding in India. India may become a sturdy marketplace for nutraceutical products. Many international companies have established nutraceutical production facilities in India and this tendency is anticipated to rise additionally. Pharmaceutical firms are being converged with food producing firms to manufacture nutraceuticals this is another promising inclination that will hold on the future.
